Mike Parson that from 1987 to 2020 the state underfunded Lincoln University by about $361 million in per-student support compared with the University of Missouri.
It was a figure highlighted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and outlets such as KCUR as part of a broader pattern of underfunding Black land-grant universities.
As lawmakers hammer out this year’s higher-education budget, that letter still sits on the table. It is not just a historical audit. It is a warning about how Missouri treats its Black land-grant university and about the risk that the state squanders federal dollars meant for farmers, rural communities and students.
Missouri actually has two land-grant universities. The state first designated the University of Missouri under the Morrill Act of 1862. After Congress passed the Second Morrill Act in 1890, segregated states that wanted to keep their white land-grant campuses had to create and equitably fund a separate institution for Black students. Missouri chose that path.
Lincoln University — founded in 1866 by Black Civil War veterans pooling their pay to build a school — became the state’s 1890 land-grant institution.
On paper, MU and Lincoln share the same mandate: use research, teaching and extension to support the state’s agricultural base and workforce. In practice, the federal government’s analysis shows Lincoln was shortchanged by roughly $361 million over three decades. You can see traces of that gap on Lincoln’s hilltop campus: patchwork repairs on aging buildings, labs with outdated equipment and too many courses and advising responsibilities loaded onto too few full-time instructors.
Land-grant status comes with obligations, not just benefits. For Black land-grant universities created under the 1890 law, federal “capacity” grants for research and extension typically require a 100% state match, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture allowed to waive part of that requirement only in limited circumstances.
Missouri’s own budget documents acknowledge that Lincoln must match its federal land-grant appropriations dollar-for-dollar with state resources.
For years, Missouri failed to provide the full match for Lincoln that it provided for MU. Analyses describe how 1890 campuses have had to seek waivers and reshuffle internal budgets simply to approach the required match, leaving federal dollars on the table and feeding the slow decay of buildings, farms and academic programs.
In 2022, Missouri lawmakers finally took what Lincoln called a “historic step”: for the first time, the legislature appropriated the full state match Lincoln needed to draw down its entire federal land-grant allocation. That is real progress. But better budget years do not erase three decades of shortfalls — or the message those shortfalls send to Washington, where Cardona and Vilsack have urged concrete catch-up plans for the 1890 campuses.
Meanwhile, federal backing is growing more fragile. This winter, the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended the 1890 National Scholars Program, a flagship scholarship that had been providing full tuition and fees for agriculture students at the 19 Black land-grant universities.
Reporting indicates the program awarded roughly $19 million in scholarships to about 94 students in 2024 before being placed “under review.” When key federal programs are frozen or reconsidered, states that have not met their own obligations are in a weaker position to argue that the money should keep flowing.
Governance matters as much as money. Lincoln’s accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, expects effective boards, adequate resources and a meaningful faculty role in academic decisions.
In 2020, Lincoln declared financial exigency — an emergency status that allows sweeping cuts — and moved to close its history department and loosen protections for tenured faculty, drawing scrutiny from national higher-education media and from the American Association of University Professors. For a small land-grant HBCU already under financial strain, the chain is easy to trace: years of underfunding lead to crisis; crisis invites emergency decisions; emergency governance weakens faculty voice and heightens accreditation risk.
If Lincoln were ever to stumble on accreditation, the first people to feel it would be students.
Missouri has already shown it can do better; now it needs to make that commitment durable and transparent. Lawmakers should lock in parity by statute, guaranteeing Lincoln the same per-student operating support and land-grant match percentage that MU receives.
The state should also begin paying down the $361 million gap federal officials have documented, whether through a dedicated fund, bonds or scheduled appropriations, with a clear timetable for repairing the damage to Lincoln’s facilities and core academic programs. New investments should be tied to public metrics — building conditions, faculty-to-student ratios, research capacity, extension work in rural communities and student success — so Missourians can see how each dollar strengthens the state’s agricultural base and workforce.
Lincoln University is not a special-interest line item; it is one of Missouri’s two land-grant trustees. How lawmakers respond now will show whether “land-grant” really means “for all Missourians.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100223_lincoln1-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-12-19 06:57:27.384086

Vermont Medicaid hopes that implementing these changes will root out duplicitous payments. Providers say that’s not how it works.

To get himself ready to leave the house each morning, Kingston Emilo goes through a series of to-dos outlined in little pictures on a story board. When he puts his socks on, he moves the velcro square from “To-Do” to “Done.” He repeats the ritual when putting on his shoes, his coat, his backpack. 
Transitions are hard for the 5-year-old with autism, explained his mother, Jocelyn Emilo. Visual cues like the story board help Kingston prepare for what comes next. It’s been crucial to reducing his tantrums and anxiety around leaving one activity and moving to the next. Their house is now filled with these story boards, his mom said.
But, she said she never would have realized that her child learns best this way without the clinical support of the board certified behavior analyst he sees.
Kingston attends an Applied Behavior Analysis, or ABA, center called Bounce. The Essex program looks like a preschool, but it’s a clinical space where he and 46 other students receive personalized ABA treatment designed to reduce their problem behaviors and increase their skills — things like articulating their needs and feelings, potty-training and putting on clothes. Bounce is one of 20 ABA providers in Vermont who receive Medicaid — nearly half of those are other clinics. 
But, proposed changes to Vermont Medicaid billing rules have made several ABA providers across the state fearful about their ability to continue doing this work. 
On Nov. 10, the Department of Vermont Health Access, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, alerted ABA providers that starting on Jan. 1, 2026, the department intends to implement a series of changes. Of those, one proposal that would prevent billing for two different providers’ concurrent services has providers and parents reeling. A public comment period on the proposed changes is open until Dec. 25.

The department hopes that implementing these changes will root out excess payments. Alex McCracken, communication director at the Department of Vermont Health Access, said the concurrent billing essentially duplicates payments. 
Those who administer the clinic-based care say the concurrent billing is necessary to pay two different specialists for their work providing two different services, and they say the changes could be an existential threat.
Billing and ABA explained
State law requires private and Medicaid insurance plans to cover medically necessary, evidence-based treatment of autism spectrum disorders — including applied behavioral analysis — for children from birth until they are 21 years old. Young people can receive this treatment at home, in public schools, remotely or in a center like Bounce. 
ABA centers like Bounce operate by pairing a child, like Kingston, one-on-one with a behavior technician, someone who stays with them throughout the day going through lessons, implementing a clinical plan and noting how the child responds and progresses. 
Typically, a board certified behavior analyst assesses a child and then designs a specific protocol for them to gain skills while reducing distressing behavior. For instance, a child with autism may hit their head because they know that doing so will elicit a response and attention from their caregiver. A provider can work with them on communication skills so that they can replace the hitting while still expressing what they need.
Kingston, for example, worked on his ability to adapt to transitions throughout the day.
But the person who designs the protocol is different from the one who implements it day to day. The board certified behavior analyst, or BCBA, needs at least a master’s level training for certification, and in Vermont, a BCBA needs a license to practice. They are the ones writing and guiding care decisions. They have many patients under their care. 
The behavior technician (also called a BT) works one-on-one with the child to practice the skills and lessons outlined in the BCBA’s plan, and this provider does not need a license, formal certification or a bachelor’s degree.
Elaina Hanson, the clinical director of Bounce, explained that for the therapy to work, the two roles cannot be separated.

“We can’t function this way. There’s no world where this makes sense,” she said of the proposed billing changes. 
She likened it to seeing both a hygienist and a dentist: The dentist gives treatment directives and outlines a plan for the patient, even though the hygienist spends the most time with the patient while they’re in the office. Both providers get paid.
She’s not sure how Bounce would be able to sustain itself under the new Medicaid rules. Right now, her clinic is able to submit separate claims for the behavior technician’s implementation and the BCBA’s guidance of a child’s therapy plan. 
She suspects that when, or if, the Medicaid changes go into effect, the BCBA will not be reimbursed for the hours they spend with a child. At Bounce, a BCBA spends about seven hours a week assessing and observing each individual child. 
Hanson estimates that not being able to bill for these services for Bounce’s Medicaid patients, like Kingston Emilo, would result in a 20% loss of revenue.
“Medicaid is the backbone of this whole system, not just for us, but for every company. The vast majority of clients are Medicaid beneficiaries, and so without them, everything kind of crumbles,” she said. “It’s the most vulnerable population that would get the brunt of this and with nowhere else to go, because everybody is in the same situation.” 
However, the Department of Vermont Health Access maintains that the change isn’t meant to alter service or availability for Medicaid beneficiaries.
McCracken, the director of communications for the department, said the way that Medicaid currently bills for a BCBA “inherently includes supervision” of the behavior therapist’s implementation. 
The way that BCBA’s bill for their time with a patient should already account for that fact that it’s two-on-one time — and should include the fact that the behavior therapist is with them, she said. The Medicaid billing code for a BCBA’s care stipulates that it “may include simultaneous direction of technician, face-to-face with one patient.” The way Medicaid sees it, separately billing for both the BCBA’s care and the behavior technician’s care would, essentially, be redundant, McCracken said. 
Providers still can bill for the behavior therapist as well as the BCBA — just not at the same time. 
McCracken said the change is meant to ensure that Medicaid pays for the time that its beneficiaries spend receiving care, rather than the time providers spend administering it.
“We’re not actually changing any of the service availability or availability for members. It is just how the reimbursement and billing works for the provider.”

A leak in the house
But providers across the state say that reducing their specialists’ ability to bill will inherently reduce access. 
“I honestly think this is a mistake,” Hanson, at Bounce, said. “I don’t think anybody’s really understanding what it’s going to look like if this happens.”
Cortney and Chris Keene are both BCBAs and run an ABA clinic in White River Junction. They employ four other BCBAs, one assistant BCBA, and 26 registered behavior technicians — enough so that each one of the 22 children who receive care there will always have an adult with them. Each BCBA has about five patients on their caseload.
As their patients reach their goals and phase out of an ABA center’s care, they can enter traditional education settings. In the coming year, Cortney Keene said, she and her husband are going to have to think critically about whether they can afford to take on new Medicaid patients when their current caseload phases out.
But, they intend to take the financial hit until then.
“We are not planning on dropping them immediately. That is against everything in how we do business, how we believe to treat our families. It is just against all of our ethics,” Cortney Keene said.
The proposed changes have sent the community of ABA providers spiralling. Keene said she is working “literally all night” to get the word out about these changes before the Department of Vermont Health Access’s public comment period closes on Dec. 25. Providers have set up a voter voice petition for people to write to the department. They are writing pleas to legislators and families for help. Kingston’s mom, Jocelyn, has set up her own Change.org petition.
“One of the biggest problems we have is that this happened in silence,” Chris Keene said. He was especially surprised because he felt like ABA centers and Vermont Medicaid have historically had a strong, collaborative relationship. When the department proposed these changes, Keene felt like they came out of nowhere. 
The department is, in part, trying to keep up with federal oversight of Vermont Medicaid. Under President Donald Trump, the executive branch and Congress have particularly focused on “waste, fraud, and abuse” in Medicaid. 
“In order to ensure that we’re safeguarding the ABA benefit, we want to be extra sure that we’re compliant with all federal regulations, because there has been this increased scrutiny nationwide,” McCracken said. She hopes that a “proactive” change can protect the program from facing more tangible threats from the federal government.
“Ultimately, these are changes we have to make, and we will be there to support providers through the process, but we don’t believe these will have a great impact on the services that members are able to access,” she said.
Chris Keene said he thinks rooting out abuse is like dealing with leaky pipes.
“Instead of going to pinpoint and target where the leaks are, this is bulldozing the house. Sure, you’re gonna wipe out waste, fraud and abuse, but you’re actually gonna wipe out your entire support structure and set it back for years,” he said, adding that ABA providers, like him and his wife, are the ones who could help find the leaks and better protect the system.  
Keene and his wife both worried that removing eligibility for concurrent billing will actually open the door for abuse, since it prevents the master’s-level providers from directing the care that the behavior technicians implement.
“If there’s not a qualified health professional overseeing something like that, you run the risk of poor implementation of programming that’s not being run as written. That could harm a child,” Cortney Keene said. 
It’s something she worries about when serving one of the most vulnerable patient bases in the state. 
“Almost all of our kids have failed somewhere else first, and that’s why they land with ABA. They’re kicked out of daycare. They’re kicked out of childcare. Parents pull them out of school,” she said. “One of the really critical aspects is it works when nothing else works.”

Oct. 22. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.A months-long court case over a homeless encampment on the north side of Lansing has reached its resolution as the city agreed to house the encampment’s residents in the Causeway Bay Lansing Hotel for at least six weeks. 
Lawyers for the city said in a court hearing on Wednesday that the hotel rooms are available as soon as residents want to take advantage of them, and that the city would provide transportation to the hotel on at least one day early next week. 
Any individuals remaining on the property as of Dec. 23 will be considered trespassers and will be removed by the city, the order states. After that point, the property owners — the defendants in the case — have been instructed to secure the property and clean up residual trash or debris. 
Following the six-week window at the hotel — which could be extended if city budgets allow, depending on how many people choose to reside there — more permanent solutions are expected to be offered, as well as social services like job assistance and aid with getting proper IDs and medical treatment.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, who has presided over the case since it was first filed in May, celebrated the city’s action. In November, she extended an order that would have required the area to be cleared by mid-November in order to ensure that those living in the encampment had a safe place to go. 
“I don’t want you removed and discarded, because you are all valuable human beings who have fallen on hard times,” she said, a sentiment that she has repeated throughout hearings on this case. “You will be together at the Causeway. You’ll still have connection. You can still reach out to each other, but in this way, you’ll be safe. It is unconstitutional, as far as I’m concerned, and inhumane, to leave you out in the cold.”
Aquilina also reiterated that, though this order closed the case, she was retaining jurisdiction and would help resolve any future issues. 
“If there’s a problem, on either side, or any of you want to bring it to me, I’m still here,” Aquilina said. “I need you to be safe, warm, happy and together. Everybody worked really hard to make sure you can stay together. Your animals can be with you, and you can bring your belongings on the buses.”
In response to concerns from one resident, who worried about being able to stay with his wife, who has a neurological condition that makes it hard for her to be alone, Aquilina emphasized that she would ensure families were able to stay together at the hotel.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_1810-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 06:57:27.384086

Every banner celebrates the 16 overall A grades that schools in the rural eastern Oklahoma district have received since 2013 on state report cards. A fresh one printed in 2025 signifies Warner’s high school and K-8 school were again among the top 5% highest-performing public schools in the state.
The A grades, though a heavy focus in the 800-student district, aren’t the point, Warner Superintendent David Vinson said. They’re a byproduct of students’ and teachers’ hard work. And if Warner can do it, he said, any district can.
“You have to make sure your students understand the why,” Vinson said. “It’s about their education. It’s about bettering their lives. It’s not about getting an A on the report card or about getting high marks as a school district. That’s a result or a fallout of them being high achievers individually.”
Public schools across Oklahoma are now implementing strategies Warner has been employing for years — a cellphone ban throughout the school day, frequent benchmark testing and tracking of students’ individual scores. The district changed its culture and policies more than a decade ago after receiving disappointing results on state report cards.

The town of Warner, home to 1,500 residents and Connors State College, doesn’t have a wealth of industry to keep its school district flush with local tax revenue, Vinson said. State funding and community support for bond issues fill in the gap.
About 60% of Warner students come from households at or near the federal poverty line, state records show. Many district students — 42% of whom are Native American, 31% white and 20% two or more races — have parents who work in farming and ranching in the area or drive 20 minutes north to Muskogee for industry jobs, Vinson said.
Not that he particularly pays attention to demographics. Those details, Vinson said, “tend to be used as excuses.”
High academic expectations and strict discipline are core to the district’s success, he said. Principals are quick to handle behavioral issues, leaving teachers free to teach and students better able to learn without disruptions.
The principal’s office is not a “revolving door,” he said. Any student sent in must leave with a consequence.
“I think education in general across the board has lost sight of that mentality, has lost sight of that philosophy,” Vinson said. “And that’s why you have schools that are in chaos, and you have entire schools scoring 0% proficient on assessments because the school has become so chaotic that teachers can’t teach and kids can’t learn. And there are just as smart of kids in those schools as there are in my school. They’re just not being afforded that opportunity to learn like our kids are.”
Small behavioral problems are addressed consistently, and big incidents are punished “severely,” he said. 
In Warner, that includes the rare use of corporal punishment, a method of discipline that more than 100 Oklahoma districts still permit. Simply having it on the table as an option, Vinson said, usually is enough to discourage most students from bad behavior.
While administrators handle discipline, teachers are expected to maximize every minute of their class time, a concept known in Warner as “bell-to-bell teaching.” That means no movies and no downtime, said Charla Jackson, the district’s curriculum director and elementary counselor.

Middle and high school students are discouraged from mingling in the hallways during passing periods. Instead they’re expected to hustle to their lockers and then to their next class, where a bellringer assignment is usually waiting. They’re expected to read a book if they finish their classwork early.
Literacy is a major emphasis in Warner, Jackson said. Several Warner Elementary teachers have completed in-depth training on the science of reading, and the school provides reading interventionists and tutoring for students who need extra help.
“They are the experts,” Jackson said of Warner’s teachers. “They are the ones making the difference. We just try to support them and allow them to do their job. So, that’s first and foremost.”
High morale keeps teacher turnover low, Jackson said. Class sizes, though increasing with Warner’s enrollment growth, max out at about 24 students per classroom.
But, Warner isn’t immune from the teacher shortage impacting public schools across Oklahoma.
About half of the teachers at Warner High School entered the classroom through non-traditional means, like adjunct teaching and alternative or emergency certification, Vinson said. The district tries to support those educators with training, pre-written curriculum plans and co-teaching hours with a veteran teacher.
Having fewer classroom disruptions, too, “just makes everybody a better teacher,” he said.

Several district teachers told Oklahoma Voice that behavioral issues are rarely a problem in their classrooms, but when they do occur, school administrators readily step in.
When asked what sets Warner apart, kindergarten teacher Lisa Lee pointed to elementary Principal Alan Gordon’s desk. 
“This man right here, he’s great,” Lee said. “The administration here, it just makes you feel good. You know what I mean? Like they’re backing us. They believe in us. They push us, and that makes a huge difference.”
Fourth-grade math teacher Pam White said she was ready to quit teaching before she came to Warner Elementary five years ago. White, 65, is eligible to retire but has chosen not to “because I love this school so much.”
She said the supportive administration has been “huge.”
“They’re in our classrooms,” she said. “They’ll take care of problems immediately.”
During a visit to White’s classroom, students in her afternoon math class were equally enthusiastic about their school, complimenting the quality of their teachers, school staff and principal.

But, Warner didn’t always have this culture of success. The turning point was 2012. That year, the district scored straight C’s on state report cards.
Vinson, then in his first year as superintendent, sent an email to Warner families to inform them “we are not pleased with the overall grade on these report cards for our schools.” The district’s administrators and teachers were already implementing changes, he wrote in the email. He still keeps a copy.
That’s when Warner adopted a more structured and disciplined culture, banned cellphones, started adhering to bell-to-bell teaching and aimed to have 90% of students make a proficient score on state tests. 
The following year, the district met or exceeded the statewide average on nearly every state exam.
That trajectory continued over the following decade, despite state test scoring becoming more rigorous in 2017 and COVID-19 interrupting schooling in 2020. In 2025, Warner students scored above the state average in every tested grade level, the district’s report card shows.
Families in the area have taken notice. While the town of Warner has experienced little population change, its school district has grown from 600 students at the start of the turnaround to more than 800 today. Student transfers are a major source of the spike.  
“I think a big thing is we established a culture here where kids want to succeed,” middle and high school counselor Misty Durrett said. “It’s something they take pride in.
“They know our ranking. They know where we stand. They want to maintain that.”

It’s not all structure and discipline, Vinson said. School still needs to be fun.
That’s why Warner has expanded extracurricular activities, electives and class options available to students. It’s added a competition choir, an art program, boys and girls wrestling, and a high school construction class, where students are building a house that should be ready to sell this spring. 
Students on the high school racing team design and build a dirt-track racing car that Vinson drives in competitions on the team’s behalf.
School spirit events, like Homecoming, consume entire school days. With the winter holidays approaching, the interior of every Warner school is decorated for Christmas with lights, trees and door decals.
“You have to create those opportunities for kids to enjoy school,” Vinson said. “It can’t be structure, discipline, learning, structure, discipline, learning 170 days a year.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s top legislative leaders on Thursday sketched out a restrained agenda — including tweaks to a contentious property tax law — ahead of an unusually short Statehouse session that is also expected to feature movement on health care, child care and utilities.
The Indiana General Assembly is scheduled to reconvene Jan. 5 for a breakneck eight-week session.
Lawmakers can meet until mid-March during a non-budget year, but plan to adjourn early to offset the two weeks they spent this month on a failed partisan redistricting proposal.
“We’ve adjusted the calendar,” House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, said. “We will finish before the end of February … and people are going to have early March off to watch basketball.”
Gov. Braun touts first-year wins amid redistricting fallout

He and other key lawmakers spoke Thursday at the annual Dentons Legislative Conference, held at the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis.
The compressed schedule will present “the No. 1 limiting factor this session,” said Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield. Crider, a Senate committee chair, said the panels may only have time for one hearing each.
Bills that don’t get committee votes won’t advance further in the legislative process.
Crider appeared in place of the Senate’s absent GOP leader, President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray.
The Martinsville senator has faced heavy criticism from fellow Republicans over the maps’ defeat.
Bray “had a longstanding in-district commitment that was on his calendar before he was even invited to Denton’s, so he wasn’t able to participate this year,” spokeswoman Molly Swigart said.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, encouraged lawmakers to be “very careful” crafting their bills amid the time pressures.
“I felt like Senate Enrolled Act 1 was done very quickly … and we’re seeing that there are problems with that,” he told reporters, referring to a behemoth local government finance law approved in April.

“I do think that if you rush through legislation, you end up making some harmful mistakes, and so we’ve got to be very careful about that,” GiaQuinta added.
Edits are expected on the local government finance law, which offers Hoosiers property tax relief while expanding income taxing potential. But schools, libraries and other units are still set to lose out on millions of dollars they would have otherwise collected.
Some communities “are just concerned about how they’re going to make that difference up,” said Sen. Travis Holdman, the Senate’s tax policy head. “We need some time to talk about that.”
“I’ve been a proponent of pushing some of these dates out a little further on the timeline, just to give us some more time to figure some things out,” added Holdman, R-Markle.
He and others are also “looking really hard” at the amounts that could be gained via local income tax.
Controlling costs
Social safety net scrutiny could continue, despite a rosier revenue forecast unveiled Thursday.
This year’s Senate Bill 1 — the number reserved for the majority caucus’ top priority — “will look at aligning Indiana statutes with what passed at the federal level,” Crider said, including changes to work requirements for Medicaid and the anti-hunger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Indiana enrollment in Medicaid, the low-income health care program, has dropped by about 300,000 people throughout the year, totaling 1.7 million in November, according to the forecast.
That hasn’t halted spending worries.
“We have people in the program that need to be off … We couldn’t take folks off the program during the Covid years,” Holdman said. “I think we’ll get there. But at the current rate, it’s just not sustainable.”
Indiana already conducted a year-long “unwinding” process post-COVID.
Huston, the House’s GOP leader, predicted an otherwise “quieter” 2026 session for health care.
“We’ve done a lot. I think this session we probably need to let some stuff bake,” he said. “… Let’s see how it works and get some of the data back that we’ve requested.”

But the 2027 session “will be all about health care,” as the General Assembly grapples with federal changes that shift Medicaid costs onto states.
During a lunchtime fireside chat, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun reiterated that cutting health care costs for patients is his top priority, but didn’t offer specific policy proposals. He didn’t take reporter questions.
Legislation to support hard-hit child care providers and parents is also expected.
Rep. Dave Heine, R-Fort Wayne, discussed plans to use the education scholarship model on child care.
“What we’re going to do is establish a public-private partnership, and we’re going to use the same format, the same structure,” he said. People or groups would give money to a scholarship granting organization and specify that it be used to support those who can’t afford child care.
The state closed enrollment in the Child Care Development Fund voucher program a year ago and won’t reopen to other low-income children until at least the end of 2026. A waitlist is growing.
Providers say the waitlist has crushed enrollment — particularly in infant and toddler rooms, since would-be voucher-holders weren’t yet born when the waitlist was implemented — while lower state reimbursement rates don’t cover costs for kids who do have vouchers.

Low-income parents often can’t access vouchers, while full-price-payers are still seeing providers close.
“I think we have a child care crisis right now. I mean, I’ve seen these centers closing,” said GiaQuinta, the House’s Democratic leader.
He and Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, indicated their caucuses will also file child care affordability bills.
Widespread outcry over rising utility bills is expected to prompt action, too.
House Republicans will consider performance-based ratemaking, while their Democratic counterparts seek to eliminate the 7% sales tax on utility service.
In the Senate, Yoder’s caucus wants to bar utilities from charging ratepayers for lobbying, litigation and more, and ban summertime shutoffs to low-income customers.
Lawmakers throughout the conference expressed excitement about the Chicago Bears’ interest in northwest Indiana, but were noncommittal on the state’s role in luring the franchise.

Claims that wolves have rescued Yellowstone National Park's aspen trees through a ""trophic cascade"" oversimplify a complex story.
The post Have wolves saved Yellowstone’s aspens? appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Mountain Journal.
Around Crystal Creek, where the road bridges the Lamar River at the fringe of Yellowstone National Park’s Lamar Valley, a grove of aspens has new life. In 1997, the first year scientists began systematically measuring the park’s aspen population, the stand consisted of towering, century-old trees with no fresh growth in the understory.
Today, the scene is dramatically different. A thicket of young aspens now blankets the ground. Many of the saplings are already taller than the researchers who study them. The grove is not only denser, but its footprint has expanded.
Crystal Creek has become synonymous with the ecological benefits of wolf restoration. It’s home to one of the pens where wolves were kept during their 1995 reintroduction, and it’s also a hotspot where aspen growth has surged over the past three decades. 
Quaking aspens grow in colonies, sending up genetically identical shoots from a shared root system. In much of the 1900s, massive elk herds devoured virtually every new aspen shoot that broke through the soil, stifling the growth of new trees.
But shortly after the ‘95 wolf reintroduction, the elk population fell and some aspen sprouts slipped past the hungry herbivores. While a flood of news articles, Facebook posts and YouTube videos have attributed the change to wolves, scientific evidence for this conclusion is limited. And some scientists believe that aspen regrowth in the park has been exaggerated.

Before wolf restoration
The idea that canines protect Yellowstone’s aspens from herbivores dates back at least a century. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, rangers in the park shot hundreds of wolves, bears, cougars and coyotes in a bid to boost deer and elk numbers. In 1926, the same year park rangers wiped out Yellowstone’s last wolf pack, biologist Edward Warren was already warning that the carnivore purge was harming the park’s aspen groves.
“There has doubtless been a great increase in the number of beaver in the Yellowstone Park of late years,” he wrote in his 222-page report. “When over two hundred coyotes are killed in a single season, as in 1922, the animals which formed part of their food are bound to profit by it and to increase in numbers. The result has been what is probably an unnatural expansion of the beaver population.”
Warren went on to describe what zoologist Robert Paine would 54 years later call the “trophic cascade.” The expanded beaver population had chomped down nearly all of the large aspen trees near the streams and ponds of Tower-Roosevelt. While thickets of young sprouts remained, most trees near beaver dams with a trunk greater than two inches had become food or building material.

By 1955, both beavers and aspens had disappeared from the ponds and creeks of Tower-Roosevelt. Beavers had chewed down the old trees, while the soaring elk population had consumed the young ones, suggested William Barmore, a park biologist who studied the park’s elk herds. Aspens continued to survive beyond the beavers’ reach, but these groves, which Barmore described in a 1965 research report, looked very different from the ones Warren photographed.
“In most stands the only aspen age classes present were decadent, overmature trees and root sprouts from one to a few years old that were browsed off to a height of one or two feet each winter,” Barmore wrote. He noted that hungry elk chomped down on aspen shoots each winter when grass was scarce, preventing any sprouts from becoming mature trees. 
An individual aspen seldom lives more than 200 years. Without successful regeneration, entire stands disappeared as the old trees died.
Barmore believed that elk were responsible. “Sometime after 1880 the relative number of elk utilizing park ranges, particularly during the winter, began to increase,” he wrote, listing hunting and development north of the park, as well as “predator destruction,” as possible causes. “Whether the increased use of park winter ranges resulted from an actual drastic increase in the herd or from a bottling up of an abnormally large number of animals on previously marginal winter range is not known,” he added.
Decades of heavy elk browsing left a lasting impact. Studies have found that between 1921 and 1999, new aspen trees grew only on scree slopes and among fallen trees that physically blocked elk access.

A trophic cascade
At the dawn of the 21st century, the situation began to change. The winter elk population in northern Yellowstone fell from a record high of 17,000 in 1995 to less than 2,000 by 2012. Multiple studies conducted in the early 2000s showed that some aspen sprouts were escaping elk browsing and growing tall.
A study published in July 2025 summarized more than two decades of data, finding that the number of young trees taller than six feet increased more than tenfold between 1998 and 2021. While new aspen trees were virtually absent from northern Yellowstone in 1998, the study found, 43% of stands contained them by 2021.
The surge in new growth seemed to parallel the ‘95 wolf reintroduction, and media coverage highlighted the connection. “Since wolves’ return, Yellowstone’s aspens are recovering,” read one Washington Post headline in August 2025. “Aspen trees are returning in Yellowstone, thanks to wolves,” read a July 2025 headline from the aptly-named Aspen Public Radio in Aspen, Colorado.
Daniel MacNulty, an ecologist at Utah State University, took issue with these conclusions. In a recent critique, he highlighted a small number of exceptional stands that drove the large increase in trees described in the study, while most aspens showed little change over the same period.
Luke Painter, the Oregon State University ecologist behind the study, agreed that the headlines simplified the data. “There are significant changes, and there are beginnings of recovery, but it’s patchy and it isn’t happening everywhere,” Painter told Mountain Journal. “But a trophic cascade does not have to be everywhere to be significant.” 
In a recent master’s thesis from MacNulty’s Utah State lab, scientists argue that the surge in young trees might be less impactful than previously stated. They used aerial photos to measure the physical area covered by 73 aspen stands on the Northern Range in 1954, 1991 and 2020. The results, which have not been previously reported by any media outlet, show that most aspen stands have continued shrinking since wolf reintroduction.
Maybe there’s some good regeneration in the heart of the stand. But the rate of contraction actually increased after wolves were introduced.Nicholas Bergeron, researcher, utah state university
Between 1954 and 1991, when elk populations in Yellowstone reached record highs, the average size of the 73 stands studied dropped 54%. Aspen groves then shrank another 59% between 1991 and 2020, despite wolf reintroduction in 1995. Only seven of the 73 stands grew larger after 1991, and Crystal Creek was one of them.
It remains to be seen whether enough young aspens are surviving to reverse the decades-long decline. “Maybe there’s some good regeneration in the heart of the stand,” said Nicholas Bergeron, author of the thesis. “But the rate of contraction actually increased after wolves were introduced.”
Painter believes aspens appear to be declining because many aspens on the Northern Range are near the end of their lives. “The older trees have been dying off at an accelerated rate since the 1990s,” Painter said in response to the thesis. “Of course, it looks like the stands are shrinking. Some of them have lost all their large trees.”
Even where aspens are making a comeback, scientists debate the role that wolves have played.
Tying it to wolves
The grasslands and sagebrush steppe of Yellowstone’s Northern Range support the park’s largest elk herd. Each winter, when snow piles up in the high country, thousands of elk descend into the valleys of northern Yellowstone and adjacent lands. The herd has shrunk dramatically over the past three decades: from 17,000 in 1995 to 6,673 in 2022, according to some of the most recent data from the Park Service
“Elk have declined a lot since wolves were reintroduced, but it’s not clear that that’s due to wolves,” said Chris Wilmers, an ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the author of another recent study that assessed the impacts of large carnivore recovery across North America. “Other predators have been recovering, there’s been a lot of human hunting of elk, there’s a growing bison population that’s competing substantially with elk, and outside the park, ranchers are increasingly tolerant of elk feeding in their irrigated pastures, so they have less of a need to migrate into the park in the first place.”
“Most ecologists suspect that wolves and other predators have something to do with the decline of elk,” Wilmers continued. “But how much can be attributed to wolves, how much can be attributed to predators in general, how much is attributed to those other causes hasn’t been worked out yet.”

Cougars, hunted aggressively within the park in the early 1900s, have increased in numbers since the 1980s. As well, the number of grizzly bears in Greater Yellowstone spiked from 136 in 1975 to about 1,030 in 2024 due to federal protections. Between 1998 and 2004, cougars probably killed more Northern Range elk than wolves, and grizzly bears are the main predators of elk calves, potentially contributing to their lower numbers.
“Elk population dynamics are extraordinarily complex and you really can’t pin elk numbers to any one thing,” said wildlife biologist Doug Smith, who led the park’s wolf program from 1995 until his retirement in 2022. He said that the reduced elk population boils down to three factors: carnivores, people and climate.
Human hunting, which killed more elk than wolves between 1995 and 2004, has declined, allowing more elk to survive outside the park in winter, said Smith, adding that warming winters are also luring elk into snow-free valleys north of Yellowstone. “Forty years ago, 80% of the elk herd wintered inside the park,” he said. “Now, 80 to 90% winter outside the park.” 
Decades of research shows that elk generally eat aspens in winter when other foods are scarce.

Smith emphasizes that predators have been a fundamental driver of the change in elk numbers and distribution, and that wolves are one of the park’s most important predators.
The popular video, How Wolves Change Rivers, says that fear of wolves “radically” changed elk behavior by making them avoid aspen thickets and steep riverbanks where they might become an easy meal. Some studies from the 2000s supported that conclusion, but more recent research has cast doubt on this idea.
A 2024 study compared the likelihood that an aspen would be eaten by elk to where wolves kill elk, where wolves spend most of their time, and eight other variables that could show whether an area was unsafe for elk. The results showed little correlation between aspen browsing and the risk of wolf predation. 
“If elk are avoiding wolves at those risky sites, they’re going back at a different time of day and still eating the aspens,” said study lead author Elaine Brice, a researcher at Cornell and a former PhD student in MacNulty’s lab. “It’s not at a big enough timescale to push them off of aspen in a way that will be meaningful for aspen growth.”
Brice’s analysis identified the single best predictor of aspen browsing: the number of elk in a certain place at a certain time. Wolves may indirectly protect aspens by suppressing elk populations, but not by scaring them away from specific patches, she said.

Brice, who has also published research suggesting that the rate of aspen recovery has been exaggerated, said aspen recovery could take many decades. In addition, wildfire stimulates aspen growth, and many stands might grow back stronger after the next major fire resets the forest.
Aspen recovery might also be limited by record-high bison populations that trample and eat aspen sprouts in some areas, according to Painter.
MacNulty says the future of aspens in northern Yellowstone is far from certain. Research modeling the climate of Yellowstone indicates that most of the Northern Range might be too hot and dry for quaking aspens by the year 2100.
Regardless of what the future holds for the iconic aspen trees, a number of scientists believe the story has stepped over the data. “It’s undeniable that there has been some benefit to wolf reintroduction,” Bergeron said. “But the narrative that wolves are a kind of silver bullet that saved the aspen in Northern Yellowstone is oversimplified.”

Why sprinkle your cookies when you could paint them? 
The post Cookie canvas: How to add more color to your holiday treats appeared first on WyoFile .","Roll out that dough and get your royal icing ready because it’s sugar cookie decorating time. 
But instead of covering your cookies — and your kitchen counters — with sprinkles and colorful sanding sugars, try watercolor painting them.
“It’s really easy,” Karen Vaughan said. “It’s a very simple crowd pleaser.” 
Vaughan, a former University of Wyoming soil scientist, now runs her own business — The Art of Soil — making watercolor paints with pigments sourced from Wyoming soils. 
“I’m always thinking about ways to share watercolor painting,” she said, whereas her 11-year-old daughter loves to bake. “So she’s always trying to be in the kitchen, and I am always painting.” 
The watercolor sugar cookie “was a way to fuse two things we both love to do,” Vaughan said. 
Bake your favorite sugar cookie recipe, then frost them with royal icing — homemade or store-bought. Leave the frosted cookies overnight to ensure they’re hard before painting. 
Dilute gel food coloring with clear extract — such as almond, vanilla or mint — to make the paints. A dinner plate works as a palette to mix colors.
Then, with a clean watercolor brush, turn that cookie canvas into a masterpiece.

“If you have different-sized paint brushes, you can do different effects on the cookies,” Vaughan suggests. “You could have a flat brush or a round brush or tiny detail brush, but anything works, whatever you’ve got.”
Paint a holiday scene or go abstract, Vaughan encouraged. “It’s something really fun you can do with anyone of any ability.”

Wyoming cannot survive on nostalgia, cuts and culture wars, writes columnist Christy Mathes.
The post When it comes to a community, ‘just say no’ doesn’t work appeared first on WyoFile .","I grew up in Gillette, inside a boomtown rhythm that I did not realize was unusual.
We had 24-hour grocery stores, rec sports for every kid and computer labs before most towns even knew what to do with them. Our public library felt like a small university. True, half the town had dirt roads and buildings that looked temporary, but beneath that rough exterior was a community that believed in purposeful growth, working hard, playing harder. Gillette invested like hell in kids and possibility.

Opinion

We said yes a lot back then. Yes to teams. Yes to libraries. Yes to new ideas. Yes to the future. I grew up thinking that was normal.
Then I went to college out of state.
The university library was a joke compared to the one I had grown up with. Businesses closed by early evening. Recreation meant driving an hour and hoping someone unlocked a gym with aging equipment. Things I had taken for granted growing up were luxuries elsewhere.
Looking back now, maybe we were a little too prone to saying yes. But we were building something. We believed our kids deserved more than survival. We believed a frontier town could grow into something special.
And now, decades later, I am watching that instinct disappear.
Not all at once. Just quietly. In meetings. In headlines. In the tightening of budgets and the narrowing of imagination. The same place that once said yes to growth now flinches at it. The same state that once reached for the future now argues that reaching is dangerous.
What is harder to accept is that many of the loudest voices weren’t here for the building. They didn’t watch dirt roads turn into neighborhoods or grow up inside the libraries and programs a community fought to create. They inherited what we built and mistook it for a hive: something that simply existed, something that would always produce on its own.
But the deepest damage comes not from outsiders who never loved this place, but from those who helped build it and still choose to stand beside those letting Gillette backslide.

They prospered because the community said yes to growth. They made their fortunes inside that dream. And from the comfort of those earned privileges, they now shout no. From porches paid for by boomtown labor and collective sacrifice, they use their clout not to extend opportunity, but to choke it. Not to carry the dream forward, but to freeze the state at the exact moment that best preserves their comfort.
They are willing to let the community age with them. And if it withers afterward, that is someone else’s problem.
This is a moment of crisis, a true hinge point. The future is asking which way we will turn, and instead of reaching for it, Wyoming has fallen in love with saying no.
No to solar. No to wind. No to carbon capture. No to advanced nuclear manufacturing. No to modern gaming revenue. No to technology infrastructure. No to economic diversification.
Project by project. Bill by bill. Meeting after meeting. That pattern is the same.
No.
Wrapped in words like “freedom” and “sovereignty,” this reflexive rejection has become a political identity. It is not strategy. It is not stewardship. It is performance. And it is putting Wyoming on a slow starvation diet.
We are watching a faction of leadership oppose diversification while simultaneously voting to cut the very systems that keep rural Wyoming alive. They choke off new revenue, then act shocked when budgets bleed. They wave away the math, then punish schools, infrastructure and local services for the consequences.
This isn’t conservatism. It’s demolition with better branding.
The record shows it plainly. We blocked renewable expansion with moratorium attempts. We attacked carbon capture the moment it became viable. We chased off nuclear manufacturing jobs with theatrics, and we killed modern gaming revenue because acknowledging it felt uncomfortable. Then those same lawmakers turned around and demanded budget cuts and called it responsibility.
That isn’t fiscal discipline. That’s policy arson followed by a speech on fire safety.
And if anyone doubts how unserious this has become, look at the bill literally nicknamed “Make Carbon Dioxide Great Again.” A proposal to declare CO2 a “beneficial substance,” repeal low-carbon standards, and weaken carbon capture; not because science changed, but because politics wanted a performance. All while the state simultaneously markets itself as a carbon-negative innovation hub.

You cannot recruit investors with one hand while lighting the contract on fire with the other.
This same reflex played out locally this year with the proposed CAM-PLEX expansion in Campbell County. A shovel-ready economic engine, livestock shows, youth sports, concerts, expos, visitors filling hotels and restaurants were dismissed not with analysis but with suspicion and fear of change. Another door half-closed. Once again, no.
This is what cultural self-sabotage looks like. We claim to want thriving communities, but recoil the moment thriving requires traffic, investment, or growth.
Coal revenue is down. Lease bonus revenue has cratered. Mineral backfill shrinks every year. And here is the truth that no culture war can erase:
You cannot cut your way to prosperity.
You cannot posture your way to stability.
And you cannot “no” your way into a functioning 21st-century economy.
We should say no to magical thinking. No to pretending yesterday’s revenue model is coming back. No to performing ideology instead of governing.
We should say no to the lie that Wyoming can survive on nostalgia alone. Pride in our past is not a budget plan. Rugged individualism does not pave highways. Culture wars do not staff hospitals.
We do not need to “just say no” to our future.
We need to say no to the people who think governance is theater and economic decline is an acceptable price for ideology.
Say no to magical thinking. Say no to breaking the state just to prove a point.
And then, with everything we have left, say no to killing Wyoming economically.
Because Wyoming is not dying on its own.
It is being starved by design.

Steve Daines proposed a bill to address new information the Chinese spy balloon contained American technology. (Provided by the office of Sen. Daines, R-Montana.)Montanans are extremely fortunate and eternally grateful for the visionary move by our highly-lauded former Senator Lee Metcalf, who designated significant Wilderness Areas for present and future generations.  Leaving these lands beyond the reach of development, as quiet refuges for the vast array of fish and wildlife that call them home was truly Metcalf’s greatest gift to the future. 
Knowing full well that extraction and development interests would otherwise degrade them, as they have so many other public lands and waters, he also designated a number of Wilderness Study Areas where development would be prohibited, thus allowing future generations the opportunity to provide full wilderness protection for these parcels. 
Comes now a considerably less visionary Senator in the person of Steve Daines, who is once again introducing legislation to undo Metcalf’s work and open existing Wilderness Study Areas to logging, mining, motorized recreation and the spiderweb of roads bulldozed in to support those polluting and habitat-fragmenting uses of public lands.
This is not the first time Daines has tried this despicable move, having failed to even get a hearing on his first two bills or advance his third attempt to the Senate floor.  
Yet, despite his quick reversal on selling off public lands earlier this year, here he is, hacking at the Wilderness Study Areas again despite the vast amount of Montana’s public lands already available for extractive industries and motorized use. 
What’s puzzling is his apparent disregard for long-standing support for wilderness and conservation by poll after poll after poll.  Maybe he spends so much time in D.C. he’s unaware of the fact that Montanans are more than a little alarmed at what’s going on here at home. Namely, that would be the influx of wealthy out-of-state interests that see Montana as ripe for the picking for their nefarious get-rich-quick schemes — while also locking Montanans out of public lands and waters.
Take the Crazy Mountain Ranch, for instance — owned by Boston-based Crossharbor Partners Capital that also own the exclusive Yellowstone Club for mega-wealthy members as well as Big Sky, Spanish Peaks, and Moonlight Basin — all of which have seriously degraded the Gallatin River.  The same Crazy Mountain Ranch that is now being sued by the state for violating the Montana Water Use Act by illegally irrigating its new golf course, oblivious to the law, the state, and the claims of senior water rights holders.
Or maybe Daines might note that runaway and unsustainable development has turned our major river valleys into endless subdivisions that, increasingly, are struggling to provide water for their developments.
Perhaps if he comes “home” for Christmas he might notice our bare mountains, unseasonably warm temperatures bringing rain, not snow, in mid-December in Montana.  Perhaps, if he bothered to think about it, he just might wonder where the water is going to come from to keep our rivers alive and sustain our world-famous trout fisheries this summer — and the recreation economy that now outpaces the extractive industries of logging and mining without leaving Superfund sites behind for future generations to remediate.
That he has been joined by newbies Sen. Tim Sheehy and Rep. Troy Downing seems to indicate all three of them need to spend more time with Montanans than D.C. lobbyists to get their priorities straight.  But they don’t do town halls now, do they?
Given that Daines and Downing will both be up for election next year, and this is Daines’ fourth attempt at undoing Metcalf’s legacy, perhaps it’s time to send them a message for so blatantly disregarding Montanans’ commitment to protect, not develop, what’s left of our state’s wilderness lands.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Daines-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-19 06:57:27.384086

Otte and others cited potential health, safety and environmental concerns, saying the well would be located a few hundred feet away from residential neighborhoods and other areas frequented by children.
“I have several objections to this, and really they all have to do with the fact that the proposed drilling site is very close to residential areas,” Otte said. “There can be a lot of people that are living very close to there. And I think there’s definitely some risks that are involved with oil and gas, having wells.”
“The spacing unit is very close to many residences in the city of Fruitland and Payette County, and drilling and extraction operations, which have some inherent environmental risks, should not be conducted so close to people’s homes,” Otte added.
 Not all residents have agreed with proposal to build a well near Fruitland neighborhoods

Snake River Oil and Gas has secured lease agreements with the holders of about 61% of the acres of land within the affected geographic spacing unit, according to state records and testimony at Wednesday’s public hearing.

Spacing units are essentially the area that can be drained by one well for development. 
The people who hold about 38% of the acres in the spacing unit have not agreed to oil and gas leases with Snake River Oil and Gas.
Under Idaho state law, applicants such as Snake River Oil and Gas who have secured leases for at least 55% of the acres can apply for an integration order to integrate the uncommitted tracts of land into the spacing order to allow for the drilling of a well.
In October, attorney James Piotrowski filed an objection to Snake River Oil and Gas’ application for the integration order, saying the integration order would violate the rights of land owners who did not agree to leases with the company.
Fruitland City Administrator Stuart Grimes also opposed the proposed integration order.
“Approval of this application force-pooling those remaining properties is going to facilitate a well being drilled just a few hundred feet from hundreds of homes belonging to city of Fruitland and Payette County residents – just over the fence from one of our subdivisions,” said Grimes, who said he was speaking on behalf of the mayor and City Council as well.
“We just have general concerns about the safety and welfare for residents being this close,” Grimes added. 
Wade Moore, who helped secure leases for Snake River Oil and Gas for the project, said Wednesday the royalty fees and bonus payments offered for the project were fair for Idaho.
In most cases, the company offered landowners a one-eighth royalty fee and a bonus of $150 per net acre for signing the lease. A one-eighth royalty fee for oil, gas or natural gas produced, proportional to the owner’s interest in the minimum royalty fee allowed under state law. 
 Decision on Snake River Oil and Gas’s application could come in January

No decisions were made during the evidentiary hearing and public comment period Wednesday. The Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will accept written public comment on the proposal until Dec. 24. Anyone wishing to comment can send an email to filings@oah.idaho.gov.
Looking forward, a hearing officer from the Idaho Office of Administrative Hearings may issue a recommendation on the proposal by mid-January. The Idaho Department of Lands is expected to issue a final decision on the proposal by Jan. 30.

(Screengrab from Beaman's Senate haring, C-SPAN.) The U.S. Senate confirmed four Trump nominees to the Tennessee Valley Board of Directors Wednesday night but left out Nashville car magnate and political donor Lee Beaman.
Beaman was removed from the nomination process and would have to receive a new nomination to be considered for the post, according to the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group that monitors TVA appointments.
Senators voted 53-47 to confirm Mitch Graves, Jeff Hagood, Randall Jones and Arthur Graham. President Donald Trump also nominated Beaman to serve on the board for the federally-owned utility that provides power to seven states in the Southeast, including Tennessee, but his nomination stalled in a committee last week.
The nominations came after Trump removed Biden appointees to the board after taking office, leaving it without enough members for a quorum to hold votes.
“At a time when Americans across the nation are struggling to pay their energy bills, it’s even more important that a utility as unique as TVA be responsible and compassionate to the needs of its ratepayers,” the Sierra Club said in a statement. “We welcome the return of a functional, voting board and are here to work with them to keep power in the public’s hands and protect this beautiful region we call home.”
Car magnate Beaman draws fire during TVA board confirmation hearing

The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works postponed Beaman’s confirmation vote last week amid questions about two Washington, D.C. rowhouses he owns that are rented to members of Congress through a nonprofit organization run by his pastor, Steve Berger.
Democratic senators also raised questions about Beaman’s connection to U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Columbia Republican targeted by the House Ethics Committee, which found he likely violated campaign finance laws by reporting an inflated personal loan of $320,000 to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022. Beaman was listed as campaign treasurer for four months in 2022 as questions surfaced about Ogles’ fundraising.
Beaman told senators in his initial hearing that he was Ogles’ treasurer for only four months, but in written responses to questions, he said he never agreed to serve in the post while also acknowledging he thought it was only an “honorary” position. He said he asked to be removed from the job after seeing his name on a political ad.
Besides problems with Ogles’ fundraising, Beaman told the committee in written responses he bought two houses totaling 6,500 square feet in D.C. in the name of Crockett Ventures and leased them to the nonprofit organization Ambassador Services International for $1 a year. The group is run by Berger, who accompanied Beaman at his first hearing and has made inflammatory statements about LGBTQ people, saying he wants to beat them to death with a baseball bat.
House Speaker Mike Johnson and Ogles are among the members of Congress believed to be living in the row houses, creating a conflict of interest for Beaman to serve on the TVA board, senators said.
Beaman told senators in written responses that he has no interest or control over the nonprofit organization, nor does he make decisions about who sub-leases from Ambassador Services International.
Yet Democratic senators also raised the issue that Berger could be considered a lobbyist under federal law, creating another conflict of interest for the tenants and Beaman. Berger founded a “discipleship program in Washington, D.C. to educate, equip, and inspire statesmen to live with compassion and confidence during their time in public service,” according to the transcript.  
Beaman, a major Republican political donor, planned to raise $4 million in 2017 when Ogles announced a U.S. Senate bid that never took off. He also served as treasurer for U.S. Rep. Matt Van Epps, who recently took office after winning a special election to replace Mark Green.

A bipartisan Congressional investigation has begun regarding Hegseth's role in ordering U.S. military strikes on small boats in the waters off Venezuela that have killed scores of people, which Hegseth said are intended ""to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people.” (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Jim Risch proclaimed in a Dec. 11 meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the “attacks in the Caribbean are absolutely, totally and 100% legal under U.S. law and international law.” 
Those strikes have produced a body count nearing 100 since Sept. 2. Oregon U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley effectively debunked Risch’s argument, pointing out that only Congress has the power to declare war under the U.S. Constitution.
Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, speaks during a confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on July 15, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)
Risch incorrectly claimed that the killings were “clearly not a war, but kinetic action,” as though that somehow got around the Constitution. His response makes no sense because the violence of war is always kinetic action. 
There is no need to get into the legal weeds about the legality of Trump’s Caribbean killings because that has been well established in the last three months. Even the Department Of Defense’s new AI chatbox, which Secretary Pete Hegseth proudly announced on Dec. 9, said that an order to kill two survivors of a boat strike would be “an unambiguously illegal order.” 
On Oct. 28, Reuters reported that some U.S. military officials have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements with regard to Trump’s Latin American adventures. That adds an element of guilt awareness to those operations.
Let me give the input of someone who was in the position of pulling the trigger on suspect people on the ground during the Vietnam War. I spent hundreds of hours as an aerial observer flying at about 800 feet in the air in a small two-seat “bird dog” aircraft. I had at my disposal six 8-inch guns (200-pound shells) and six 175 mm guns (165- pound shells) from my heavy artillery battalion. 
Most of my combat missions were over “free fire zones” where everyone was presumed to be an enemy. The war had been approved by Congress in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (later found to have been based on false information).
Even though we could fire on practically anyone in the free fire zones, we were prohibited from firing on civilians. I would not have done so anyway. I lived with South Vietnamese soldiers, respected the Vietnamese people and would not have exposed civilians to danger. 
On the other hand, I had no qualms about calling fire upon North Vietnamese Army soldiers because my job was protecting U.S. troops and our South Vietnamese friends.
When you saw people near the edges of the free fire zones, you had to evaluate the circumstances and determine whether or not there were indications of military affiliation. The two kids with a water buffalo on the edge of the free fire zones were definitely not targets. The man driving his donkey cart into the free fire zones was most likely a woodchopper. The three guys on bikes in the middle of the free fire zones were definitely North Vietnamese Army and legitimate targets. 
The other aerial observers that I knew, and the pilots who flew them, acted in a similar manner. We followed the rule of engagement, which included U.S. and international rules of war.
Had I been overhead for any of the Trump/Hegseth strikes, I would not have pulled the trigger — no declared war, no enemy combatants, clearly civilians and no justification for “kinetic action.” The proper course of action would be to call the U.S. Coast Guard to interdict and search the boats, like they have historically done. Last year, the Coast Guard seized 225 metric tons of cocaine. The U.S. would have to destroy a heck of a lot of narco speed boats to equal that tonnage.
These present boat strikes have a feature that was not in existence back in Vietnam days. Then, the aerial observer and pilot were the only people who knew the situation on the ground. We were largely on the honor system in deciding who should live or die. 
Now military personnel up and down the ladder may have eyes on the situation. Not only that, but a video record is being made of each strike. Any person who sees a strike being carried out and does not raise concerns about its legality may be called to account, even years later. 
Keep in mind that both Trump and Hegseth have gleefully announced the strikes and vowed to kill all other alleged “narco-terrorists.” They might be surprised to learn that several victims of the Sept. 2 strike were not drug merchants. 
The U.S. Supreme Court essentially immunized Trump against any kind of charges that could result from the strikes, but Hegseth and the military personnel with eyes-on participation in the strikes could find themselves in legal hot water down the road for these summary executions.
Sen. Risch should study the law and avoid covering up for MAGA lawbreakers.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)With whooping cough cases in West Virginia at a record high this year, a physician said residents should consider getting a booster dose of the Tdap vaccine to protect them and the children around them.
As of this week, cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, had reached 199 — the highest number reported in West Virginia since 2010, according to data from the state Bureau for Public Health. Of those cases, 76 were active as of Dec. 15. 
Last year, West Virginia reported 46 cases of the illness, according to state health officials. 
Gailyn Markham, director of communication for the state Office of Shared Administration, said several factors may have contributed to this year’s surge, including potential mutations of the bacteria that causes pertussis and a natural three- to five-year peak. Nationally, there were six times as many cases reported in 2024 than in 2023, she said. Cases peaked in November 2024 but cases remained elevated this year, she said. 
“We continue to work closely with local health departments, health care providers, and community partners to identify cases quickly, ensure appropriate treatment, and control measures to help reduce the spread of the disease,” Markham said. 
In Kentucky, three unvaccinated infants have reportedly died of the illness this year. 
Dr. Lisa Costello, a pediatrician and associate professor of pediatrics at WVU School of Medicine, said with the increased cases, she’s treated children with the illness for the first time in her career. 
“[Whooping cough] was not something that we saw with that much frequency,” she said. “And certainly with the rise in cases, we are unfortunately seeing more cases, particularly in infants. 
“They’re at higher risk of having more severe symptoms because their airways are small, their immune systems are still developing, and the pertussis or whooping cough can cause really intense coughing fits,” she said. “For infants, sometimes that can even have them stop breathing.”
Symptoms of pertussis start out like a common cold — runny nose and cough, but with whooping cough, the cough persists, Costello said. 
The name whooping cough comes from the sound that children in particular can make when trying to catch their breath during a coughing fit. Children can also throw up after a coughing fit. 
“If you’re having symptoms of a cough described as either of those, getting checked and tested would be important, because immunization is our best way to protect against pertussis,” Costello said. 
Antibiotics are available for those who test positive for the illness and preventative antibiotics are recommended for those in close contact with someone who tests positive. The sooner the person starts on antibiotics, the better, she said. 
Infants and children who get pertussis are at a higher risk of complications like pneumonia, seizures, brain inflammation, dehydration, low oxygen levels and even death. 
“Adults, if they get whooping cough or pertussis, may not have as severe symptoms. However, they could still spread to others who would potentially be impacted more severely, such as infants, pregnant people, immunocompromised people,” Costello said. 
A combination diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccination and boosters are required for students beginning in kindergarten in West Virginia. While the state’s strong school immunization requirements have kept the rates higher for school age children, the state’s pre-school vaccination rates have historically been lower, Costello said. 
“When we’re talking about whooping cough, those who are at most risk are really those infants, so those under one year of age,” she said. “So that would be before school, and for many, even before child care — it just depends upon when you may be going to a child care facility. And certainly those would be areas where there could be increased risk for spread.”
She said it’s important for adults, particularly those who are in contact with people at an increased risk for severe illness, to stay up to date on their vaccines. Adults may not get severe symptoms, but they can pass it on to children who can. 
“My daughter turns 4 in the New Year, and before anyone came to visit her, everybody had to have an updated Tdap [vaccine], because I didn’t want to put her at increased risk,” she said. “And I got vaccinated when I was in my third trimester.”
Pregnant women who get a booster of the vaccine can protect their babies until they’re able to start their vaccination series, she said. 
“I think it’s important for people of all ages to have that discussion with a health care provider about what immunizations it’s important to stay up to date with,” Costello said.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — The second week of a stepped up immigration enforcement effort in southeast Louisiana — dubbed Catahoula Crunch by federal officials — saw increased reports of immigration enforcement activity on Lake Pontchartrain’s North Shore, including in Slidell.
On Saturday, volunteers from Unión Migrante, an immigrant-led civil rights group, responded to a report that federal immigration agents were conducting an arrest inside a gated community in Slidell, with assistance from St. Tammany Fire Protection’s District #1, based in Slidell. TV station WWL aired video from the arrest that showed federal agents in green tactical gear leading construction workers off of a roof, using a ladder from the local fire department.
In an emailed statement shared with Verite News and other media, Lawrence Payne, a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Border Patrol agents attempted to arrest “three subjects” on the roof of a construction site using a “makeshift ladder.” The statement said one of the people they were after pushed the ladder, which fell and struck an agent, causing “a minor laceration to his right face” and “breaking his eyeglasses.”
“Several minutes later, agents successfully secured the ladder and climbed to the rooftop, apprehending all three subjects without further incident,” the statement said. “In total, two Honduran nationals, one Mexican national, and one El Salvadorian national were arrested for being illegally present in the United States.”
Also, over the weekend, protesters opposing the operation gathered in Orleans, Jefferson and St. Tammany parishes, including protesters demonstrating in front of a Latin American grocery store in Slidell that drew counter-protesters, WDSU reported.

.In a Thursday press release, the Department of Homeland Security said federal agents had arrested 250 “criminal illegal aliens” in the first eight days of the Louisiana sweeps. However Homeland Security officials said only 23 or less than 10% of the people apprehended have criminal records, according to the Times-Picayune. The offenses range from domestic abuse child endangerment and drug possession to driving while intoxicated and urinating in public.
In that press release, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the department, slammed so-called “sanctuary policies” in New Orleans that she said, “have endangered the lives of the citizens and visitors of its beautiful city.”
McLaughlin was likely referring to two separate federally-mandated consent agreements that govern how the New Orleans Police Department and Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office interact with immigration enforcement agencies.
Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill sent a letter to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick saying that the department’s policy, which limits collaboration with immigration enforcement agents, “conflict with current state law and also may be interpreted as ‘sanctuary’ policies,” the Louisiana Illuminator reported.
Kirkpatrick responded with a statement saying, “NOPD will continue to follow all state and federal laws while staying focused on public safety and maintaining the trust of our community.”
Despite McLaughlin’s statements on New Orleans, immigration enforcement efforts have appeared more active in areas outside of the city, including Kenner — which has the highest percentage of Hispanic residents in the New Orleans metropolitan area.
Throughout the region, community activists are responding to immigrants’ fears to leave their homes, including for medical emergencies. Verite News public health reporter Halle Parker covered efforts to save a baby’s life after a mother gave birth at home, rather than risk arrest by going to the hospital.
Beyond critical care, groups are providing assistance to community members most impacted by the immigration enforcement operation in the greater New Orleans area.
Meanwhile Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has been leading enforcement operations around the country, has returned to Chicago — where communities have seen the most heavy-handed approaches, including the use of tear gas against protesters. On Wednesday, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported that many of the Border Patrol agents that were stationed in Louisiana for “Catahoula Crunch” have temporarily relocated to the greater Chicago area, leaving a slimmer crew to continue operations here.
This week, several outlets, including News Nation, reported that the Department of Homeland Security is shifting its immigration enforcement approach toward focusing on migrants with serious criminal records and away from large-scale raids at locations such as home improvement stores and away from arrests of immigrants who have been in the United States for more than a decade.
“We have always been going after the worst of the worst first. There are no operational changes to announce,” a DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
Records continue to show the vast majority of immigrants detained have no criminal record. Their only offenses are civil immigration violations.

They were so proud of the initiative they decided against inviting the media to the event at the State Capitol, instead sending out a video on a social media site I’ve never heard of, accompanied by yet another video by Gov. Bill Lee, who less than a month ago said he didn’t know anything about the plan.
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson and U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn put together the event as the group founded by the late Charlie Kirk gathers influence in the wake of his untimely death.
“Partnering with Turning Point USA to support the expansion of Club America chapters in high schools across Tennessee reflects our commitment to the founding ideas of free speech, limited government, and liberty – the values Charlie Kirk stood for,” Johnson said in response to questions from the Lookout. 
Johnson said no state funds will go toward the partnership and explained that it’s a grass-roots organization students can form voluntarily “to celebrate the founding principles of our great nation.” 
“The state of Tennessee stands ready to support those patriotic students’ efforts and ensure their constitutional rights are respected,” Johnson said.
It’s almost as if they’re expecting backlash before this deal starts.

Kirk, who frequently asked students to prove him “wrong,” was shot to death during an event at a Utah university where he was set for a debate. 
Interestingly, Kirk made numerous demeaning remarks about Black women and men by questioning their intellect, urged women such as Taylor Swift to submit to men and, after the mass shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, said such deaths are the price of Second Amendment rights, according to an article in The Guardian.
President Donald Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the wake of his death.
Lee declined to comment about Kirk’s inflammatory statements this week but said he “broadly” supports the group’s efforts to bring about “civil discourse” in schools. He added that people need to learn how to “disagree better.”
“I certainly appreciate what they do, but as far as a formal partnership, I don’t know about that,” Lee said, leaving more questions than answers about the state’s endorsement and why a “partnership” is needed.
Some key lawmakers wish Kirk hadn’t made such comments, but they’re comfortable with his organization, which is a template of sorts for Trump’s MAGA movement.
Even though Turning Point USA is a so-called beacon for free speech, numerous people who criticized Kirk after his death were fired.
Clarksville resident Monica Meeks, represented by the national nonprofit, Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, filed a federal lawsuit over her firing by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance after she posted a private Facebook comment critical of Kirk.
Former MTSU employee Laura Sosh-Lightsy also filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, as well, against the university after it fired her for a critical post of Kirk. 
The violent act is unforgivable, but the irony here is fascinating. 
Kirk traveled the country debating students and urging free speech and “civil discourse.” Yet the government purged itself of anyone who had the temerity to challenge his statements publicly. 
Is this what Charlie would do? 










I certainly appreciate what they do, but as far as a formal partnership, I don’t know about that.


– Gov. Bill Lee, who appeared in a video announcing the state's partnership with Turning Point


Just as high schools have had Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapters for decades, schools can allow students to start their own Club America groups to meet before school or during break. (You remember FCA. Hardly anyone went to the meetings, but when they took the yearbook picture, half the school showed up to get out of class for a few minutes.)
During these Club America gatherings, students can discuss “limited government” in which the government backs their rights but infringes on other people’s free speech. They can also talk about the governor’s comments that it’s not really a “partnership” and the fact no money is flowing for group activities, at least not this year. The budget is way too tight. But hope springs eternal.
The overriding question, though, is whether students at urban schools such as Nashville’s Pearl-Cohn and Knoxville’s Austin-East will form chapters. Not likely.
Watch your sugar
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved Tennessee’s request to cut sugary drinks, snacks and other unhealthy food from people’s SNAP purchases. (That’s stuff bought with what were once referred to as food stamps, now called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is enough to put a bad taste in anyone’s mouth.)
One of the notable things is that people won’t be able to use their SNAP cards, now that we’ve gotten rid of the stamps, to buy prepared fried chicken. Yet they can buy flour, cooking oil, spices and chicken to fry. 
Feds approve Tennessee’s SNAP waivers excluding soda, sugary foods from benefits

Luckily, few people eat fried chicken around Christmas. It’s always ham or turkey (my pre-New Year’s resolution is to cut out pork, except maybe a couple of pepperonis), which leaves turkey, the reason we have Thanksgiving only once a year.
But back to this SNAP deal. Sugary soda pops (also known as cokes) will be prohibited, along with sugary cereals and snacks. Does that mean people can’t buy pecan pies at the store? What about canned cooked apples, which are likely loaded with sugar? And what about sports drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade? I’m told by health freaks they contain a lot of sugar.
Thus, no Cap’n Crunch, no fried chicken, no pop (I’m not really from the North, unless you consider Hendersonville part of Kentucky), and no pecan pies.
This could be the worst Christmas ever for some folks. Or it could drive them to get a job at a fast-food joint, where the food is probably not real food but has plenty of sugar and grease.
Back at you
Republican Sen. Kerry Roberts filed a counter-suit against Knoxville-based Apex Bank, claiming it forced him and his wife to default on a $4.6 million loan for a massive renovation of his historic Springfield home, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Roberts filed the lawsuit in Robertson County Circuit Court, claiming the bank dragged its feet on providing funds for the project that made him lose time on construction and $750,000 in potential income from weddings, corporate retreats and Airbnb reservations, according to the report.
The Springfield senator counter-sued over the bank’s foreclosure after Sumner County General Sessions Judge Kee Bryant-McCormick determined that the bank took advantage of the Roberts but didn’t do anything illegal and should be allowed to acquire the property and adjacent tracts used as collateral, the Tennessee Journal reported. 
Gonna hitch a ride
Always on the lookout for ways to protect Tennesseans, state Rep. Gino Bulso is sponsoring a special bill for pregnant women and just in time for Christmas.
Bulso filed HB 1457, which would classify any person in the second or third trimester of pregnancy as a “disabled driver,” along with those who have a pregnancy deemed a high risk by their doctor.
If this means the woman will be able to obtain a placard allowing them to park in a spot designated for handicapped or disabled people, that might be a good thing. Kudos for the idea, though it could force businesses to leave more open spaces for pregnant women. Of course, how many of us have seen people without handicapped parking placards parking in handicap spots, even though they show no outward signs of disabilities or a pregnant bump.
We also know of women who’ve been forced to go out of state for treatment of a high-risk pregnancy, which means we don’t mind if they park closer to the Walmart door but can’t go to their doctor for the care that could save their lives. 
Maybe the bill needs a tweak or two.
Give me Kmart or give me death
With state departments requesting $300 million for technology in next year’s budget and lawmakers looking at replacing their aging payment and HR system, Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson told senators this week “society is evolving quickly” (or devolving) and that the state needs to meet constituents “where they are,” whatever that means.
“We cannot be Kmart when our citizens expect Amazon,” he said.

Some old-timers might take exception to that comment. For decades, Kmart was my go-to for underwear, socks and golf balls and not necessarily in that order. Going there was an adventure, too, because even after the stores added 15 checkout counters, they hired only one person to work them.
After standing in line for 30 minutes and losing circulation in my legs, I’d proudly place my items on the counter, and, 99.9% of the time, the checkout person would pick up the pack of Hanes and say, “Did this have a price tag on it?” Response, “Well, it was the only pack.”
Which would require the employee to get on the loud speaker, “I need a price check on men’s underwear!” The words reverberated through the store as women behind me cackled. Fifteen minutes later, the price would arrive. But in spite of this shopping gauntlet at least I could walk out the door with underwear and socks in hand.
Kmart’s problem was not with prices and products. They spent more money on technology than people. Alas, when they closed, the breakup was hard.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from the real Stockard on the Stump.

(Photo illustration by Mario Tama/Getty Images)I have spent my career as a physician assistant caring for patients of all ages — listening to their concerns, diagnosing their needs, and helping them navigate treatment plans in ways that are medically sound and humane. That’s why I am alarmed by the rapid spread of a dangerous gray market of counterfeit and illegally compounded GLP-1 medications and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Colorado families deserve better — and state leaders must act to protect them.
Advances in GLP-1 therapies have transformed our medical approach to obesity — a condition that impacts heart health, metabolic risk, and overall well-being. Here in Colorado, our own Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation this summer to expand access to weight loss treatments, including allowing employers to opt into covering GLP-1s. When used under proper medical supervision these drugs can help patients manage their weight with dignity and support. With obesity impacting more than 24% of adults in the state, increasing access to FDA-approved weight loss drugs keeps Coloradans safe and healthy.
But the dark side of growing demand is that unscrupulous actors are exploiting patients’ real needs: selling unapproved, clandestine, and potentially unsafe “alternatives” that bypass the safeguards of regulated care.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The crisis began when legitimate GLP-1 supplies became scarce: Regulatory shortages prompted compounding pharmacies to step in, as allowed. These compounding efforts were meant as a short-term, carefully regulated bridge. Once shortages ended earlier in 2025, mass compounding should have stopped too.
Instead, some med-spas, telehealth companies, and compounding entities have continued compounding or supplying GLP-1s — frequently sourcing active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, from abroad, sometimes via unregulated importers. These compounds are not FDA-approved, so their manufacturing lacks the rigorous safety, labeling and oversight that patients deserve and expect.
Even more troubling: Some companies are selling raw APIs directly to consumers to be reconstituted at home — turning a medication to be taken under medical supervision into a do-it-yourself experiment. As a clinician, I find this unconscionable. We are talking about medications meant to affect metabolism, hormones and overall health — not benign over-the-counter vitamins. When patients don’t know the purity of a powder or the exact dose, they are risking far more than money.
As of July 2025, federal data show hundreds of adverse events tied to compounded or illicit GLP-1s — hospitalizations, overdoses and even deaths. These are not abstract statistics; these are real people whose lives and trust in the health system have been harmed.
We cannot stand by and let this continue. The federal government should strengthen enforcement to stop illicit APIs from entering U.S. supply chains, like Attorney General Phil Weiser and members of the Colorado congressional delegation have strongly called for. At the same time, Colorado’s regulators, licensing boards and legislators must take action to shut down illegal compounders, hold accountable those who mislead patients, and protect access only to safe, FDA-regulated medications.
I chose to become a PA because I believe in equitable access to safe, effective and compassionate health care. As a clinician, I have looked patients in the eye and walked with them through difficult decisions about their health. As a Coloradan, I believe everyone deserves transparency, dignity and protection — especially when it comes to their health.
If our leaders heed this call, we can help ensure that obesity treatments remain tools of healing, not shortcuts to danger.

In Kentucky, we’ve witnessed that tug-of-war up close through the lens of the coal mining industry and electric utilities that burn coal.
For example, after President Bill Clinton tightened pollution controls on coal-fired power plants through a regulation known as “new source review,” which required new or modified plants that increase emissions to install tighter controls, President George W. Bush’s Environmental Protection Agency sought to reverse course and was at least partially successful.
After Barack Obama followed Bush, his EPA put in place a raft of pollution reduction rules and programs, many of them targeting coal mining and coal burning — significant contributors to water pollution and global warming. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell dubbed those years as “Obama’s war on coal,” and President Donald Trump took steps to reverse many of those environmental initiatives after he was elected in 2016.
Now we have a second Trump administration following President Joe Biden, who did the most of any president to address climate change through legislation (Inflation Reduction Act, for one) and executive actions to boost cleaner power from wind and solar and reduce heat-trapping emissions from cars and other methods of transportation.
This time, when it comes to the federal government’s response to climate change and the environment, what is happening goes far beyond a normal tit-for-tat change in public policy. The Trump administration is taking a wrecking ball to the very infrastructure of climate science — going after the scientists themselves and the institutions that support their work.
Consistent with Project 2025, Trump has sought to neuter NOAA and NASA climate scientists by denying funding and seeking to eliminate climate research programs. And last week, EPA eliminated references to how people were contributing to rising temperatures from some of its climate change webpages.
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. (NCAR)
News of Trump’s latest assault broke on Dec. 17, with USA Today reporting that the administration is moving to break up the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, a leading global climate and meteorology research center. Trump officials complained to the newspaper that NCAR was a “hub for climate alarmism.”
The only thing the administration got right in that statement is that NCAR is a hub.
As Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, wrote on Linked In, NCAR is “quite literally (atmospheric scientists’) global mothership.” 
Nearly everyone, she wrote, “who conducts research in climate, atmospheric science, and weather  — not only in the U.S. but around the world — has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.
“NCAR supports the scientists who fly into hurricanes, the meteorologists who develop new radar technology, the physicists who envision and code new weather models, and yes — the largest community climate model in the world. That too.”
Hayhoe concluded: “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet.”
Fine, let’s have the debate about what, if anything, should be done to address climate change, which credible scientists and scientific institutions agree is caused by burning fossil fuels and other human activities. What are the pros and cons of Kentucky lawmakers, or the Trump administration, adopting policies to keep coal in business and at what cost to electric utility consumers and the environment? 
But stifling science promotes a philosophy that ignorance truly is bliss. It goes along with the administration’s equally anti-democratic attacks on journalists and attempts at intimidating or trying to silence media outlets.
Shutting down this well-respected global climate and weather science lab is stupid and tragic. This is more than shooting ourselves in the foot. It’s shooting the messenger, which is probably the point.
All of this brings to mind the satirical black comedy “Don’t Look Up,” starring Louisville native Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio as scientists who tried in vain to warn the world of a catastrophic comet collision. “We really did have everything, didn’t we? I mean, when you think about it,” DiCaprio’s character said near the end of the movie.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-178479362-700x467-1-1.jpg,,,2025-12-19 05:57:17.427228

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger detailed how she plans to work with legislators to make utility bills more affordable, as the cost of electricity continues to rise across the commonwealth. The incoming Democratic governor’s ideas range from bolstering battery storage capacity to reducing power use and the need for expensive transmission lines.
“I recognize the complexity of our current challenges and threats posed by the future demands, but the answer is not to sit so our problems only get worse,” Spanberger said at the state Capitol Thursday morning, as top Democratic lawmakers looked on.
Spanberger’s interest in increasing battery storage is complimented by a bill being carried by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax and Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, which will increase the amount of battery storage the major utilities need to invest in as part of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. 
As the battery technology is evolving, it is becoming more affordable and helps solar power be more dispatchable when the power is needed and not being produced. The measure was vetoed by term-limited Gov. Glenn Youngkin in this year’s session.
“We have to expand generation, and in doing so, it is about ensuring we can continue to attract businesses and investment. It’s also about ensuring we can literally keep the lights on for Virginians across our communities,” Spanberger said.
Spanberger also echoed the priorities of House Democrats who want to look into barriers that some homeowners face when trying to utilize efficiency and weatherization programs. One of the bills urges the utilities to expand their efficiency programs.
If the state rejoins the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), as Spanberger has stated she would make happen, then funding will flow back into the state to help fund efficiency and flood mitigation programs.
“If we were actually leveraging RGGI dollars for weatherization projects as prescribed by the programmer, we could be reducing the cost for Virginians by building up on energy efficiency,” Spanberger said.
Two bills the governor-elect is pushing would also give the State Corporation Commission the ability to create a process to measure how well the current grid infrastructure is being utilized, in hopes of cutting down on the need for new expensive transmission lines to be built. 
Many of the current and recent high-voltage transmission line cases before the SCC have been proposed to push more power directly to data centers, plans that have raised community concerns over routes and cost.
While the legislation in Democrats’ priority affordability package does not directly address data centers and the costs associated with their power demands, another bill Spanberger is supporting pushes the State Corporation Commission to come up with a review process to ensure demand load growth estimations given by utilities are accurate.
Some residents and advocates have questioned if the true amount of power being calculated based on data center proposals may potentially be inflated compared to the real amount that ends up being built. The utilities have their own ways of verifying what they say are accurate counts. This legislation would create a backup check through the SCC.
In an effort to expand small solar projects to bring every electron possible onto the grid, Spanberger said she supports a recommendation from the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation to make small solar projects more accessible, including balcony solar panels that would be exempt from utility approval requirements.
All of these bills will be formally filed and considered in the regular legislative session that begins Jan. 14.

A similarly situated […]","Protestors hold a sign denouncing proposed Medicaid cuts in Richmond, June 2025. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)In York County and Virginia Beach, a couple of 40-year-olds with two kids and a combined household income of $150,000 could see their health insurance premiums rise by $4,330 per year if the U.S. Senate and House fail to extend health insurance premium tax credits now set to expire on Dec. 31.
A similarly situated family in relatively affluent Albemarle County is looking at a yearly increase of $6,244 in premiums.   
These estimates do not come from Democrats or Republicans. They come from a calculator prepared by KFF, the Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the country’s most reputable health policy organizations.  
Experts predict that huge premium increases to households that would lose expired premium tax credits could leave as many as 100,000 Virginians uninsured.
The cost of human suffering by those forced into bankruptcy due to illness or those who forego treatment because they cannot afford to pay is hard to calculate. What is certain is that the increased cost will devastate people of all political persuasions.
This begs the question of why none of Virginia’s Republicans in the House of Representatives would sign a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill to extend the tax credits for three years. 
Four Republicans, three from Pennsylvania and one from New York, joined 214 Democrats to force debate on the bill this week, after House Speaker Mike Johnson refused to include premium tax credits in a Republican health care reform proposal Wednesday. Johnson then abruptly ended a 204-203 House vote that blocked quick consideration of the discharge bill before Congress adjourns for the holiday season on Friday. 
Conspicuously missing from the list of GOP members challenging Johnson were two representatives from the Old Dominion. 
First Congressional District U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, whose district includes York County, and Second Congressional District U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, whose district includes Virginia Beach, have each made, then broken, promises to go to the mat to control constituents’ health care costs. Kiggans even co-sponsored a bill that would have extended health insurance premium tax credits for two years. It never came to a vote.
Wittman made no promise on premium tax credits. But like Kiggans, during federal budget negotiations he co-signed a letter to Johnson saying he would not vote for a federal budget that cut access to Medicaid, then, like Kiggans, did so twice.
It’s time for Wittman and Kiggans to serve constituents, not Trump

Since then, Wittman and Kiggans have offered continuous pledges to make health care affordable. With their failure to support a discharge petition to force a vote on premium credits, they have once more betrayed constituents. 
Both Republican incumbents risk losing their seats in Congress for ignoring constituents in health care votes and for failing to hold President Donald Trump accountable for economic policies such as tariffs that have already raised the costs of goods and services for those they represent. 
Since November’s Democratic sweep of statewide offices and increased control of both chambers of the state legislature, talk has focused on whether Virginia will redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats as a way to offset Trump’s command to Republican-run states to develop redistricting plans that increase the GOP’s congressional representation. But Wittman and Kiggans would still be in trouble if Virginia left their districts intact.
Health care expenses represent a bipartisan financial crisis. A May 2025 tracking poll by KFF showed “three-quarters of uninsured adults say they have skipped or postponed getting the health care they needed due to cost. Having health insurance, however, does not offer ironclad protection as about four in ten adults with insurance (37%) still report not getting health care they needed due to cost.”
Those are the stakes as the clock winds down on Congress’ failure to extend the premium tax credits, if only for a few years to work out kinks and help the middle and upper middle classes protect their families. Instead, Republicans just voted down a Democratic proposal for a three-year extension of premium tax credits in the Senate and refused to even bring it up in the House.  
Johnson and other Republican leaders who control the Senate and House continue to hurt their own constituents, including essential middle class voters, in the name of partisan purity. Yes, health care premium tax credits are a result of former Democratic President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Yes, those credits also pair with former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature health care reform bill, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). At this point, though, the Republican obsession with destroying the ACA has turned self-destructive. 
A 2025 Virginia Joint Commission on Health Care report shows why. The state saw reductions in the number of residents without health insurance from 2018 to 2023 due to Medicaid expansion and growth in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
Helping the middle and upper middle classes afford health insurance with tax credits makes for a healthier mix of incomes and individuals. Some Republicans contend this amounts to welfare for those who do not need it. Such criticism drips with hypocrisy coming from GOP majorities in the Senate and House, whose members  — including Virginia’s entire Republican delegation — just voted for a federal budget without health premium tax credit extensions, but with permanent extensions of tax cuts for the country’s richest individuals and corporations. 
Dumping premium credits also ignores the hidden cost of emergency room visits by the uninsured it creates. Those visits often go at least partially unpaid and eventually get passed on in the form of higher insurance premiums to those who do have health coverage. One daunting fact that emerged from Virginia’s 2025 health metrics report is that “the percentage of potentially avoidable emergency department visits in Virginia has steadily increased since 2021.”
As time runs out for extending health insurance premium credits, Republicans have offered little that will effectively replace them. As he did in his first administration, Trump has promoted cheap private health insurance policies that do not cover prior existing conditions, have monetary caps on services, and/or require large deductibles before benefits kick in.
Republicans in Virginia, including Wittman, talk about privatization of health care. Often that includes giving money to individuals for health savings accounts that can be used to buy their own insurance policies or other uses. But the subsidies Republican plans mention  — $1,000 per year for some people and $1,500 for others – would not be enough to pay the costs of a couple of trips to the emergency room, much less the bill for a single in-patient surgery.
The Senate and House need to extend the health insurance premium tax credits at least temporarily, if for no other reason than this: They sustain Americans’ physical and financial health in a country where for-profit medical services enrich everyone except the patients.
Virginia’s Republican delegation to Congress forgets that at its own peril.

(Photo courtesy of Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Office of Emergency Response)Linda Perri has seen — and smelled — a lot in the more than 40 years she has lived in Washington Park in Providence. Some days are worse than others.
“You can’t open your windows in the summer, you can’t sit outside in your yard, front or back,” Linda Perri, who is president of her neighborhood association, said in a Nov. 14 interview.
For decades, many South Providence residents have suffered from pollution caused by industrial businesses on Allens Avenue and the Port. Some recall being awoken by the pungent odor of asphalt and experiencing nausea, headaches, and fatigue. In 2022, a school was even evacuated due to smells from the Port being mistaken for a gas leak. And though hundreds of air quality complaints have been made, Rhode Island has continued to prioritize economic profit over the wellbeing of its people. The time has come for the state to put the health of its people first and hold these entities accountable.
Allens Avenue, home to asphalt plants, scrap metal dealers, oil and gas companies, and salt distributors, has been called “the most toxic and polluted stretch of roadway in Rhode Island” by the Providence Streets Coalition, a group of over 40 community organizations, local businesses, schools, associations, and individuals supporting safe and healthy streets.
The impact of this pollution on surrounding communities is severe. The combination of noxious emissions from I-95 and pollution from businesses along Allens Avenue and the Port may contribute to Rhode Island’s asthma rate for adults exceeding the national average. In 2021, 12.6% of the state’s adult population had the condition, far above the national average of 9.7%. Rates among Rhode Island youth have decreased in recent years but were at 6.6% compared to the national average of 6.5%.
“It’s a struggle. There’s so much pollution. There’s so much road debris.” Perri said. “There’s a lot of things that could be done in this neighborhood to create a healthier, more environmentally-friendly port area.”
State officials are not doing enough to prevent bad actors from hurting the environment and these communities for their own monetary benefit. Since 2009, Rhode Island Recycled Metals has conducted its operations without proper permits from the state, contaminating the Providence River and Narragansett Bay with runoff and fuel from unlicensed vessels and defying stormwater discharge permits. Even after a series of fires led to its temporary closure in 2024, attempts to bring the company into compliance continue to fail. Meanwhile, nearby communities continue to pay the price.
Over the past few years, government action has shown that the state prioritizes the interests of these industrial businesses over the wellbeing of affected communities. In 2019, Mayor Jorge Elorza applauded the industrial waterfront as a “driver of economic development.” And when asked why some businesses in the area were not being held accountable by the city for environmental violations, Elorza’s office told ecoRI News  that “the City is not responsible for air emissions or coastal regulations,” passing this responsibility to the DEM and Coastal Resources Management Council.
Mayor Brett Smiley’s 2024 Comprehensive Plan has taken a step in the right direction, but further action is needed. The plan emphasizes the development of clean and sustainable industries, laying out objectives to mitigate the environmental and health impacts of pollution. It also notes that “the city may prohibit future industrial uses in the General Industrial District, M-2, that it determines go against the public interest of public health and quality of life in near-industry neighborhoods.” However, will the state actually do this when the time comes? Or will more businesses like Rhode Island Recycled Metals be allowed to emerge? Without concrete accountability measures and enforcement strategies, these goals risk becoming empty words.
It is difficult to strike a balance between economic growth and public wellbeing, but it is essential that the state do so. Without immediate government intervention, the health of thousands of Rhode Islanders will remain at risk. Left to their own devices, these industrial businesses will continue to prioritize economic growth over public health.
Many residents worry that their voices will be drowned out by lobbyists and developers, who have greater influence in determining governmental outcomes. The state should propose an environmental justice law that will give residents in these communities a prominent voice in future developments. The state must enact legislation that reflects not only the interests of industrial developers, but also the concerns of those affected most acutely. Additionally, to decrease industrial operations in specific areas, the state should rezone parts of Allens Avenue and impose stricter penalties on businesses that violate environmental regulations.
I imagine a future where children can play outdoors without worrying about inhaling harmful pollutants – a future where every Rhode Islander has access to clean, healthy air. Thousands are counting on the state to act. 
So the question I ask is this: Will it continue to prioritize economic growth over people’s health, or will it finally listen to the voices of those crying out for help and deliver justice to these communities?

Some Ohio craft brewers are optimistic changes will be made at the federal level to allow THC-infused beverages to continue to be manufactured and sold past next year.
Ohio Senate Bill 56 allows five milligram THC beverages to be manufactured, distributed, and sold until Dec. 31, 2026. The bill also says that if the federal government legalizes THC beverages, Ohio will consider “a more robust regulatory framework of these products,” according to the bill’s language.

“I’m excited we have another year,” said Collin Castore, the co-founder of three central Ohio breweries. “I’m optimistic that the federal side will get cleared up. …The more regulation we can get and clarity on things, the better.”
Ohio Republican lawmakers passed the bill, sending it to Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk for his signature. DeWine has said he will sign the bill. 
“I think (the bill is) positive,” said Bobby Slattery, founder of Fifty West Brewing Company in Cincinnati. 
“I would have hoped that this bill would have, if the federal extends, this bill would have an automatic extension built into it. That’s not exactly how it played it out, but I think it’s something that we can fix down the road.”
However, not all brewers are as hopeful. 
“I’m not optimistic that the federal piece that would trigger that clause will happen in time before the end date of this Ohio bill,” said Scotty Hunter, co-owner and founder at Urban Artifact Brewing, which produces Coastalo THC sodas. 
“I’m still optimistic that the federal (government) will get a regulatory framework in place. I just don’t expect that to happen in under a year …  I expect some period of prohibition in Ohio.”
THC-infused beverages have no alcohol in them and are regulated by the Ohio Department of Agriculture. 
“One of the requirements of these beverages is that you actually have to send your product out to a lab to verify that it meets the milligrams that you are advertising on the can,” Slattery said. 
Fifty West Brewing produces Sunflower THC Seltzer, which has quickly become popular. 
“On the trajectory that it’s on, we can see within the next two years this overtaking and us producing more THC products than craft beer,” Slattery said.
People looking for an alternative to alcohol turn to the THC-infused beverages, Ohio brewers said. 
“If you talk to customers that are drinking them, it’s not because they get you higher or anything along those lines,” Slattery said. “Most of them, they’re just looking for a healthy alternative, whether it be lower calories or it doesn’t mess with their sleep.”
Castore was glad THC-beverages were separated out from intoxicating hemp products in the bill. 
“This is a different category and should be treated differently,” he said. “We felt like we were kind of being good players who were getting tossed into the maybe not so great players.”
THC-infused beverages make up 10-15% of their wholesale business and about 5% on the retail side, said Castore, the co-founder of Seventh Son Brewery, Antiques on High, and Getaway Brewing.
Until he hears otherwise, Castore is keeping things status quo when it comes to THC beverages. He said his breweries are doing some new flavors of THC drinks next year. He said they were going to roll out a 10 milligram THC beverage, but are now changing it to five milligram beverage. 
“We’re overall glad about the regulation, and overall slightly optimistic that things are moving in the right direction,” Castore said. 
A pair of Democratic senators from Oregon recently introduced federal legislation that would undo the federal hemp ban and would, among other things, allow THC-infused beverages to contain up to 10 milligrams per container.

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)Jen Legere, owner and director of A Place to Grow, hangs staff credentials on the walls of her child care centers. Being known for having a quality early childhood program, she said, shows families her program is worth sending their children to. 
“It is super important to us from a marketing perspective,” she said. “When we’re talking about the quality of our schools, 100% it is important to our families.”
One way for child care programs in New Hampshire to invest in quality is through the Granite Steps for Quality, or GSQ, system. The joint federal-state program ensures early education programs maintain quality and operate above the state’s minimum standards, and, as a result, provides educators with support measures, including training and coaching, as well as quarterly and annual funding. 
GSQ is New Hampshire’s version of the national Quality Recognition and Improvement System. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, defining and measuring quality is important because it ensures educators “are addressing the essential building blocks of a well-financed, high-quality early childhood education system.” 
For providers like Legere, whose early childhood education business operates in Brentwood, Salem, Durham, and Wingate, North Carolina, GSQ’s incentives and support are beneficial. It helps to subsidize the cost of running a child care business — which is already high — while motivating her staff to improve. She said she gets between $8,000 and $10,000 a year for being in the program. 
Oftentimes, joining GSQ allows early education programs to receive incentives for work they would be doing anyway as a licensed child care program with credentialed staff. The benefit to participating in Granite Steps for Quality is that providers receive extra support in addition to some stimulus funding. 
However, the disadvantages are starting to prevail. Maintaining a high-quality program at GSQ standards is expensive and the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start is becoming more rigid in paying out to providers. Communication between the two groups is starting to dissolve. The bureau also changed how employees are classified in the system, making it even more confusing for busy program directors to navigate. 
“It’s really a system designed for failure, for sinking child care centers that are already struggling and on the margins,” Legere said. “This is broken. We need to fix it.”
And it’s not easy to leave. The impact of no longer being in Granite Steps for Quality would be a 3% tuition increase for parents, Legere said. 
A Place to Grow uses GSQ incentive dollars to fund employee benefits such as telehealth, mental health care, retirement, reduced tuition for children of providers, roadside assistance, and more. GSQ funds are budgeted, so the money has to come from somewhere else. 
The child care industry already exists on thin margins. Program tuition is expensive for most families, and programs do not want to raise rates for fear of pricing families out. According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the recent data shows the average annual price for an infant in center-based child care was $17,250, and the average price for both an infant and a 4-year-old was $31,868 in 2023.
Providers need money to retain their employees, who are leaving the industry due to low wages, few benefits, and burnout. A 17% turnover in child care employees was anticipated between 2023 and 2025, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute.
Programs often look to the few child care subsidies available in New Hampshire to help balance their budgets and retain their staff. With that in jeopardy, businesses will pull out of the system and have to raise tuition— a solution that helps no one. 
Invoice issues? No payout.
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 142 early education programs were a part of GSQ in fiscal year 2024-2025, which is about 19.8% of 717 licensed child care programs in New Hampshire as of December 2024. The department said it awarded over $1 million in quarterly incentives. 
Programs can receive between $2,400 and $5,700 per quarter in incentives, depending on the program type and size. The money is authorized for personnel costs such as benefits and employee incentives, implementing state standards and credentialing, purchasing classroom materials, conducting staff and child mental health checks, and more. 
Recently, providers have reported that the Department of Health and Human Services and the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start are no longer accepting late GSQ invoices, resulting in programs not being paid despite having completed the work. 
Legere said she submitted her invoice after the deadline earlier this year. Health and Human Services told her they would not be paying her, a change from past times when she had submitted late paperwork. She said not getting paid for the work she and her employees did was frustrating, and she was willing to let the loss go until she found out she was not alone. 
“If it was just me, I would be much more likely to suck it up, like ‘I’m a s—y bookkeeper.’ But like, when there’s so few of us participating in the system … that’s a system problem,” Legere said. 
Kitty Larochelle, executive director of The Growing Years Center in Manchester, said that when she had not received payment from the department, she was told it was “too late,” even though she had sent the invoice on time. 
“We never get any kind of confirmation that we’ve submitted anything, and we never get any receipt,” she said. In the past, Larochelle said she had issues with New Hampshire Connections, the website where providers submit invoices, so she was not surprised by the problems. She was, however, surprised she wasn’t paid. 
“I have no proof. I didn’t do a screenshot of when I imported it into New Hampshire Connections,” she said. 
Larochelle said that GSQ funding is a way for child care programs to get a few extra dollars “when pennies are tough,” especially now when funding for child care employee recruitment and retention is in limbo. 
At a Child Care Advisory Meeting held on Dec. 11, Jotham Spreeman, director of operations at the Bureau of Child Development, said Health and Human Services would not be paying out late invoices from previous quarters. 
The department’s policy surrounding late payments is not concrete. The current GSQ handbook, last modified on Oct. 5, states that “incentives funding may be denied or paused” if an invoice is not submitted on time. Providers have pointed to the “may” in the sentence, believing that it leaves wiggle room on the rule. 
Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about why they would not pay providers if their paperwork was late but they had completed the work. 
“I want my f—g money,” Legere said. “Why is there no transparency about it? We did the work. Why can we not get paid in a more fluid and easy fashion?”
Measurement and communication issues
To be part of Granite Steps for Quality, programs must meet specific criteria and benchmarks, including credentialing and training their staff, administrators, and directors beyond what is already required of licensed child care programs. Increasing the percentage of a program’s credentialed staff allows it to move onto the next “step” of GSQ, giving programs more access to funding and resources. 
One major problem providers are struggling with is inconsistency in how the state represents staff qualifications. Across the three main qualification systems — state child care licensing, which is required for entry into GSQ; credentialing, the term used for training under New Hampshire’s Early Childhood Professional Development System; and GSQ — an educator can fall under three different qualifications.
For example, under licensing, a “lead teacher” is someone with a high school degree, 18 industry-related college credits, and a minimum of 1,000 hours of work in a licensed program. Under credentialing and GSQ, the title and qualifications for someone who meets the criteria differ.
“You’ve already been through all these inspections, you’ve already proved yourself to be licensed. It should be front-door access,” Larochelle said.
Dealing with this is an administrative burden for program directors. In Larochelle’s eyes, it is a result of child care providers not being included enough in conversations about issues that involve them. 
“Systems have been built for us without a whole lot of input from those of us who actually use these systems. So ideally, I would love to see the systems have some communication when it comes to licensing.”
The department said it worked with child care providers, advocates, higher education systems, educators, and the legislatively enacted Child Care Advisory Committee on the changes implemented in 2022. They did not respond to questions about qualification redundancies and differences. 
Legere is skeptical of provider input. She is confident providers would have pointed this out if asked. 
“I don’t think they realized what they did when they did this,” she said. “They thought they were helping, but it actually hurts mathematically.” 
Programs have to reapply for GSQ every three years, and in working on her application, Legere realized that under the 2022 changes, she wouldn’t be eligible for GSQ at all. 
“I’ve been at Step Two for three years. Really ready to move into Step Three. But the way that those new changes have happened, I don’t even qualify for Step One anymore,” she said. “I have the most qualified staff I’ve ever had in my life at our schools. But the way this math works makes it look like I’m the worst I’ve ever been.” 
Overall, providers have complained about the lack of communication from the department and the bureau. Complaints include no reminders about deadlines or memos about program and form changes.
“There’s a disregard for the complexities of the lives of us as business owners in this industry,” Legere said. “Do you know how many socks and shows and children and parents and grandparents (I manage) in a day? Like, general courtesy, send me a reminder.”
Larochelle said that when problems arise for her, it is difficult to determine who at the department or bureau is the best person to contact. When she reaches someone, responses are not timely. 
“We do not have a directory,” Larochelle said. “We don’t know who to contact. We don’t know who we’re actually in communication with. It’s rare for an email to be signed.” 
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to allegations of lack of communication and slow response to early education providers.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/childcarequality-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-19 05:57:17.427228

Ohio has joined a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company engaged in deceptive practices as part of its Uber One subscription service. Nineteen other states, the District of Columbia and California’s Alameda County have signed on to the lawsuit as well.
“Uber took consumers for a ride – and it wasn’t what they signed up for,” Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in a press release. “A free trial shouldn’t lead to a surprise bill, and canceling shouldn’t become an exercise in frustration.”
Meanwhile, the ride hailing company defends the subscription service, which trades perks like discounts and ride credits for a monthly fee.
“Millions of Americans choose Uber One because it delivers real, measurable value: substantial savings on rides and deliveries, priority service, and exclusive promotions,” the company said in a statement.
“The FTC, and the states that have decided to join this misguided lawsuit, are wrong, and we will vigorously defend these claims in court,” it added.

The case
The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general contend Uber’s subscription service makes bogus claims about purported savings and makes it very difficult for consumers to cancel.
In its promotional materials, Uber claims customers save on average $25 a month with the subscriptions. The complaint rejects that out of hand.
“In fact, these claims are false,” it states. “Many consumers do not actually save $25 a month by using Uber One.”
The FTC and attorneys general cite internal documents from Uber in 2023 that detail actual savings among subscribers. But those figures are redacted in the court filing. Notably, they add Uber’s savings claim only works if you don’t factor in the cost of the subscription.
Much of the government’s case hinges on violations of the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act, a consumer protection measure passed by Congress in 2010. Part of that law generally prohibits the sale of goods or services through “negative option marketing” unless there are specific safeguards.
“A negative option is an offer in which the seller treats a consumer’s silence — their
failure to reject an offer or cancel an agreement — as consent to be charged for goods or services,” the complaint explains.
One of the required protections is a simple cancellation process. But the government claims, “Uber utilizes various tactics that prevent or make it hard for consumers to cancel, especially when they attempt to do so within 48 hours of their billing date, often snaring consumers into additional months or even years of a service they no longer want or need.”
The filing details a seven screen, 12 action process customers must navigate to cancel. But in the final 48 hours of a billing cycle, that process grows 32 actions on 23 screens and involves direct contact with customer service. In those circumstances, the app explained their next payment may already be in process.
“In fact, Uber always charged consumers before the supposed billing date and never processed cancellations concluded via the in-app cancellation flow in the final 48-hour window,” the complaint alleges.
The government notes as of September of 2024, Uber had enrolled more than 28.7 million users in the program, and that those subscription fees generated close to a billion dollars in revenue over two years.
Uber’s response
In its statement, Uber pushed back strongly on the government’s characterization of its subscription service.
“If this lawsuit were to succeed, it would upend how virtually every modern subscription service operates,” the company said. “Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law. Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less”
The company also said it has since eliminated the alternative cancellation process in the final 48 hours of a billing cycle.
“This has not been the case for more than a year,” the company stated, “and we have refunded customers who had reached out to Uber Support to cancel within 48 hours of their next billing period and did not receive benefits greater than the membership fee charged.”

In addition to Christmas and Hanukkah, at least five other traditional celebrations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia take place this month. 
All fall around the shortest day of the year, the winter solstice, and in Ohio people have been marking it for at least 2,000 years. More than 100 are expected to go to Fort Ancient in southwest Ohio Sunday to mark it yet again. 
It’s unknown exactly why Hopewell peoples went to such great lengths to mark celestial phenomena, but it’s beyond question that they did. 
For centuries after A.D. 1, peace reigned across what is now the eastern United States as people of different cultures shared the same belief system. They made periodic pilgrimages to the Ohio Valley to build vast monuments that are so mathematically and astronomically precise that in 2023, the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks were named Ohio’s only World Heritage Site.
The world celebrated Ohio’s most important cultural site. Like so much else, that’s controversial

Requiring more than a century to plan and build, the Octagon Earthworks at Newark mark the 18-year cycle of the moon.
 More than 100 miles to the southwest, Fort Ancient charts the phases of the sun.
The 110-acre hilltop site is enclosed by 3.5 miles of earthen walls, some as high as 23 feet, said Neil Thompson, a spokesman for the Ohio History Connection, which runs and cares for the site. 
Construction was an immense effort, given that the walls had to be built one basket of earth at a time — and had to be built sturdily enough to last for millennia.
“There’s no place in the world quite like this,” Thompson said. “They made the hilltop enclosure so the earthen walls followed the hilltop, and they were still able to code the solar alignment in what they did. I think it’s another human testament to the creative genius that made these places.”
Fort Ancient isn’t just some big, crude structure looking out over the Little Miami Valley.
“At Fort Ancient, the builders literally carved the rhythm of time into the land,” the History Connection’s website says. “Two of the distinctive limestone-capped mounds align to the summer solstice sunrise, and two align to the winter solstice sunrise. These days must have held deep importance for the site’s builders.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stand behind one of the mounds on Sunday and you’ll watch the sun rise through the exact center of a gap built into an earthen wall hundreds of yards away. 
Doing so is free and open to the public, and you’ll likely be with people who have traveled from other continents just to see it.
As with other Hopewell sites, artifacts have been found at Fort Ancient that came from as far away as the Rocky Mountains, the Atlantic Ocean, modern Canada and the Gulf Coast. 
That means that vast, intricate trading networks existed when it was built — although there’s no known written record from the time describing them.
Also due to the lack of a written record, it’s unknown why the movements of the sun and moon were so important to the Hopewell people that they’d undertake such a gargantuan effort to mark them. 
But we know why the winter solstice was important to other cultures. 
As the shortest day of the year, it could be a time to check grain and hay stores and decide what animals to slaughter so the rest could survive until spring.
That might call for a feast. And just being in the depths of the gloomiest part of the year might be reason enough for a celebration of light and rebirth and renewal.
Fort Ancient will open at 7 a.m. Sunday, with sunrise to come 50 minutes later. A guide will be there. Click here for a map and directions.
Weather in the area is expected to be clear and in the upper 20s. The museum will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and bathrooms are available. The park is open until 5 p.m.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)While commending the passage of a law to limit local involvement in federal immigration work, lawmakers and immigrant rights groups say those restrictions are vital but only one step in guarding against rights violations in Maine.
When the Maine Legislature’s next session begins in January, lawmakers are slated to take up new proposals focused on protecting against erroneous detentions, preventing immigration enforcement in places like schools and hospitals, and clarifying language to ensure jails can refuse to detain people on behalf of federal authorities. 
Originally proposed in collaboration with the restrictions that passed, another bill that seeks to limit local-federal collaboration by banning official contracts with federal immigration authorities will also be returning. 
While immigration is a federal matter, states have tried in various ways to intervene since President Donald Trump began his second term and launched a mass deportation agenda, with federal agents using aggressive tactics to meet record arrest numbers and in some cases bypassing due process. 
Some states have expanded local authorities’ ability to assist in the president’s effort, while others have limited it. 
Maine joins the latter after Gov. Janet Mills announced earlier this week that she will allow a new law that sets specific restrictions on when local authorities can collaborate with federal immigration agencies. 
But there are also other ways lawmakers and advocates are pushing for the state to set limits, including shoring up individuals’ rights against possible violations by federal entities and challenging the current use of jails to house immigration detainees. 
“Our ultimate goal is not having pockets of protection,” said Crystal Cron, founding director of the mutual aid organization Presente! Maine, which is helping craft one of the new bills, “but knowing that we are truly safe in this state that we call home.”
New proposals 
During Trump’s second term, there have been instances of people being erroneously detained and deported. A proposal from Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) seeks to prevent that from occurring in Maine by creating a right to emergency review.
“The way that federal immigration enforcement has been conducting itself has been extremely concerning to my constituents in Portland and people across Maine,” Duson said. “My goal with this proposed bill is to protect public safety, require due process and respect individual rights. I firmly believe that these three things can be true at the same time.”
Under Duson’s proposal, the text of which is still in the works, if someone is swept up by immigration authorities, detained in a Maine facility and has not been accused of a criminal violation, that person can petition a Maine court for review and release by providing evidence that they are lawfully present. 
“There is a lot of concern that federal immigration enforcement is more focused on meeting quotas than protecting constitutional rights,” Duson said. “Regardless of where you stand on immigration issues, I think we can all agree that no hard-working person who stops at the Home Depot or drops their kid off at school should be disappeared from their family and wrongfully held in custody.”
In September, a parent was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
Among the many changes the Trump administration has made to immigration enforcement was revoking the “sensitive locations” policy, which previously protected certain areas — such as schools, hospitals and places of worship — from immigration enforcement. 
One of the new proposals Maine lawmakers will consider next session targets that change. 
A bill sponsored by Rep. Ellie Sato (D-Gorham) seeks to add state level protections in those scenarios. Like Duson’s bill and other new legislation, the text of this proposal titled, “An Act to Improve Constitutional Protections Against Unreasonable Search and Seizure in Public Schools and Public Health Facilities,” is currently being drafted.
Sato declined to comment on the details of her proposal at this time, but other lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates described it as a key priority. 
The session that begins in January is the second year of the state’s two-year legislative cycle. Legislation in the second session is limited to budgetary matters, bills from the governor, and proposals considered emergency in nature by the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected members of legislative leadership.
Legislative leaders rejected a proposal from Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland) that sought to prohibit law enforcement from wearing masks that conceal their identities. Across the country, immigration agents have been seen wearing masks during raids and while detaining people, which had generally not been seen previously. 
Another of the new bills accepted targets a particular nuance in state law that has come up in debate over whether Maine jails are required to hold people on behalf of federal immigration authorities. 
Split over views on immigration detention, Cumberland County commissioners postpone vote

Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions. Since the spring, the public has been calling for the Cumberland County commissioners to cancel the county jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshals Service. It’s been in place since 2010, paying the county $150 per day per federal detainee. 
Over the summer, the Maine Department of Corrections issued a memo stating that their interpretation of current law is that Maine jails must hold people for federal law enforcement officers. This statute has also been cited by Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce when contending that he’d still be obligated to hold immigration detainees regardless of what happens with the contract. 
“That’s been one of the biggest barriers for our commissioners — doubts about whether action at the county level will even carry weight,” said Cron with Presente! Maine, whose organization has been a part of the group calling for the board of commissioners to terminate the agreement. 
Bill sponsor Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) did not respond to requests for comment, but Cron said Presente! Maine is helping craft the legislation, which she hopes will demonstrate that the original intent of the law was not to obligate jails to hold detainees on immigration offenses. 
During commission meetings, some have argued ending the contract would only result in people being detained farther away from their family and legal counsel. But Cron argues that thinking is flawed. 
As Maine Morning Star reported back in April and attorneys say remains the case, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.
Federal authorities may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but legal experts say regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch. 
That is the broader system Cumberland County Jail is a part of, Cron said. 
“We’ve heard a lot of language about, ‘Oh well, my hands are tied’ and ‘this is the way things are done,’” Cron said. “As community members, as lawmakers, we need to work together to figure out how to make policies and laws align with our values and what we will allow within communities, and not the other way around.”

Returning proposal 
Two of the most hotly debated bills last session were introduced in tandem, offering a two-pronged approach to prevent local and state police from taking on the work of federal immigration enforcement. 
LD 1971, now slated to become law, set limits regardless of formal partnerships with federal authorities. The other, LD 1259, would explicitly prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities, such as 287(g) agreements. 
“This win for LD 1971, this promise that it will go into law is absolutely a vital step. It’s a huge win,” said Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor). “But, there is still work to be done.” 
Rana, the sponsor of LD 1259, says her bill is still needed. She plans for it to remain the same, though noted she’s open to adjustments as long as its intention isn’t altered. 
Elsewhere in the country, participation in ICE’s 287(g) program has been growing since Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. The program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling. 
GOP lawmakers in Maine attempted to make it illegal to restrict compliance with immigration enforcement earlier this year, but that proposal failed. 
Wells Police Department was the only Maine agency that opted to join, but the department later ended its contract in October after continuous public opposition. 
Absent official agreements, police in Maine have still looped federal immigration authorities into routine work, such as traffic stops, which have resulted in drivers, passengers and people who later arrived at the scene being detained for alleged immigration violations.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4503-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-19 04:57:51.703339

I can tell I’m growing older because I instinctively recoil at the number of receipts and checkout terminals that now include a line for tips. You can hardly buy a meal, drink or some kind of personal service without also being asked to judge someone via gratuity. That’s the kind of complaint that my forefathers and foremothers in the column writing business would have chewed over to their obvious delight in the 1960s or 1970s.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.

But take a look at that Kansas minimum wage, still stuck at $7.25 an hour. That works out to $290 a week, or $15,080 per year, both before taxes and assuming you work full time. Meanwhile, according to Forbes, it costs an average of $35,185 a year to live in the Sunflower State.
Those whose income includes tips, meanwhile, can receive a far lower hourly wage — tips are meant to make up the difference.
So pay up, my friends.
I’m old enough to remember when the adults around me considered a 10% tip adequate. Within my quarter-century as an adult, that percentage shifted upward to 15%. At least since the COVID-19 pandemic, a basic tip among civilized folk has hovered at 20%.
This leads to surprising difficulties with arithmetic. Once can figure out 10% easily enough — 15% means a dollar or two above whatever you were going to tip. But calculating 20% requires mental multiplication. Depending on your comfort level with times tables, that’s a challenge.
Those gratuities can also ding the proverbial pocketbook. A dinner for two at mid-level restaurant can easily top $50. A 20% tip, at a minimum means, $10 extra. If you go to a truly nice place or receive exceptional service anywhere, you’ll probably want to throw in a few dollars extra.
We have shifted from tipping being a way to reward exceptional service to an expected charge supporting service workers. In Europe, locals don’t tip much or at all. But companies also pay living wages there. As a U.S. consumer, I’m willing to help make up the difference. 
If the pandemic didn’t teach us any other lessons, it surely proved that those who deliver food orders and shop for us at grocery stores deserve more than the minimum. Period.
Perhaps as a result, we’ve seen tipping spread through the culture like a gelatinous blob.
“The reason people believe this is because it’s true,” Cornell University professor Mike Lynn told AARP. “They’re being asked by more people to leave tips and asked to leave larger amounts.”
That doesn’t mean anyone has to enjoy tipping. I suspect the problem comes down to giving people too much choice. Few of us mind fuel taxes, because service stations include them in the cost of a gallon of gas. Likewise, those with mortgages might notice property taxes less because banks add them to monthly payments. Retirees who own their houses outright pay those taxes separately — and they sure notice them.
In a perfect world, businesses would pay workers what they’re worth. Innumerable tip lines and required calculations would disappear. Just think: The people we rely upon across society to serve us could afford to live in that society!
Tipping might just return to its status as a recognition of superior service.
We don’t live in a perfect world, though. Suck it up and help pay people what they’re worth. They’re only your fellow human beings.

(Photo by MIchael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Niki Isaak was approximately 33 miles into the Central Florida Classic bike ride near Brooksville in October when a group of motorcyclists entered the bike path and began riding dangerously close to her.
Despite there being a wide-open road, one motorcyclist narrowly passed Isaak on the right shoulder, another pinned her in on the left, and a third finally hit her from behind.
The sudden impact smashed her body to the ground, puncturing her anal canal and fracturing her tailbone, among other injuries. She was immediately rushed to HCA Florida Bayonet Point Hospital, where she remained in the trauma center for three days before being released to return to her home in Fort Myers.
Two months later, she is still doing physical therapy and has created a GoFundMe page to help with the medical bills now totaling more than $400,000 as she tries to pick up the pieces in her life.
“The impact is so big,” she said in a Zoom conversation last month. “It’s ruined our lives in so many ways, and we don’t even know the outcome. I just hope people can see that it’s just getting worse.”
Despite the seriousness of the accident, the offending motorcyclist was only charged with a citation for careless driving, a moving violation.
Frustration among cycling advocates 
“What is the response of the local law enforcement officers? Nothing,” fumes Matt Scarborough, Isaak’s attorney who specializes in defending cyclists involved in accidents. “We’re seeing in my practice that cyclists are just being ignored. If this was a motor vehicle vs. another motor vehicle causing this much damage to somebody, I think it would be a much different story.”
One of Scarborough’s other cases involves pro triathlete Gabrielle Suver, who was cycling along the side of a county road in Lake County on  Nov. 15 when a driver sideswiped her, resulting in a broken back, a fractured neck, a broken leg, fractured kneecap, liver laceration, scapula and sternum fractures and concussion, according to WESH-TV. She was released from the hospital this past Sunday after 28 days.
For decades, Florida’s roads have been listed as the most dangerous in the nation for pedestrians and bicyclists, and there has certainly been more awareness regarding safety concerns in the Sunshine State. But observers lament that conditions aren’t getting better.
A recently released report from the Bicycle Accident Lawyers group concluded that Florida remains the most dangerous state in the nation for bicyclists, looking at combined 2022 and 2023 data. And there were another 207 bicycle fatalities in 2024, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
These troubling statistics continue despite the fact that Florida lawmakers in 2006 passed a law requiring motorists to give cyclists at least three feet of space when driving along or passing them.
Cynics question how often that’s being enforced. Just 130 motorists were cited for violating that law in 2024, according to the annual uniform traffic citation report produced by the state.
Florida’s 3 foot rule
“The 3-foot rule is not the 3-foot rule,” says Tampa attorney Steele Olmstead, who has represented injured cyclists. “The statute says that the motorist has to pass at a safe distance. Not less than 3 feet? Well, cops fall back on that and go, ‘Oh, well. I can’t get out and measure it. I couldn’t tell whether it was 3 feet or not.”
Florida statute 316.083 (2) says that that any driver overtaking a bicycle or other nonmotorized vehicle or an electric bicycle occupying the travel lane must pass that vehicle “at a safe distance of not less than 3 feet or, if such movement cannot be safely accomplished, must remain at a safe distance behind the bicycle or other nonmotorized vehicle or electric bicycle until the driver can safely pass at a distance of not less than 3 feet and must safely clear the overtaken bicycle or other nonmotorized vehicle or electric bicycle.”
Olmstead says he “might have” won one case over the past decade in which a motorist received a ticket for unsafe passing.
Officials say increasing bicycle deaths is a national problem but note that there is a greater proximity to higher speed roads in Florida.
“There’s often a transition from a 20-25 miles per hour neighborhood development that’s relatively self-contained or something like a quasi-gated community, and then you’re immediately on a 45 mph road,” said Ken McLeod, policy director for the League of American Bicyclists. “And at 45 mph, any mistake by a driver is more likely to cause a death for a person biking or walking.”
And while more Florida cities have incorporated separated paths for people to bike and walk, there remain plenty of unprotected bike lanes. “All it takes is driver looking down at their phone and drifting down into the bike lane at 45 mph, and you have a crash that could be a fatality, because you have that high speed and that kinetic energy potential is there to cause the death,” McLeod said. “If it was 35 or 30, you have a lower chance of death when that crash occurred.”
The League of American Bicyclists “Benchmarking Report” released in December 2024 showed that the percentages of bicyclist deaths have increased in Florida from an average of 143 between 2014 and 2018 to 197 between 2019 and 2023, a 38% increase.
And, according to preliminary data compiled by the state of Florida, as of Dec. 13, there had been 185 bicycling fatalities this year (along with 9,277 injuries from bicycle crashes).
(A group called “Ghost Bikes” places white-painted bicycles at sites where someone was hit or killed while riding.)
Some law enforcement officials say the fault often lies with cyclists. In a YouTube video posted last month, Pinellas County Sheriff Sgt. Jessica Mackesy said that at least four cyclists were critically injured or killed in crashes with vehicles because they didn’t stop at a stop sign or a red light.
“Physics doesn’t care if you’ve done it 100 times before. A 4,000-pound vehicle versus a bike, there’s only one outcome,” Mackesy said. “And looking both ways isn’t enough when there’s a driver who has the right of way and expects you to stop. Stop means stop — on the road, on the trail — every time.”
The Florida Department of Transportation last updated its Pedestrian and Bicycle Strategic Safety Plan in October 2021. In it, the agency reported that, between 2016 and 2020, 90% of all pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities and serious injuries on state roadways occurred in just 25 of the state’s 67 counties. (The top five counties for fatalities and serious injuries were Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange, Hillsborough, and Duval).
Potential solutions?
Pinellas County Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross is a cyclist who can be seen riding her bike to the Capitol during the legislative session. She says there are common-sense things that government can do to enhance safety for pedestrians and cyclists, such as creating more protected bike lanes and pedestrian crosswalks, but she believes part of the problem is with how local governments develop communities.

“They’re all focused on having a car,” she said. “People by and large will choose places that are more walkable, that have mixed uses where you can walk to your grocery store or to a coffee shop. People like that, but a lot of the new development doesn’t have that as an option. You’ve got to drive to get into your community. You probably have to go a couple of miles to get to a grocery store.
“Maybe there’s sidewalks in your community, but they’re not leading to anywhere. They’re just a loop within the community. So, I think fundamentally, we need to shift the way our development is happening, so it’s geared towards people moving at a slower pace. Cars are also going to have to slow down and make it safer. That also helps to just enhance our quality of life, make it more accessible for people who are aging to have those options.”
John Sinibaldi Jr. is president of the St. Petersburg Bicycle Club. He has been hit twice by motorists while biking, the last time in 2010 when a collision with a distracted driver led to two lower-back surgeries and two cervical spinal-fusion surgeries. He offers two changes that he thinks could significantly improve bike safety in Florida.
“I would increase communications dramatically between the state and the people who drive on our roads,” said Sinibaldi, whose late father, John Sinibaldi Sr., was a two-time Olympic cyclist in 1932 and 1936. “That would include visual things like billboards and public service announcements on TV. That would  include better driver education before you get your license, [and] driver education when you renew your licenses.”
His other idea is less prescriptive, and more philosophical.
“The second thing is we have to get our local police out of the mindset that if a motorist in a car hits a cyclist, the default option should not be to just assume that the cyclist did something wrong. And yet that’s often the case,” he said.
The Phoenix reached out to law enforcement agencies in Florida for reaction.
“Law enforcement works to enforce the law, and they will treat everyone with respect in that process, that includes both motorists and cyclists,” said Logan Lewkow, deputy executive director of operations for the Florida Sheriffs Association. “You can look around the state — sheriffs’ offices have created visibility enforcement programs specifically to make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists. The safety of pedestrians and cyclists is very important to law enforcement.”


The Florida Highway Patrol did not respond to a request for comment.

Legislation
The Florida Bicycle Association says its top legislative goal is for the state to pass a comprehensive “Hands Free” law that would make it illegal to hold a phone while operating a motor vehicle. The group says such legislation must go beyond “texting and driving” to encompass all activities that take a driver’s hands and attention away from the road, including scrolling through social media, streaming videos, and any other non-driving activity requiring manual interaction with a handheld device.
Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, sponsored a bill to do just that during the 2025 session, which passed in the Senate, 37-9. But its House companion never moved at all.
No similar bill has been filed yet for the 2026 session.
Bills addressing bike safety have been introduced for the coming Florida legislative session, but only regarding electric or e-bikes, a relatively new phenomenon resulting in a spike in injuries around the state.
Lots of people — from kids to seniors — began using e-bikes during the COVID pandemic. “A new subculture” of seniors who never rode a bike before are using e-bikes seeking the freedom they’re looking for, Sinibaldi said, adding that he sees younger people who have lost their licenses or can’t drive for whatever reason who are also using these new bikes.
“They’re terrorizing the Pinellas Trail — there’s no other way to put it — because they don’t know anything about trail etiquette,” he said. The trail occupies old railroad right of way between St. Pete and Tarpon Springs.
A bill (HB 243) sponsored by Republicans Yvette Benarroch from Collier County and Kim Kendall from St. Johns County would require a person using or renting a class 3 electric bike to hold a driver’s license or learner’s permit. Class 3 electric bikes are the fastest legal bikes with a maximum speed of 28 miles per hour. Anyone caught purposefully modifying an E-bike to boost its motor-powered speed would face a fine up to $100. Subsequent violations could go up to $250.
And Hillsborough County Republican state Rep. Susan Valdés filed legislation last week (HB 667) that would require anyone under 18 to wear a helmet while operating or riding an e-bike.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ghostbikeIMG_0918-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-19 01:01:04.344058

The crew gathers at your house, and you snap some photos for social media before strolling to your local train station. 
Once aboard you chit-chat placidly while gliding to your destination. There’s no traffic, no missed turns, no endless circling to find a parking spot. After the curtains come down, you wander back to a station and catch the train home, buzzing with excitement right up to the moment your head hits the pillow.

This kind of convenient, safe, and affordable travel should be the norm, but Connecticut’s extant rail network is underutilized. While Gov. Ned Lamont and other state leaders have supported investment in rail improvement projects, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. This issue is partly due to limited public awareness. Most Connecticut travelers assume that driving is the only means of reaching their destination, unaware that public transit may be cheaper, is statistically safer, and is always better for the environment. 
If we can get more people to take the train more frequently, they will experience first-hand the efficacy of rail transportation. This awareness will induce a greater public appetite for rail improvements and expansion, which can in turn reduce congestion on our roads, limit deadly car accidents, and lower our state’s carbon footprint. 
To facilitate a higher rate of ridership on existing rail lines, Connecticut should start by subsidizing Metro-North rides to concerts at the Hartford Healthcare Amphitheater in Bridgeport. Riders could simply show their concert ticket to conductors within an hour of an event’s start or conclusion to qualify. 
A similar program already works in Phoenix, AZ, where Valley Metro Light Rail provides free rides to the PHX Arena. Connecticut should study this model with the intent of implementing their own version. Such a program would boost awareness of public transit while reducing post-concert car traffic.
Downtown Bridgeport is the ideal place to implement this transit-oriented policy. The amphitheater was built to serve as a cultural hub, and pedestrian walkways connect the existing Metro-North train station directly to the venue. Despite this, many amphitheater attendees still drive. 
Incentivizing train travel as a cost-efficient alternative to driving would not only streamline concert-goers’ experience but also benefit local businesses, as pedestrians are more likely than motorists to stop at restaurants and shops on their way to and from events. The boost to Bridgeport’s local economy from increased foot traffic would be substantial, accelerating the city’s renewal. 
If successful, the program could be extended to other transit-adjacent venues like College Street Music Hall in New Haven, Fairfield Theater Company, or Waterbury’s Palace Theater. Critics may argue that free train rides are a “handout,” but once people have a pleasant and convenient experience on public transportation they are more inclined to use it again, even when they have to pay. This increase in ridership would generate more revenue, better service, and greater public interest in rail expansion across the state.  More opportunities to take the train means less traffic on roads, which leads to cleaner skies and smaller road maintenance budgets. 
Creed frontman Scott Stapp once asked, “Can you take me higher?” The state of Connecticut can. By offering free train rides to events at Hartford Healthcare Amphitheater, we can elevate our cultural offerings, grow local economies, and raise residents’ quality of life. When we connect the Nutmeg State by rail, there’s nowhere to go but up.

Defeat has taken over my body as my mind gives in to the anxiety of doing a skill I thought I had mastered. Despite being a cheerleader for over a decade, I am hit with a mental block.  
Mental blocks are known to psychologists as lost move syndrome. This is a condition in which an athlete is unable to perform a skill that was once automatic. Mental blocks can be challenging obstacles for cheerleaders and require resilience and patience to overcome.  
This past year I experienced mental blocks. I have been a competitive cheerleader for 14 years and a youth cheer coach for four years.  In all this time, I have never run up against an obstacle as debilitating as a mental block.  



When I became a collegiate cheerleader at Central Connecticut State University, I knew I needed to improve my tumbling skills and to learn a standing back handspring. Every day during the summer, I would practice in my backyard with my sister or dad. After hundreds of tries, I finally was throwing the back handspring with ease. I was proud of my hard work and grateful to do the skill I’d dreamed of.
Until one day I couldn’t.  
At practice I tried to transfer the skill from the cushioned mat onto the hardwood floor in preparation for basketball season. When I began to count myself in like I have done hundreds of times, my body froze up, my mind went blank, panic set in and fear clouded my head. 
I had heard stories of cheerleaders and gymnasts experiencing mental blocks but never imagined it would happen to me. Was all my hard work this summer for nothing? Would I have to start over? Was I no longer good enough to be a college cheerleader? These were the troubling thoughts that flowed through my mind every time I stood at the edge of the blue mat preparing to throw my back handspring.  

Emily Sousa

Many people do not understand the physical and mental demands that go into perfecting competitive cheerleading skills. Cheerleaders are taught to smile and perform no matter what. If the stunt falls, keep going. If you mess up, keep smiling. This pressure of perfection can mask the physical and mental difficulties we athletes face in preparing to take the floor, knowing that we could get hurt. The National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research said that collegiate cheerleading accounted for 70.5% of all female catastrophic sports injuries between 1982 and 2007.  
Lost move syndrome, however, can be overcome. Jada Wooten, featured on Season 2 of the Netflix series “Cheer” was the 2021 NCA Collegiate National Champion with Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas. She said in the YouTube video “How She Overcame Her Mental Block” that after making her dream team and suffering from a mental block, she considered giving up the sport she loved: “So I fought and fought, and yeah, I fell, but I kept fighting. … It was part of my growth. It taught me to keep battling. … I still go through hard times, don’t get me wrong. But I have learned not to fear them.” 
Mental blocks were not the end of my cheerleading journey. I dedicated the following months of practice to regaining my confidence and changing my mindset. I tested my limits and pushed myself beyond my mental barriers.  
By continuing to show up for myself and practicing patience, my hard work paid off. I was able to compete with my back handspring at the National Cheerleaders Association’s College Nationals Championships. 
Mental toughness is still a challenge I work on every day, both on and off the mat. But like Jada Wooten, my experience working through mental blocks has made me into a stronger athlete and individual.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The board that oversees Maryland’s multibillion-dollar education reform plan formally threw its support Thursday behind a list of legislative priorities adopted last week by the state Board of Education.
The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Accountability and Implementation Board will back the school board’s three legislative priorities: changing the current star-rating system for schools, also known as the state’s annual report; investing in the professional teacher development program known as coaching; and funding stipends to let experienced principals help mentor aspiring school leaders.
“I sincerely believe that these investments that this body can support now, to ensure that we deliver on the promise of the Blueprint, can restore Maryland as an education destination that is top 10 in the nation,” said state Superintendent Carey Wright, who spoke before the Blueprint board for almost 35 minutes during  Thursday’s online meeting.
“This is so important for us to be able to collectively deliver for the 890,000 kids around the state,” Wright said.
The coaching and principal initiatives were approved in the 2025 legislative session — but without funding — as part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act. Wright and other education advocates plan to press lawmakers for funding in the 2026 session that starts Jan. 14.
The Academic Excellence Program is a statewide literacy and math instructional coaching program that has as part of its goal “to address persisting achievement gaps and provide additional support to underserved communities.”
The principal initiative is under the Maryland School Leadership Academy that seeks to support and develop education leaders. Stipends would be for experienced principals to mentor aspiring and novice principals in community and low-performing schools.
State Board of Education to study new school rating system, but changes could be years off

In terms of a new rating system to assess student achievement, the state Board of Education reviewed possible changes last week based on a recommendation from the Accountability Advisory Committee to eliminate the current star system. School leaders have said the system, which give schools one to four stars, does not adequately capture the quality of a school, and shortchanges schools with a large number of low-income students.
Educators will be asking for funding for those programs at a difficult time, as lawmakers face a potential $1.5 billion budget deficit for the next fiscal year.
“There may be questions as it relates to the timing, in some degree the cost, because that’s a real challenge for us in this age and time, given the budgetary restraints that we have,” said Blueprint Board President Isiah “Ike” Leggett, who agrees with Wright on the need to invest in those initiatives.
Blueprint board member Robin Werner, director of teaching and learning for Talbot County Public Schools, asked Wright if there’s a strategy for local schools to replace an experienced educator who may leave the classroom to become a coach.
Wright said part of the plan is that any educator who applies to become a coach would have to work in a certain region of the state, which could be in the same or a nearby school district. But she also noted that a superintendent must “agree to sign off on it. If they don’t sign off on it, then that teacher would not be selected from that district.”
Endorsing the school board’s legislative priorities come just weeks after the Blueprint board adopted its own legislative priorities for the 2026 session. Those include an extension of the policy to “hold harmless” funding for multilingual learners, students in poverty and those in special education. That provision, which protects those students from potential per pupil funding cuts, is currently set through fiscal 2027; the board wants it extended through fiscal 2028.
Move-in update
The Accountability and Implementation Board, with more than a dozen people on staff, could be close to moving into its office in Annapolis in March — about a year after a long search secured office space on West Street in Annapolis. The goal then was to have the first workers in the office by fall 2o25.
“Very excited at some point in the spring we can have an in-person board meeting.” AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise told board members.
“I’ll believe it when I see it,” Leggett said.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderState regulators are set to vote Friday on a massive energy capacity request from Georgia Power that proponents say protects ratepayers but environmental and consumer groups warn relies on uncertain data center demand, which critics say could cost customers billions.
The Georgia Public Service Commission is considering the utility’s request to approve nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy infrastructure, roughly five Hoover Dams’ worth of energy, primarily to serve a projected surge in data centers. Commission staff and Georgia Power recently reached an agreement that allows the utility to proceed with its full request under specific conditions. Under the deal, the utility has agreed to protect existing customers from rate increases until 2031 if the projected data center boom fails to materialize.
“Staff now supports the stipulation with Georgia Power, which addresses the core concern of protecting ratepayers from speculative load forecasts,” said PSC Electric Unit Director Robert Trokey at the Dec. 10 hearing.

Trokey and other commission staff testified that the provision allows at least $8.50 per month in “downward pressure” on residential rates during this period, even if the spike in demand does not materialize as forecasted, and that Georgia Power would assume financial risk through 2031.
Before the agreement was made public, commission staff recommended a more conservative approach, approving only one-third of the utility’s 10,000-megawatt request and giving conditional approval to another third.
Last-minute surprise agreement with Georgia Power is met with outrage at regulatory hearing

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center, Georgia Interfaith Power and Light and Southface Institute, are asking the commission to reject the plan. In a closing brief, the groups argued that, with interest included, customers could end up paying as much as $60 billion of the cost of building out the massive energy infrastructure. The groups also argued that the protections in the agreement are insufficient, warning the commission that overbuilding for data centers that may never materialize is a risk to its customers.
“This 10,000 megawatt request is not about reliability, or the risk of blackouts; it is about on what ‘timeline’ Georgia Power may accommodate prospective new large load customers,” the SELC wrote in its filing ahead of the vote. “For existing customers in Georgia Power’s territory, the risk of underbuilding — which only arises if Georgia Power chooses to cancel a conditionally certified resource — is that Georgia Power may have to ask prospective customers for a longer load ramp, something they already are doing.”
A new report commissioned by SELC and produced by Greenlink Analytics and Science for Georgia challenges the utility’s energy demand projections, suggesting they are statistically improbable. The report indicates that Georgia Power is basing its 10,000-megawatt request on a highly improbable 1-in-500 scenario, asking for more capacity alone than the 2,400 to 6,700 megawatts of growth they projected for the entire Southeast.
“Infrastructure planning or investment decisions that rely on high demand forecasts risk driving unnecessary investments and infrastructure,” according to the report. “We recommend healthy skepticism of aggressive utility forecasts to avoid underutilized or stranded assets and increased retail electricity costs for ratepayers.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC06774-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 21:58:37.232665

Officials have not publicly confirmed the search is related to the mass shooting that occurred more than 85 miles south on Brown University’s campus in Providence on Saturday. A press conference initially scheduled in Providence at 4 p.m. remains delayed by more than five hours, but city officials confirmed an update will be shared with the public at some point in the evening.
The Salem Police Department did not immediately respond to calls for comment Thursday night. However, the town’s public safety agency posted on its Facebook page shortly after 8:30 p.m. Thursday, urging local residents to “remain vigilant and exercise heightened caution.”
The post confirmed heightened police presence, including “several federal agencies,” along Route 28 and neighboring Methuen City, Massachusetts. Salem Police are also asking for tips on anyone who sees “any individuals on foot who appear out of place, unfamiliar to the area, or behaving in a manner that seems unusual or suspicious.”

One of the most notable wreath laying ceremonies this year was in Sunset, Utah, where for the first time the day was honored at the site of the Agent Orange Memorial in Sunset Veterans Park. 
The official groundbreaking ceremony for the Agent Orange Memorial took place on Nov. 15. The monument’s construction began two days later and is still in progress. 
Even though the memorial has not yet been completed, the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF) scheduled a wreath laying ceremony to honor victims of Agent Orange and other toxic chemicals. 
Those victims number in the hundreds of thousands and include Vietnam veterans, Gulf War veterans, and post-9/11 veterans. Service members from all three groups were exposed to extremely hazardous chemicals. 
An information stand located in front of the Agent Orange Memorial contains details about veterans exposed to toxic chemicals. Those details indicate where chemical exposure occurred and other relevant data. 
Some of the information provided at the memorial site relates to Vietnam veteran Larry Kerr, founder and chairman of the UAOVF. This is due to Larry’s exposure to Agent Orange during his service in Vietnam. 
As one consequence of Larry’s exposure to toxic herbicides sprayed in Vietnam, his voice is not quite what it used to be. As he spoke at the ceremony, however, Larry gave a voice to countless Agent Orange victims who no longer have one. 
Larry also played a major role in planning the wreath laying ceremony, where an appropriately decorated wreath was placed in front of the information stand with the solemnity fitting such a revered occasion.
While the wreath laying ceremony was brief, its significance endures.

Pete Ricketts for his work attracting out-of-state law enforcement officers. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers criticized President Donald Trump’s efforts to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana as local advocates applauded the change.
Trump, via a new executive order he signed Thursday, seeks to expedite a move started under President Joe Biden to federally downgrade marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug. Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, LSD, ecstasy and peyote, are drugs the federal government has classified with a high likelihood of abuse and no currently accepted medical value.
Schedule III drugs are defined as those with moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence, such as Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids and testosterone.
Trump signs order to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, but it’s still illegal

Trump’s order directs U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to “take all necessary steps” to complete the rulemaking process related to rescheduling marijuana and to do so in the “most expeditious manner” possible.
“We will evaluate the order closely to determine how we can best continue to engage, protect the public health, and ensure the safety of our citizens,” Hilgers and seven other Republican attorneys general said in a joint statement.
Hilgers was joined by attorneys general from Indiana, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Wyoming. 
In Thursday’s joint statement, the attorneys said they had argued against rescheduling for years. The officials also said they believe science around marijuana shows it is correctly listed as a Schedule I drug and that they have “seen firsthand the harm the drug has caused in our communities.”
“The negative impacts of expanded marijuana use, especially on children and adolescents, are worrisome,” the attorneys general said.
Last year, Hilgers’ office, on behalf of Nebraska and 10 other states, submitted a public comment against rescheduling.

Meanwhile, Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which ushered in two laws through Nebraska ballot measures in 2024 to legalize and regulate the drug as medicine, applauded the move and said it recognizes the medical value of cannabis, corrects “false narratives” around addiction and allows “long-overdue” research.
“With marijuana now rescheduled, the excuses for inaction are gone, and state leaders can no longer hide behind scheduling as a reason to do nothing,” said Crista Eggers, executive director of the organization.
The order “doesn’t legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,” Trump said Thursday. “Just as the prescription painkillers may have legitimate uses, but can also do irreversible damage … it’s never safe to use powerful controlled substances in recreational matters.”
Trump’s executive order cites a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determination that marijuana has medical uses, based on a finding that more than 30,000 health practitioners across 43 U.S. jurisdictions are authorized to recommend medical marijuana. The drug has been recommended to more than 6 million registered patients for at least 15 medical conditions, the order states.
Trump also cited a finding by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for using marijuana to treat pain, anorexia in some situations and nausea or vomiting induced by chemotherapy.
Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., joined 21 other Senate Republicans urging Trump not to reclassify marijuana. Ricketts has long opposed marijuana and, in 2021, made national headlines when he said, “If you legalize marijuana, you’re gonna kill your kids.”

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says no deaths from overdose of marijuana have been reported. National critics, including Hilgers, have said the drug has broader harms.
“We cannot reindustrialize America if we encourage marijuana use,” Ricketts told 10/11 on Thursday. “This change could put our roads, workplaces and communities at risk. Those pushing this are giving bad advice.”
The continued fight could matter in Nebraska, as a voter-created commission, appointees of Gov. Jim Pillen, continues to write rules and regulations around the medicine. The Nebraska Legislature might also act in 2026.
Marijuana could also matter electorally. Jacy Todd of York, a challenger to Pillen in the 2026 Republican gubernatorial primary, helped the 2024 medical cannabis campaign, and possible rematch candidate Charles Herbster — who has not yet entered the race — has sharply criticized Pillen on marijuana. 
Dan Osborn of Omaha, a registered nonpartisan challenging Ricketts in the 2026 U.S. Senate race, has pointed to their differences on marijuana.
“I’m not sure what Pete is smoking, since it’s apparently not weed, but these 1930s-style scare tactics and the prohibition of cannabis has only harmed patients and caregivers,” Osborn said Thursday in a campaign statement. “Grow up, Pete.”
Eggers said her group looks forward to working with Hilgers, Pillen and Ricketts “to ensure Nebraska reflects science, supports patients and adheres to voters’ mandate.”

Lawmakers that year passed a bill that enables communities and groups to pool resources to become connected to solar energy. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Attorney general-designee Stephen Cox is asking two of Alaska’s largest electrical utilities to reconsider years-old charity programs that have benefited local nonprofits.
In a pair of letters sent to Golden Valley Electric Association and Matanuska Electric Association on Thursday, Cox says he believes their charitable round-up programs may violate state law and the U.S. Constitution.
“My office is not asking for Operation RoundUp to be discontinued, but rather reformed so that it fully honors transparency, consumer rights, and constitutional rights,” Cox wrote in the letter to MEA CEO Tony Izzo.
The Department of Law sent copies of the letters to the Alaska Beacon in response to questions about why the attorney general had raised concerns about a proposed program by Chugach Electric but not two older, already-operating programs elsewhere in the state.
In its newsletter to consumers this month, Chugach Electric Association — the state’s largest electrical cooperative — said it was continuing an indefinite suspension of its planned “Cents of Community” effort because of “legal concerns raised by the Alaska attorney general.”
“The Attorney General’s Office previously took no action against similar programs operated by Matanuska Electric Association Inc. and Golden Valley Electric Association Inc., for more than 15 years,” the newsletter stated.
All three utilities are member-owned and -governed, and in all three cases, members voted to install programs that round up utility bills to the next dollar. Proceeds from that rounding are collected and distributed to nonprofits chosen by the utilities.
In each case, the programs are opt-out — members are automatically enrolled but can unsubscribe from the round-up program if they want to. 
In 2023, when Chugach Electric customers were asked about the program, it was described as “all in,” and members approved it by a wide margin.
Similar programs are common across the country. When GVEA created its Good¢ents program in 2011, more than 260 electrical cooperatives had similar programs, said GVEA spokeswoman Ashley Bradish.
“Over half of GVEA’s membership opt to round-up their monthly bill and their small change continues to make a big impact on the communities we serve,” she said by email.
Altogether, GVEA’s program has distributed almost $1.9 million to a variety of nonprofits in the Fairbanks area. Recipients are chosen by a volunteer, six-member board.
Local voters approved MEA’s Operation RoundUp in 2011.
“Approximately 67% of our co-op membership participates in the program which provides on average $50,000 in grants on a quarterly basis to local community organizations and projects,” said Jennifer Castro, senior manager of communications and community engagement for the cooperative.
Writing on Tuesday, two days before the attorney general’s letter, Castro said MEA “absolutely” intended to continue the program.
“It’s successful. Our members love being able to support their community and it’s also personal,” she said. “Whereas when you go to the grocery store and the electronic pad prompts you to round up to support a national organization that you’ve never heard of — with our program our co-op members change goes directly to making positive change within the community we power.”
Chugach Electric had intended to begin its program in October but postponed its implementation when Cox challenged the program soon after Gov. Mike Dunleavy designated him as attorney general in late August. 
In a September filing with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska, which controls electric utility rates, attorneys for the Alaska Department of Law questioned the legality of Chugach’s program.
The commission ultimately decided that it lacked jurisdiction over the issue, but Cox said he could pursue the matter in state court.
It isn’t clear why Cox initially challenged Chugach’s prospective program but not those already operating in Fairbanks and the Mat-Su. 
Julie Hasquet, a spokesperson for Chugach, said the utility doesn’t know. 
The Department of Law did not provide an explanation for the three-month gap between the action against Chugach and the letters sent to MEA and GVEA.
In the action against Chugach and in the new letters, Cox said he believes an opt-out program could be considered a negative option marketing scheme, something prohibited by law.
Recipients of the MEA and GVEA programs are chosen by a volunteer board, but Cox said “members do not control where their money goes.”
“The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held that individuals have a right not to subsidize speech or causes with which they disagree. An opt-out mechanism does not fully resolve that concern when participation is presumed rather than chosen,” his letter to MEA and GVEA states.
That argument resembles one the Department of Law used for five years in an unsuccessful legal campaign to require public employee unions to reauthorize their membership annually. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled against the state on that issue, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the topic.
“I am hopeful that MEA will consider the concerns in this letter and switch to an affirmative opt-in program, which would substantially mitigate the legal concerns while preserving the program’s charitable mission,” Cox wrote, using similar language in his letter to GVEA.
Hasquet, at Chugach, said the board of that utility will vote in early 2026 about whether to go ahead with its round-up program or not.
“The key to a successful return would be resolution of any legal issues brought forward by the Alaska Attorney General,” she said.
If the utility goes forward with the program, Chugach expects it would result in about $400,000 per year for charities in its coverage area.
“One of the principles of a member-owned electric cooperative is concern for community. We were looking forward to the opportunity to support charities in our service territory, especially now with dollars dwindling on other fronts (state and federal),” Hasquet wrote by email.
“The program was approved by Chugach members, and a Board of Trustees, made up of Chugach members, was appointed by the Chugach Board of Directors. The Board of Trustees would be the individuals reviewing and approving the grants. We believe this is a great opportunity to support charitable organizations with member-directed dollars,” she said.
“We remain committed to the cooperative spirit of concern for community and to pursuing initiatives that support charitable and community efforts.”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Vaccination rates for influenza and COVID-19 are low in Wisconsin, and on Thursday, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services announced that two children have died within the last month: one from the flu in northeast Wisconsin and one from COVID-19 in the western part of the state.
 
For people without health insurance
The Vaccines for Children program makes shots available for people who have no health insurance or whose health insurance plans don’t cover vaccines.  Wisconsin also has a Vaccines for Adults program that provides free or low-cost vaccines for adults 19 or older who have no health insurance coverage or whose insurance doesn’t cover vaccines.


Citing concerns for family privacy, DHS is not releasing the ages of the children. At a media briefing, Tom Haupt, the DHS respiratory epidemiologist, said they were the first deaths of people under 18 from those illnesses since the start of the flu season Oct. 1.
Although year-to-year comparisons in mid-season are difficult, “we are definitely seeing an increase in influenza and COVID-19 at this particular point,” Haupt said.
Haupt said DHS has not yet verified whether either of the two children were vaccinated. Both had “some underlying conditions that would increase their risk” for more serious illness, he said.
Five people under 18 died from flu in January and early February 2025, Haupt said. DHS monitors certain illnesses, including flu and COVID-19, through data from hospital emergency rooms, lab tests and studying municipal wastewater for evidence of the viruses responsible.
Vaccination is the best tool for preventing serious illness from both flu and COVID-19, Haupt said.
“Our vaccination status for children for both COVID-19 and influenza are very low,” he said. “We want them to be increased significantly.”
Across all ages, about 28% of Wisconsinites have been vaccinated against the flu and 10.6% against COVID-19. “These numbers are lower than what we’ve seen over the past few years and that’s very unfortunate,” Haupt said.
DHS recommends both vaccines for everyone 6 months or older. The COVID-19 and the flu shots can both be given at the same time.
Flu can have outcomes much worse than its usual symptoms.
“Influenza could lead to cardiac problems for both children and adults. It can lead to encephalitis,” Haupt said. “So, it’s not only the acute acute part of influenza, it’s what can happen later on.” With vaccination people are “protecting yourself and protecting those people who are around you.
For a third serious respiratory illness, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, DHS recommends the maternal RSV vaccine for expectant mothers who are 32 to 36 weeks pregnant, to protect their infants after they’re born.
DHS recommends the RSV vaccine for infants younger than 8 months if they were born to mothers who did not get the vaccine during pregnancy. DHS also recommends the vaccine for children 8 to 19 months old with a higher risk of RSV, as well as for adults 75 and older and for adults 50 to 74 years old who have an increased risk for the virus.
Haupt said doctors have told DHS that they’re encountering more vaccine hesitancy in the general public than in the past. One cause appears to be confusion about shifting recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the CDC advisory council that makes recommendations on vaccines, he said.
Haupt said that for people hesitating about getting vaccines for themselves or their children, the “most accurate sources” for information are the state health department, local public health departments, community clinics, pharmacies and primary care doctors.

Tony Evers meets with children at a Fitchburg child care center in September 2023. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers approved an administrative rule change Thursday meant to make it easier to place children, who are in foster care because they are unable to safely remain in their home, with relatives or “like-kin” caregivers.
“We know that kids do better when they have supportive and loving people around them, and they’re in settings where they feel safe and can be their best and full selves. Keeping adults in kids’ lives who know and love them can go a long way toward making sure a kid has the stability they need so they can be focused on being a kid,” Evers said in a statement. “This is about doing what’s best for our kids and helping increase the likelihood of youth being in an environment with their family and loved ones, especially during difficult, chaotic times in their lives.”
According to the Evers administration, the rule change will help by providing a separate, streamlined licensing pathway for relative and “like-kin” caregivers as well as ensure that there is fair financial support available for them.
The rule change is a continuation of work on the issue. In 2024, the state Legislature passed and Gov. Tony Evers signed 2023 Wisconsin Act 119 which expanded the definition of those eligible to be kinship caregivers to include first cousins once removed and adults with a “like-kin” relationship with the child, meaning people with a significant emotional relationship with a child.
According to the Department of Children and Families, in 2024, 39% of children in Wisconsin who entered out-of-home care were initially placed with relatives, increasing the likelihood that they would be placed with their siblings, experience more stability during their placement and help them achieve permanency with family.
“We know kids do better when they’re with family — however they define it. And families do better when they can spend less time running up against unnecessary administrative and financial barriers and more time together, being a family,” DCF Secretary Jeff Pertl said in a statement.

The Montana Public Service Commission will likely lose its fourth executive director in as many years.
The Helena City Commission announced Wednesday it voted to appoint Alana Lake as its city manager contingent upon successful negotiations. MTN said she was selected on a 3-2 vote.
Lake took the PSC executive director job in March and would be the fourth in that role to leave in one year or less.
Lake said Thursday she has been asked to withhold comments until an employment contract is finalized.
She was announced as a finalist for the city manager role on Dec. 1.
The Public Service Commission is made up of five elected commissioners who regulate monopoly utilities in Montana. It has struggled recently with internal clashes and, several years ago, with poor audits.
The agency hired its first executive director in August 2021 after it received a critical audit in the spring from the Legislative Audit Division.
In response to the audit, then-PSC President Jim Brown said the new position was already in the works as part of the agency’s proactive approach to address shortcomings.
In August 2021, the agency announced its first director, but the following summer, Erik Wilkerson, a former school superintendent, left for another superintendent job.
In January 2023, the agency said it hoped for stability in that role when former state legislator Brad Tschida took the job, but the Republican departed in September the same year. He had maintained a residence in Missoula.
The PSC announced David Sanders accepted the job in January 2024, but he left at the end of the year to serve as chief of staff for Brown, a Republican elected as state auditor that November after serving on the Public Service Commission.
Sanders has since announced his candidacy for the Public Service Commission.
Lake, of Frenchtown, holds a bachelor’s in international relations and political science from Montana State University and an associate degree in Korean language from the Defense Language Institute, according to the Helena City Commission announcement.
She joined the U.S. Air Force and spent a decade in leadership and also served as a counterintelligence officer for the Idaho National Laboratory, the announcement said.
At the PSC, Lake oversees a budget of $6 million and staff of more than 40, the city said.
Thursday, a PSC spokesperson said she would address questions about whether the agency plans to recruit for another executive director and potential timeline after Lake accepts the city manager position.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-12-18 20:56:54.962680

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — About 1,600 people attended job fairs and other events held over the past two weeks in the Lexington area for workers impacted by the Tyson Foods plant closure, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced Thursday.
The state and local efforts were designed to connect displaced workers with potential jobs and state workforce support services. Nearly 600 individuals registered with the state Department of Labor’s employment website.
Such outreach followed the announcement by Tyson Foods that it will close its longtime Lexington beef plant, eliminating 3,200 jobs. The plant is to close in mid-January. Tyson is the biggest employer in the town of about 11,000.

“We are helping people identify ways that they can make the most of this situation,” said Erick Carrillo, director of reemployment services with the Labor Department. He said the process is different for each worker.
Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said she attended several of the events the department hosted. More than 150 employers took part in job fairs and other outreach focused on the Tyson workforce. 
Employers are encouraged to post their jobs at NEworks.nebraska.gov. Participating employers, a summary of job openings and community resources are listed at opportunity.nebraska.gov/Lexington. 
A hotline (308)-407-1517 also is now available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, for Lexington workers seeking assistance through the Nebraska Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.
“The hotline aims to streamline access for individuals with questions regarding programs that may benefit them most during this time,” Pillen said. 
The Labor Department has scheduled other events at the Dawson County Fairgrounds for those losing Tyson jobs. NEworks sessions help people register for NEworks.nebraska.gov, the website where they can find employment and file for unemployment benefits when a job ends. 
The events:

Nicholas Scutari said he hasn't abandoned his plan to create a New Jersey inspector general to probe complaints against law enforcement.,"Senate President Nicholas Scutari had tried to weaken the state comptroller's investigatory powers, to the dismay of his critics. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey legislator behind a botched attempt to weaken the power of the state comptroller said he’ll attempt next year to pass a similar bill, but one that wouldn’t touch the comptroller’s office.
Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) said Thursday that he will introduce legislation in the next session, which begins Jan. 13, to create a state inspector general to field complaints about law enforcement, and that new position will be based in the State Commission of Investigation.
His remarks came a week after he said he would not move forward with the older version of the bill, which critics said was a bald attempt to kneecap an office tasked with guarding against public fraud, waste, and abuse.
Scutari, talking with reporters after a Senate voting session in Trenton, bristled at that suggestion.
“It was never a comptroller bill. It was an SCI bill,” he said.

Any legislation he introduces in the next session “will have nothing to do with the comptroller whatsoever,” he said.
A bill Scutari introduced just days before Thanksgiving would have transferred the investigatory powers of the comptroller’s office to the commission.
Scutari characterized the move as consolidation. Acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh blasted the bill, and other critics suggested it was retaliatory.
Walsh’s office has investigated public officials — including Scutari’s former chief of staff and other allies — around the state, issuing more than 25 reports this year alone that have irritated powerful people at all levels of politics. The State Commission of Investigation, in comparison, issued no reports this year. Critics warned that stripping the comptroller’s office of its investigative powers would allow corruption to flourish.
Scutari, as Senate president, largely controls what legislation moves in the Statehouse and fast-tracked his bill after about 18 months of mounting backlash to Walsh’s work.
Scutari insisted his motive has been to save money and eliminate a duplication of watchdog efforts.
“Apparently, we have lots of money to allow multiple places to do that,” Scutari said. “I don’t want to be seen that I want to hide any waste, fraud, abuse or corruption, which I don’t. But I don’t want to spend ungodly sums of money on these things when sometimes they don’t seem to lead to anything. But regardless of that fact, I heard the objections.”
A Senate hearing on the bill earlier this month devolved into a shouting match, with Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), the committee’s chairman, limiting critics’ testimony while giving supporters more time to speak. Beach also made Walsh, U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, and Attorney General Matt Platkin, all critics of the proposal, testify last, even though they were among the first to sign up to speak.
Scutari declined to comment Thursday on how Beach handled the hearing.
“These hearings are the way they are. I can’t chair every committee,” Scutari said. “I thought the testimony that I heard in the beginning was well thought out. And, you know, people did not agree with a lot of the stuff that was in there, but that’s pretty much it.”

Gov. Jacqueline Coleman would also cut their […],"The Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort, Kentucky, on February 27, 2024. Photo by Arden BarnesDemocratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says he is planning a roughly 3% budget cut to “many agencies” in Kentucky’s executive branch in response to a revenue shortfall in the current fiscal year. 
Beshear said during a Thursday press conference that his office and the office of Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman would also cut their budgets by about 3% to help cover a projected $156 million shortfall.
He also called on other state constitutional officers — all Republicans — to reduce their budgets by 3% as well. He said such reductions could be made not filling or eliminating vacant positions.
“We’re going to be able to manage this shortfall and still provide necessary services to Kentuckians,” Beshear said.
Beshear said many cabinets in state government are choosing to not fill vacant positions, though “absolutely necessary” vacant positions would still be kept. He said the state’s budget reduction plan does not make cuts to K-12 school systems, higher education, pension funding for state employees and educators and public safety funding including State Police and juvenile justice programs. He said the executive branch cuts would result in $77.7 million in General Fund reductions; he did not say how the remainder of the shortfall would be covered. 
That budget reduction request has been met with pushback by at least two Republican officeholders, and his move to cut executive branch agencies also drew caution from GOP leadership in the Kentucky House of Representatives. 
“We have seen reports of temporary cuts and strongly urge the governor to reject broad, across-the-board budget cuts and instead make deliberate, strategic decisions,” said House Speaker David Osborne in a statement through a spokesperson. “Across-board cuts may help the governor avoid difficult decisions at the state level, but they do not distinguish between effective programs and those that can absorb reductions, and they risk serious harm to essential services that individuals and communities across the state depend on.” 
The Consensus Forecasting Group, a committee of economists that forecasts Kentucky government revenues, slightly upgraded its outlook earlier this week when it projected the state’s revenue shortfall for the current fiscal year would be $156 million instead of an earlier projection of $305 million. 
Beshear said during the press conference his administration had not received formal plans yet to reduce budgets from Attorney General Russell Coleman, Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell and Secretary of State Michael Adams. 
But he said State Auditor Allison Ball and State Treasurer Mark Metcalf are “refusing” to go along with the request, breaking decades-long precedent “to do their part to be fiscally responsible and to take part in the budget reduction.” 
“There is nothing partisan or political about a budget reduction,” Beshear said. 
Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Colman Elridge in a statement following the press conference said in part that the state constitutional officers’ “refusal breaks more than three decades of precedent and adds insult to economic injury by forcing families who are losing access to food and health care to cover the expenses of elected officials who refuse to take even a 1% funding cut.” 
Republican pushback
But both Ball and Metcalf took strong issue with Beshear’s characterization. Both of the Republicans stressed their offices were independent of the governor’s administration.
Clay Skaggs, a spokesperson for Metcalf, in an emailed statement said the state treasurer “has not refused to participate in budget reductions and continues to act responsibly with taxpayer dollars.” 
Skaggs said Metcalf on Dec. 9 had “formally acknowledged the obligations of the Budget Reduction Plan to the State Budget Director and noted that his office will manage the Treasury’s budget internally.”

“The treasurer is an independently elected constitutional officer — he answers to the people of Kentucky, not to the governor’s inflated sense of authority,” Skaggs said, mentioning the Kentucky State Treasury would “achieve the required savings.” 
Both Metcalf and Ball also pointed to language in the last two-year state budget passed by the GOP-controlled legislature that appears to allow state constitutional officers to choose whether to comply with a budget reduction request by the governor. 
Ball in a statement provided through her spokesperson said the governor “demanded that my office reduce its budget, even though state law says he cannot demand that of constitutional officers.” 
“My office is responsible for identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and I identified five times the amount of wasteful spending that could be cut to avoid the budget shortfall entirely,” Ball said in her statement. “If the governor would just follow our recommendations, there would be no shortfall.”  
Joy Markland, Ball’s spokesperson, shared with the Lantern letters between State Budget Director John Hicks and Ball, dated from late September through November, highlighting disputes between the Beshear administration and Ball over the requested budget reduction. 
One of Ball’s letters to Hicks mentions language in House Bill 6, the two-year executive branch budget bill passed by the GOP-controlled legislature in 2024, that gives constitutional officers the choice whether to follow along with a request from the governor to reduce budgets during a revenue shortfall. Ball’s letters to Hicks also mention various audits her office has conducted of the executive branch.
Hicks in a letter dated Oct. 24 to Ball wrote it was his understanding “that you have said you will not participate in the General Fund budget reduction plan.” 
“And as a matter of context, it may be the first time an executive branch agency has refused to do their part. The Auditor’s office appropriation has been reduced in every mid-year General Fund budget reduction plan but one over the last 25 years,” Hicks wrote. 
Hicks wrote that the state auditor’s office in a submitted budget proposal had 13 vacant, full-time positions representing $1.3 million in costs “with the bulk financed from the General Fund.” He wrote a 2% General Fund cut from the auditor’s office would represent a $263,100 reduction and that many state agencies were participating in the budget reduction by not filling vacant positions.

Ball in a reply letter on Nov. 7 wrote: “We have no problem with you implementing a budget reduction plan. We simply believe that it should come in the form of targeting the executive-branch agencies that are actually responsible for creating budget problems and not those agencies that are actively working toward fixing them.” 
Andrew McNeill, a deputy state budget director under former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin and president of the free-market think tank Kentucky Forum for Rights, Economics and Education, said he implemented a few budget reductions during his time with the administration. 
Two big differences from back then compared to now: the state has billions of dollars in its Budget Reserve Trust Fund, colloquially known as a “rainy day” fund, to rely on; and lawmakers had passed language that allows state constitutional officers to choose whether they want to reduce budgets when requested by the governor. 
During his time working with the state budget office, “we had the authority to unilaterally reduce the allotments of the constitutional officer budgets.” 
“When we were doing these budget reductions, we didn’t have any choice but to impose these reductions on everybody because there wasn’t any money,” McNeill said. “That’s really the big difference here.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/240227Lantern059-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Federal regulators directed the operator of the nation’s largest electricity grid to establish transparent rules for AI data centers to connect directly to power plants.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the revisions will help to manage electricity costs as the race to develop artificial intelligence drives an unprecedented increase in electricity use across the country. 
In Thursday’s meeting, the commission unanimously approved an order directing PJM Interconnection to revise its tariff — a compilation of rate schedules and terms of a particular company or utility — to detail the terms and conditions for customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load. The order directs PJM to offer customers who want to co-locate four options to manage how data centers and other large loads interact with the grid.
Montgomery County-headquartered PJM manages the wholesale electricity market and grid for about 65 million customers in Pennsylvania and 12 other states plus Washington, D.C.

“PJM has been actively engaged with stakeholders throughout 2025 to address the rapid growth of data centers and the related increase in demand for electricity,” spokesman Jeff Shields said in a statement. 
Shields added the PJM board intends to move forward with a proposal to FERC derived from its own process in which stakeholders have provided their input on possible solutions.
“We share FERC’s focus on clear and transparent rules as data centers expand their role as an engine of the U.S. economy. PJM is reviewing the order and will assess how it impacts efforts already underway.”
FERC Chairperson Laura Swett said Thursday the decision would advance the nation in the AI and manufacturing revolution while safeguarding the prices consumers pay for electricity.
“While uncertainty has abounded across our country on how we will facilitate data centers, this morning, my colleagues and I are taking a critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem,” Swett said.
In February, FERC initiated a proceeding to review issues associated with the co-location of AI data centers, which can use as much electricity as a small city, and generators to ensure the clarity of the rates, terms and conditions of service that apply to co-location arrangements.
“Co-location arrangements are a fairly new phenomenon that entail huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs,” former Chairperson Mark Christie said in February.  “Given these ramifications, the commission truly needs to ‘get it right’ when it comes to evaluating co-location issues.”    
Advanced Energy United, an association for the renewable energy industry, said the order has potential to bring welcome regulatory clarity for large load customers and safeguards to minimize the impact of co-location on the electric rates and system reliability of all other customers.
Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said demand is outpacing the ability of the market alone to reliably and affordably serve data centers and existing customers.
“Advanced energy solutions like battery storage, solar, wind, demand response, and distributed energy resources are well-suited to reliability and affordably serve new large loads in PJM and across the country,” Marquis said. “The advanced energy industry will welcome new rules within PJM that empower large load customers to bring their own new clean energy to the system, benefiting all energy users.”
Co-location, the group noted, is attractive to AI hyperscalers because it can result in faster connections for data centers, which companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are competing to bring online first.

Microsoft has a $1.6 billion deal with Constellation Energy to restart the remaining nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Dauphin County to power its data centers elsewhere in the PJM service area. Amazon announced an agreement to buy a data center development adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna Steam Electric nuclear power station in Luzerne County. 
Co-location also raises questions about who will pay for additional transmission infrastructure and how large loads or other customers will be affected by fluctuations in electricity supply across the grid.
Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents competitive power generators, said the order provides options, recognizing that there are a variety of approaches to co-locating large electricity users and generating stations. 
“Clearly, this is the first step in a process that will require quick action and durable consensus from many stakeholders and highlights the urgency in getting solutions onto the system and for that we applaud FERC’s approach,” Snitchler said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6060-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A Senate panel advanced more than a dozen judicial nominees Thursday that could bring court vacancies to their lowest levels in years after confirmation votes that are planned to go before the full chamber next week.
If confirmed, the 13 would-be Superior Court judges, plus the one jurist confirmed during Thursday’s voting session in the Senate, would drop vacancies on New Jersey’s bench to 30, a level top court officials have said is sustainable for the judiciary.
“There are hardly going to be any vacancies left,” Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) told reporters following Thursday’s voting session.
Senate committee advances bill to end municipal public defender fees

There were 44 vacancies in New Jersey’s courts on Thursday, up from 33 at the start of July. That number will fall to 43 once New Brunswick Chief Municipal Court Judge James Hoebich, who was confirmed to the Superior Court Thursday, is sworn in.
The 13 court nominees advanced through the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday are set to be confirmed by the full chamber during Monday’s voting session, according to Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), the Senate judiciary chairman.

The judiciary committee intends to meet again to advance more judges before the current legislative session ends in mid-January, Stack said.
“I think we’ll have another one or two meetings, depending on the Senate president’s direction on it. Definitely one more. Possibly two more,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
The nominees advanced Thursday include Murphy administration attorneys Valentina DiPippo, Melissa Medoway, and Kerry Soranno, plus Dan Kelly, a longtime advisor who runs the governor’s disaster recovery office.
“Each of these talented individuals have worked diligently to advance our state. I am confident they will excel in their new roles on the bench,” Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.
There are 17 remaining Superior Court hopefuls who have been nominated by Murphy, who leaves office on Jan. 20. Murphy’s nominations expire when new legislators are sworn in at noon on Jan. 13.
Though most of the court nominees awaiting committee hearings were nominated in recent weeks or months, three have been waiting longer.
Murphy nominated Department of Corrections Commissioner Victoria Kuhn and former Newark Municipal Chief Judge Richard Nunes in June. Shantika Dorsey, an attorney for East Orange, has been awaiting confirmation votes for just over a year.
In New Jersey, individual senators can indefinitely and unilaterally block judicial nominees who reside in their home county or legislative district by invoking an unwritten rule called senatorial courtesy. The practice could block the confirmations of some nominees, though it’s unclear how many.
When asked whether there were court nominees awaiting courtesy sign-offs, Stack said, “I believe there might be, but I’m not 100% sure.” 
Court observers who have long urged legislators to speed judicial confirmations — and Murphy to nominate judges — welcomed this week’s progress. Christine Amalfe, president of the New Jersey State Bar Association, said vacancies have strained the state’s courts and swelled case backlogs.
“Passing today’s slate of judicial nominees will meaningfully ease that burden, and the NJSBA thanks the Governor and Legislature for taking this important action,” she said. “The NJSBA will continue to urge state leaders to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities and restore the Judiciary as a co-equal branch of government by confirming a full complement of judges. We look forward to further progress.”
The judiciary reported 36,396 backlogged cases in October, down from the record 97,032 cases reached in September 2021, but the number remains about 52% above prepandemic levels.
In March 2020, before COVID-19 forced the judiciary to shutter courthouses and hold proceedings virtually, the judiciary reported 23,917 backlogged cases.
Court officials mark a case as backlogged if it has not been heard after a period of time, which varies based on the type of case.
If confirmed by the full Senate, the nominees advanced Thursday would fully erase the Mercer Vicinage’s six vacancies and cut vacancies in Atlantic County from one to zero.
Middlesex’s vacancies would fall from four to three, then two once Hoebich is sworn in. Ocean, Burlington, and Monmouth counties would each see their vacancies reduced by one if the nominees are confirmed.
Judicial vacancies have been a longstanding problem under Murphy. Though just nine seats on the bench were empty after Gov. Chris Christie left office in January 2018 following a court expansion that added 20 new judgeships to aid then-nascent bail reform, vacancies ballooned early in Murphy’s tenure.
Only one of his judicial nominees was confirmed in 2018, when the governor found himself at odds with legislative leaders from his own party. The clash extended to budget negotiations, only narrowly avoiding a government shutdown.

Cox/Getty Images).Kansas legislative leaders will meet Monday to take one of the final steps toward luring the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line, floating bonds worth hundreds of millions so the team can build a domed stadium and an entertainment district.
With a year-end deadline looming, the Legislative Coordinating Council will consider approving Sales Tax and Revenue Bond agreements with the Chiefs. Monday is the council’s last scheduled meeting of the year.
With the bonds’ approval, the Kansas City Chiefs could move closer to uprooting six decades of NFL history in Missouri and relocate to Kansas. The deal is said to call for placing the new stadium near the Legends, a regional shopping mall and commercial area in the Village West development in Kansas City, Kansas.
The council will not consider any deals with the Kansas City Royals on Monday.
Legislative and state leaders refused to offer specifics about the meeting and would say only that the Chiefs will be on the agenda. Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican running for governor, said he has worked diligently to explore the change to bring the Chiefs to Kansas without raising taxes.
“He remains fully committed to these efforts and will continue working tirelessly up to and through the upcoming Legislative Coordinating Council meeting to facilitate this exciting opportunity for Kansas,” said Megan Stookey, Masterson’s spokesperson.
Missouri or Kansas? Business leaders don’t care as long as Chiefs and Royals stay near KC

Kansas Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said she was told the council, which is composed of legislative leadership from both parties, would be talking about the Chiefs on Monday — but not the Royals.
“We will be talking about the Chiefs,” Sykes said. “It sounds like there is some proposal that we will be looking at.”
The Kansas Department of Commerce, which handles such deals, posted on Facebook that the state is in active discussions with the Chiefs about “building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas.”
“No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come,” the statement said. “We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”
The Kansas City Chiefs didn’t return an email seeking comment.
In an interview Tuesday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly declined to say whether the Chiefs or Royals were coming to Kansas.
“You really think I’m going to answer that question?” Kelly said.
Missouri Gov, Mike Kehoe said his team remains in frequent communication with the Royals and the Chiefs and wants to keep the teams in Missouri.
“He believes Missouri is the best home for both teams and continues working with the teams to make the right decision to grow and invest in the Show-Me State,” said Gabby Picard, his communications director.
Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas issued a statement Thursday saying the city doesn’t negotiate in public.
“As the city and our Missouri partners continue discussions with our long-term partners at the Chiefs and the Royals, we remain steadfast in working toward an arrangement in the best interest of our community and the greatest success of our teams on and off the field,” Lucas said.
After a ping-pong of public-financing proposals offered by the two states, the Chiefs face a decision on Kansas’ deal, which could cover up to 70% of the project through bonds. Missouri’s plan offered 50%.
Missouri hit a wall in its bid to keep the Chiefs after voters rejected a sales tax extension in April 2024, throwing in jeopardy a plan that would have helped fund a new $2 billion downtown ballpark for the Royals and $800 million in renovations to Arrowhead Stadium. That’s when Kansas lawmakers aggressively stepped in, authorizing STAR bonds to finance 70% of development projects with a minimum investment of a billion dollars.
Kansas legislative leaders will meet Monday to consider using STAR bonds to finance a stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs that could be built near the Legends shopping area (Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector).
Kansas Sen. David Haley, a Democrat from Wyandotte County, said Thursday he’s hearing talk that the team is headed to the Legends.
The site of the new stadium could be west of the Kansas Speedway, at the junction of Interstate 435 and Interstate 70. The potential entertainment district surrounding the stadium would be placed near other existing businesses, like Legends Outlets, the Hollywood Casino, and Sporting KC’s soccer stadium.
The Kansas Legislature during a special session last summer created a financial incentive package designed to lure the Chiefs and Royals across state lines. The law allows for STAR bonds to pay for 70% of a development project with a minimum investment of a billion dollars. The bonds would be paid through liquor sales and retail sales tax revenue in the development area, with a window up to 30 years.
Reaching a deal now could allow a stadium to open by 2031, when the team’s leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire.
The Chiefs began playing in Kansas City in 1963 after owner Lamar Hunt moved the franchise from Dallas. The team first played at Municipal Stadium, at 22nd Street and Brooklyn Avenue, then moved to Arrowhead in 1971. The Truman Sports Complex, on the city’s east side, is also home to the Royals and the teams share parking lots.
The Chiefs sold naming rights in 2021 to the Government Employees Health Association and the official name became GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.
The Chiefs’ negotiations with Kansas intensified last month when the team floated a request for proposals from firms to design a domed stadium, which would be available for use during the Super Bowl and other winter events. The team was said to be negotiating with NASCAR for land near the Speedway.
Five months earlier, in June, the Chiefs requested an extension to a deadline for a stadium financing package from the state of Kansas, which was an indication the NFL franchise’s move across the state line was a real possibility.
But that same month, Kehoe called lawmakers into a special session to offer a competing stadium financing deal, hoping for something that could keep both the Chiefs and the Royals on that side of the state line. The Missouri Legislature approved the plan, which authorized bonds covering up to half of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million in tax credits for each stadium and more aid from local governments.

A federal judge in San Francisco is reversing the terminations of hundreds of federal employees finalized during the recent government shutdown.
U.S. District Judge Susan Illston issued a preliminary injuction, late Wednesday that orders the departments of Education and State, the Small Business Administration and the General Services Administration, to rescind reduction-in-force notices for employees who were terminated between Oct. 1 and Nov. 12 — the start and end dates of the government shutdown.
“Absent a contrary ruling from a higher court,” Illston is giving agencies until Tuesday to carry out the terms of her injunction.
“Defendants must do what the continuing resolution says. They may not take any further steps to implement or carry out a RIF through January 30, 2026, regardless of when the RIF notice first issued,” Illston wrote.
These agencies sent RIF notices to employees before the recent government shutdown, with separations in most cases scheduled to take effect in October or November, during the shutdown.
The American Federation of Government Employees and the American Foreign Service Association, who are leading a lawsuit with other unions, argued agencies that finalized RIFs during the government shutdown, regardless of when they were issued, violated a stopgap spending bill passed by Congress that prohibited layoffs through Jan. 30, 2026.
Illston issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month that blocked the finalization of layoffs of nearly 250 Foreign Service officers at the State Department. Those layoffs were originally scheduled for Nov. 10, but were pushed back to Dec. 5, and remain on hold.
In Trump rebuke, US House approves bill to overturn collective bargaining limit

The Trump administration has followed a narrower interpretation of the stopgap spending bill, and has only reinstated federal employees who received RIF notices between Oct. 1 and Nov. 12.
The continuing resolution Congress passed on Nov. 12 to reopen the government states that between Nov. 12, 2025 and Jan. 30, 2026, “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department.”
It also states that “any reduction in force proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken by an executive agency between October 1, 2025, and the date of enactment, shall have no force or effect.”
At a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Illston said she would grant the preliminary injunction requested by the unions, because the “chaotic nature of these RIFs has been continuing.”
“The continuing resolution, ending the longest shutdown the government has experienced to date, said that no federal funds would be spent RIF-ing people through Jan. 30. But that is not what is happening in some of these agencies,” Illston said.
The judge’s order will impact about 680 total federal employees: The nearly 250 Foreign Service officers, 200 employees at GSA, 150 at the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights and nearly 80 at SBA.
Illston agreed to the Justice Department’s request to delay her preliminary injunction from taking effect until Dec. 23, while the Trump administration considered whether to ask a higher court to stay her ruling. Illston said this would minimize some of the “whiplash” some federal employees have felt in other court cases, in which lower courts have reinstated them, only for an appeals court to allow layoffs to continue.
“They’d have to send a notice, and then another notice, and a notice saying, ‘Forget what we said yesterday.’ It would be terrible,” Illston said.
Brad Rosenberg, a DOJ attorney, said that rescinding layoffs now would be “logistically a big lift” for agencies, especially if the courts later allow those RIFs to proceed.

“If a RIF is rescinded, and if this court either decides at final judgment in this case, or if the government were to appeal, and an appellate court were to stay or vacate this Court’s preliminary injunction, government agencies would presumably have to start all over again with that, with that process, and it would be awfully hard to unscramble that egg,” Rosenberg said.
“That’s not going to provide the type of long-term relief that I suspect plaintiffs are seeking here,” he added.
Rosenberg argued that employees should bring their individual cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board. An appeals court recently allowed President Donald Trump to proceed with firing a Democratic member of the MSPB.
“This is merely the administration trying to carry out its policy objectives. And I realize that those policy objectives have consequences for individuals, and that they can be significant consequences, although we do think that those consequences can be remediated through proper channeling to the Merit Systems Protection Board,” he said.
Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the plaintiff unions, said the “mandate was clear” from Congress, and that agencies should “nullify those RIFs.”
“We have Congress stepping in here and being incredibly clear about what the public interest needs in this very circumstance, and the public interest is in restoring these employees to their employment status and giving them clarity,” Leonard said. “Congress could have just said, ‘Stop.’ Congress could have just said, ‘Halt, let’s just freeze everything.’ They went further than that.”
OPM advises agencies to consider reducing senior executive staffing

Leonard said recently separated federal employees face “real and ongoing harm,” including eviction notices and unpaid bills.
“We have seen agencies exploit their lack of communication to keep employees in the dark, to keep them confused. They have not even told them whether they’re still employed when they directly ask. There absolutely has been harm,” she said.
AFGE National President Everett Kelley called Illston’s ruling “another victory for federal employees and for the rule of law.”
“When Congress voted to end the longest government shutdown in history, it spoke clearly and unambiguously that further reductions-in-force were prohibited, and any RIFs that occurred during the shutdown were required to be reversed. The administration’s continued defiance of that mandate is part of a troubling pattern of egregious actions against federal employees and the American public,” Kelley said.
John Dinkelman, president of the American Foreign Service Association, said Congress was clear that “reductions in force were prohibited” when it passed the continuing resolution, and that the administration’s efforts to proceed with RIFs were “unlawful.”
“Today’s ruling confirms this,” Dinkelman said.  “We will continue to fight to ensure that Foreign Service professionals are treated with the respect the law demands.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-9.39.12-PM-1024x677.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 19:57:12.754991
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-19 00:37:31+00:00,Mississippi Today,"The number of vacancies among teachers is going up in Mississippi, new survey shows",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/18/k12-teacher-vacancies-increase/,"Mississippi had 6,907 vacancies among teachers, administrators and school support staff as of November — 1,747 more than last year.","Nearly 4,000 teaching positions remain unfilled in Mississippi, hundreds more than last year. 
The Mississippi Department of Education released results from the latest iteration of its annual teacher shortage and educator recruitment surveys Thursday at the state Board of Education’s last meeting of 2025. The surveys paint a sobering picture of the education sector in Mississippi, and validate what teachers have been ringing the alarm bell about for years — low pay is driving the state’s teacher shortage.
Responses from the state’s public schools show that, as of November, there were 6,907 vacancies among teachers, administrators and school support staff across the state. That’s 1,747 more than last year. 
The decrease is the biggest jump in recent years. Teachers received pay raises during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 school years and, subsequently, there were fewer vacancies during that period. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, licensure testing suspensions that made it easier for college students to become teachers likely contributed to fewer vacancies, the agency said in a news release. 
Teacher vacancies are concentrated in special education and elementary education, Courtney Van Cleve, executive director of the Office of Educator Continuum, told state board members. Together, the two categories account for half of all teacher vacancies in Mississippi.
“This does indeed remain one of our greatest areas of need,” she said.
Another area of concern, according to Van Cleve: teacher assistant vacancies. She said that pool is often where the agency looks for prospective teachers. 
A retention and recruitment survey, which the state Education Department released for the first time in conjunction with the educator shortage survey, provided insight into the reasons behind the vacancies. Teachers say a top reason is low pay. 
The National Education Association says Mississippi’s average teacher salary is $53,704, nearly $20,000 less than the national average. That average salary is also the lowest of all 50 states and third-lowest when adjusted for cost of living. 
Educators recently told Mississippi Today they have to take second jobs or forgo necessities to make ends meet financially, and State Auditor Shad White released a report this week drawing attention to the low salaries. 
In recent months, education researchers, teachers and administrators have called on state lawmakers to raise the teacher pay floor once again during the 2026 legislative session, which kicks off in January. 
“The pay has to go up if we’re going to entice people coming from other professions,” said Darein Spann, president of the Mississippi Association of Educators. “We’re going to need more base pay for those with families and those coming from more competitive industries.”
His statewide organization, which advocates on behalf of teachers, regularly contacts educators to poll them about their needs. Spann also hears from mayors and superintendents about obstacles they face in counteracting high teacher vacancies in their communities.
Vacancies increased the most in U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson’s 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses the Delta, the region with the largest population of Black people and low-income households in the state. While some districts offer financial stipends to bolster teacher pay, many Delta districts can’t afford to do the same. 
“The tax base is not as lucrative to support pay supplements that might entice new teachers,” Spann said. “This has been a problem in southwest Mississippi and the Delta for a while.”
Moving forward, the agency plans to address the growing crisis by continuing to loosen licensure standards, especially in crisis areas. 
In response to last year’s educator shortage survey results, the agency allowed college students studying education to start teaching elementary school classes on a provisional license while taking a free course to satisfy the Foundation of Reading test requirements. The state Education Department also removed its reading test requirement for prospective special education teachers with “mild to moderate students” or special education students who can be taught in general education classrooms. 
The education agency is reviewing its criteria for secondary mathematics education supplemental endorsements. 
Some educators have scrutinized those licensure decisions. Others, like Spann, say they’re necessary to recruit teachers. 
“I do think we need to open up more opportunities for people to become certified while we work on recruitment statewide,” he said. 
This year, the state Education Department rolled out a revamped teacher recruitment website aimed at making the pathway to teaching more accessible, and the Legislature put $3 million toward the state’s teacher residency program, which paid for tuition and expenses associated with teacher licensure for 201 additional students at nine Mississippi universities. 
Van Cleve said in an email that the state Education Department hopes to address regional shortages through the residency program and will continue to promote the recruitment website.

(Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)Kansas legislative leaders will meet Monday to take one of the final steps toward luring the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line, floating bonds worth hundreds of millions so the team can build a domed stadium and an entertainment district.
With a year-end deadline looming, the Legislative Coordinating Council will consider approving Sales Tax and Revenue Bond agreements with the Chiefs. Monday is the council’s last scheduled meeting of the year.
With the bonds’ approval, the Kansas City Chiefs could move closer to uprooting six decades of NFL history in Missouri and relocate to Kansas. The deal is said to call for placing the new stadium near the Legends, a regional shopping mall and commercial area in the Village West development in Kansas City, Kansas.
The council will not consider any deals with the Kansas City Royals on Monday.
Legislative and state leaders refused to offer specifics about the meeting and would say only that the Chiefs will be on the agenda. Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican running for governor, said he has worked diligently to explore the change to bring the Chiefs to Kansas without raising taxes.
“He remains fully committed to these efforts and will continue working tirelessly up to and through the upcoming Legislative Coordinating Council meeting to facilitate this exciting opportunity for Kansas,” said Megan Stookey, Masterson’s spokesperson.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, said she was told the council, which is composed of legislative leadership from both parties, would be talking about the Chiefs on Monday — but not the Royals.
“We will be talking about the Chiefs,” Sykes said. “It sounds like there is some proposal that we will be looking at.”
The Kansas Department of Commerce, which handles such deals, posted on Facebook that the state is in active discussions with the Chiefs about “building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas.”
“No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come,” the statement said. “We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”
The Kansas City Chiefs didn’t return an email seeking comment.
In an interview Tuesday, Gov. Laura Kelly declined to say whether the Chiefs or Royals were coming to Kansas.
“You really think I’m going to answer that question?” Kelly said.
Missouri Gov, Mike Kehoe said his team remains in frequent communication with the Royals and the Chiefs and wants to keep the teams in Missouri.
“He believes Missouri is the best home for both teams and continues working with the teams to make the right decision to grow and invest in the Show-Me State,” said his communications director, Gabby Picard.
Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas issued a statement Thursday saying the city doesn’t negotiate in public.
“As the city and our Missouri partners continue discussions with our long-term partners at the Chiefs and the Royals, we remain steadfast in working toward an arrangement in the best interest of our community and the greatest success of our teams on and off the field,” Lucas said.
After a ping-pong of public-financing proposals offered by the two states, the Chiefs face a decision on Kansas’ deal, which could cover up to 70% of the project through bonds. Missouri’s plan offered 50%.
Missouri hit a wall in its bid to keep the Chiefs after voters rejected a sales tax extension in April 2024, throwing in jeopardy a plan that would have helped fund a new $2 billion downtown ballpark for the Royals and $800 million in renovations to Arrowhead Stadium.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa state officials on Thursday announced events and initiatives set for 2026 throughout Iowa as the state participates in national America 250 celebrations.
In addition to participation in national efforts, Iowa’s America 250 Initiative co-chairs Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer and Agriculture Sec. Mike Naig said Iowa will be hosting several efforts throughout the next year that showcase the important role Iowa plays in the U.S. — especially in agriculture.
Thursday’s event in the Iowa Capitol’s rotunda was focused on unveiling Iowa’s plans for the upcoming year. The Iowa Young Patriots’ Club performed several songs at the event and a flag ceremony was conducted by the Civil Air Patrol Color Guard.
Each participating state is planning unique, signature events for the initiative — and Cournoyer said Iowa will be “leaning into our DNA” with an signature event called “America’s Harvest.”
“Throughout 2026 we’re going to lead the nation in celebrating how agriculture, gardening and horticulture have proven the very freedoms we enjoy as Americans,” Cournoyer said. “We’ll host webinars, share our agricultural journeys on social media, and then on about — stay tuned — Oct. 24 2026, we will gather for a massive harvest festival that celebrates Iowa’s integral role in feeding and fueling the world for 250 years.”
These are not the only events planned in 2026 to celebrate the nation’s founding. Cournoyer highlighted other efforts like the Masons of Iowa decorating graves of Revolutionary War soldiers in Iowa, planned tea events with actors playing George and Martha Washington, and a State Historical Society program to “renew the historic John Brown trail through southern Iowa.” More on planned events can be found on the state’s website for the America250 initiative.
“It’s a celebration of the Iowans who built this country and the Iowans who are leading it into the next 250 years,” Cournoyer said.
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said his office will also be hosting a “Ready, Set, Vote” initiative as part of the 250th anniversary celebration. Registering to vote is a way to celebrate the U.S. by connecting “Iowa’s rich history with our collective civic future, empowering Iowans to take action today for a stronger tomorrow,” he said.
“For the past 250 years, our nation has been at the forefront of civic engagement and the democratic process,” Pate said. “We remain committed to championing those values, and one of the most impactful ways to do that is by registering to vote. It’s the first step in making your voice heard at the ballot box and shaping the future of our representative government.”
Plans to celebrate the country’s 250th anniversary have been in the works for several years, with Iowa beginning to work with the federal America250 effort in 2023. Iowa has also played a role already in some celebrations, with President Donald Trump holding an event July 3 this year at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, where he discussed events planned throughout the country leading up to July 4, 2026.
Naig said while there are multiple events and efforts already launched, the state wanted to make sure America250 celebrations were open to all.
“This is hardly a top-down type of approach,” Naig siad. “I think maybe what I’m even most excited about is what will come up from across the state, opportunities for communities and organizations and schools and churches, businesses and families all across Iowa to take part in their own special and unique ways.”

(Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife)In a vote on Thursday afternoon, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that will delist the gray wolf from the endangered species list throughout the country.
H.R. 845, brought by Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and cosponsored by Montana Rep. Troy Downing, titled the “Pet and Livestock Protection Act,” directs the Secretary of the Interior to reissue a rule delisting the species.
“Montanans should be able to secure their herds, crops, and personal safety without fear of undue legal repercussions,” Downing said in a statement on Thursday. “As written, the ESA makes the gray wolf out to be a liability to avoid, not a resource to be protected. It is critical that we trust the science and look towards a more precise conservation approach when dealing with unique populations. I was proud to support this measure today and look forward to seeing it signed into law.”
Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, voted in favor of delisting the species. In a statement posted on X, Zinke wrote that “The ESA was created to protect endangered animals, not to be weaponized for a radical agenda by activist judges. The last four administrations have all agreed that the gray wolf has recovered. Let’s follow the science and Montana’s lead and delist.”
Conservation groups immediately decried the move, saying removing federal protections amounted to creating an open season on the species.
“Rep. Boebert’s bill is a deadly invitation to trophy hunt wolves to extinction,” Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “Stripping these amazing animals of protection while they’re still fighting to survive isn’t conservation, it’s cruelty. Wolves belong in the wild, not mounted on someone’s wall.”
Other groups, including the Human World Action Fund, said that the decision to delist an endangered species should not be made by Congress.
“The Endangered Species Act has worked for decades because decisions are made by scientists, not politicians,” Sara Amundson, president of Human World Action Fund, said in a statement. “Congress shouldn’t override expert agencies and the courts just to fast-track wolf hunts, and it certainly shouldn’t ignore how deeply Americans care about wolves. The Senate should stop this meritless bill dead in its tracks and keep in place the vital protections that are making wolf recovery possible.”
When gray wolves were initially delisted in Montana and the other western states in 2011, it was done through a similar provision.
Montana’s then-Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, placed a rider on a federal budget bill to remove ESA protections from wolves in the Rocky mountains. It also contained a provision that the courts could not intervene.
 Wolf whiplash

Gray wolves were almost entirely eliminated from the lower-48 states by the 1970s, leading to their listing under the Endangered Species Act.
In 2009, the species was delisted, an action that led to immediate litigation and paused the change in status. In 2011 Congressional action officially turned management of the species in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and the eastern thirds of Oregon and Washington over to the respective states.
Currently, gray wolves are listed as a threatened species in Minnesota and endangered in the remaining 44 states.
According to a 2022 report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which formed the basis for its later determination, there were approximately 2,797 wolves in the western U.S. — including roughly 1,000 wolves in both Montana and Idaho, fewer than 400 in Wyoming, and around 200 in Oregon and Washington. The federal agency estimated an additional 20 wolves are in California and Utah and two in Colorado.
In 2023, Colorado began relocating wolves to the state, with four established packs reported as of this summer.
Under the Trump administration in 2020, the Fish and Wildlife Service had decided to delist gray wolves in the states outside of the northern Rockies where they had been protected by the Endangered Species Act. But a federal judge in California reversed that decision in February 2022, which led the service to publish a rule in November to comply with the order.
Conservation groups filed a lawsuit last summer against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in an attempt to force the agency to reapply ESA protections to the species across the western portion of the country.
A federal judge in Missoula ruled in favor of the groups in August and found the federal government had erred in a determination that further protections were unwarranted.
Judge Donald Molloy said the federal government “made numerous unfounded assumptions regarding the future condition of the gray wolf despite recognizing either limitation on those conditions or bias in the population estimates utilized,” Molloy wrote. “Because these deficiencies are serious and pervasive, they weigh in favor of vacating the portion of the 2024 Finding that determined that the gray wolf in the Western United States does not meet the definition of an endangered or threatened species.”
Montana officials called the ruling a move by an “activist” judge favoring environmental extremists.
Subsequently, the federal government decided not to prepare a national gray wolf recovery plan, which led to more legal action by conservation organizations, led by the Center for Biological Diversity.
In the state, Montana’s own wolf hunting regulations are tied up in dueling lawsuits.
This year, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Fish and Wildlife Commission — the agency’s rule-making body — increased the quota of wolves to be killed during the 2025-26 hunting season.
A group of conservation organizations sued, saying the quota is too high and risks decimating the wolf population, while a group of outfitters and legislators also sued, saying the quota was too low and would not reduce the wolf population enough.
A hearing on the case was held in November, and a ruling is still pending.
According to a state Fish, Wildlife and Park’s dashboard, hunters and trappers have killed 82 wolves so far this season out of a statewide quota of 452. One hunting area, just outside of Yellowstone National Park, has closed after hunters and trappers reached its three-wolf quota.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A court case involving Greenpeace and the Dakota Access Pipeline developer went before the North Dakota Supreme Court on Thursday, with justices asked to stop a counter-suit pending in the Netherlands.
Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International is a defendant in an ongoing lawsuit in North Dakota district court, where Energy Transfer accuses it and two other Greenpeace entities of conspiring to use unlawful tactics to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from being built.
All three Greenpeace defendants deny the allegations and claim the case is a tactic to waste their time and money as punishment for opposing the pipeline.
This led Greenpeace International to counter-sue Energy Transfer in a Dutch court in February under a European Union directive that provides recourse to those targeted by frivolous lawsuits for exercising their free speech.
The overseas lawsuit also argues Energy Transfer harmed Greenpeace International by bringing a similar federal lawsuit against it in 2017, which was dismissed, and for defaming the environmental group.
Greenpeace International wants the Dutch court to order Energy Transfer to award it monetary damages. 
Energy Transfer this summer asked Southwest Judicial District Court Judge James Gion to suspend the Dutch lawsuit until the North Dakota case plays out, which Gion denied in September. Energy Transfer appealed the decision.
“Rather than take responsibility for its misconduct, Greenpeace ran to Amsterdam seeking ‘protection’ from this lawsuit,” Brad Hubbard, an attorney arguing for the pipeline developer, told the North Dakota Supreme Court on Thursday.

Gion found that the lawsuits are about fundamentally different legal claims, so he didn’t think it necessary to stop the foreign action.
Hubbard disputed Gion’s conclusion that the cases don’t overlap. He said the European Union directive is designed to undermine the authority of foreign courts.
“This court’s intervention is needed to block the wasteful litigation of the issues tried and decided by the jury,” he said.
Betsy Elsberry, an attorney representing Greenpeace International, said the overseas lawsuit is wholly separate from the case before Gion. 
Elsberry also argued that Gion acted within his discretion as district court judge when he denied Energy Transfer’s request.
“It is Judge Gion who listened to the North Dakota claims for three weeks,” she told the high court. “He determined that they are not the same as those being brought forth in the Dutch court.”
Greenpeace says North Dakota judge shouldn’t meddle with international free speech case

Jurisdiction was another recurring issue during the hearing.
Some of the justices asked why Greenpeace International filed the suit in the Netherlands as opposed to seeking relief by bringing counterclaims in North Dakota.
Elsberry said it would be improper to bring such claims in North Dakota since Greenpeace International is a Dutch organization, and Energy Transfer is headquartered in Texas. North Dakota courts wouldn’t have jurisdiction, she said.
Gion doesn’t have the authority to stop the Dutch case for similar reasons, Elsberry added. 
Chief Justice Jon Jensen said the North Dakota Supreme Court will take the matter under advisement. District court judges James Shockman and Stephanie Hayden sat on the court in place of Justices Douglas Bahr and Daniel Crothers, who recused.
Gion has yet to make a final decision on the outcome of the lawsuit.
A Morton County jury in March handed down a more than $660 million verdict against Greenpeace after a three-and-a-half week trial. Gion recently cut that sum by about half.
Energy Transfer said previously it planned to ask the North Dakota Supreme Court to reverse Gion’s revisions to the defamation and conspiracy awards.
Marco Simons, interim general counsel for Greenpeace’s USA affiliate, said once Gion enters a final judgment, they plan to ask for a new trial. If that request is unsuccessful, they will appeal.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed a movement led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which drew thousands of activists to protest in south-central North Dakota in 2016 and 2017.
The pipeline, often referred to as DAPL, carries crude oil from wells in northwest North Dakota to Illinois and has been in operation since 2017.

Josh Kimbrell says voters should not to count him out, even as a lawsuit from a former business partner has overshadowed his run for the South Carolina Governor’s Mansion.
Kimbrell, in a 21-minute Facebook video, called the months of legal drama that have dogged him since the start of his campaign “the roughest period of life since I’ve been on the planet.”
In an interview with the SC Daily Gazette, Kimbrell went on to blast his former associate, Frank Rogers, as a “raging narcissist” who had destroyed his business and left him forced to sell his home to pay his ongoing legal fees.
An attorney for Rogers did not respond to phone calls from the SC Daily Gazette Thursday.
The legal drama started two weeks after Kimbrell’s June gubernatorial launch. Rogers sued him, alleging the legislator had diverted more than $2 million out of their joint company and used the money for personal and campaign expenses.
Kimbrell denied the allegations and counter-sued for defamation.
Now, the Boiling Springs Republican is urging voters not to dismiss him in the five-way Republican primary, despite his low profile and nearly non-existent fundraising compared to other candidates.
“Anybody that’s writing me off as irrelevant does so at their peril,” he told the SC Daily Gazette.
Kimbrell highlighted his record of co-sponsoring anti-abortion and tax-cutting laws and said he’ll further prove himself to voters in the upcoming legislative session.
But what the former conservative Christian radio host is probably best known for are a pair of special budget rules: one threatening to pull state funding for public libraries unless they restrict children’s access to books deemed inappropriate and another yanking funds for any city with bans on so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ minors.
Exodus Aircraft
In addition to his radio career, Kimbrell founded Exodus Aircraft, a company that charters private flights, in 2017. Five years later, Rogers bought a half-stake in the company, according to his July lawsuit.
Kimbrell said he was in the process of selling the business when Rogers sued him. Rogers, in court filings, claims he wasn’t adequately informed of the sale plans.
Kimbrell told the SC Daily Gazette that he believed, after Rogers sued him, that Rogers would soon “destroy” the company and wanted to sever ties as soon as possible.
He agreed to resign and turn over all Exodus business records in anticipation of counter-suing.
In a dueling lawsuit, several Exodus investors sued alleging Rogers was fully aware of the impending sale and blew up the deal by orchestrating a “hostile takeover.”
About two weeks after Rogers filed suit, both he and Kimbrell signed on to an agreement saying that Kimbrell would resign from Exodus Aircraft and surrender all company assets and business records. Rogers’ lawyers have argued in recent filings that Kimbrell has not abided by terms of that agreement. They alleged Kimbrell has contacted former Exodus employees and investors and has not turned over all business records Rogers’ lawyers requested.
Meanwhile, the legal mess continues to grow as Rogers and Kimbrell each seek to drag more people and businesses into the fray. A judge will hear arguments about potential new parties in the suit Friday.
According to recent quarterly fundraising reports, Kimbrell has raised $23,000 for his run for governor. Three of his Republican competitors have raised over a million dollars; the fourth has raised over $800,000.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-18 23:52:21+00:00,CT Mirror,Capital Prep sues over CT charter school funding process,Laura Tillman and Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/18/capital-prep-sues-over-ct-charter-school-funding-process/,The lawsuit asks a New Britain judge to decide whether the power to fund such schools lies with the state Board of Education or not.,"Capital Preparatory Charter School announced on Thursday a lawsuit that seeks to reverse an October ruling by the Connecticut Board of Education in which the board claimed it was not responsible for determining which charter schools receive state funding. The state legislature allocates charter school funding, but the lawsuit contends that the decision of which schools get funded should lie with the state Board of Education.
The board’s ruling, and the subsequent failure of the legislature to allocate funds to the previously approved school, has left Capital Preparatory’s plans to open a school in Middletown in the lurch.
In the lawsuit, the school asks a New Britain judge to decide whether the power to fund such schools lies with the state Board of Education or not. 
At an impassioned press conference in the Cross Street AME Zion Church in Middletown, representatives of Capital Preparatory Schools said they were compelled to file the lawsuit after many previous attempts to resolve the issue with members of the legislature, the state Board of Education and Gov. Ned Lamont.
“We hope this lawsuit will expose flaws in the current funding and selection process,” said Michele Clay, the co-chair of the Capital Preparatory School planning committee. Clay said that “when transparency is replaced with backroom decisions,”  the system of allocating funding becomes a barrier for school success. “This is a systemic issue and it deserves a systemic solution.”
In March 2023, the state Board of Education voted to grant an initial certificate of approval for Capital Preparatory Schools to open a charter school in Middletown. In doing so, it overrode the recommendations of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker, who wanted to give community members more time to submit comments to the board. But the school ultimately has never received funding.
The group then appealed directly to Gov. Ned Lamont and were met with what they described as a “stern” response from his office. That response, from Natalie Braswell, an attorney for Lamont, states that Capital Preparatory’s allegation that the state Board of Education acted unlawfully in its failure to fund the school is “both baseless and concerning, as it misrepresents the SDE’s legal authority and the legislative process that governs charter school funding,” according to a copy of the document reviewed by The Connecticut Mirror.
Responding to a request for comment, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont said his office cannot comment on ongoing litigation. A spokesperson for the State Department of Education declined to comment for the same reason. 
At the press conference, supporters of the school also named Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Middletown, Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, and Sen. Jan Hochadel, D-Meriden, as key figures that undermined the funding of the school. Looney, Hochadel and Lesser did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“What they’re trying to argue is that one state legislator has a one person vote. So, Matt Lesser did speak to Marty Looney with Jan Hochadel, and they said, ‘take Middletown out of the budget,'” Steve Perry, founder of Capital Preparatory Charter School, told the CT Mirror. “Even if they said that, they don’t have the authority to do it.”
Years ago, a charter school only needed approval from the state Board of Education to begin the process of opening. 
But in 2015, the legislature changed the law to require lawmakers to approve the school’s funding. Earlier this year, Capital Preparatory asked the state Board of Education to specify which body is responsible for funding specific charter schools. 
In that petition, Capital Preparatory argued that it should be up to the Board of Education to decide which schools receive the funds. Representatives of the proposed school have repeatedly argued that because Capital Preparatory Middletown’s application for initial approval was awarded the highest score of any the board approved that year, it should be funded first. That did not happen.
Other charter schools have also faced opposition in Connecticut, like an effort to open a charter school in Danbury. There, Danbury lawmakers urged fellow legislators not to fund the school.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6757-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

Julie Fedorchak for North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat.
In his campaign announcement, Balazs pledged to hold regular, in-person town halls and advocate for citizen-led service, veterans, fiscal discipline, border security and America First priorities.
Balazs, of Cando, received the endorsement of North Dakota Republicans for the open U.S. House seat during the 2024 state convention in Fargo. However, the support came after Fedorchak withdrew her name from consideration. 
Balazs finished fourth out of five candidates during the 2024 primary election for North Dakota’s at-large U.S. House seat with 4% of the statewide vote. Fedorchak won the primary with 46% voter support.
Fedorchak went on to defeat Democratic-NPL Party candidate Trygve Hammer during the 2024 general election with 69% voter support.
Balazs served in three different military branches across 25 years of service. He also served as a project manager for the State Department at different locations around the globe.
While aligned with the Republican platform, Balazs said he will remain an independent thinker on representing North Dakota.
“My background in national security and fiscal responsibility has prepared me to tackle these challenges with clarity and resolve,” he said.
Rep. Julie Fedorchak
Kate Roberts, spokeswoman for Julie Fedorchak for Congress, said Fedorchak received President Donald Trump’s endorsement for reelection in August. 
“She understands North Dakota and delivers results,” Roberts said in a text message. “She enjoys wide support and looks forward to a successful reelection campaign.”
A formal reelection announcement for Fedorchak is expected at a later date.
Candidates must file signature petitions or endorsement documents with the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office by April 6 to be considered for the 2026 primary election on June 9. The 2026 general election will be Nov. 3.

Bob Ferguson is asking lawmakers to fund $244 million in additional housing investments as part of a budget proposal released Thursday.
His plan comes as the state grapples with an ongoing shortage of affordable housing, and after lawmakers have already pumped hundreds of millions of dollars toward the state’s main housing account over the past few years. Some of the funding Ferguson is proposing would go to help people whose homes were damaged in record flooding over the past two weeks.
Almost all of the money would be from the state’s capital budget, which is healthier than the cash-strapped operating budget. 
The governor also signed an executive order to get the ball rolling on establishing a new cabinet-level Department of Housing. 
“I’m enormously gratified to stand here today and be able to make the following statement: We have a housing governor,” Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, who has advised Ferguson on housing issues, said during a press conference at an affordable housing complex in south Seattle.
Of that $244 million, $50 million is for housing preservation, including to repair flood-damaged homes, Ferguson said. Another $5 million will go specifically to a grant program to help low-income homeowners with flood-related repairs.  
Ferguson said he would work with lawmakers early in the legislative session that begins next month to open up that money quickly. The governor called the funding a “down payment” as the state determines the scope of the flood damage. It’ll also serve as a bridge as the state works to get disaster aid from the federal government in the aftermath. 
“When you ask for disaster relief, the state is saying we can’t handle the scope of the damage that’s being caused,” Ferguson said. “But we’re working to make sure we do everything we can in the short term to help folks out, to make sure we get support during this really critical time.”
Ferguson’s housing proposals are in response to an estimated million-home shortfall the state faces over the next two decades. It’s estimated that half of those homes need to be affordable to those making less than half of the median income. 
The sum Ferguson is proposing builds upon $760 million in spending on affordable housing that lawmakers authorized in Washington’s construction budget this year. Of that, $605 million is directed to the Housing Trust Fund. That’s up from $527 million shoveled into the fund in the previous two-year budget. 
The details
Most of the additional $244 million Ferguson is calling for would go toward the Housing Trust Fund. 
It includes $81 million to develop nearly 2,000 new affordable housing units, he said. Another $73 million to build over 600 units for first-time homebuyers, and $20 million would go to acquire and preserve mobile and manufactured home communities.
There is also $6 million to speed up development by “modernizing permitting systems.”
The proposed spending would largely come from state bonds. A small amount is included in the operating budget proposal and some money from carbon auction proceeds under the state’s Climate Commitment Act, said Ferguson’s budget director, K.D. Chapman-See. 
“We feel very confident that we have absolutely maximized every dollar that is possibly available in our budget to go to housing,” Ferguson said. 
Ferguson described the funding ask as potentially the biggest housing investment in a supplemental budget in the state’s history. 
Legislators will also look at more policy solutions to get and keep people housed. 
This year, they passed legislation to push more housing development around transit stops, increase condo development, cap residential rent increases, ease parking requirements that serve as an impediment to construction and allow for more lot splitting.
Ferguson is partnering with Sen. Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, on a housing bill this next session. The legislation would require cities and counties to permit residential and mixed-use development in commercial zones. The Democratic governor said he’ll also be supporting other housing legislation next year.

Denny Heck and Housing Development Consortium Executive Director Patience Malaba on Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)
“There are tens of thousands of parcels where housing is prohibited and where real barriers exist that make development infeasible,” Alvarado said. “Think about it, vacant strip malls or big box stores that are boarded up or empty parking lots, and now imagine the transformation of those places into homes. What a better future for our communities.” 
Former Gov. Christine Gregoire has been a vocal supporter of the proposed legislation. 
Other housing policy priorities next year include barring jurisdictions from denying permits for permanent supportive housing, transitional housing or indoor emergency housing or shelter in certain residential and commercial zones and limiting corporate homeownership, Alvarado said. 
The state faces new housing challenges this year, as the Trump administration looks to shift federal funding away from permanent supportive housing. Washington and other states are suing over the move. A hearing in the case is set for Friday in federal court in Rhode Island.
Even with this recent development, housing has always been a top priority for Ferguson as governor, he said. 
“I’m not sure I needed any extra motivation,” he said. 
Ferguson’s executive order on the new Department of Housing creates a task force to develop it. The task force is required to file a report by Nov. 15, 2026, with recommendations for the agency that lawmakers can consider in the 2027 legislative session.
The governor will release his proposals focused on supplemental funding for the transportation and operating budgets before Tuesday, the statutory deadline.

The Burlington School District has reached a $475,000 settlement with a former female athletic director who accused the district of gender-based wage discrimination.
Jeanne Hulsen, who worked at Burlington High School for 22 years, told VTDigger in a telephone interview that she filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in 2020 after the school district redefined the athletic director position and hired a younger and less experienced man at a starting salary that dwarfed hers by more than $30,000.
After years of what felt like going through life with a wet blanket draped over, Hulsen, 65, of South Burlington, said the settlement brings validation and closure.
“There’s this sense of freedom now that it’s over,” she said. 
According to the settlement, the lawsuit is dismissed with prejudice, and the school district will pay Hulsen $295,000 “in compensation for lost wages” and her lawyer $180,000 for legal costs.

John Franco, who represented Hulsen in the case, said they were scheduled to go to trial on Dec. 1. But both sides opted for mediation, which led to the settlement agreement dated Nov. 12.
While exhaustion was a factor in that decision, Franco said he found the case to be particularly egregious. 
“Jeanne was by far the most exploited employee based upon gender wage discrimination that I’ve ever come across,” he said. “She got a fraction of what her damages were.” 
She was originally seeking damages to the tune of almost $2 million, Franco said.
The district was prepared to go to trial, but the insurance carrier, which has ultimate settlement authority, made the decision to settle to avoid the cost of a trial, according to Russ Elek, spokesperson for the Burlington School District. The funds will be paid via insurance and the district will only pay the $5,000 deductible and any applicable payroll taxes, he added.
The settlement agreement “represents a compromise to avoid litigation” and further states that neither party “makes any admission concerning the strength or weakness of any claim or admits any liability therefore.”
The complaint came a year after the Burlington High School girls’ soccer team’s calls for gender pay equality went viral, receiving national attention.
At the time, Hulsen said, she was proud of their activism. But she said “it was very perplexing” given that she was “a prime example of that situation right in their backyard.”
It was also a time when she was among a very small number of athletic directors statewide who were women. She wasn’t a part of a union and received annual raises “almost without any discussion” or opportunity to negotiate. The amount was “typically lesser” than what people in bargaining units could secure, according to the lawsuit. Plus, the job grew immensely over those years, but the salary did not keep pace, she said.
“BSD provided significant support to the amazing student athletes involved in the Equal Pay movement, and we remain in full support of the cause,” Elek said in an email. “The vast majority of BSD wages are negotiated through bargaining units, a practice that has not changed since litigation began. Other wages are influenced by research, including regional comparisons. If we identify a pay discrepancy, we correct it as promptly as possible.”
In the civil complaint filed November 2020, Hulsen alleged that the Burlington School District violated the federal Equal Pay Act and the equal pay provisions of the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act, and sought “appropriate relief, including back pay, liquidated damages, prejudgment interest, plus attorney’s fees, and litigation costs.”
Hulsen worked in the school district for a starting salary of $30,000 in 1998 and said she drew $70,000 when she left in 2020. After 22 years, her position was redefined, and she was not rehired. The district instead hired a younger man with two years of work experience at a starting salary of $87,405.50 in August 2020, the complaint stated. 
“Even adjusting Ms. Hulsen’s starting salary for inflation, Burlington School District paid her male successor a starting salary which was almost $39,700 higher in 2020 dollars,” the complaint stated.

The decision dropped all three major investor-owned power companies’ returns by 0.3%, bringing the shareholder return for Pacific Gas & Electric to just below double digits for the first time in at least two decades. A decision proposed last month would have imposed a slightly larger profit cut of 0.35%.
All of the utilities asked for a return of more than 10%. The decision is unlikely to significantly impact customer bills, which remain the second-highest in the nation after Hawaii.
Darcie Houck was the only “no” vote on the California Public Utilities Commission, saying the decision did not properly take into account the cost to ratepayers. 
“Every economic indicator tells us that we’re living in a time of extreme precarity for working Californians,” she said. “I do not think the decision threads the needle sufficiently to consider the full impact to the customer interest.”
Utilities say that a high potential rate of return for shareholders is important to bring in needed funding for infrastructure projects, which are typically paid for up front by investors and bonds and later reimbursed by ratepayers once regulators approve costs. This return is considered compensation for the risk of doing business.
The returns are not listed specifically on customers’ bills, instead baked into the rate customers pay.
The decision set 2026 potential shareholder returns for PG&E at 9.98%, Edison at 10.03%, and San Diego Gas & Electric at 9.93%. These returns are not guaranteed and can be affected by a utility’s financial performance throughout the year, going down if a utility has cost overruns. Historically, only San Diego Gas & Electric achieves its full shareholder return, while PG&E and Edison typically fall short of the full amount.
The three utilities’ approved returns have hovered around 10% for decades, which is also the national average for utility shareholder returns, often going above that. Academics and ratepayer advocates have argued for years that this is a problem because a higher return rate is meant to compensate for risk, but utilities are a historically low-risk industry. Their rates are set by regulators and their income is largely predictable and effectively guaranteed by ratepayers, who will continue needing services like electricity. U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, which are considered the baseline for a risk-free investment, are about half of the utilities’ approved rate. Utilities regularly push back on this point, saying that wildfires in particular have made their industry more risky.
Utilities criticized the proposed drop in shareholder rates, saying it would exacerbate already high bills for ratepayers. The California Public Advocates Office, which advocates for ratepayers before the commission, pushed back on this, saying that claim is “entirely without merit.”
“The evidentiary record shows the [utilities’] claims for increasing their respective [returns] are based on flawed methods and would inevitably result in unreasonably high customer rates,” it said in a December response to utilities’ comments.
The utilities said the decision isn’t an accurate reflection of the risks their industry faces in the state.
“We think the reduction from current ROEs doesn’t reflect the unique risk environment facing California IOUs and their investors,” David Eisenhauer, spokesperson for Edison, said.
Similarly, PG&E was “disappointed that the final decision fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems,” Mike Gazda, PG&E spokesperson, said. “We will keep working with regulators and state leaders to ensure adequate funding needs and reasonable long-term rates for customers, so we can continue stabilizing our energy prices and funding critical energy system improvements for customers.”
Anthony Wagner, spokesperson for SDG&E, did not address the regulators’ decision directly, saying the company is “working every day to manage our costs responsibly while continuing to provide the essential service our communities depend on – offering tools and resources to ensure every customer has access to the support they need.”
The shareholder profits are a percentage of a utility’s “rate base” – the total value of its assets that it can earn a return on. This includes things such as power plants. While a utility’s approved shareholder returns fluctuate, the rate bases for California’s three utilities steadily rise. Each utility’s rate base is billions of dollars, earning hundreds of millions for shareholders even if a utility doesn’t reach its full shareholder return.
In 2023, for example, Edison had a rate base of $29.7 billion, and it was allowed to earn $198 million for shareholders that year. If its approved return was one percentage point lower, it would still have been allowed to earn $178 million for shareholders. Though it came in far short of this that year, it still brought shareholders $91 million from ratepayers.
In Houck’s dissent, she noted that the rate bases for the utilities, including Edison’s natural gas arm, are expected to go up by about 10% each year, with the combined authorized potential returns approaching $1 billion more than 2025. Her analysis for this included Edison’s natural gas arm, SoCalGas.
Houck recommended that regulators revisit this issue annually instead of every three years. California ratepayers are facing an affordability crisis for power bills because of factors such as wildfire recovery and hardening. Shareholder profits, which impact bills, have also risen in recent years because of utilities’ growing rate bases.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092022-Power-Lines-RL-CM-24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A coalition of New Mexico environmental advocacy groups this week endorsed $218 million in funding requests that would bolster water conservation and restoration projects. Lawmakers are expected to tackle these projects as they craft the state’s budget in January’s legislative session.
Projects in the group’s list range from relatively small — $1.5 million to upgrade an IT system in the Office of the State Engineer — to large — $50 million to meet the terms of the settlement agreement in a yearslong legal battle over Rio Grande water between Texas and New Mexico.
Many of the projects aim at giving New Mexico’s waterways preventative care to reduce the amount of costly disaster relief that’s often needed after wildfires give way to floods, advocates said.
“It is cheaper to invest before the big fire, before the big flood,” Dan Roper, New Mexico lead for Trout Unlimited, said during a news conference Wednesday that included representatives from nonprofit groups including Trout Unlimited, the New Mexico Acequia Association, New Mexico Wild and Western Resource Advocates. “We are getting fewer and fewer drops of water these days…these projects keep water, whether it falls as snow or monsoon rains, on the landscape longer. In doing that, we make sure that water is available downstream when it’s needed for things like irrigation and agriculture.” 
Roper and his colleagues also back a proposed law, known as the Land Grant-Merced and Acequia Infrastructure Act, which would create funds that support infrastructure and disaster recovery in rural and historic communities.
Together, representatives from the four advocacy organizations highlighted nearly a dozen budget requests from state agencies as the projects they see as most urgent for New Mexico’s environment. 
New Mexico Environment Department
Advocates expressed support for a $50 million request that would aid the department’s River Stewardship Program, which funds projects that address poor water quality in the state’s rivers. The funding is critical for waterways damaged by recent wildfires, such as those near the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon burn scar and those in Ruidoso, advocates said.
They praised a $25 million ask for the department’s Neglected and Contaminated Site Fund, which would consider hundreds of contaminated or threatened groundwater sources across the state.
They also endorsed $3.5 million for the department’s Surface Water Permitting Program, which state leaders created in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA ruling. The decision removed protections from about half of the nation’s wetlands. 
New Mexico Office of the State Engineer
Environmental advocates said they want to see a $1 million appropriation for the Office of the State Engineer to develop tools and strategies to navigate interstate water agreements and mitigate the effects of long-term drought.
They also backed a request of $1.5 million to upgrade the office’s dated IT system. The Water Administration Technical Engineering Resource System, known as WATERS, database is the “backbone” for state officials who deal with rights, permitting and other legal issues regarding water. However, advocates said it’s been in need of an update for nearly 30 years and cannot perform basic functions, like digitizing existing records.
Interstate Stream Commission
Advocates backed a $10 million request for the Interstate Stream Commission’s infrastructure fund to pay for acequia and community ditch needs and disaster recovery.
They recommended $5 million for the commission’s regional water planning efforts, which stems from the 2023 Water Security Planning Act. The funding would pay for regional planning councils and public education initiatives, such as Main Stream New Mexico.
They highlighted a $15 million appropriation for the state’s Strategic Water Reserve, which allows people to sell or lease their water rights to the Interstate Stream Commission for various purposes, including pumping water underground and supporting endangered species. The money would go to a fund, which Senate Bill 37 created earlier this year, and give the Strategic Water Reserve a consistent lifeline.
The group also called out a $50 million request to help the Interstate Stream Commission meet the settlement terms of a lengthy legal dispute over Rio Grande water between Texas and New Mexico. The settlement requires “significant” groundwater purchases, advocates said, to reduce depletions on the Rio Grande.
The group championed a potential appropriation of $35 million for the Indian Water Rights Settlement Fund, which will help to pay for resolving Indigenous water rights claims.
New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources
Climate advocates said they want to see lawmakers appropriate $22 million for ongoing aquifer mapping and monitoring in the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. These mapping projects are meant to give state leaders a clear picture of the quantity and quality of groundwater resources across the state.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0549-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

The Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees, which oversees the state’s public universities, voted Thursday to waive part of a policy that would prevent an interim president from applying for the permanent position at the institution they lead, according to a news release from IHL.
The waiver only applies to the current JSU president search, and the vote was unanimous, said John Sewell, IHL’s communications director. 
Without the waiver, if Jones Gregory wanted to apply for the permanent role as president, she would first have to step down from the interim position. 
The vote reflects feedback the board received from JSU alumni and some students this summer questioning the fairness of the search process and criticizing the approach for a repeated lack of transparency. At a July meeting, some JSU stakeholders asked if Jones Gregory would get a fair shot at the permanent role. 
Jones Gregory, a JSU alumna, was the university’s provost and vice president of academic affairs before stepping into the interim leadership role. 
In a statement released in May after her appointment as a temporary leader, Jones Gregory expressed her appreciation for the chance to lead the university. 
“It has been my privilege to serve Jackson State as provost, and I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to continue serving my alma mater in this new role,” she said. “My commitment is to uphold the standard of excellence that defines Jackson State in every area of university life.
“As a proud graduate of JSU, I know what this university means to the people it serves because it has shaped every part of my life. This legacy grounds me and guides me.”
Jones Gregory could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. 
The Thursday vote was not the first time the IHL board temporarily waived its policy related to interim presidents applying for the permanent position. 
In 2023, the IHL board voted 7-5 to allow Elayne Hayes Anthony, who was the temporary acting president, to apply for the permanent role. Dr. Steven Cunningham, the only Jackson State alumnus on the board and the trustee leading that university’s presidential search, voted no. He said he didn’t want to dissuade outside candidates from applying for the role. After conducting an international search and interviewing 79 applicants, the board hired Marcus Thompson. 
The top role at Jackson State has been vacant since May, when Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure.
Jackson State’s next president will be its fourth since 2020, when then-President William Bynum, who was appointed in 2017, left after his arrest on multiple charges including possessing marijuana, giving a “false statement of identity” and “procuring the services of prostitute.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/21134934/Institute-of-Higher-Learning-Board-Meeting-2.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem trends — which include another high mortality year — are not a cause for concern, federal and state grizzly bear managers say. 
The post Yellowstone grizzly range contracts by 4%, while ‘Northern Continental Divide’ bears gain 12% more ground appeared first on WyoFile .","The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population continues to stagnate geographically, a relatively new trend that wildlife managers say is related to bears saturating “suitable habitat” where the species is tolerated. 
That finding is described in a new and first-ever rangewide report summarizing where grizzly bears are found in the Lower 48. 
Overall, grizzlies, which are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, continued their decades-long recovery and reoccupied 4% more habitat over the past two years. That equates to a rangewide expansion of roughly 2,250 square miles, or an area about two-thirds the size of Yellowstone National Park.  
Grizzly bears occupy an estimated 59,000 square miles of habitat throughout all their recovery zones in the Lower 48. (Cecily Costello)
But bruins that dwell in the tri-state Yellowstone area were the exception. The estimated 1,050 grizzlies there occupied about 3.5% less ground, or about 963 fewer square miles, than they did two years ago. The report does not address what drove the change, but lead author and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks research biologist Cecily Costello said it’s likely related to grizzlies running out of ideal habitat in the modern West.
“When you look at the habitat to the east of the Yellowstone Ecosystem, to the south of Yellowstone, you’re looking at a lot of open prairie,” Costello said. “There’s not really big river valleys those bears could move into. There’s a little bit of a limitation in terms of the range expansion in those directions.” 
Wyoming grizzly managers see it similarly, attributing the slight retreat to bears losing spaces where they can live without getting into trouble. 
“I think it’s just indicative of where the population is,” said Dan Thompson, large carnivore supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I don’t think we should expect it to expand.” 
The occupied grizzly bear range in the Yellowstone region is retreating slightly and encompasses an estimated 26,100 square miles, nearly two thirds of which is located in Wyoming. (Cecily Costello)
Matt Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s new leader, agreed. His predecessor, Frank van Manen, predicted about a decade ago that the grizzly population in the Yellowstone region would soon stabilize — and now it seems to be doing just that. 
“Occupied range has kind of waned up, and now it’s kind of slightly decreasing,” Gould said. “It’ll be interesting to see: ‘Does it drastically drop, or is it going to stay steady and bounce around?’” 
Stopped expanding
Biologists first documented the end of a half-century-long era of grizzly range expansion in the Yellowstone area two years ago. At the time, federal scientists observed a 0.5% reduction in the species’ overall distribution — a retreat of 142 square miles. 
The mapping Costello and her co-authors just completed examined the period from 2010 to 2024. Distribution in the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystem is based on hard data — from tracked bears, conflicts and other verified observations — over a 15-year rolling window. 
The data is smoothed out based on the whereabouts of all grizzlies known to exist in any given area. For that reason, bears that make “outlier” movements, like the subadult male that reachedthe Bighorns in 2024, don’t usually influence the distribution maps.
Contraction in the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s occupied range comes at a time when there has been a record number of bears dying, though grizzly biologists say they don’t necessarily see the two trends as being related.

Mortality hit a high in 2024, with 72 known grizzlies that died that calendar year, Gould said. The death toll this year is almost the same, at 71, which is about 35% greater than the 10-year average of 54 mortalities. 
The leading causes of death, according to Gould, were livestock conflict (21 grizzlies killed as a result), followed by “site conflicts with humans” (16 grizzlies), self-defense killings (12 grizzlies), accidental deaths (nine grizzlies) and natural causes like predation (six grizzlies). 
This year, three in four Yellowstone-area grizzly deaths were within a zone in the core of the ecosystem known as the “demographic monitoring area.” That’s a slightly higher rate than average. 
Where habitat’s retreating
Wildlife managers count bears in the demographic monitoring area. This area was declared fully occupied by bears in 2019. 
In Costello’s distribution report, this “core” area represented 71% of where grizzlies were found in 2024. The other 29% of the occupied range fell outside of this core area on the fringes of the mountainous, public land-dominated ecosystem. This is where grizzly range has been retreating. When Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly distribution reached its peak in 2021, more than 40% of occupied range was mapped outside the core zone.
Last year, the largest contraction in occupied Yellowstone habitat was located in eastern Idaho in the Big Hole Mountains and Snake River Range. Another recession appears in Montana’s Ruby Range, maps from the report show, and there’s a small loss of occupied range in the South Pass area off the tip of the Wyoming River Range. 
Costello, who compiled the maps, said she doesn’t put a “whole lot of stock” into small regional changes.
“The edges are a little bit uncertain,” she said, “because you have less [grizzly data] about the edges than you do about the middle.”
The other major population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48 dwell in Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Occupied grizzly range stretched by 2,500 square miles, a nearly 12% increase. These bears mostly pressed into new habitat on the eastern and southern sides of the ecosystem, gaining ground in the Sapphire Range, and Boulder and Big Belt Mountains, maps show.
There are more than 24,000 square miles of occupied grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, a 12% increase from an assessment two years ago. (Cecily Costello)
The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem’s occupied range encompasses much more open prairie than to the south in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
Partly, that’s explained by Montana grizzlies moving down big river corridors, Costello said. When a bunch of them make the movement, the occupied range line can “pull out really quickly.” Smoothing of the data can then make it look like they’ve reoccupied big chunks of open country, she said.
Habitat is another explanation for why western Montana occupied grizzly range keeps stretching while Yellowstone-area bears have held steady and retreated in places.   
“When you look at the plant communities and mountains that exist in western Montana, there’s still a lot of what could be considered decent bear habitat,” Costello said. “It’s the expectation that we’ll probably continue to see bears moving into those habitats.” 
A lot of that growth is expected to take grizzly populations toward Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem, which has been unoccupied since the species was wiped out there in the 1950s.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Reductions to a child care subsidy program will remain in place for now despite a lawsuit from an advocacy group challenging the legality, an Oklahoma County judge said. 
Judge Natalie Mai, at a hearing Thursday, declined to order the Oklahoma Department of Human Services to fully restore a pandemic-era child care subsidy program and said there was a lack of evidence to issue a temporary restraining order. Litigation will continue. 
The Licensed Child Care Association of Oklahoma sued the Oklahoma Department of Human Services after the agency notified providers over email in October that a $5 per child, per day subsidy for school-age children would be paused because federal relief funding had been exhausted and DHS could no longer afford to continue the full program.
The group sought an emergency injunction that would require the agency to continue to pay the subsidies and alleges the state agency failed to follow proper rule-making procedure, as outlined in state statute, when announcing the change.
New applications and renewals for child care subsidies are also paused and the “$5 per day COVID-era add-on incentive for school-age children” ended Nov. 1 because of funding lost during the federal government shutdown, according to the agency’s website. Subsidies are unaffected for children in foster care, adoptions, children with disabilities who are approved for a special needs rate and the unhoused population.
Andrew Bowman, an attorney representing DHS, said the subsidy changes are “absolutely” a budget issue and are “paused,” not ended. For the full program to resume, the agency will need further funding from the Oklahoma Legislature and is awaiting federal guidance, he said. 
“We understand that this is a difficult issue,” Bowman said. “We share in the frustrations about the lack of funding, but at the end of the day that’s what this is, a funding decision, and we’re doing what we can to focus our efforts on the families and children who are in the most need in this regard.”
Eve Spaulding, an attorney representing the child care advocacy group, said Thursday was only an emergency hearing so there will still be a future day in court.
“We will obviously continue moving forward, because this is not a simple matter,” she said. “This affects many. It affects all the families that receive subsidy here in the state, and it affects the child care facilities. Unfortunately, they are closing. I’ve gotten notice this week that multiple have already had to shut their doors.”
Shane Williams, a child care provider in Guymon, said about 80% of the children they care for are subsidized, with about 60% who are “school aged.”
With the current subsidy structure, Williams said his child care facility can last however long they want to “borrow money to keep operating.”
“So what happens then is we are basically personally subsidizing child care in our town, and we can’t do that,” he said. 
The agency is requesting $70 million in funding from the Oklahoma Legislature in an effort to “stabilize” the child care industry and “prevent future funding cliffs,” according to a news release.
This request will be “too late” to help child care providers who are closing now, Williams said. 
“When there’s not any discussion about these kinds of things … then I feel like we’re not being told the truth about what’s going on,” he said. “For child care for rural Oklahoma, this is going to be extremely detrimental. There aren’t other options like you have in a metropolitan area.”

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens defeated the Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns, 20-13, in the 68 Ventures Bowl, December 17, in Mobile, Alabama.
 
Louisiana quarterback Lunch Winfield gathered his team to the line of scrimmage in a hurry as time ticked down late in the fourth quarter. Delaware defensive end Noah Matthews tackled Winfield in bounds the play before, causing the scramble to the line. With no timeouts to stop the clock, Winfield managed to get everyone set. He spiked the ball with two seconds remaining in the game, setting up one final chance to tie or win the game from the UD seven yard line.
Following a timeout from the Delaware sideline, Winfield and the Louisiana offense lined up in the shotgun with three receivers near the right sideline, a running back to the quarterbacks right and a single receiver out to the left. Winfield received the snap and threw toward the middle of the endzone hoping to connect with fellow redshirt sophomore Caden Jensen running an in-breaking route from the three receiver set. Instead, the ball ricocheted off the tight end’s right forearm as Delaware safety KT Seay flew in to make the tackle, ensuring the ball would hit the ground and UD would leave Alabama with a winning season.  
The Blue Hens became the second school in FBS history to win a bowl game in their first season of FBS football after defeating the Ragin’ Cajuns, 20-13, Wednesday night, in the 68 Ventures Bowl.  
UD’s win in its first FBS postseason action brings its final record to 7-6 ending the program’s historic season with success. Head coach Ryan Carty donned a celebratory beaded necklace while celebrating the victory along with his team after the defense made the final play. Quarterback Nick Minicucci was the first person off the bench running to celebrate with the defense.
Minicucci was one of four Blue Hen players to win an award from the game. Minicucci took home the offensive MVP trophy. Nate Evans won the defensive MVP award and Nate Reed won the special teams MVP. Senior running back Jo Silver received the biggest honor, being named the game MVP.
Silver’s MVP award was well deserved after he finished the game with 116 rushing yards on only 14 carries and a touchdown that provided the spark for Delaware’s offense in the first quarter. 
The touchdown came late in the first frame in a game that neither offense could get much going in the first half. Louisiana was able to get down the field, but were stopped twice in the red zone. The first stop resulted in a missed field goal and the second was the first of three turnovers for the Ragin’ Cajuns on a Evans’ interception in the endzone. 
The Blue Hens started at their own 20-yard line following the turnover and ran four plays getting them to their own 39. On the fifth play, Minicucci handed the ball off to Silver, sending the New Jersey product streaking up the middle of the offensive line. Silver was barely touched, breaking through the first two levels of the defense and once he found open space there was no stopping him en route to a 61 yard score — the third longest run in the bowl game’s history.
Silver’s was the only touchdown scored in the first half. Louisiana knocked in a field goal on its first possession in the second quarter and Reed kicked one in for Delaware, giving the Blue Hens a seven point advantage at halftime. 
Silver and the run game provided the spark for Delaware’s offense which throughout the season routinely relied on the passing game to supply the majority of the production. The Blue Hens finished the regular season as Conference USA’s leading passing attack, but ranked ninth in rushing offense. On Wednesday, the rushing attack fell just 18 yards shy of matching the passing game’s yardage. 
The Blue Hens turned to the air coming out of halftime throwing the ball on all six plays of their first drive of the second half. Minicucci completed five of his six attempts amassing 70 yards and ending the drive by connecting with sophomore receiver Sean Wilson up the right seam for a 35-yard touchdown. Reed knocked in his second field goal on UD’s next drive, putting the Blue Hens up 17 with under seven minutes to go in the third quarter.
Delaware’s defense dominated throughout most of the game holding The Sun Belt’s seventh ranked offense at bay. The Blue Hens kept Louisiana scoreless for a little over 34 straight minutes before Tony Sterner converted on a 39-yard field goal late in the third quarter. Delaware attempted to answer with its own field goal on its ensuing drive, but Reed’s 52-yard attempt was blocked. The Ragin’ Cajuns used the good field position to drive 46 yards in ten plays scoring their lone touchdown of the evening on an eight yard completion to the LSU transfer Shelton Sampson Jr.
The Blue Hens defense stopped the scoring there and finished the bowl game with three takeaways, two sacks and five tackles for loss. Delaware stopped Louisiana on half of their redzone trips and held the offense to a 35 percent conversion rate on third down. 
UD and fellow CUSA member Jacksonville State are the only teams in FBS history to win a bowl game in its first season as FBS schools. In a fun sports coincidence, the Ragin’ Cajuns were on the losing end of both historical wins. 
The Blue Hens signed 19 high school athletes to join the ranks next year and with the transfer portal opening on January 2, 2026, and a bowl win under their belts the future could be bright for the University of Delaware football program.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_xf6g6rxf6g6rxf6g.png,,,2025-12-18 18:57:42.976915

Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) issued his scathing statement just moments before the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission was set to meet behind closed doors at 5 p.m. Ferguson, one of the five commission members, and an outspoken opponent of hyper-partisan midcycle redistricting, said he issued the statement in response to reporters’ request for comment on the commission “approving a decision to move forward consideration of new Congressional maps.”
“The meeting is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. – it has not happened, but the outcome is already known. Clearly, the Commission’s work was pre-determined from the moment the GRAC was announced,” his statement said.
The fact that the meeting was to include a vote on a recommendation — if not a possible map — would likely surprise others on the panel. Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, in an interview early Thursday afternoon, said he expected the meeting to be “administrative” in nature, “to determine steps going forward and sort of lay out a plan for the for the future meetings … that we’re going to have, either about continuing down this path, or discussions about about maps.”
“Because, quite frankly, there have been no real discussions about maps that at this point in time. I haven’t seen anything. Nobody’s asked me anything about what I believe would be appropriate congressional district lines or anything like that,” Morriss said. “So, more than anything, I think that’s what today’s meeting will be … pretty much administrative and sort of figuring out the roadmap going forward.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Previous meetings of the panel, which is chaired by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), were all held in public, and virtually. None featured maps that the public or commission members could look at. Meetings were often added along the way. without a clear idea whehter the panel would hold in-person meetings, produce maps for comment or even if there was an expected end date to proceedings.
When asked if the meeting should be public, Morriss agreed that if a decision was to be made, it should be open. It’s why, “to a great extent,” he hung on to the belief that Thursday’s meeting would be “just administrative and [about] a timeline going forward.”
“I don’t believe it’s going to be a real discussion about maps or anything like that,” he said. “It may be a discussion about that we would be receiving data to be able to then have a discussion about a map, is the way I would see it, if it’s going to be done properly.”
Two other commission members contacted earlier in the day expressed similar beliefs about what would be discussed in the meeting, but they asked not to be named.
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment made earlier in the day.
Ferguson’s statement said he agreed to sit on the commission “because we were tasked with hearing from Marylanders as to whether to move forward with mid-cycle redistricting. The cumulative oral and written testimony received to date demonstrates by a large margin that Marylanders oppose mid-cycle redistricting. Moreover, we did not engage in a thoughtful, informed conversation that would have included, at the very least, testimony from the Office of the Attorney General, or our State and local boards of elections.”
“Pushing forward a pre-ordained recommendation outside the public eye is irresponsible and lacks transparency,” his statement said
Morriss agreed that the combination of written and in-person testimony led him to believe that Marylanders were not overwhelmingly in favor of redrawing the congressional maps.
Ferguson, in his statement, pointed to recent polling that he said showed state residents have bigger issues on their minds.
“Our state’s residents have been clear in front of this commission and through polling,” his statement said. “The overwhelming majority do not want a new congressional map. They want their government focused on fostering growth, affordability, and real protections against this lawless federal Administration. The Senate of Maryland remains focused on this important agenda as we continue to try to tackle a $1.4 billion budget shortfall in Maryland’s state budget.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Prosecutors made their closing arguments in the federal trial against Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan Thursday, asking jurors to consider what happens when judges decide what laws they want to follow based on their own personal beliefs. Dugan is accused of interfering with federal agents as they tried to make an immigration arrest outside her courtroom, and with helping their target to evade arrest. Jurors, the prosecution said, must draw a line, without which “there is only chaos,” and that “chaos is what the rule of law is intended to prevent. 
Calling immigration enforcement a “polarizing issue” nationwide, prosecutors said that Dugan is not on trial for her personal beliefs, but because she “stepped outside of the law.” As they flashed slides and footage to the jury, the prosecution heavily featured statements from Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Kristela Cervera, who accompanied Dugan into the hallway at the courthouse to confront the agents. Cervera testified against Dugan saying “judges shouldn’t be helping defendants evade arrest,” a quote prosecutors highlighted to the jury. 
Dugan knew that the agents had a warrant, prosecutors argued, yet  concealed Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the immigrant they were there to arrest. Dugan’s obstruction of the agents was completed the moment she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney, Mercedes de la Rosa, to a non-public door to exit her courtroom. Flores-Ruiz exited into the same hallway where agents were waiting for him, and they arrested him shortly afterwards outside the courthouse. But “it simply does not matter what happened next,” prosecutors said. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Although de la Rosa, who prosecutors described as “naive and inexperienced,” took the door to the public hallway where agents were waiting, they told the jury Dugan intended  for Flores-Ruiz and his attorney  to use a staircase to exit on  the fifth floor. To buttress their argument, prosecutors played courtroom audio that captured Dugan talking with court reporter Joan Butz and saying “down the stairs” as well as Dugan saying, “I’ll do it…I’ll take the heat,” and Butz responding, “I’d rather get in trouble.” 
Prosecutors argued that had Flores-Ruiz taken the stairs instead of going out into the hallway, that the agents “would have never found” the Mexican-born man, who was in the country without legal authorization. Repeatedly, prosecutors said that no one should ever “second guess” the decisions of ICE agents and law enforcement. 
Dugan was described as “stern” and “angrily pointing” in the hallway, rounding up nearly the entire arrest team and telling them to go to the chief judge’s office. Cervera led the agents to the office, testifying that she felt “abandoned” by Dugan and  “roped into” Dugan’s plan. “No one is above the law,” the prosecution stressed.
Attorney Jason Luczak, delivering the closing  for Dugan’s defense, tried to poke holes in the prosecution’s narrative. “This is a very important case; this is a very unprecedented trial,” Luczak said. “Make no mistake…the government is trying to make an example” out of Dugan, he said. He added that  the jury has the power to check what he described as “overreach” by the federal government. 
Luczak stressed that prior to the second Trump administration, ICE arrests had never occurred at the Milwaukee County Courthouse before. When the arrests began in late March, individuals had been reportedly arrested in elevators and before attending family court, actions which should have been reported up the agency’s chain of command but weren’t, he said. “They’re not even following their own policies,” Luczak said. “This caused concerns, legitimate concerns, among the judges.” 
The jury was asked to consider whether they really believe that Dugan would put her career at risk for Flores-Ruiz. “This case is riddled with doubts,” said Luczak, stressing that the jury can only convict if they find Dugan guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. “There are consequences on rubberstamping what the government wants you to rubberstamp.”
Jurors were reminded of the many emails sent by various judges asking for a policy, sharing stories of having people detained during court, and the slew of questions they had about how the county courthouse could respond. Chief Judge Carl Ashley had released a statement saying that ICE presence at the courthouse discouraged participation in the justice process and eroded trust in the courts’ integrity. 
Luczak also cast doubt on Cervera’s testimony. Jurors were played mute security camera video and asked to decide whether they believe Cervera that Dugan told the agents three times that they needed a judicial warrant, something that didn’t appear to happen in the video. “Judge Cervera is wrong,” said Luczak. “I don’t know if she’s lying, but I could think of some reasons why.” Cervera, the attorney argued, was trying to save herself by throwing Dugan under the bus. “You’re either a friend or an enemy of the government,” he said, asking the jury to consider why prosecutors relied on her statements so heavily. 
When Dugan spoke with the agents, Luczak said, “she’s not being confrontational, she’s being a judge.” He also highlighted that agents contradicted themselves in testimony and in the interviews they gave to FBI agents after the incident. Luczak pointed out that the agents never ran down the hallway to the elevators, as they’d implied. The audio evidence provided by prosecutors had also been taken from multiple microphones and put into one file, and was not audible in many areas, Luczak told the jury, adding, “I don’t think you can see this as very good evidence at all.” 
“If you don’t trust the evidence that the government is putting forward, it’s just another reasonable doubt,” Luczak said. Dugan never concealed Flores-Ruiz from the agents, who never entered her court to keep eyes on him, he said, adding that she never told de la Rosa to take the stairs. Luczak highlighted that prosecutors showed the jury video of the hall, with the filmer going down the stairs and not into the hallway, the opposite of what actually occurred. He called the government’s downplaying of concerns around ICE “tone deaf,” and questioned why Cervera herself texted her sister to warn her about sweeping arrests coming to the courthouse if she, too, didn’t have concerns.
“Justice is not what the government is seeking today,” Luczak. “They’re just wrong.” He told the jury to rely on Dugan’s emails to determine her state of mind, including one where she wrote: “We are in some uncharted waters with some very serious and even potential tragic community interests at risk in the balance.” 
The jury was given instructions by Adelman, and began deliberations shortly after 2 P.M. At around 3:45 P.M., the jury sent out a question to the judge. Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin Brad Schimel, who lost a bid for the Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this year, made an appearance in the gallery as Adelman read the question from jurors about whether they were allowed to see ICE policies, which were included among the exhibits. 
Defense calls former Mayor Barrett as character witness
As witness testimony in the trial against Dugan concluded Thursday morning, Milwaukee County judges and public defenders spoke about the confusion and questions they faced when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began arresting people at the county courthouse. Former Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett was also called to the stand as a character witness, testifying that he’s  known Dugan for over 50 years since they were in high school together. 
Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judges Katie Kegel and Laura Gramling-Perez testified for the defense about emails local judges sent each other, asking for guidance and sharing stories about having people “snatched” out of their courtrooms and seeing ICE agents sitting in cars outside the court. 
One judge chimed in on the chain, “does this mean that Milwaukee County is cooperating with ICE?” Milwaukee County does not cooperate with ICE detainer requests in  the jail. The Milwaukee Police Department also has its own policies limiting cooperation with ICE.
Judges air concerns about courthouse arrests
In one of her emails, Gramling-Perez strongly urged the creation of a policy on courthouse arrests by ICE. Under such a policy, she testified, ICE agents would be required to check in with the chief judge before conducting any enforcement. When the arrest team arrived the morning of April 18, they checked in with security who notified their supervisors at the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office. Security initially believed the agents would need to be escorted by the sheriff’s office, but a sergeant told them that wouldn’t be necessary. 
Gramling-Perez reviewed emails on the stand that said “the historic protocols are now shifting quickly,” and explaining  that although state and local law enforcement have conducted arrests around the court in the past, those activities were always guided by clear policies or practices which were respected by law enforcement. “The ICE detentions are a different animal,” one email stated.
Prosecutors repeatedly attempted to get Gramling-Perez to say that ICE arrests were allowed in public hallways, per the “key takeaways” that she outlined in her email to Dugan and other judges. Gramling-Perez, however, didn’t budge. When prosecutors showed her images of documents they claimed were part of her presentation, she said she’d never seen them before. When they pressed her to say that ICE arrests could happen in public hallways, she countered that her emailed explanations were not all inclusive, that she is not an expert on the matter, but that even public hallway arrests have their limits. 
Gramling-Perez testified that although discussion of a policy had begun, no policy had yet been established by the chief judge. 
Attorney Maura Gingerich, a public defender, was also called to the stand as a defense witness. Gingerich testified wearing a black suit with a black mask she said she wore for health reasons — attire similar to what she wore on April 18, when security cameras captured her photographing the plain-clothes ICE, FBI, DEA, and Border Patrol task force members in the courthouse hallway. Gingerich testified that she took photographs of  the agents to send to her supervisor, so that the chief judge would be notified that the agents had returned and could offer guidance. 
“I think that it was very stressful to see what I thought were a number of law enforcement on the sixth floor without uniform,” Gingerich testified, noting she had already gone to another courtroom when Dugan approached the agents. One of the prosecutors  suggested  Gingerich followed the agents to another courtroom and was cooperating with Dugan,  saying, “I know what you guys were trying to do,” but Gingrich denied that characterization. Gingrich said she never saw Dugan that morning. 
Barrett calls Dugan ‘extremely honest’; Dugan invokes the Fifth Amendment
Former Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett testified as a character witness for Dugan, saying he has known her and the Dugan family for half a century. They first met when they attended the same high school.
Barrett described Dugan as very active in the community, an enthusiastic participant in community organizations and in  her church. “I think that she is extremely honest and I know that she will tell you exactly how she feels,” Barrett testified, adding that he feels that Dugan is a good person. 
The defense rested its case ahead of a lunch break. Dugan invoked her Fifth Amendment rights not to testify.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources confirmed Thursday that Canada geese at two southern Iowa lakes tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. 
The outbreak was detected following reports of dead geese at Green Valley Lake, near Creston. 
Rachel Ruden, the state wildlife veterinarian with DNR, said this is the first time mass mortality events from the bird flu have impacted southwest Iowa since the start of the HPAI outbreak in 2022. 
“We’ve been kind of buffered in southwest from seeing great activity,” Ruden said. “Whereas other parts of the state, central Iowa and northeast, it’s been pretty routine to get activity in the fall (and) winter.” 
Since 2022, according to national data from U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 184 million domestic poultry have died from the virus, and more than 8,500 cases of the flu have been detected in wild birds.
According to DNR, staff received reports of dead geese at Green Valley Lake Dec. 11 and began collecting birds to submit for testing at Iowa State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Results from the test revealed geese died from the H5N1 avian influenza. 
Ruden said reports of dead geese circulated around the same time for Lake of Three Fires, in Bedford, where the other documented outbreak occurred. 
Because the birds are wild, can sink in the water or be taken off by scavenging animals, Ruden said it’s difficult to gather an exact count of the number of dead birds during an outbreak. She said last year, wild bird deaths across the state totaled in the low thousands. So far, in southwestern Iowa where the outbreaks have been concentrated this winter, Ruden estimated bird deaths totaled a “couple hundred.” 
Canada geese migration increased in late November with the cold and snowy conditions across Iowa. According to DNR, a Dec. 12 survey of waterfowl found the Canada geese populations had increased by more than 30% from the week prior. 
DNR said it’s “uncertain” how long the outbreak will last, but staff expect waterfowl will “disperse” and therefore reduce opportunities for transmission, as rain and mild weather move in. 
Ruden said it will be interesting, from a scientific perspective, to see how the scavenging population in southwest Iowa reacts to the outbreak. In the past, she said, there has been a concern about bald eagles contracting bird flu after scavenging bird carcasses but as it turns out, many of the mature bald eagles have shown they have antibodies to avian influenza. 
“But, that might not hold true in the southwest, where they really haven’t seen the same level of exposure,” Ruden said. 
People should avoid contact with dead or sick birds, according to DNR and to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the public health risk of HPAI is low, there have been more than 70 cases of the virus in people who were exposed to sick poultry or dairy cattle. 
DNR also advises Iowans keep their pets from dead or sick birds as they can also get sick from the virus. 
Iowans who see 20 or more bird carcasses are encouraged to call their local wildlife staff, a directory of which can be found online. 
The state has additional guidelines for Iowans who find a bird carcass on their property and want to collect and dispose of it safely.
“We encourage the public to report sick birds or other wildlife to your local wildlife biologist or conservation officer to help us track impacts of this disease,” Ruden said in the news release. “We all have a part to play in keeping Iowa’s wildlife healthy.”

(CSPAN screengrab)The economy’s great, like nobody’s ever seen before, so quit your whining, Trump told the nation in a TV address Wednesday night.
Besides, while the economy is great at levels that have never been seen, if there is something about it that bothers you, obviously that’s Biden’s fault, Trump added.
So everybody stop complaining and instead start writing heartfelt thank-you notes to Trump for making all your lives so marvelous.
The inflation report released Thursday morning did find a lower rate in November than in September. (There was no October report because of the government shutdown.) The overall inflation rate in September was 3%, but in November it was down to 2.7%.
When the inflation rate goes down, that doesn’t mean prices are going down, of course. But at least it means they’re not rising as fast.
Alas, a lot of people are throwing a lot of shade at the report, some of them having warned earlier that shutdown-related data collection snags which torpedoed the October report altogether would continue to distort findings in the November report.
I’m not qualified to say if this is a reflection of that, but I did notice the breakdown by detailed expenditure category in Thursday morning’s report has no info on some expenses. A couple that caught my eye: Motor vehicle insurance, and admission to sporting events. (There was also no November inflation data on “whiskey at home,” but I digress.)
And while the overall inflation rate was slightly lower than 3% — which was not only the September rate but also the rate when Trump took office in January — several items rose by a lot more than that.
Beef was 16% more expensive in November than it was a year ago.
Frozen fish and seafood, 12%. Coffee, 19%. Electricity, 7%. Natural gas, 9%. Motor vehicle repair, 10%. Tenants’ and household insurance, 7%. Care of invalids and elderly at home, 11%.
“Food away from home” was up 3.7% in November, and “full service food away from home” was up 4.3%. While not notably higher than the 2.7% increase for all items, like beef or coffee or natural gas was, the cost of food away from home has been rising more than the topline consumer price index inflation rate for months.
The rising cost of food away from home hurts more in Nevada than in a lot of other states, because of Nevada’s pretty high sales tax rates (about which few to no elected officials in the state give a damn, but again I digress).
But the cost to Nevadans who eat out isn’t the only reason I mention the rising prices of food away from home. 
“Accommodation and food services” is by far Nevada’s largest employment sector, accounting for more than 20% of the state’s jobs. And as I’ve noted before, in a metro area of 2.4 million people, it’s safe to assume those 2.4 million residents, not tourists, are the largest Southern Nevada customer base for food away from home on any given day. The last thing we need is weakness in spending by locals brought on by food inflation jeopardizing food service jobs throughout the valley.
Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about that, because the economy is great, like nobody’s ever seen before! So to reiterate, quit your whining, right?

Dec. 18, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAmid calls for transparency from the Attorney General’s Office, environmental activists and thousands of residents from across the state, the Michigan Public Service Commission met on Thursday to consider a set of contracts for one of the state’s largest utilities to provide energy to a massive data center project.
The regulatory body’s three commissioners voted unanimously to conditionally approve DTE Energy’s contracts to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center planned for construction in Saline Township in Washtenaw County by tech giant Oracle and developer Related Digital.
The decision, which came one day after potential financing for the project was withdrawn, sparked disappointment and frustration amongst several audience members who stood opposed to the deal and the lack of public transparency leading up to its approval.
DTE Energy filed an ex parte request with the commission on Oct. 31, drawing criticism from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who noted that this procedure would allow the case to move forward without allowing outside parties to intervene, file testimony and conduct legal discovery on the deal.
In addition to her arguments that DTE’s application fails to provide sufficient evidence that the 1.4 gigawatt data center will not bring higher costs to customers, Nessel has also criticized the company for heavy redactions in the publicly available version of the contracts.
Jill Wilmot, DTE’s Director of Corporate Communications, previously told Michigan Advance that the company was following proper procedure, as the state allows companies to file for an uncontested approval of contracts if there is no cost of service increase to customers.
The company has also repeatedly pointed to language in the law establishing sales and use tax exemptions for data center construction and equipment that bars data centers from accepting an energy deal which shifts costs onto other ratepayers. However, that language is the part of the conditions for receiving the tax break, rather than a regulation on data center operations.
During the meeting, the commission’s Chief Operating Officer Mike Byrne told the commissioners before their vote that the order up for consideration determined that the case would not bring additional costs to customers. 
However, Byrne also broke down several of the stipulations that DTE would need to meet in order to reach the conditions of the contracts’ approval, including making a commitment to ensuring that the costs of supplying power to the project will be covered solely by the data center, and not by other ratepayers. 
The contracts would also require the company to tweak its rate structure for large load customers like data centers to ensure these facilities cover the costs associated with connecting to the grid. The order also requires DTE to update its emergency procedures to ensure that the data center would have its electricity reduced or interrupted before the company interrupts service to its other customers.
While public comments pointed to issues with noise pollution, water usage and other concerns on data centers, Commissioner Katherine Peretick noted that the Public Service Commission’s jurisdiction is limited to decisions around electrical supply.
She also emphasized that the order before the commissioners was conditional, and that if the safeguards included in the contract fail to protect customers, those risks will fall on DTE.
“If DTE is not comfortable bearing the risk. They’re welcome to refile their application as a contested case,” Peretick said. 
In a statement, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry applauded the commission’s decision. 
“DTE Energy has an obligation to serve any customer, including data centers, that come into our electric service territory in southeast Michigan. That’s why we’ve been so focused on making sure our broader customer base is protected with these contracts to ensure they will not subsidize data center rates,” Lowry said. “We acknowledge there’s a range of viewpoints and emotions about this decision. We remain deeply committed to supporting our customers and the communities we serve by delivering the safe, reliable energy they depend on each day.”
Nessel, on the other hand, shared her disappointment in the commission’s decision to grant DTE its contracts. 
“While I am relieved that the Commission at least purports to have placed some conditions on DTE’s application, without being able to see the full, unredacted contract, and study the predicate conditions and enforcement mechanisms set by the Commission, it is impossible to verify any of these claims today,” Nessel said in a statement. “As Michigan’s chief consumer advocate, my office is reviewing the Commission’s order and considering what next steps we may be able to take to protect our residents.”

The assurances provided by the commissioners also failed to sway those opposed to the project, including several Saline Township residents who spoke up during the meeting’s public comment period.
“What you did is hurting real families,” said Kathryn Haushalter, who lives near the data center site. “You can say and justify it however you want, but I want you to remember my kids and remember me. You’re hurting us. You do not serve me.”
Ash Haushalter, her husband, argued the commission had set a dangerous precedent, and that they’d allowed businesses to come in and set their own terms. 
Nichole Keway Biber, mid-Michigan Campaign Organizer for Clean Water Action, called on the commission to serve the public interest, rather than “[tying] a pretty bow on our ex-parte blindfolds.”
In a statement released after the decision, Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said the decision to approve the project without a contested case marked a missed opportunity to examine how the massive facility could impact DTE’s generation portfolio and Michigan’s renewable energy goals – including the impact of the proposed battery storage system the data center will be paying to develop as part of the project.
“The proposed battery storage system could be beneficial, but it’s critical to understand what will charge those batteries – clean energy or fossil fuels,” Duckworth said. “Fast-tracking approval only defers consideration of the renewable energy implications until next year’s integrated resource planning, which will only make these issues more difficult to thoughtfully address.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7596-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-18 22:41:32+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi Department of Mental Health says fewer people who need mental health services are being held in county jails,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/18/mississippi-mental-health-jails/,"Before 2024 state legislation went into effect, people going through the civil commitment process could be jailed if county officials determined they did not have another place to hold them.","OXFORD – The Mississippi Department of Mental Health said significantly fewer people they oversee who needed mental health services in the state ended up in county jails over the last year, findings it attributed to a 2024 bill lawmakers passed to reduce how often people are placed in that position.
Sharing statistics from the department’s fiscal year 2025 annual report at the agency’s board meeting Thursday, Executive Director Wendy Bailey said there was a 31% decrease in state hospital admissions from jails since the House Bill 1640 became law in July 2024. 
Before the new legislation, people going through the civil commitment process could be jailed if county officials determined they did not have another place to hold them. Now, local community mental health center staffers screen people who are reported to be a potential danger to themself or others before they are taken into state custody and must note why a less restrictive treatment is not an option. A person cannot be held in jail unless all other options for care have been exhausted, they are “actively violent” and never for more than 48 hours. 
Among people jailed while awaiting mental health treatment at a state hospital, the department found that their wait behind bars decreased from about two days before the law went into effect to about one day after. Bailey attributed these changes to a part of the law that requires a provider to screen someone being committed for severe mental illness before they are sent to jail. 
In 2023, Mississippi Today and ProPublica found that the state routinely jailed people in need of severe mental health treatment who were never charged with a crime, which often endangered their lives. It was the only state in the country that regularly did that, according to a survey conducted by the newsrooms. 
The mental health department’s statistics are only one measure of how many people end up in jails with mental health needs and no criminal charges. Chancery clerks and community mental health centers are also supposed to keep track of the number of people in this position. Unlike the state agency, their statistics include those who are released to places other than the state hospitals. 
In January, Mississippi Today found that these three groups of recordkeepers had inconsistent numbers, making it difficult to say whether the 2024 law was doing what lawmakers said it would. 
After the board meeting, Adam Moore, spokesperson for the Department of Mental Health, said that although the agency’s annual report findings did not account for everyone, they still indicated that the new law was having a positive effect.
“We think it’s a correlation, and we think it’s a positive correlation,” he said.
House Public Health and Human Services Chairman Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, was the lead sponsor of the 2024 bill, and he said the Mississippi Today and ProPublica’s Investigation was a big reason he co-authored it. 
After the board meeting, Creekmore said he was proud of the Legislature’s efforts to reform the civil commitment process. But that law alone won’t ensure that the most mentally vulnerable Mississippians will avoid danger while trying to get help. 
He said that goal would take more work from the Legislature next year.
“It’s not perfect by any means.”

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Public Safety says a saturation patrol initiative has had a minimal impact on the Highway Patrol’s budget. 
Operation Prairie Thunder, announced in July by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, has put additional state troopers in cities across South Dakota on eight occasions. 
Last week, the state said it had jailed 75 people on drug charges during two sets of patrols in the cities of Yankton, Huron and Belle Fourche. Earlier patrols had focused on the city of Sioux Falls. 
Brad Reiners, spokesman for the Highway Patrol, told South Dakota Searchlight the state logged $43,000 worth of overtime hours for troopers during the days the patrols took place.
“There are minimal lodging, travel, and fuel costs as well,” Reiners wrote in an email, adding that those expenses were covered by the Highway Patrol’s operational budget.
He also said troopers would have logged some overtime hours during the saturation patrol time frames even if those patrols had not taken place.

He declined to say how many additional troopers were involved in each patrol, or to offer the total annual overtime budget for the agency. He wrote that the overtime budget is “complex,” because “there are several accounts from which overtime may be drawn.” The Highway Patrol’s total budget for the current fiscal year is about $45 million.
The budget impact of saturation patrols extends beyond the Highway Patrol.
Minnehaha County Public Defender Traci Smith told South Dakota Searchlight she has not broken down the exact number of additional cases her office now has as a result of the patrols, but that “the increase we felt was anecdotally due to the higher number of arrests during those times.”
Smith also wrote that she had recently asked the Minnehaha County Commission for a $190,000 budget supplement. The commission approved her request on Tuesday.
The Nov. 21 letter requesting that money did not mention Operation Prairie Thunder, but pointed more generally to “unanticipated operational needs and workload-driven expenses” and a “sustained increase in felony, drug, and violent-offense cases.”
Immigration connection
During the saturation patrols, state troopers are questioning people they suspect of being in the U.S. without documentation, facilitated in part by a cooperation agreement inked between the agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement this year.
Such questioning, some of which results in detainment for ICE, takes place during regular traffic stops.
The mayor and a state representative from Huron, one of South Dakota’s most diverse cities per capita, told Searchlight that the troopers’ presence in town sparked fears of ICE immigration crackdowns.
The state does not publicly announce the dates for its patrols in advance, but the city of Brookings posted a press release late last week announcing that Operation Prairie Thunder patrols would take place in the city from Wednesday through Friday, and that “the city of Brookings will not be participating in these operations.”
Brookings Mayor Ope Neimeyer told The Dakota Scout newspaper that the release was meant to “inform our citizens.”
Josie Harms, a spokeswoman for Rhoden, declined to say on Tuesday if anything had changed in terms of the Highway Patrol’s plans for Brookings.
“For security reasons, we are not going to comment on operational specifics,” she wrote in a statement. “It’s unfortunate that the city of Brookings would jeopardize an anti-crime operation and put the safety of our officers at risk by publishing this information. In South Dakota, we enforce the rule of law.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rhoden-and-ICE-e1753734439834-1024x825.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-18 22:39:41+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,T says weekend ridership nearly back to 2019 levels,Ella Adams | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/t-says-weekend-ridership-nearly-back-to-2019-levels/,Chief Operating Officer Ryan Coholan said weekend ridership is nearly back to 2019 levels.,"THE MBTA IS experiencing “a monumental comeback story” in the eyes of its leadership, who looked back Thursday at the agency’s 2025 storyline and approved a safety plan and new accessibility metric. 
Chief Operating Officer Ryan Coholan said weekend ridership is nearly back to 2019 levels. Overall ridership sits at 77 percent of 2019 levels, and weekday ridership is at 73 percent of 2019 levels, he added. 
“It’s a testament to what we’ve been able to produce and the work that we’re doing and the work that we’re going to do,” Coholan said at the board’s final meeting of 2025. “More and more people are returning, it really is a monumental comeback story.”
Coholan said he thought rising weekend ridership could be due to the ease with which people in Boston can get around with improved train service and connection. Weekday ridership figures are “reflective of just how work patterns have evolved” since the pandemic, he said.
In a lookback video played Thursday, T General Manager and interim MassDOT Secretary Phil Eng — donning a T-inspired holiday sweater — called 2025 a year of “bold goals, complex challenges and meaningful progress.”
Eng was not in-person at the Thursday meeting because he was attending funeral services out of state, according to T Chair Tom McGee.
Eng said that the number of scheduled weekday trips on the Red, Orange and Blue lines have increased 55 percent, 50 percent and 16 percent, respectively, since the spring of 2024. The T is providing nearly one million trips each day, which he called the highest ridership since the pandemic. 
Service in the core tunnel and all four Green Line branches has been suspended since December 8 and is set to reopen December 22. Coholan said that workers have been able to “tackle” all 13,000 feet of an aging, 130-year-old wooden trough with new composite fixtures. During the diversion, steel work was done at Boylston station, concrete and lighting work was done at Copley station, and work began on a radio replacement program, he said. They also began to install new messenger wire and cabling for upcoming signal upgrades.
The T is looking ahead to its role in major events in 2026, including FIFA World Cup, Massachusetts’ 250th anniversary and the return of tall ships to Boston Harbor.
“We installed a temporary platform, and are advancing the construction of permanent level boarding platform at Foxboro Station, positioning us to serve over 20,000 spectators for each FIFA Men’s World Cup game,” Eng said.
Later in the meeting, MBTA Transit Police Chief Kenneth Green said that there are 10 trains available to help transport the influx of people during the World Cup stint next summer. They’re still trying to figure out how the “queueing” of trains will work during that period, he said.
Following discussion about the recent Daniels-Finegoldsettlement, the board voted to update its service delivery policy to incorporate an accessibility metric. The board voted to add a “station staffing” metric to the service delivery policy, which would designate locations in stations for dedicated customer service staff. Each location would be assigned a “tier,” which would dictate the minimum staffing standards.
“This is about codifying a minimum standard that we have been meeting for the last few years,” Assistant General Manager of System-Wide Accessibility Laura Brelsbord told the board. The T established station staffing standards and a staffing plan to fulfill it in 2021, and the standard has largely been met since fiscal year 2024, when in-station staffing was increased, according to her report.
The board also voted to approve an updated 2026 transit safety plan.
The board approved the initial plan at an August 12 meeting, though Department of Public Utilities comments required a resubmittal of the plan in December. The board voted on DPU adjustments, which included updates to safety performance targets and the risk reduction program. After some confusion among a couple of board members about how the targets would be calculated, McGee suggested the board approve the updates but requested there be briefings or explanations about the plan shared in “layman’s terms.” 
T Chief Safety Officer Tim Lesniak pointed to improved safety rates year-over-year with regard to events reportable to the Federal Transit Administration and DPU.
“As you look at the FTA reportable events, we’re actually down approximately 25 percent from 2024 to 2025. And for DPU, we’re down approximately 15 percent from 2024 to 2025,” Lesniak said.
A Transit Police update showed that year-to-date “Part I” crimes — which include crimes such as aggravated assault, larceny and burglary — are down 14 percent. Offenses between January 1 and December 15 in 2024 totaled 798, while that same time period in 2025 saw 687 offenses. 
Green also noted hiring process changes in a 2024 economic development law that enable a new “hybrid” civil service model. The transit police will now be able to hire more officers outside of the civil service hiring process, he explained, which “taps into a much bigger applicant pool.”
“We can get college students now,” Green said. “You can get women, you can get minorities in the greater Boston area that know the system. It gives us the chance to diversify.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transportation_MBTA_Orange-Line_Station.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas regulators have asked that an Oklahoma city’s appeal of a wastewater permit get tossed, saying lawyers who filed the appeal are ineligible because they are not licensed in the state.
The challenge to Decatur’s wastewater permit was filed last month by the city of Tulsa. Tulsa argued a permit modification granted by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality earlier this year violated the state’s water pollution standards. Tulsa also said the modified permit violates a 2003 federal settlement agreement among Tulsa, Decatur and several poultry companies over nutrient pollution in the water.
The Department of Environmental Quality argued that since the Tulsa-based attorneys for the permit appeal are not licensed in Arkansas, they’re prohibited from representing the city before the panel taking up the issue.
In Arkansas, those who object to an environmental quality permit decision have 30 days from the agency’s final decision to request a hearing before the Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, which kicks off the appeal process. But DEQ said since Tulsa’s attorneys weren’t licensed in Arkansas, that request was not properly filed by the deadline, making the request null and void.
DEQ also said since Tulsa argued the modification violated a federal court settlement, the commission didn’t have jurisdiction over the matter.
PCEC Administrative Law Judge Charles Moulton set an administrative hearing on the appeal for April 9 and 10, 2026.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-18 22:25:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump admin. moves to cut off transgender care for children,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/18/trump-admin-moves-to-cut-off-transgender-care-for-children/,"The Connecticut Hospital Association called the action ""aggressive"" and ""alarming"" in a statement Thursday. ""Patients must come first.""","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday unveiled a series of regulatory actions designed to block access to gender-affirming care for minors, building on broader Trump administration restrictions targeting transgender Americans.
The sweeping proposals — the most significant moves this administration has taken so far to restrict the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical interventions for transgender children — include cutting off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and prohibiting federal Medicaid dollars from being used to fund such procedures.
“This is not medicine, it is malpractice,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said of gender-affirming procedures in a news conference on Thursday. “Sex-rejecting procedures rob children of their futures.”
Thursday’s announcements would imperil access in nearly two dozen states where drug treatments and surgical procedures remain legal and covered by Medicaid, which is funded by federal and state dollars.
A statement from the Connecticut Hospital Association Thursday said the move could “jeopardize care for all patients” by putting hospitals and providers in a challenging position. 
“These latest actions are aggressive, alarming, and follow a pattern of efforts by federal agencies — including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission — that seek to bring the full weight of the federal government to bear on this issue,” the statement read. “Patients must come first and Connecticut hospitals are continuing to help families navigate care. Threatening healthcare providers and holding Medicare and Medicaid funding hostage are devastating tactics intended to leave hospitals with little choice.”
The Trump administration proposals run counter to the recommendations of major U.S. medical societies. And advocates for transgender children strongly refuted the administration’s claims about gender-affirming care, saying Thursday’s moves would put lives at risk.
“The multitude of efforts we are seeing from federal legislators to strip transgender and nonbinary youth of the health care they need is deeply troubling,” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, of The Trevor Project, a nonprofit suicide prevention organization for LBGTQ+ youth.
Proposed rules would threaten youth gender-affirming care in states where it remains legal
Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court’s recent decision upholding Tennessee’s ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place.
The proposals announced by Kennedy and his deputies are not final or legally binding. Officials must go through a lengthy rulemaking process, including periods of public comment and document rewrites, before the restrictions become permanent. They are also likely to face legal challenges.
But the proposed rules will likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children and many hospitals have already ceased such care in anticipation of federal action.
[RELATED: CT families file complaints against hospitals over ‘severe disruptions’ to gender-affirming care]
Hannah Edwards, executive director of Transforming Families, a support organization for families of transgender youth in Minnesota, said she expects some patients will still be able to get care at private clinics that don’t participate in Medicaid and Medicare.
But that won’t be a solution for all kids seeking care.
Edwards has a 15-year-old transgender daughter and said that there’s a growing sense of fear because of federal government actions, even in a state that’s become a destination for families with transgender children.
“The conversation that constantly happens for my family personally is: Where is our red line when we need to flee the country?” she said.
Nearly all U.S. hospitals care for patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, the federal government’s largest health plans that cover seniors, people with disabilities and low-income Americans. Losing access to those payments would imperil most U.S. hospitals and medical providers.
The same funding restrictions would apply to a smaller health plan, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, when it comes to care for people under the age of 19, according to a federal notice posted Thursday morning.
“This sets a very dangerous precedent for all areas of health care, if the government can cherry-pick one area of medicine to use to withhold necessary funding from entire groups of people,” said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, a psychiatrist and board member for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. The group develops standards of care for transgender patients globally.
Kennedy also announced Thursday that the HHS Office of Civil Rights will propose a rule excluding gender dysphoria from the definition of a disability. Gender dysphoria is a formal medical diagnosis that describes the distress felt when someone’s gender expression does not match their sex assigned at birth.
Young people who persistently experience gender dysphoria are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive hormone-blocking drugs that delay puberty, followed by testosterone or estrogen to bring about the desired physical changes sought by patients. Surgery is rare for minors.
Moves contradict advice from medical organizations and transgender advocates
Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on Thursday called transgender treatments “a Band-Aid on a much deeper pathology,” and suggested children with gender dysphoria are “confused, lost and need help.”
Polling shows many Americans agree with the administration’s view. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling transgender issues.
Chloe Cole, a conservative activist known for speaking about her gender-transition reversal, spoke at the news conference to express appreciation. She said cries for help from her and others in her situation, “have finally been heard.”
But the approach contradicts the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, which has urged states not to restrict transgender care and services. The American Academy of Pediatrics called on HHS to reverse course Thursday, saying “children and families will bear the consequences.”
“These rules are a baseless intrusion into the patient-physician relationship. Patients, their families, and their physicians—not politicians or government officials —should be the ones to make decisions together about what care is best for them,” said Dr. Susan Kressly, AAP president.
Actions build on a larger effort to restrict transgender rights
The announcements build on a wave of actions President Donald Trump, his administration and Republicans in Congress have taken to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.
On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that declared the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. He also has signed orders barring transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports and cutting federal spending for transition-related care, which prompted Thursday’s announcement.
On Wednesday, a bill that would open transgender health care providers to prison time if they treat people under the age of 18 passed the U.S. House and heads to the Senate. Another bill under consideration in the House on Thursday aims to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for children.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Environmental groups are yet again challenging Louisiana regu their decision to reissue a previously suspended permit for a liquified natural gas export facility in Cameron Parish. 
The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th judicial district against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy. 
The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish. 
​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s  valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.
“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney. 
Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis. 
The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.
 Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG. 
About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda. 
The United States was the largest exporter of LNG in the world in 2024, 11.9 billion cubic feet per day around the globe, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Louisiana handled around 61% of those LNG exports.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185

The measure was considered during the chamber’s last vote series before a two-week break, and 18 members did not vote.Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, has sponsored a companion bill in that chamber. The measure faces an uphill road in the Senate, where passage of partisan bills is rarer due to the 60-vote threshold for most legislation.The bill would remove gray wolves from the ESA list, even though they have not reached population figures that the Fish and Wildlife Service has said would indicate full recovery.Rep. Donald S. Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, said it would be reasonable to adjust population thresholds, but that congressionally mandated delisting was unwise and illegal.“This bill fails to recognize the status of gray wolves today, taking us back to an outdated rulemaking that didn't hold up in court,” Beyer said on the House floor Thursday.House Natural Resources Committee ranking Democrat Jared Huffman of California said the bill set a “troubling” precedent by blocking judicial review.“It tells the American people they no longer have the right to challenge unlawful government actions,” he said. “The ESA is simple and effective. It ensures decisions are grounded in science — that's the heart of it — and this bill throws that principle out the window.”Several Republicans on the Natural Resources Committee spoke in favor of the bill, saying it would delegate wolf management to states.In a statement, Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican, said the gray wolf has been “fully recovered” for two decades.“States are more than capable of managing thriving wolf populations. This legislation restores a common-sense, science-based approach to wolf management, returning decision-making to states,” he said.Republicans also argued the bill would protect livestock and humans.Rep. Pete Stauber showed a photo from his district in Ely, Minnesota, of a wolf in a school parking lot.“Because of the gray wolf’s listing status, nothing could be done to protect the lives of the students there,” the Republican said. “The broken ESA is putting my constituents' lives at risk.”",,,,2025-12-18 18:00:13.727185

The resolution would have authorized the borough to enter into official “discussions and considerations” with Chugiak and Eagle River residents who want to separate from the Municipality of Anchorage and instead join Mat-Su.

Annex Now is separate from a longer-term push known as Eaglexit, which aims to peel the region away from Anchorage and create a new independent borough. That proposal is currently under review by the state’s Local Boundary Commission. A decision on whether Eaglexit can submit signatures for a ballot initiative on the matter is expected next month.
The Mat-Su Assembly voted 6-1 to indefinitely postpone the resolution supporting annexation discussions — a move that effectively kills the proposal — and instead wait for the commission to decide whether Eagle River can form its own borough.
“I don’t want to do anything that is going to give the boundary commission the idea that we want to get involved in annexing Chugiak and Eagle River,” said Assembly member Bill Gamble, whose district includes Big Lake. “I think it sends a very confusing mixed message.”
Assembly member Dmitri Fonov, who sponsored the resolution, voted no because he wanted to delay the discussion rather than dismiss it completely, he said. Fonov’s district includes portions of Palmer and Wasilla.
McCarty said the Annex Now effort offers Chugiak and Eagle River residents an alternative option if the commission rejects Eaglexit’s stand-alone borough plan. Any final decision to annex the area would require voter approval both there and in the Mat-Su Borough, he said.

Supporters of Eaglexit told the assembly that even greenlighting official discussions about annexation could confuse Chugiak and Eagle River residents and potentially hurt their chances of winning approval from the commission.
“We worked so hard on this, and I just beg you to table this indefinitely — give us a chance to get this done,” said Matthew Hickey, an Eagle River businessman who supports the Eaglexit effort, during public comment Tuesday. “This is like our worst nightmare happening, and we don’t get it.”
Regardless of whether the commission allows the issue to move forward, breaking away may not be financially viable, one Anchorage city official warned.
Not only would residents need to fund their own school district, but they would likely need to buy out the city’s assets in the area, Anchorage Assembly Chair Christopher Constant told the Anchorage Daily News in an interview last month.
“The cash-out costs would be extraordinary. They would need to go into massive debt,” Constant said. “It’s going to be very, very, very, very, very expensive. Five verys.”
How much annexing the region into Mat-Su could ultimately cost the borough or Eagle River-Chugiak residents — or what the legal path for doing so would involve — was not immediately clear. Borough Attorney Nick Spiropoulos said his office is focused on other matters and has not looked into the issue.
“I don’t have the time or the inclination to chase things that we’re not involved with,” he said during Tuesday’s meeting.

(Photo provided/Department of Mental Health)COLUMBIA — South Carolina agreed to bolster programs that help people with severe mental illness live on their own as part of a settlement agreement with the federal Department of Justice.
The federal agency sued the state last December, claiming South Carolina’s agencies kept people in restrictive residential housing longer than necessary. People in the state’s care had few opportunities to go out in public or learn necessary social skills, making it difficult to meet the requirements to transition out of state-run facilities and into their own housing, the lawsuit claimed.
Not providing adults with severe mental illness who are capable of taking care of themselves with the supports needed to live on their own violates the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, which protects people with disabilities from discrimination, the justice department’s Civil Rights Division argued.
South Carolina, which denied the lawsuit’s claims, did not admit to doing anything wrong. The state has programs in place to address the Department of Justice’s demands, but over the next three years, the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities will expand those programs in an effort to help more people transition out of residential care and, when possible, treat people in their own homes, according to the settlement announced Thursday.
“We are pleased that the parties were able to reach an agreement to resolve this suit,” said Robert Kittle, a spokesman for the state attorney general, in an email.
The agency’s mental health office was pleased with the agreement, spokeswoman Tracy LaPointe said in an email. She noted that the state already meets some of the federal agency’s requirements, which the settlement requires the agency to maintain in the coming years.
“The office looks forward to expanding the identified services as needed to ensure those in need have access to high quality services in the least restrictive setting possible and continue to develop additional resources and partnerships to further this goal,” LaPointe said.
Last year, when the lawsuit was filed, more than 1,000 people were living in the state’s 362 facilities, which are often the first stop for people discharged from state-run psychiatric hospitals, according to the initial complaint. Seven of those were run through the state Office of Mental Health, LaPointe said.
Many of the people living in those care homes could live on their own with the right supports, the lawsuit argued. And some wouldn’t have to go there in the first place if the state had more resources to help people in crisis stay in their homes, federal attorneys wrote.
If the agency doesn’t meet the goals laid out in the agreement, the Department of Justice could sue again, according to the agreement. Since any funding for expanded programs must go through the Legislature, the federal and state agencies will meet to discuss next steps if legislators opt not to fund the programs.
The state’s behavioral health department, which formed this year from three other health-related agencies, is asking for $1.1 million to start putting changes in place. That’s in addition to the $3 million in the state budget that runs through the end of June for similar efforts. The agency expects to make another request for funding for the 2026-2027 budget, according to its budget request.
“The Department and South Carolina are working together to ensure that people with serious mental illnesses can be served in the community when they want to be,” said Harmeet K. Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general, in a news release. “This is a great day for the people of South Carolina and demonstrates the substantial work that can happen when the federal government and states work together.”
Most of the settlement’s requirements had to do with hiring and retaining employees.
Some changes could prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, keeping people from going into residential treatment in the first place, according to the settlement.
For instance, the state must make sure it has at least two dedicated peer support specialists at each of its 16 community centers across the state. The specialists have been through their own recoveries and can share their experiences to help people in similar situations, who may not always trust medical professionals, according to the lawsuit.
The mental health office also needs more teams to visit people’s homes to help them with everyday treatment needs and other daily tasks. When the lawsuit was filed, the state operated two Assertive Community Treatment teams, composed of nurses, psychiatrists and peer support specialists. It needs another 11, including six larger teams capable of treating upward of 50 clients each, the settlement reads.
For people experiencing mental health emergencies, the state should have more two-person mobile crisis teams, which respond to calls made to 988, the suicide and crisis hotline. For that, the justice department didn’t give a specific number of teams, saying only that the state must have enough to respond to two incidents in a county at a time. Each of the 16 community centers, which serve all of the state’s counties, has a dedicated crisis team, LaPointe said.
If a person does need to stay at a residential treatment center, once they are stable and no longer need around-the-clock care, the state should work to get them back into the community as quickly as possible, according to the agreement.
To keep people from staying in residential care indefinitely, case managers should create a plan for how they will get housing, a job and at-home treatment, if necessary, within a month of a patient deciding they want to leave. No resident should stay longer than three months after they are able to secure housing and any other necessary supports under the agreement.
Adults who prefer residential care don’t have to leave, but they should have that choice, the settlement reads.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Columbia-Area-Highway-to-Hope-RV-1024x792.jpg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

Free.,"‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ provided funds for $1,776 dividend checks for military",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/one-big-beautiful-bill-provided-funds-1776-dividend-checks-military,,"WASHINGTON — The $1,776 “warrior dividend” checks President Donald Trump announced during Wednesday’s prime-time address will come from basic housing allowance funds approved by Congress and signed into law in July, according to a senior administration official.Trump touted the one-time payments to troops Wednesday night as a new boost made possible in large part by tariff revenue.“In honor of our nation's founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776 — think of that — and the checks are already on the way. Nobody understood that one until about 30 minutes ago,” Trump said. “We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the (reconciliation) bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military, and I say congratulations to everybody,” he continued in his 18-minute address.Politico first reported the money would not come from tariffs, as the president implied, but from a housing stipend already approved by Congress in this summer’s budget reconciliation bill, a massive tax and spending cuts measure often dubbed the “one big, beautiful bill,” which Trump signed into law on the Fourth of July. A senior White House administration official confirmed to States Newsroom via email Thursday afternoon that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has directed the department to disburse $2.6 billion “as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to eligible service members at the rank of senior officer and below. The official also specified the one-time payment will go to “eligible recipients not receiving” a basic allowance for housing.The email specified that Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of Defense, which the White House refers to as the Department of War, to supplement the basic housing allowance entitlement.  The amount can be found in Title II of July’s budget reconciliation law.“This one-time payment exemplifies the Department’s ongoing commitment to improving the housing and quality of life for our military members and their families,” the administration official wrote in the email.The White House did not respond to follow-up questions pointing to Trump’s attribution in his speech to tariff revenue.When asked for comment, the Pentagon directed States Newsroom to a social media post on the White House Rapid Response account that slammed Politico’s reporting as “highly misleading.”One-time paymentA Department of Defense article published Thursday by “Pentagon News” states, “Money to pay for the Warrior Dividend came earlier this year as part of the president's One Big Beautiful Bill” and does not mention tariffs.The article, written by C. Todd Lopez, quotes Jules W. Hurst III, assistant secretary of the Army “who is performing the duties of comptroller for the War Department,” as saying, “This payment is a ‘thank you’ from President Trump, the American people and Congress.” U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who chairs the Senate Committee on Armed Services, issued a statement Thursday commending Trump’s “swift action to implement the additional funding Congress provided to help offset housing costs for service members.”“This one-time payment, combined with an average 4.2 percent increase to the Basic Allowance for Housing and 3.8 percent military pay raise in 2026, will put real money in the pockets of our servicemembers and their families, helping provide greater stability and improved housing options as they manage the unique demands of military life,” Wicker said.",,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

(Provided by Flathead Electric Cooperative's Facebook site.)Utility crews are restoring power to customers affected by the recent wind storm in Montana, but some people could be without electricity for multiple days, and the weather caused greater damage than earlier assessed, according to reports from electricity providers.
NorthWestern Energy said Thursday its crews made significant progress repairing damage and restoring power for customers affected by outages caused by the strong wind storm that swept across the state on Wednesday.
Between Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning, crews had restored service for at least 35,000 Montana residences or businesses affected by outages, NorthWestern said.
NorthWestern estimated about 10,000 of its Montana customers were affected by outages Thursday afternoon. NorthWestern lists estimated repair times on its outage map when available.
Flathead Electric Cooperative also reported progress overnight with more than 50% of Wednesday’s outages fixed and 15,000 members restored in 24 hours.
However, the cooperative also said hurricane-force winds damaged the grid more extensively than originally assessed.
“Crews are at work addressing multiple outages and expect to make slow and steady progress today (Thursday),” the cooperative said in a social media update. “There are over 150 outages currently impacting the system.
The cooperative said some areas have experienced “severe damage” and the widespread outage is expected to last multiple days. It encouraged people to plan accordingly.
“This damage will take time to resolve because crews are encountering wet, saturated ground conditions which, combined with massive, uprooted trees laying across lines and muddy ground, are making it extremely difficult for heavy trucks and equipment to safely reach damaged lines and poles,” the cooperative said.
NorthWestern Energy said dangerous weather conditions required crews to pause work overnight in some areas, including Elk Park north of Butte and Lincoln.
Crews were back in the field Thursday morning and will continue working until all customers are restored, the utility said.
However, NorthWestern Energy also noted a new weather system is expected to bring more snow and wind to Montana on Thursday evening.
It encouraged people to fully charge their electronic and mobile devices, power banks and other backups, and to prepare emergency outage kits with essentials.
“NorthWestern Energy is preparing with crews staffed, equipment and supplies ready to respond to any outages as quickly as possible, safely, to restore service,” the utility said.
In Helena, NorthWestern crews worked through Wednesday night to restore power to the Helena Regional Airport, the utility said.
In Superior, a generator was installed at the Town Pump convenience store to keep gasoline sales operating amid widespread outages along I-90 west of Missoula, NorthWestern said.
“Call volume to NorthWestern Energy’s Customer Service Center on Wednesday alone was equivalent to a typical full month, underscoring the impact of the storm across the state and the increase in customer calls that were being responded to by customer service representatives working around the clock,” NorthWestern said.
The utility said for the safety of customers and communities, power lines are being manually patrolled before being reenergized, which results in a longer restoration time for some outages.
“We appreciate customers’ patience during this challenging event,” NorthWestern Energy said.
 


Tips from NorthWestern
Safety Reminder
As residents inspect their property after the storm, watch for downed power lines hidden under debris. Always assume any downed line is energized and dangerous — stay far away and report it immediately.
Check your meter mast and base
Heavy windstorms can damage the meter bases and masts on homes and buildings.
If your meter base is damaged, you must contact a licensed electrician to make repairs before service can be restored safely.
Even if damage is visible, never attempt to make repairs yourself. Service lines can carry up to 240 volts of electricity, which can cause severe injury or start a fire.
Repairs can only be made by a licensed electrician.

The Trump administration pushes nuclear power center stage. Vermont’s congressional delegation works to help communities storing the radioactive fuel left behind.

While the nuclear renaissance grips Washington, Vermont’s congressional delegation introduced a bill this week seeking more local control over the closure of nuclear plants.
U.S. Sens. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., along with U.S. Rep. Becca Balint,  D-Vt., joined with others to give states a more meaningful role in the development and approval of shutting down old nuclear reactors through the Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2025. 
Local groups that oversee the shutdown process, called community advisory boards, would receive more support under the law, and communities that host the reactors would get more money through grant programs. Those communities would also get more say in what happens when plants close or change ownership. 
In Vermont, the town of Vernon saw its nuclear plant close down in 2014, leading to job loss and economic disruption in a rural community. In the decade since, more than 1,000 tons of nuclear waste have been left behind, according to cleanup contractor NorthStar.
Adding parameters suggested in the bill to federal statute could become salient as nuclear energy grows, with plans to add 15 new reactors globally in 2026, including formerly retired U.S. plants.
“For too long, working class communities across the country have been forced to deal with the safety and economic consequences of nuclear power plant(s) while having virtually no say in the plans, which the people of Vernon understand all too well,” Sanders said in a media release.
The shuttering of Vermont Yankee
Vernon is the host community for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, a 650-megawatt plant that opened in 1972 on a curve along the Connecticut River. The plant produced more than a third of the state’s electricity while operating, but it closed in 2014, outcompeted by cheap natural gas and following decades of anti-nuclear activism in the state.
The closure came after a battle between the state and Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, a Louisiana-based energy company that bought the facility a decade earlier. That company wanted to keep the plant open until 2032; the state wanted the plant to close in 2012, at the end of its operational license. Lawsuits followed, including a nationally watched debate over who had more control over nuclear energy: the state or the federal government. In the end, the parties settled.

Entergy transferred ownership of the site to a cleanup contractor, NorthStar Group Services Inc., which will decommission the plant by the end of 2026, four years ahead of schedule, according to a September report. A community group, the Vermont Nuclear Decommissioning Citizen Advisory Panel, formed under state statute to follow the progress in quarterly meetings, because decommissioning plans were convoluted and difficult to track.
“In Vernon, the loss of steady information, limited local capacity and the lack of predictable planning dollars made it much harder for the region to adapt,” said Adam Grinold, executive director of the Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation, an economic growth engine in the region that endorsed the legislation, in a statement. “A community can only react for so long before momentum slips away.”
The era of old nuclear fuel
The nation has no solution for long-term storage of nuclear waste, known as spent nuclear fuel, from such plants. 
While other countries have successfully sited long-term storage facilities — managed waste sites where fuel is stored thousands of feet underground — the U.S. is nowhere close to such construction after decades-long plans to store the waste at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain were canned during former President Barack Obama’s tenure. 
Right now, spent fuel is often stored on or near the decommissioned site in dry casks meant to keep people and the environment safe from dangerous levels of radiation. That’s the situation in Vernon, where 58 dry casks are stored on site. 
Under the Senate bill introduced by Welch and others, host communities like Vernon could be paid $15 per kilogram of waste. Vermont Yankee houses 1.2 million kilograms of waste in its dry casks. Under the bill, the nearby community could earn more than $10 million annually, according to Welch’s office, or about $90 million through fiscal year 2035, if the bill passes during the 2026 congressional session.
But that passage is unlikely, according to Welch’s office.
While support for nuclear power is a rare overlap between Republicans and Democrats, the bill did not receive bipartisan support, a point made when state leaders and community members assembled at a virtual Dec. 8 meeting hosted by the citizens advisory panel. 
That’s partly because the bill is asking for a lot of money for nuclear communities, according to Welch’s office. The law also comes in response to moves by the Trump administration to weaken the independence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent federal body that oversees the licensing and safety regulations of U.S. nuclear sites.

An uncertain future
Vernon’s nuclear future remains uncertain. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy is pushing to find a home for stranded nuclear waste, including in communities like Windham County.
In November, a pro-nuclear energy nonprofit based in California, the Good Energy Collective, hosted a two-day meeting in Vernon to discuss why a community might be interested in hosting a consolidated 15,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. That’s more than 12 times the amount of waste stored in Vernon today. While no communities have signed on to hosting such a high volume of waste, the federal government is searching for one.
The Energy Department has the sole legal authority and responsibility to remove spent fuel from the Vermont Yankee site, according to Scott State, NorthStar CEO and chief nuclear officer. Some of those low-level radioactive materials from the decommissioning process are stored at a facility in Andrews County, Texas. NorthStar once hoped to send more nuclear waste to Texas until a federal court decision blocked the transportation in 2023.
This summer, that decision was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Texas site “provides a safe and economical interim storage option for spent fuel from Vermont Yankee,” State said in an email. But the Energy Department hasn’t developed the infrastructure needed to transport spent fuel there, State said.
“NorthStar has no control over either the timing of spent fuel removal or the choice of final or interim storage location,” State wrote. “NorthStar’s only responsibility is to ensure that spent fuel remains safely and securely stored while it remains on the Vermont Yankee site.”

Jim Hunt, the longest serving governor in North Carolina history, who championed education and served as a decades-long stalwart for the state’s Democratic Party, died Thursday, according to Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt, his daughter. He was 88.  
“It is with deep sadness that I share the passing of my beloved daddy and hero, former Gov. Jim Hunt,” Rachel Hunt said in a statement Thursday. “He devoted his life to serving the people of North Carolina, guided by a belief that public service should expand opportunity, strengthen communities, and always put people first. His leadership and compassion left a lasting impact on the lives of countless North Carolinians.
“To our family, he was a loving husband, dad, and granddad whose kindness and steady hand shaped our lives in immeasurable ways,” she continued. “We are profoundly grateful for the outpouring of love and support as we mourn and celebrate his extraordinary life.”
Hunt served four terms as North Carolina governor, from 1977-1985 and then again from 1993-2000. 
In 1984, he ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Jesse Helms, but lost after a hard-fought, bruising campaign that was the most expensive Senate race in history at the time. 
He was known as the “education governor,” promoting pre-kindergarten — he created the state’s “Smart Start” program in the 1990s — as well as higher teacher pay. He founded the N.C. School of Science and Mathematics in Durham.  
Hunt was also an advocate for technology-centered economic development, establishing the N.C. Biotechnology Center and helping to recruit a number of major tenants to Research Triangle Park. 
Hunt also convinced North Carolina voters in 1996 to amend the state’s constitution to give the governor veto power. The amendment was approved by a 3-to-1 margin.   
Born in Greensboro, Hunt earned degrees at NC State and UNC School of Law. He worked in Nepal and on Democratic campaigns before running and winning his own campaign for lieutenant governor in 1972.
After four years as lieutenant governor, during which he helped lead efforts to make kindergarten mandatory and raise teacher pay, he ran and won the governorship. 
Even after he retired from elected office, Hunt continued to be a driving force in the North Carolina Democratic Party for many years, shaping the state-level candidates who followed him, and stumping and fundraising for a who’s-who list of Democratic presidential candidates. 
In his later years, he also founded the Hunt Institute at Duke University, a nonprofit education policy think tank, as well as the Institute for Emerging Issues at N.C. State, a nonprofit that studies a broader range of public policy issues.
Gov. Josh Stein, in a statement Thursday, said he “can think of no one who shaped North Carolina’s recent successes as much as Gov. Jim Hunt.”
“Governor for 16 years, he was a visionary who founded Smart Start, raised teacher pay, protected air quality, and created the NC Biotech Center,” Stein said. On a personal level, he was a mentor and dear friend. Anna and I are keeping Carolyn, Rachel, and the entire Hunt family in our thoughts and prayers. May Gov. Hunt’s memory be a blessing. He certainly was for North Carolina.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-18 21:37:51+00:00,Mississippi Today,Greenwood Leflore Hospital reaches deal with state Medicaid officials to repay remainder of its $5.5 million debt,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/18/greenwood-leflore-medicaid-debt/,The overpayments stemmed from calculations by the Division of Medicaid based on old data that did not reflect lower patient volumes after the hospital closed its labor and delivery and intensive care units in 2022.,"Greenwood Leflore Hospital and the Mississippi Division of Medicaid reached an agreement Thursday in a dispute that hospital leaders said could otherwise force the facility to close.
The compromise, reached during a Hinds County Chancery Court hearing, gives both sides more time to negotiate a plan for the hospital to repay $5.5 million in Medicaid overpayments made last year. The agency has already recouped about $2 million of the funds. Under the deal, the Greenwood public hospital must secure a property bond by Jan. 31 to guarantee repayment of the debt or the Division of Medicaid could withhold scheduled payments to the hospital.
The conflict began after the Division of Medicaid notified the hospital in June it would recoup $5.5 million in state-directed payments, or supplemental funds intended to offset low Medicaid reimbursement rates. Hospital leaders warned the agency in September that the proposed repayment schedule of $900,000 a quarter — with about $2 million already recovered this year — would severely strain the long-struggling hospital and could lead to its closure. The facility serves about 300,000 patients in the Mississippi Delta, a region of the state with limited access to medical care. 
The overpayments stemmed from calculations by the Division of Medicaid based on old data that did not reflect lower patient volumes after the hospital closed its labor and delivery and intensive care units in 2022. Hospitals were notified two years ago that a reconciliation would occur in 2025, according to the Division of Medicaid, though they did not know at the time how much they would owe. 
Greenwood Leflore is one of 30 hospitals overpaid a total of $48 million during the state’s 2024 fiscal year, Marchand previously told Mississippi Today.
The recoupment amount is significant for the 35-bed hospital, which operates a physician-staffed emergency room and offers general, vascular and outpatient orthopedic surgery, cancer care and a full suite of diagnostic services. The hospital’s total operating expenses were $74.7 million in the 2023 fiscal year, according to an audit performed that year. 
Tensions escalated this month after the Division of Medicaid reversed an earlier repayment agreement and instead accelerated the recovery, saying it would withhold $2.5 million in supplemental payments this month, according to an affidavit filed in court by the hospital. Weeks earlier, on Dec. 1, the agency said it would pause recoupments until March of next year, according to hospital leaders. 
“We will make our last payroll tomorrow,” interim hospital CEO Gary Marchand testified at the Dec. 18 court hearing before the agreement was reached. He warned that once the hospital announces layoffs, licensed professionals on staff will take jobs elsewhere and make it difficult to reopen the hospital, even under new leadership.

After the Division of Medicaid paused recovery of the funds for two months, Greenwood Leflore Hospital proposed several plans for repayment within three years. The hospital said these plans would buy it time to first begin receiving higher payments for Medicare patients, which are expected as a result of the hospital’s acceptance to the federal Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program earlier this year. The program allows selected hospitals to be reimbursed based on their actual costs for inpatient care instead of a fixed amount. The designation is expected to increase the hospital’s Medicare inpatient payments by about $1.3 million a year, said Marchand in a Dec. 18 memo to staff and board members.
“We thought we had finally climbed out of the COVID hole,” Marchand said Thursday of the hospital’s acceptance into the program. The hospital also began providing skilled nursing care for people recovering after hospital stays this year, but will not begin receiving the higher payments for these services until late 2026.
But the Division of Medicaid said in September it did not agree with the solutions for repayment proposed by the hospital and denied the hospital’s request for an administrative appeal process on the matter. The hospital then appealed the matter in Hinds County Chancery Court, asking a judge to uphold the hospital’s right to recourse and pause the pending recoupments. 
Janet McMurtray, an attorney representing Mississippi Medicaid, argued the hospital did not have the grounds to appeal and it is not the responsibility of Medicaid to bail the hospital out of its ongoing dire financial straits. 
“They have not put their house in order,” she said. “…I don’t know what is going to save this hospital, but it’s not going to be Medicaid.”
The Division of Medicaid said it needed security before discussing a repayment plan, she said, emphasizing the agency’s responsibility to recoup the payment in order to keep the supplemental payments program in balance for all hospitals. 
In a letter dated Dec. 17, Senate Public Health Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, and House Public Health Committee Chairman Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, encouraged Judge J. Dewayne Thomas to pause the repayments to give lawmakers time to pursue remedies during the upcoming Legislative session. 
“Greenwood Leflore Hospital serves as a critical lifeline for thousands of residents, providing essential medical services that would otherwise be inaccessible,” wrote the chairmen. “Greenwood Leflore Hospital also serves as an important economic anchor in the Leflore County and wider Delta communities, employing more than 400 individuals.”
The hospital has faced a litany of financial challenges over the past several years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the hospital was losing between $7 million to $9 million a year, Marchand previously told Mississippi Today.
The pandemic only worsened the hospital’s precarious financial condition. To keep its doors open, the hospital shut down departments and clinics, went up for lease multiple times, drew down millions of dollars in credit, applied for grants from the state Legislature and pursued a more lucrative hospital designation. In 2023, the hospital suspended the use of 173 beds to control costs, according to an audit. 
Marchand, who plans to step down Jan. 1, repeatedly warned local leaders and state lawmakers that the hospital was on the verge of closure. 
To become more financially secure, the facility vied in 2023 to be designated a critical access hospital. These facilities are reimbursed by Medicare at a rate of 101%, theoretically allowing for a 1% profit. But its initial application was denied because critical access hospitals must be located 35 miles from the nearest hospital, and South Sunflower County Hospital in Indianola is closer, at 28 miles away. 
Greenwood Leflore was one of three hospitals in the state chosen for the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program in April.
The state-directed payments helped to stabilize Greenwood Leflore’s finances after it was forced to close valued services. But those payments are set to be reduced over time beginning in 2028 as a result of federal cuts to Medicaid included in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump in July. The hospital will remain open for now, but its long-term financial outlook may depend on how it adapts as those payments are gradually reduced.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/06091110/3X0A9410-scaled.jpg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Court of Appeals has agreed to hear the state’s appeal of a Nashville judge’s decision to temporarily block the Tennessee National Guard’s deployment to Memphis. 
The appeals court, setting an expedited timeline, has set a March 5 oral arguments date. 
The appellate court will review a Nov. 21 ruling by Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal to grant a temporary injunction barring the Guard from patrolling the streets of Memphis. The Guard was deployed to Memphis by Gov. Bill Lee as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened in September by President Donald Trump. 
In Memphis, volunteers document Task Force arrests and provide aid to those left behind

Moskal’s order never took effect; anticipating the state would appeal, her ruling was conditioned on an appeal being filed. The case is now on hold pending a ruling from the higher court.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and six other Democratic officials filed suit in October against Gov. Bill Lee, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Major General Warner Ross III of the Tennessee National Guard,  challenging the deployment as contrary to Tennessee law and the state constitution. 
The suit cited a 2021 opinion by former Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III that concluded, under the Tennessee Constitution, “only circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion permit the governor to call out the militia, and even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.” 
Skrmetti’s revised the decision in April 2024, writing that the Tennessee National Guard is only a militia for the purposes of a federal deployment. It was Lee who deployed the guard to Memphis, unlike other cities across the country that currently have a National Guard presence, ordered by the federal government.
Tennessee lawmaker says AG omitted, altered Guard deployment opinions

The lawsuit also cited state law that entrusts local officials with determining whether there has been a breakdown in law and order requiring the presence of the guard. 
State lawyers have argued the Tennessee National Guard is an “army” and not a militia constrained by Tennessee law and the constitution.
“The Governor, the sole State official elected by the entire voting population of Tennessee, is established as commander-in-chief by both Constitution and statute,” they wrote. “Fettering the Governor’s authority to identify those rare occasions when the Guard is necessary and mobilize the Guard accordingly will put future Tennesseans at grave risk.”
Members of the Guard have been patrolling the streets of Memphis since October as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by Trump to restore law and order to Memphis, whose violent crime rates have risen in recent years. Local officials have noted the rates had begun to fall before the Task Force was created. 
The number of National Guard in Memphis has fluctuated, but court filings last month said more than 700 are currently in the city. 
The appeals court asked both sides to weigh in on one additional question, beyond the arguments heard in Nashville: whether the case should have come before a three-judge panel instead of a single Chancery Court judge. Tennessee law requires certain challenges to state actions be heard in front of a panel of judges, one representing each geographic division of the state.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado air quality regulators on Thursday adopted new rules aimed at limiting emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the state’s landfills.
Members of the Air Quality Control Commission voted 6-0 to approve the new rules, concluding a yearlong rulemaking process that resulted in a compromise plan agreed to by environmental groups and public and private landfill operators.
Food waste and other organic material dumped in landfills produces methane and other pollutants as it decomposes. Colorado’s 59 landfills emit a combined 1.3 million tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions every year, a little over 1% of the state’s overall greenhouse gas emissions.

“Today’s decision is a meaningful victory for the health of Colorado communities,” Nikita Habermehl, a pediatrician and advocate with Healthy Air & Water Colorado, said in a statement. “Methane is a powerful climate pollutant that also worsens the air quality issues driving asthma, respiratory illness, and other preventable health harms — especially for children and those living closest to landfills.”
The new rules approved Thursday will require landfill operators to take a variety of steps to limit their emissions, including increased monitoring for leaks and requirements on the amount and types of soil that can be used as landfill cover.
Under Environmental Protection Agency rules, 12 of Colorado’s largest landfills are required to maintain gas collection and control systems, which can capture the waste methane, or combust it in a flare system to convert it to carbon dioxide, a less potent greenhouse gas. The AQCC’s rule would extend those requirements to approximately 16 additional mid-sized landfills, though the state’s smallest operators would still be exempt. It also requires open flares to be phased out and replaced by more efficient enclosed alternatives by 2029.










The rule approved by the commission is an important step forward on landfill emissions in Colorado.


– Alexandra Schluntz, attorney with Earthjustice


“The rule approved by the commission is an important step forward on landfill emissions in Colorado,” said Alexandra Schluntz, an attorney with environmental group Earthjustice. “While this does not do everything we hoped to see, it will make a real difference for the health of surrounding communities.”
After the AQCC held a formal rulemaking hearing on the proposal in August, staff from the state’s Air Pollution Control Division last month submitted a series of revisions to the rule, weakening it at the request of waste industry groups and local governments that operate public landfills.
Prior to the vote, AQCC commissioner Jon Slutsky said the revised rule didn’t go far enough to meet the state’s greenhouse gas reduction goals, objecting to an increase in the emissions threshold that triggers monitoring requirements and corrective action, which he called the “heart of the regulation.” Slutsky moved to strike the revisions from the rule, but his fellow commissioners declined to discuss or second his motion.
“It’s always good to have a consensus,” said commissioner Martha Rudolph. “Not everybody likes what happens in a consensus, but I personally believe that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.”

Who is eligible for CARE Court? How do I file a petition? Can this program force someone into treatment? Read on to find out.


Information accurate as of December 2025. Please be aware that CalMatters is not continuously updating this story. 
What is CARE Court?
CARE, which stands for Community Assistance, Recovery and Empowerment, is a court-based way to deliver mental health and substance use treatment to Californians struggling with a severe mental illness. The program launched in a handful of California counties in October 2023, and rolled out in the entire state in December 2024.
Who is CARE Court for?
To be eligible for CARE Court, someone must be diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, or another similar psychotic disorder. They must be 18 years old, and not already receiving adequate mental health care.
Starting on January 1, the program will expand to include people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder.
Who can refer someone into CARE Court?
One thing that makes CARE Court unique is that it’s not just doctors who can refer someone into the program – family members, EMTs and others also have that ability. 
A petition for CARE Court can be filed by a person’s immediate family (parents, siblings, grandparents or children) or by their roommate. First responders (law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, crisis response teams and homeless outreach workers) can also file petitions, as can hospitals and other behavioral health providers. If someone is in a conservatorship, the public guardian can file a petition to move the person down from conservatorship into CARE Court. And the court can refer someone into CARE Court if they have been charged with a misdemeanor.
Someone can also file a petition for themselves, known as a self-petition. 
How do you file a petition?
First, fill out a CARE Court petition, available here. You must also fill out a mental health declaration (available here), or provide evidence that the person was held for intensive treatment at least twice, including once in the past 60 days. 
Next, file the paperwork with the correct division in your county courthouse. In some places, you can do that electronically. Otherwise, make three copies of each form and either bring them to the courthouse in person, or mail them. 
The court will then determine if the petition meets its requirements. If the petition is accepted, whoever filed the petition must appear at the first court hearing, at which point the court will decide if the person can participate in CARE Court.
Then what happens?
If someone is accepted into CARE Court, the court orders the county to work with them on a voluntary “CARE agreement,” which can include mental health and substance abuse treatment, housing, and other services, as needed. The CARE Court participant is represented by counsel during this process – often a public defender. Then, the participant attends regular court hearings for the next year to report on their progress, bring up questions or complaints, or request different or additional services.
If they cannot reach a CARE agreement, the court can order a CARE plan (see below).
After one year, the participant can either graduate from the program or continue for up to one more year.
Can CARE Court force someone into treatment?
No, not really. When Gov. Newsom first proposed the program in 2022, he said it would come with ways to hold participants accountable if they didn’t follow through with their treatment. But coercive treatment is controversial, after the country’s troubled history of locking patients in psychiatric hospitals led to the mass closure of those facilities in the 1950s and 1960s. 
Participants in the program can sign up for a voluntary “CARE agreement,” through which they can get access to housing, mental health care and other services. If they refuse, a judge can impose a court-ordered “CARE plan.” But that’s very rare. So far, judges have ordered CARE plans just 22 times throughout the entire state. Some counties have eschewed CARE plans altogether, preferring instead to make the program entirely voluntary.
Even if a judge does order a CARE plan, the program has no teeth to enforce the order. Clinicians cannot force CARE Court participants to take medication, nor can a participant be punished for refusing medication. If someone fails to complete an ordered CARE plan, the court could put them on a path to conservatorship, according to the state.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)A Minnesota safety net program was so easy to scam, it attracted tourists, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said Thursday.
Two Philadelphia men, Anthony Waddell Jefferson, 37, and Lester Brown, 53, heard that Minnesota’s Housing Stabilization Services program was “easy money,” so they traveled to Minnesota, enrolled their companies into the program, returned to Philly and submitted fraudulent claims from there, Thompson said in a news conference announcing charges against the two men and several others. They obtained $3.5 million in Medicaid payments through this “fraud tourism,” Thompson said.
The extent of fraud in Minnesota human services programs — which has become infamous across the country — is even higher than the public knew.
Providers in 14 “high-risk,” state-run Medicaid programs being audited by the state have billed $18 billion since 2018, and “half or more” is possibly fraudulent, Thompson said.
“The fraud is not small. It isn’t isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated,” Thompson said. “What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It’s a staggering, industrial-scale fraud. It’s swamping Minnesota and calling into question everything we know about our state.”
It’s unclear how much of the $18 billion in the 14 Medicaid services comes from state taxpayer dollars; around 36% of all Minnesota Medicaid dollars comes from the state, while the rest is funded by the federal government.
Federal prosecutors also charged three other individuals who allegedly defrauded House Stabilization Services and two individuals for defrauding an autism treatment program called Early Intensive Development and Behavior Intervention. Federal prosecutors have already charged eight people in HSS and one person for defrauding the autism program.
The Department of Human Services in August shut down the Housing Stabilization Services, citing “credible allegations of fraud.”
“I am grateful for the U.S. Attorney’s actions to prosecute criminals attacking and stealing from Minnesota’s programs,” said temporary DHS Commissioner Shireen Gandhi in a statement. “We will continue to support their efforts by sharing any data and information we have that can hold these criminals accountable.”
Thompson said that there’s no indication that fraudsters have sent money to terrorist groups, contrary to a November article saying that Minnesota taxpayer dollars have funded the Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab — a claim that has led to President Donald Trump’s current attacks on Minnesota’s Somali-American community.
Thompson added that money from fraud could have indirectly ended up in the hands of al-Shabaab, which taxes businesses in the areas of Somalia it controls.

New federal investigation into fraud in disability program
Federal agents raided the Bloomington office of another provider, Ultimate Home Health Services, Thursday morning, executing a search warrant that is the first indication of a federal investigation into Integrated Community Supports, another state-run Medicaid program.
Integrated Community Supports started in 2021 and is designed to help disabled adults live more independently in apartments rather than in an institution. The program is vulnerable to fraud and has seen soaring cost increases since it began, paying out $170 million in 2024 compared to $4.6 million in 2021, according to the search warrant filed by the feds.
The ongoing federal investigation found that, instead of providing services, many Integrated Community Supports providers simply rented apartments to Medicaid recipients and billed the program for services they didn’t provide, Thompson said. The program allows providers to bill hundreds of dollars a day, often adding up to $100,000 to $200,000 a year, per client, he said.
Ultimate Home Health Services billed the program $1.1 million between June 2024 and August 2025 for services for multiple individuals it didn’t provide, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney General’s office and the search warrant.
The search warrant also referenced a KARE 11 report from November about a man found dead in the care of Ultimate Home Health Services in March. Though the provider was billing DHS for 12 hours of one-on-one care for the man, an employee of Ultimate told St. Paul Police that he only checked on him once a day.
Following the report, the Department of Human Services suspended Ultimate Home Health Services’ payments and license in December, citing that the agency found in October that Ultimate Home Health wasn’t adequately providing services and failed to properly report cases of maltreatment and the death of a person.
As of late November, DHS has withheld payments to more than 17 Integrated Community Supports providers suspected of fraud or affiliated with allegedly fraudulent providers, according to a statement at the time from DHS. Amid DHS’s effort to crack down on fraud in the Medicaid program, attorneys for program recipients have criticized the state agency for neglecting its responsibilities toward disabled people who depend on the program for critical services.
The Thursday raid drew the attention of immigrant rights activists, who have been closely tracking Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity. Many responded to the scene of the raid, but the majority dispersed after it became apparent that the activity was not immigration-related.
A handful of observers watched as agents loaded boxes of evidence into vans, leaving behind a broken office door window and damaged door frame.
Democrats’ response
Fraud has roiled Minnesota politics in recent years and it will continue to dominate headlines through the midterm elections. Shortly before Thursday’s press conference, Gov. Tim Walz and House and Senate Democrats criticized the House Fraud Prevention and State Oversight Committee for “playing politics” with fraud.
During a fraud committee hearing Wednesday Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, alleged that DHS paid state money to a defendant in the Feeding Our Future case through the assisted living program while they were awaiting trial.
Democrats criticized her for presenting her allegations in a public forum rather than going to state investigators.
Walz on Thursday praised the federal charges and said Minnesota doesn’t tolerate fraud.
“This is exactly the type of strong action we need from prosecutors to ensure fraudsters are put behind bars,” Walz said in a statement. “This infuriating greed and criminal activity is why we took action earlier this year to shut down Housing Stabilization Services and hired an outside firm to audit these programs and stop payments to fraudulent providers.”

There’s still more than 10 months until Floridians elect a successor to Ron DeSantis, but there’s no question the Naples Republican is in the pole position after his campaign announced Thursday that he has raised more than $40 million since February.
How impressive is that?
“For perspective, that is 2½ times what then-candidate Ron DeSantis raised and $3 million more than Adam Putnam raised in total in the last open Republican gubernatorial primary in 2018,” writes Ryan Smith, the Donalds’ campaign’s chief strategist, in a memo published Thursday.
Donalds also continues to dominate in most public-opinion polls of the candidates running in the August 2026 Republican primary, despite having yet to air a single television ad.
A survey of 800 Republican primary voters taken Dec. 8-9 by The American Promise showed Donalds with a 27-point lead over Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, 38%-9%. (While Collins is not a declared candidate for governor, a political committee has been running ads for weeks in certain key Florida media markets touting him as such. Pollster Ryan Tyson said in a memo that the survey was taken to determine whether those ads helped Collins at all. It appears they have not).
In addition to being endorsed by Donald Trump, Donalds is backed by Florida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott as well as 17 of the state’s 20 members of Congress and 63 members of the Florida House of Representatives.
The other major Republican candidates are former House Speaker Paul Renner and investment firm CEO James Fishback.

The ruling is the latest setback for the Vermont Attorney General’s Office in its legal actions against the New York-based company. An earlier lawsuit brought by the state was also dismissed.

A Vermont judge has tossed out a lawsuit brought by the state against a New York-based facial recognition software company, alleging violations of consumer protection laws.
Washington County Superior Court Judge Daniel Richardson this week granted Clearview AI’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was brought earlier this year by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office.
“The largely uncontested record here shows that Clearview conducts no substantial business in Vermont and never has,” Richardson wrote the eight-page ruling, throwing out the case on jurisdictional grounds. 
“It does not have any Vermont customers using its database,” Richardson added of Clearview, “and there is no allegation that Clearview’s data-collection activity bears any connection specific to Vermont whatsoever.”
The state’s suit against Clearview alleged the company had violated Vermont’s Consumer Protection Act by collecting photographs from the internet and then storing the unique facial biometric identifiers of Vermonters — including children — in its database, all without the knowledge or consent of Vermonters.The company has drawn the ire of privacy advocates over its practices, leading to other legal actions.
Asked Thursday if she planned to appeal the ruling, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark said in a statement to VTDigger that her office was considering its options.
“Unfortunately,” Clark said “the ruling focused on the contacts by Clearview to a purchaser of their product, but not the likely hundreds of thousands of Vermonters whose faces make up the product. We aren’t the purchaser; we are the purchased.”
Clark said Vermont lawmakers should look into how to address the issue raised by the state in the lawsuit.  
“This ruling is a call to the Legislature to act to protect Vermonters — the court has told us they cannot help us,” Clark said. “This is a classic example of technology outpacing the law.”
Clearview, in a statement Thursday to VTDigger, praised the judge’s ruling.“Clearview AI does not operate in Vermont, and today’s ruling appropriately recognizes that courts should exercise jurisdiction over companies with which they have a meaningful connection,” the statement read.
According to the lawsuit, while Vermont law provides limits on the use of biometric information by state and local law enforcement, Clearview sells access to other state and federal law enforcement.
The state also alleged that Clearview’s actions were invading the privacy of Vermonters, exposing their personal data to potential theft and fraud by bad actors, and provided no way for Vermonters to opt out. 
The lawsuit sought a declaration that Clearview violated the Vermont Consumer Protection Act, permanent injunctions against most of its business practices related to Vermont, civil penalties, and a requirement that all Vermont consumers’ photographs be deleted from their databases.
In announcing the filing of the lawsuit in April, Clark said in a statement she was “highly disturbed” that Clearview’s actions were taken without the consent of Vermonters, particularly when it came to children. 
“This practice violates Vermont law and is chilling in this moment when the federal government’s overreach in matters like immigration enforcement are impacting our communities here in Vermont,” Clark said at the time.
An earlier lawsuit brought by the state against Clearview in Chittenden County Superior civil court in Burlington was also thrown out by a state judge, who ruled it was not the proper venue for the case.
The refiled case by Clark was brought in Washington County Superior civil court in Montpelier, where the lawsuit stated the venue is proper “because Plaintiff the State of Vermont is deemed to reside in Washington County for purposes of civil actions.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried is blasting proposed legislation introduced this week by Florida Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia aimed at increasing local government spending transparency — specifically, a provision that would allow removal of local officials found to have committed “financial abuse.”
The legislation, scheduled to be filed ahead of the coming legislative session in the Florida House by Rep. Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, and in the Senate by Nick DiCeglie, R-Indian Rocks Beach, would increase local government transparency and formally establish Ingoglia’s Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight (FAFO) effort into statute.
The proposal includes a provision that would codify the state’s CFO’s ability to recommend removal of any elected official who is found to have committed “financial abuse, malfeasance or misfeasance.”
“I have heard zero from our new CFO about what he plans on doing to hold our property insurance companies accountable,” Fried said on a Zoom conference call on Thursday. “Instead, he’s bullying our local governments, creating fictitious formulas, and now he wants to overreach even more by putting a clause in there about removing elected local officials.”
More than any recent governor, Ron DeSantis has aggressively exercised the power within his office to remove elected officials from office, including school board members, sheriffs, and most controversially, two Democratic state prosecutors, Andrew Warren in Hillsborough County and Monique Worrell in Orange and Osceola counties.
Worrell rebounded from her 2023 suspension, winning re-election by a large margin in 2024.
“We see how Ron DeSantis has abused that power throughout his eight years in this administration, and so that is just them bullying our local governments that are the ones who are closest to the people,” Fried added.
In addition to those above listed suspensions, Attorney General James Uthmeier threatened other local governments officials in Florida earlier this year in Orange County and Key West when they raised objections to signing 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In the case of Orange County, Mayor Jerry Demings said in August that he signed an updated agreement with ICE under “protest and extreme duress” after Uthmeier threatened the mayor and all six county commissioners that their failure to do so would result in their removal from office by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Other provisions in the legislation introduced by Ingoglia at a press conference in Tampa on Wednesday include allowing the Department of Financial Services to pursue financial penalties from local governments if they don’t respond to inquiries “promptly,” including by withholding any state funds until they do so.
“If we ask for the information on a Monday, and we’re giving you five days to compile the information — get it in five days; if you don’t, then you face a $1,000 a day penalty,” he said at the press conference.
The legislation comes as Ingoglia continues to make the case that local governments have been engaged in “excessive and wasteful spending” by comparing their fiscal year 2024-2025 budgets with what they were spending in 2019-2020. So far, after reviewing the budgets of 11 local governments this year, he says they have engaged collectively in $1.86 billion in alleged wasteful and excessive spending.
Local government officials who have received those FAFO audits have questioned the accuracy of the methodology used by the CFO’s auditors. Ingoglia has called such criticisms “bogus” and “not well thought out.”
Fried argued that if Ingoglia were serious about cutting excessive government spending, he should look inside the DeSantis administration’s own spending excesses. She referred to a Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald story published last week reporting that the DeSantis administration spent $36.2 million in taxpayer funds last year to purchase ads against the proposed marijuana and abortion ballot measures, both of which were contested by the governor.
“If [Ingoglia] wants to talk about saving dollars and making sure that the people are getting a return to the taxes they have put into this state, he should be focused on what’s happening in Tallahassee,” she said. “Ron DeSantis stole $38 million from the people of this state, and so that’s really where the attacks should be. That’s where his energy should be.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-10-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

Brandon Steele, an attorney by trade who represented the Beckley area in the state House of Delegates and who often gave impassioned speeches during legislative proceedings, resigned from his elected position on Thursday.
He submitted his resignation through a letter sent to the House Clerk before 9 a.m. on Thursday, according to House Communications Director Ann Ali. In the letter, he said the resignation was effective immediately.
Steele, a Republican, told Lootpress — an online publication he founded in 2020 and continues to own — that his resignation was necessary due to “professional opportunities” arising that would “interfere” with his work in the House.
He said he was “honored” to serve his constituents and will “always cherish the time” he spent in the body.
Steele has served in the House since 2018 and previously served as chair of the House Committee on Government Organization. 
His resignation this week comes nearly a year after he was involved in a domestic disturbance where, according to a police report, his wife called 911 due to Steele drunkenly handling assault rifles and screaming at people in their neighborhood on Dec. 23, 2024. 
In 911 calls, Brianne Steele told police that Brandon Steele was “extremely agitated and very, very drunk” and that their three children, who were home at the time of the incident, were “terrified.” No arrests were made.
On Jan. 7, 2025 Brandon Steele was selected to serve as chairman on the House Judiciary Committee. That same day, a copy of the police report and recordings of the 911 calls from the disturbance were sent to members of the media and House leadership. The next day, Brandon Steele skipped his swearing in ceremony and on Jan. 17, he was removed as chairman of House Judiciary after a private conversation with House Speaker Roger Hanshaw.
Brandon Steele told West Virginia Watch in January that the “rumors” being spread surrounding the domestic disturbance were “vicious and disheartening.” He denied any wrongdoing.
In August, according to The Real WV, Brianne Steele — who works as the Raleigh County Circuit Clerk — filed an emergency protective order against Brandon Steele. That protective order mandated that Brandon Steele not be within 100 yards of Brianne Steele or her residence. 
Brandon Steele was reelected to his House seat in 2024, meaning a year remains in his term. Following his resignation, the Raleigh County Republican Executive Committee will submit three candidates to Gov. Patrick Morrisey to serve the remainder of the term. Morrisey will then appoint one of those candidates to the seat. 
The 2026 regular legislative session is scheduled to start on Jan. 14, 2026.

,DC,2025-12-18 21:03:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump health agency proposes rules to limit gender-affirming care for youth,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-health-agency-proposes-rules-limit-gender-affirming-care-youth,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s administration took major steps Thursday in a campaign to block minors’ access to gender-affirming care nationwide. Under two proposed new rules from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hospitals would be barred from providing gender transition treatment for children as a condition of participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, and Medicaid funding would be prohibited from being used to fund such care for minors. As most hospitals receive Medicare and Medicaid funding, the rules would essentially have the effect of a nationwide ban if they are finalized. The announcement came a day after the U.S. House passed a bill that would impose federal criminal penalties for gender-affirming care for minors and hours before it advanced a separate measure that would prohibit Medicaid funding for gender transition treatment for minors. The proposed regulations, which will next undergo a period of public comments, are certain to draw legal challenges.The efforts build on Trump’s executive order in January that restricted access to gender-affirming care for kids. More than half of states already have laws or policies aimed at limiting youth access to gender-affirming care, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz announced the proposals alongside several other health officials at a press conference at HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C. The room featured a handful of GOP members of Congress. At least two Republican state attorneys general — Ken Paxton of Texas and Todd Rokita of Indiana — were also in attendance.At the press conference, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the FDA is also sending “warning letters” to 12 breast binder manufacturers and sellers for “illegal marketing of breast binders for children for the purposes of treating gender dysphoria.” Breast binders are used to flatten tissue in the chest.  Kennedy said his agency’s Office for Civil Rights is moving to “reverse the Biden administration’s attempt to include gender dysphoria within the definition of disability.” House passes anti-transgender bills The proposed rules are part of the Trump administration’s broader anti-trans agenda. Trump has signed executive orders that make it the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,” aimed to bar openly transgender service members from the U.S. military, and sought to prohibit trans athletes from competing on women’s sports teams consistent with their gender identity.Meanwhile, efforts at the congressional level to restrict youth access to gender-affirming care face a dismal path in the Senate, where any legislation would likely need the backing of at least 60 senators to advance past the filibuster.The House passed a measure Wednesday night, 216-211, that would subject medical professionals to up to 10 years in prison for providing gender-affirming care for minors. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who sponsored the legislation, called its passage a “win for children all over America,” in a social media post Wednesday. It’s likely the last legislative achievement for the Georgia Republican, who is resigning from Congress in early January. Four Republicans voted against the measure: Reps. Gabe Evans of Colorado, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Mike Kennedy of Utah and Mike Lawler of New York.Three Democrats voted with the GOP to back the bill: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas and Don Davis of North Carolina.The House also passed a measure Thursday, 215-201, from Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Greene that aims to prohibit “Medicaid funding for gender transition procedures for minors.” Cuellar, Gonzalez and Davis also backed the GOP-led bill, along with fellow Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state. ‘Cruel and unconstitutional attacks’ Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, blasted the administration’s proposals, saying they “would put Donald Trump and RFK Jr. in those doctor’s offices, ripping health care decisions from the hands of families and putting it in the grips of the anti-LGBTQ+ fringe.”  Robinson also emphasized that the rules are “proposals, not binding law,” and called on community members, health care providers, administrators and allies to “be vocal in pushing back by sharing the ways these proposals would be devastating to their families and the healthcare community at large.” The American Civil Liberties Union also condemned the administration’s proposals and vowed to challenge the efforts in court. Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Rights Project, dubbed the proposals “cruel and unconstitutional attacks on the rights of transgender youth and their families.” Strangio said the proposals would “force doctors to choose between their ethical obligations to their patients and the threat of losing federal funding” and “uproot families who have already fled state-level bans, leaving them with nowhere to turn for the care they need to survive and thrive.”",,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

This has sparked yet another clash between the federal government and Washington state, where leaders are aiming to get coal power out of the electricity grid […]","An undated aerial view of TransAlta's coal-fired power plant in Centralia, Washington. (Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)The Trump administration has ordered Washington’s last coal-fired power station to continue burning coal, just weeks before it was scheduled to shut down and convert to natural gas fuel.
This has sparked yet another clash between the federal government and Washington state, where leaders are aiming to get coal power out of the electricity grid by year-end. Officials here aren’t ruling out the possibility of a lawsuit over the move.
Tuesday evening’s emergency order by the U.S. Department of Energy would keep TransAlta’s coal unit going in Centralia for 90 more days. The order comes amid Washington’s broader shift to use cleaner energy, such as solar and wind power, while reducing power from fossil fuels.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright wrote in the order that, “the emergency conditions resulting from increasing demand and accelerated retirement of generation facilities will continue in the near term and are also likely to continue in subsequent years.”
The Canada-based TransAlta and then-Gov. Christine Gregoire’s administration negotiated the Centralia plant’s end-of-year shutdown schedule more than a dozen years ago. The Washington state Legislature passed that negotiated agreement into state law.
This week’s federal order throws a wrench in that plan and raises questions about what exactly will happen in the near future at the plant.
A statement by TransAlta said the company is evaluating the directive and will work with the state and federal governments.
“The coal-to-gas conversion project, announced on December 9, 2025, remains a priority for TransAlta,” the company added.
In an interview Wednesday, a senior state House Democrat who helped craft Washington’s clean-energy laws had choice words about the federal order. 
“I thought it was so transparently stupid that I hoped they’d have thought better of it,” said House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle.
Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act, passed by the Legislature in 2019, requires utilities to stop providing coal power to Washington customers by the end of this year. 
Fitzgibbon, who helped craft Washington’s clean-energy laws, said he doubted utilities in Oregon and California would want to buy coal power from Centralia. He called Canadian-owned TransAlta the “obvious loser” under the federal order.
“They don’t have coal there, they’re using up their coal by the end of the year,” Fitzgibbon said. “So are they going to have to buy new coal and bring it in and store it in Centralia? They don’t have employees ready to run this plant.”
Fitzgibbon also raised the specter that the plant would have to burn coal that doesn’t even generate power just to satisfy the federal order.
“It’s completely unclear and I think those will be some of the issues that it will take a court to figure out,” he added.
‘No emergency here’
The office of Washington Attorney General Nick Brown is “still discussing our legal options in response to this action,” spokesperson Mike Faulk wrote in an email. 
In a joint statement Wednesday, Brown, along with Gov. Bob Ferguson and State Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller, blasted the federal order, saying: “Let’s be clear: there’s no emergency here.”
“The administration does not care about energy affordability and reliability for consumers,” the officials wrote in prepared remarks. “In fact, electricity prices have gone up nationwide over the first year of this administration. Instead of helping states diversify their energy economy, the administration wants to keep a dirty, dying energy source on life support.”
Ferguson and Brown are both Democrats and have sparred repeatedly with Republican President Donald Trump.
This week’s order in Washington comes after a similar Trump administration order in the spring to keep a coal plant burning in Michigan, according to news reports. That 90-day order was extended in August and again in November. 
In July, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to challenge the federal order, calling it “arbitrary and illegal.”
That legal challenge is still pending, a spokesperson for Nessel’s office said Thursday.
Environmental groups in Washington reacted swiftly to the TransAlta order. In a statement, Lauren McCloy of the NW Energy Coalition described the move as “federal overreach” and “incredibly unproductive.”
The NW Energy Coalition is a group of roughly 100 business, government, civic and environmental organizations working to advance affordable, equitable and clean energy policies.
“The closure of this plant has been planned for over a decade, and keeping it running beyond its useful and economic life is not the answer,” said McCloy in prepared remarks. “This order takes resources and focus away from addressing the real challenges we have.”
Feds point to utilities’ analysis
In his emergency federal order, Wright cited the same analysis used by Puget Sound Energy to justify TransAlta’s proposed conversion to burn natural gas.
That analysis, commissioned by Puget Sound Energy, Tacoma Power, Avista, Seattle City Light, and others, argues that Washington could get hit with an electricity crisis.
Released in September, the report contended that the move toward wind and solar has prompted the retirement of fossil fuels faster than they are being replaced by clean energy.
A spokesperson for Puget Sound Energy said the utility is reviewing the federal order.
On Thursday, state Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said he thought the Trump administration had valid concerns about a power crisis.
But, “logistically, can you get more coal? Who would buy it? Those are questions nobody has the answer to,” said Braun, whose district includes the plant.
Braun said he didn’t think the federal order would derail the transition to natural gas.
“I don’t think it helps,” Braun said. “I don’t think it hurts, either.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/transalta-coal-plant-e1765321297646-1024x699.jpg,,,2025-12-18 16:58:34.200973

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A Wisconsin Senate committee held a public hearing Thursday on a bipartisan bill that would require the state Department of Natural Resources to notify county and tribal governments when local groundwater is found to exceed state standards. 
Throughout the hearing, the bill’s authors and residents of communities with water quality problems complained of incidents in which significant amounts of time passed before people learned their water was contaminated with harmful chemicals such as nitrates or PFAS. 
“Time really counts, hours, days, weeks, and in our case, even years,” said Lee Donahue, a resident of the town of Campbell on French Island near La Crosse, which has been dealing with PFAS contamination for years. “It’s been heart wrenching to know that my family and my friends and my neighbors have all been impacted by these toxic chemicals. I don’t wish anyone to have contamination in their water. And the sad part is we had no clue that PFAS was pouring from our faucets and that we were drinking that water for years and years and years before any notification was made.”
Initially authored by Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), more than 60 legislators of both parties have signed onto the bill as co-sponsors, signaling the legislation has enough support to be signed into law during a legislative session in which efforts to find compromise on environmental issues — including efforts to extend the Knowles-Nelson stewardship grant program and to create a method to spend $125 million that has been set aside for more than two years to remediate PFAS contamination — have been stuck in the partisan muck. 
Under the bill, if the DNR finds an exceedance of the state’s groundwater standards the department will have seven days to notify the local county or tribal health department as well as the county land and conservation department. 
For several years, Wisconsin policymakers have been unable to establish a state standard for the acceptable amount of PFAS in the state’s groundwater, hitting roadblocks at the state Natural Resources Board and in the Republican-controlled Legislature. The state does have established standards for the amount of PFAS in the state’s surface water and the drinking water provided by municipal water utilities. 
As the Legislature has tried and failed to pass a bill that would spend the $125 million in the PFAS trust fund, residents of communities affected by PFAS contamination have frequently said the policy change they’d most like to see is the establishment of a groundwater standard. 
The contaminant notification bill does not establish a groundwater standard for PFAS, however it requires the DNR to notify the county government if the groundwater is found to have PFAS levels higher than the existing state standards for PFAS in surface or drinking water. 
About one-third of Wisconsin residents get their water from private drinking wells. While the bill does not establish a groundwater standard and does not provide any assistance if the groundwater they use to shower, brush their teeth, make coffee or mix baby formula is contaminated, proponents said it does make sure residents have the information they need to make decisions about the source of their water. 
“If people have a right to clean water, then they have a right to know when their water is not clean,” said Michael Tiboris, the agriculture and water policy director at the River Alliance of Wisconsin. “And this bill is exactly the kind of action that we appreciate having legislators take a strong position on, giving families knowledge of the threats to their drinking water makes it possible for them to protect themselves.” 
None of the people or groups that testified at the hearing Thursday were in opposition to the bill, but a few industry groups expressed a handful of complaints and said they’d like to see amendments to the bill’s final version. 
The concerns of business groups centered around making sure that any notifications were made after test results have been verified and making sure that the notifications don’t instigate regulatory action from the government that it doesn’t have the authority to undertake. 
“It’s just not appropriate for the government to take any kind of action,” said Adam Jordahl, director of environmental and energy policy at Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. “I know it’s not a direct regulatory action where we’re expecting an individual or business to do something or comply with something, but nevertheless, the issue of sort of holding people accountable to a regulatory PFAS standard that has not yet actually been promulgated into the administrative code. We find that to be very problematic and kind of a slippery slope going down in terms of holding people accountable or responsible to something that hasn’t gone through the full rulemaking process.”
Scott Suder, the president of the Wisconsin Paper Council, said he’s concerned that prematurely telling people their water is contaminated could create “reputational risks” for nearby businesses. 
“It creates unnecessary legal and reputational risk for industry, potentially because the notice is subject to public inspection and copying under [Wisconsin open records law],” Suder said. “All exceedance notifications would become public records, creating significant disclosure and some reputational risks, so even minor errors or omissions could trigger liabilities, and the visibility of exceedances may lead to public misunderstanding about actual risks. So it is a bit concerning for industry as well.”

State records indicate chiropractor Chad Faaborg was arrested in June 2022 and charged with third-degree sexual abuse. Police alleged that on June 16, 2022, a female patient reported she had an appointment with Faaborg at his practice, Simply Chiropractic in Anita.
According to police, the woman reported that during her appointment, Faaborg “went under her clothing, fondled her, and performed a sex act on her without her permission.”

At the time the charges were imposed, Faaborg agreed to a license suspension that resulted in his refraining from practicing while his court case was pending.
After 14 continuances in the case were ordered by the court, Cass County prosecutors changed the charged offense to simple misdemeanor assault in the form of insulting or offensive conduct.
On Sept. 13, 2024, Cass County District Court Judge Eric Nelson found Faaborg guilty of the offense, ruling that Faaborg had touched the alleged victim “in an area of her body without permission,” and that “he intended his touch to be offensive or insulting to her.” Nelson fined Faaborg $350.
Although no plea agreement or amended trial information was filed with the clerk of court in the case, Nelson’s sentencing order stated that “the parties inform the court that upon conviction, the defendant has agreed to make a donation to Catholic Charities in the amount of $750.”
Faaborg said Thursday he was “falsely accused” of sexual assault by the patient, and that the reduced charge was negotiated by his attorney and Cass County Attorney Vanessa Strazdas. It was Strazdas, he said, who proposed that the agreed-upon charitable donation be routed to Catholic Charities.
“That was all part of our negotiation with the county attorney,” he said.
The Iowa Board of Chiropractic recently agreed to reactivate Faaborg’s license, subject to two years of monitoring. During that time, Faaborg will be required to have a female chaperone present for all examinations and consultations with female patients.

CT is using surplus funds to help people next year, but will Congress act? What to know,","COVID-era financial assistance for ObamaCare health plans, known as enhanced premium tax credits, are all but guaranteed to lapse at the end of the year, with Congress set to leave town this week without addressing them. 
After a failed vote last week to extend the subsidies for three years, Gov. Ned Lamont announced that Connecticut will foot the bill to maintain financial assistance for some Connecticut residents. However, there are residents who are set to lose some or all aid.
Here’s what to know about who could be impacted, Connecticut’s plans and the chances of the subsidies getting extended.
Who is going to be impacted? 
About 90% of Access Health CT enrollees — or 143,000 Connecticut residents — receive some sort of subsidy to help defray the cost of premiums. With the subsidies expiring, those residents were set to lose some or all of the financial assistance they receive. 
Access Health CT is the official state health insurance marketplace created to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. 
The lapse would mean individual enrollees could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year for an individual and $10,000 annually for a family of four. Connecticut would have to spend $295 million per year to maintain the current level of financial assistance provided by the expiring federal subsidies.
What is Connecticut going to do?
Last week, Lamont pledged $70 million in state funding to keep premiums stable for the most financially vulnerable families set to get hit by the expiring tax credits, but hinted that more help might be on the way. On Wednesday, the governor increased the investment to nearly $115 million through June 2027. 
The plan includes $64.1 million to maintain CoveredCT through June 2027, according to a letter the governor penned to legislators informing them of the expenditures. CoveredCT currently uses federal subsidies to provide no-cost plans to low-income families that earn slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid. 
Another roughly $50.8 million will go toward replacing the subsidies entirely for Connecticut residents who aren’t in CoveredCT, but earn between 100% and 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. It will also cover half of the current financial assistance for people earning between 400% and 500% of FPL, who are set to lose all financial assistance once the federal subsidies expire. 
However, unlike the CoveredCT funding, the $50.8 million only covers subsidies through the end of 2026.
In addition to the $115 million in direct subsidy support to CT residents, the state will pay community health centers $5 million through June 2027 “to help promote access to primary and preventive care for those individuals with incomes below 100% of the FPL at risk of losing coverage due to elimination of all federal health plan subsidies,” according to the governor’s letter.
Anyone who already signed up for a plan and qualifies for state assistance will have their premiums adjusted, according to Access Health CEO James Michel. 
Due to recent outage issues with Access Health CT’s website, the agency has extended the enrollment deadline for plans beginning in the new year to Dec. 20, Michel confirmed.  
The funding for subsidy replacement will come from $500 million in state reserves designated during last month’s special session, which was intended to potentially backfill federal cuts to nutrition, health care, heating assistance and other human service programs until the next General Assembly session starts Feb. 4. 
What’s going on with Congress right now?
The imminent expiration set off a last-minute scramble on Capitol Hill to see if the House would take it up. Democrats’ three-year extension failed to get through the Senate last week. 
House Republicans ultimately put a bill on the floor that would implement various health care reforms but didn’t include any extension of the subsidies. The bill passed along party lines on Wednesday, but is likely to get blocked when it reaches the Republican-controlled Senate. 
Republicans have opposed the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010, but they have struggled to unify around a replacement plan. Most Republicans view the tax credits as a costly measure that was supposed to be temporary when it was created in a pandemic relief bill. 
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been resistant to putting a subsidies extension on the floor. That rankled a bloc of moderate Republicans, who came up short in their push for a vote after tense negotiations with Johnson. 
“Many of them did want to vote on this Obamacare, COVID-era subsidy the Democrats created. We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve and it just was not to be,” Johnson said Tuesday. 
The only other avenue available is through a procedural tool called a discharge petition. If lawmakers can collect 218 signatures, it forces a vote on the House floor. 
There are two bipartisan petitions that extend the subsidies, but for a shorter timeframe than sought by Democrats and with changes to eligibility. U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, is the only member of Connecticut’s delegation to sign onto both. But the two measures are short of the needed signatures. 
Is there any chance the subsidies will get extended?

,DC,2025-12-18 20:46:28+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump signs order to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, but it’s still illegal",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-order-loosen-federal-restrictions-marijuana-its-still-illegal,,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana, which Trump said reflected the drug’s potential medical benefits while discouraging recreational use.The order moves cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III on the Federal Drug Administration’s list of controlled substances. Schedule I, the most restrictive category under federal law, indicates a high likelihood of abuse and no accepted medical value. Trump said the move reflected that cannabis could have medicinal value, even if abuse was still possible.The order “doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,” Trump said. “Just as the prescription painkillers may have legitimate uses, but can also do irreversible damage … it's never safe to use powerful controlled substances in recreational matters.”Still, the order marks a major step in the decades-long liberalization of cannabis policy. Since 2012, when Washington and Colorado voters legalized personal marijuana use, 22 other states have legalized at least some form of recreational use. Only 10 states still restrict both medicinal and recreational use.President Joe Biden started the process for rescheduling the drug last year.Medical angleA group of administration officials and medical doctors flanked Trump during the Oval Office signing, with some speaking to the potential medical benefits of marijuana, including as an alternative to highly addictive opioid painkillers.“The facts compel the federal government to recognize that marijuana can be legitimate in terms of medical applications when carefully administered,” Trump said.Researching the potential benefits of marijuana is nearly impossible because of the tight restrictions on Schedule I substances, advocates have argued.Removing cannabis from Schedule I would help ease those restrictions, Trump said. “This reclassification order will make it far easier to conduct marijuana-related medical research, allowing us to study benefits, potential dangers and future treatments,” he said. “It's going to have a tremendously positive impact.”In addition to researchers, the split between federal law and the legal landscape in many states has created challenges for the industry, users and law enforcement, among others.For example, the unusual position of state-legal businesses in a federally banned industry means they cannot use certain tax provisions, access some banking instruments or transport their product across state lines.In a lengthy statement, Paul Armentano, the deputy director of leading marijuana legalization organization National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, offered qualified praise for the move, saying it “validates the experience” of patients who have used marijuana to treat chronic pain and other conditions. “This directive certainly marks a long overdue change in direction,” Armentano said. “But while such a move potentially provides some benefits to patients, and veterans especially, it still falls well short of the changes necessary to bring federal marijuana policy into the 21st century. Specifically, rescheduling fails to harmonize federal marijuana policy with the cannabis laws of most states.”The reclassification could provide tax relief to many marijuana businesses, he added.GOP senators opposed moveMany Republicans in Congress remain opposed to legalizing marijuana.In a letter dated Wednesday, 24 Senate Republicans urged Trump not to reclassify marijuana, which they said had a high likelihood of abuse and no medical value.Allowing marijuana businesses to take advantage of federal tax deductions would give them a tax break of as much as $2.3 billion, allowing them to increase marketing efforts and expand into additional states, the lawmakers wrote. The benefits of economic growth would be outweighed by the costs of accidents, “not to mention the moral costs of marijuana advertising that could reach kids,” they wrote.“In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans,” the GOP senators wrote. “We urge you to continue your strong leadership of our country and our economy, and to turn away from marijuana rescheduling.”North Carolina’s Tedd Budd led the letter, which was also signed by John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Jim Banks of Indiana, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Crapo and Jim Risch of Idaho, Rick Scott of Florida, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.",,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

Kennedy Jr. after Kennedy's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, 2025. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)A concerning trend is emerging this year: access to safe, effective vaccines is being challenged as vaccine skeptics assume positions of authority. Their growing influence in health leadership places them in roles where they can shape policy at the highest levels of government, with far-reaching consequences for families across the country.
With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed as secretary of Health and Human Services, and former Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham named as the deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, individuals who have questioned vaccines now hold significant influence over national health policy. This shift in leadership is likely to shape public health in Louisiana and across the country.
We are already seeing the impacts of growing vaccine misinformation. Louisiana is facing its worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years, with reports of delayed action by the Louisiana Department of Health hindering an effective public health response. Meanwhile, The United States is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in two decades — nearly 2,000 reported cases and the tragic deaths of at least two children. These illnesses could be prevented with more widespread vaccination coverage.
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who spent decades treating patients and recommending vaccines, understands the importance of evidence-based prevention. As the chair of the Senate Health Committee, he has the authority — and responsibility — to exercise congressional oversight of the CDC’s Advisory Council on Immunization Practices and Secretary Kennedy, bringing transparency to the sweeping changes that threaten vaccine access. Cassidy has spoken out against vaccine rollbacks without scientific evidence. However, we need him to do more.
Recently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to end its recommendation for the hepatitis B birth dose and Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill endorsed the change. This decision increases health risks for our children and create dangerous confusion for parents and providers.
The birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine:

reduced acute hepatitis B infections in children under 19 by 99%
prevented an estimated 500,000 childhood infections
prevented over 90,000 hepatitis B-related childhood deaths

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has historically been nonpartisan, grounding its recommendations in the best scientific evidence, rather than ideology. The most recent vote and the subsequent policy changes, however, depart from scientific evidence and weakens long-standing protections for infants and children.
These changes do not make America healthier. They create barriers for parents, who want nothing more than to keep their children safe and healthy. Parents consistently support common-sense policies guided by decades of rigorous research, and children deserve to attend school in places where they don’t risk death from a preventable illness.
This is not about politics. This is about parents’ ability to protect their children from preventable illnesses and death.Louisianans know too well the consequences when those in power fail to make clear recommendations based on the best science. We cannot afford to keep making the same mistakes.
Parents deserve the information and tools necessary to make the best decision for their families. We deserve clear, consistent guidance based on evidence. Louisiana deserves better.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gettyimages-2196806242-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

Less than a week after an unprecedented atmospheric river brought catastrophic floodwaters to northwest Montana, continued extreme weather including high winds on Wednesday have slowed some recovery efforts and knocked out power to residents. 
“Libby, I mean, they’ve got, boy, you know, every single issue that weather could throw at them,” Trent Parker, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service told the Daily Montanan on Thursday. 
Flooding in Lincoln County last week compromised at least nine bridges, leading to 40-mile detours for some residents of Libby and Troy and increasing the risk of rock and landslides throughout the northwest. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte issued an executive order declaring a flooding disaster in northwestern Montana, allowing general fund money to be spent on disaster relief efforts. 
Nick Holloway, public information officer for the Western Montana Type 3 All Hazard Incident Management team that took command of the flood incident on Monday, said the state emergency declaration has helped open up resources and that state disaster personnel are on the ground working in tandem with the incident management team.
The Flathead Electric Co-op outage map on Dec. 18, 2025, showing more than 2,500 continued outages across Lincoln County.
“We’re here helping people — life safety is our primary focus, and incident stabilization is our secondary focus,” Holloway said. 
However, additional extreme weather this week, this time in the form of high winds across the state, have stressed recovery efforts. Statewide, more than 60,000 customers lost power, according to Northwestern Energy and Flathead Electric Coop, due to downed trees and powerlines. 
According to the FEC outage map, more than 3,000 customers in the Libby area and along Montana Highway 2 remain without power after more than 24 hours, even as crews have worked to restore power to thousands more customers throughout the region.  
“Normally with power outages in a county or jurisdiction, mutual aid could come in and help,” Holloway said. “That’s not helping here, because it’s a region-wide event. There’s no additional resources.”
On Tuesday, Gianforte and the state’s federal delegation also requested a presidential disaster declaration from President Donald Trump, and requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. 
Holloway said there has been no update from the federal government yet, but if it comes through it would open up additional, needed resources. 
A spokesperson for the governor did not respond to a question about the federal ask on Thursday. 
With the wind event following extreme rain and flooding, the ground throughout Lincoln County is saturated with water, which Holloway said is slowing the repair process.
“It’s hard to get poles to stand straight in this kind of weather,” he said. “And we expect more trees to come down that were weakened during the worst of the wind but didn’t fall. They don’t need as heavy of a wind to come down now.”
The National Weather Service has issued a wind advisory for the Kootenai/Cabinet region from 11 p.m. Thursday through 8 a.m. Friday.
Emergency personnel urge all residents of the area to be careful parking cars near trees and going anywhere on foot, in case of further gusts that knock down trees. Residents are advised to stay at least 35 feet away from downed power lines and treat any power line as live. 
Holloway also said residents can haul debris to the Lincoln County landfill on Pope Creek, but no debris should be piled on roadways or streets. 
The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office has issued an evacuation or stay-in-place order for residents on the west side and south end of Bull Lake due to debris accumulation against the Ross Creeks Cedars Bridge, which is closed to traffic.
Emergency mitigation work is currently underway on the bridge. 
The latest emergency information can be found at the Lincoln County flood information website.
 Health concerns 

Along with infrastructure damage, last week’s flooding has impacted Libby’s municipal water source, which comes from the Lower Flower Creek Diversion Structure. 
The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation has been coordinating inspection of the structure and done work to stabilize damaged areas on Dec. 14 and 15. 
The city has been under a boil water order since flooding began. The Red Cross has established an emergency shelter at the Memorial Center, 111 E. Lincoln Boulevard in Libby, and bottled water is available to residents who need it. 
There are two potential concerns with the drinking water, Holloway said, including whether organic or inorganic compounds are present. 
Organic compounds can be addressed through the boil order, but the presence of inorganics, including heavy metals, would make the water nonpottable. 
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality has been monitoring the situation and conducting testing. 
Water samples from the city were hand delivered to a testing laboratory in Kalispell on Monday and Tuesday. Results are expected by the end of the day on Thursday or Friday morning at the earliest, according to Holloway. 
Libby’s public water permit requires testing for heavy metals every nine years. Holloway said the city has met all state and federal safety standards in its previous two tests. 
Another public health risk being monitored is whether there have been any impacts to the Libby Asbestos Superfund site, Holloway said, and according to DEQ, there is a chance that some mine waste and vermiculite may have been exposed by the flooding. 
“While the potential for Libby Amphibole asbestos release exists, there is not immediate danger currently identified,” Holloway said in a statement. “Inspection of flood impacted areas for LA containing materials will take place once floodwaters have receded. If areas of concern are identified further actions may take place to protect human health and the environment. Please contact the Asbestos Resource Program if you observe any vermiculite containing materials or if you have any further questions or concerns.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-1.30.02 PM.png,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

Here's what to know about how to stay warm and help others.","As temperatures continue to drop across Connecticut, Bridgeport officials are warning residents to prepare for dangerously cold conditions and to look out for one another — especially people without stable housing.
Periods of extreme cold trigger a coordinated cold weather response involving city agencies, emergency management officials, shelters and outreach teams. The goal is to reduce the risk of cold-related injuries and deaths while connecting residents to warming spaces, shelter and support.
One of the key things to know is that extremely low temperatures and wind chills can cause frostbite and hypothermia within minutes, especially for those outdoors. The city urges residents to take precautions at home, check on vulnerable neighbors, and use available warming centers and shelter resources. 
People who see someone in need can call 211 to alert outreach teams. But there is more that can be done.
Here’s a look at how Bridgeport’s cold weather response works, where people can go to stay warm and how residents can help during periods of extreme cold.
What is Bridgeport’s cold weather response?
Bridgeport’s cold weather response is activated during periods of dangerously low temperatures and wind chills. 
During these periods, the city increases outreach to people experiencing homelessness, sharing information about shelter availability and transportation options. Outreach teams work to connect people to shelters such as Prospect House, the Bridgeport Rescue Mission, and Alpha Community Services.
Residents who see someone sleeping outside or in distress due to the cold are encouraged to call 211. Those calls help outreach workers locate people who may need immediate assistance. People can also go directly to the South End Community Center at 650 Park Ave., which serves as a central access point for support and case worker assistance.
Where can people go to stay warm during the day or overnight?
Bridgeport has several locations that can serve as warming spaces during cold weather, though hours and availability vary.
Overnight support and case managementThe South End Community Center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The center offers limited overnight capacity and access to case worker support for people experiencing homelessness.
Senior centers (open weekdays only)

Black Rock Senior Center, 2676 Fairfield Ave., 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
East Side Senior Center, 268 Putnam St., 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Eisenhower Senior Center, 307 Golden Hill St., 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Transportation hub

Greater Bridgeport Transit (GBT) Station, 710 Water St., Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Public librariesBridgeport Public Library branches also serve as indoor warming spaces during open hours:

Main Branch, 925 Broad St. (downtown)
Black Rock Branch, 2705 Fairfield Ave.
Newfield Branch, 755 Central Ave.
North Branch, 3455 Madison Ave.
Beardsley Branch, 2536 East Main St.

Hours vary by location and day, and libraries are closed on Sundays. The East Side Branch is temporarily closed for renovations.
What should residents do to stay safe during extreme cold?
City officials are urging residents to take precautions both inside and outside the home.
At home, residents should make sure heating devices are working properly and should never use a stove or oven to heat a living space, as doing so can create serious fire and carbon monoxide risks. Anyone using a generator should follow manufacturer instructions and never operate it indoors.
Residents are also advised to bring pets inside, watch for ice on pipes and walkways, and bundle up if going outdoors. Prolonged exposure to cold temperatures can be dangerous even for people who are otherwise healthy.
On the roads, drivers should allow extra travel time and be cautious during morning commutes, when icy conditions are more likely. The city also warns residents not to drive through flooded areas beneath viaducts or underpasses, which can be hard to see in winter weather.
Officials are also asking people to check in on elderly neighbors, family members, and others who may be more vulnerable to cold-related health risks.
How can residents help people experiencing homelessness during cold weather?
One of the most immediate ways to help is by calling 211 if you see someone who appears to be sleeping outside or struggling in the cold. Those calls go directly to outreach teams who can attempt to connect individuals with shelter and services.
Residents can also share information about warming centers and shelters with people who may not know where to go. Simply letting someone know that places like the South End Community Center are open around the clock can make a difference during extreme cold.
For people experiencing homelessness themselves, showing up at 650 Park Ave. can be a starting point for getting connected to shelter options, outreach workers and longer-term support.
What if residents lose power during the cold?
Cold weather can also strain utility systems. Residents who experience a loss of electricity should contact United Illuminating’s customer hotline at 800-722-5584, which operates 24 hours a day for emergency service.
City officials say staying informed, checking on neighbors and using available resources are key during periods of intense cold.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Downtown-Bridgeport-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice has sent a confidential draft agreement to more than a dozen states that would require election officials to remove any alleged ineligible voters identified during a federal review of their voter rolls.
The agreement — called a memorandum of understanding, or MOU — would hand the federal government a major role in election administration, a responsibility that belongs to the states under the U.S. Constitution.
A Justice Department official identified 11 states that have expressed an interest in the agreement during a federal court hearing in December, according to a transcript reviewed by Stateline. Two additional states, Colorado and Wisconsin, have publicly rejected the memorandum of understanding and released copies of the proposal.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

The 11 states “all fall into the list of, they have expressed with us a willingness to comply based on the represented MOU that we have sent them,” Eric Neff, the acting chief of the Justice Department’s Voting Section, said at the hearing. He spoke at a Dec. 4 hearing in a federal lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against California, which has refused a demand for the state’s voter data.
Neff’s courtroom disclosure, which Stateline is the first to report, comes as the Justice Department has sued 18 states for unredacted copies of their voter rolls after demanding the data from most states in recent months. The unredacted lists include sensitive personal information, such as driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers.
The states Neff identified are led by Republicans — Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.
The draft memorandum of understanding represents a new effort by the Trump administration to gain access to some states’ voter data without litigation.
The administration’s lawsuits mostly target Democratic states, where election officials refused initial requests for voter data and allege the demand is unlawful and risks the privacy of millions of voters. They have also voiced fears that the Trump administration could use the information to target its political enemies.
Neff said four states with Republican secretaries of state — Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas and Wyoming — have “complied voluntarily” with the Justice Department’s demand without memoranda of understanding.










What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum.


– David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research


The Justice Department says it needs voters’ detailed information to ensure ineligible people are kept off state voter rolls and that only citizens are voting.
Federal officials say they will follow federal privacy laws, but critics fear voter data is being shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which operates a powerful citizenship verification tool known as SAVE. The Trump administration has previously confirmed the Justice Department plans to share voter data with Homeland Security.
“What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum,” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. “They’re trying to use the power of the executive branch to bully states into turning over highly sensitive data: date of birth, Social Security number, driver’s license — the holy trinity of identity theft.”
Becker, who worked as a senior trial attorney in the Justice Department’s Voting Section during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, told reporters on Dec. 8 that several states received the memorandum. But Neff’s identification of 11 states wasn’t widely available until the judge in the California lawsuit on Tuesday ordered the transcript of the Dec. 4 hearing immediately posted to the lawsuit’s public docket, where Stateline accessed it.

The draft memorandum of understanding, which is labeled “confidential,” outlines the terms of the proposed agreement between each state and the Justice Department. After a state provides its voter roll, the federal department would agree to test, analyze and assess the information. The department would then notify states of “any voter list maintenance issues, insufficiencies, inadequacies, deficiencies, anomalies, or concerns” found.
Each state would agree to “clean” its voter roll within 45 days by removing any ineligible voters, according to the memorandum. States would then resubmit their voter data to the Justice Department for verification.
While the Justice Department has demanded states’ voter rolls since this summer, the memorandum of understanding offers the most detailed picture to date of how the Trump administration plans to use the data.
“It lays out in a way that we haven’t seen in any other context their plan for one of the things, I will say, that they plan to do, which is disturbing,” said Eileen O’Connor, a senior counsel and manager in the voting rights and election program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, a progressive think tank.
O’Connor was a trial attorney in the Justice Department’s Voting Section during the Obama, first Trump and Biden administrations. “I think with each passing lawsuit, they are clearly trying to create a national database of every voter in the country,” she said.
The Justice Department didn’t answer questions from Stateline about how many states had been sent the memorandum and whether any had signed it.
Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, wrote in a statement to Stateline that the department has a statutory mandate to enforce federal voting rights laws. Ensuring the voting public’s confidence in election integrity is a top priority of the Trump administration, she wrote.
“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Dhillon wrote.
Federal involvement in elections
The Justice Department memorandum, if implemented, would mark a significant departure from how election officials typically maintain voter rolls.
States, often in coordination with local election officials, check lists for changes in address, deaths and other reasons for ineligibility, such as a felony conviction. States typically perform this task with little to no federal involvement.
Some states participate in voluntary programs that allow election officials to share voter information with other states for the purposes of looking for voters who may have moved or who are registered in multiple locations. But those don’t include the federal government, which plays a limited role in election administration under the United States’ decentralized approach to elections.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said clerks continually look at death records and other sources of data to update voter lists. He said the United States’ localized election system is a strength that guards against election interference.
“The federal government has no role in list maintenance,” Crane said.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

But that has begun to change under the Trump administration, as President Donald Trump has made removing noncitizen voters a priority.
Earlier this year, Homeland Security overhauled the SAVE program into a tool that can scan millions of voter records against government databases for evidence of citizenship. The program was previously used for one-off searches to check whether noncitizens were eligible for government benefits.
Some Republican secretaries of state have agreed to upload their voter rolls into SAVE. Democratic secretaries of state object to using the program and say they are wary of what will happen to the voter information once it’s provided to the Trump administration, including its potential use by the Department of Homeland Security.
While SAVE can flag voters with potential eligibility issues, the onus now is still on state officials to investigate whether those voters are actually ineligible and decide whether to initiate a process to remove them from the rolls.
By contrast, the Justice Department memorandum would empower federal officials to take a more active role, allowing them to check the work of state election officials as they remove — or don’t remove — voters.
“We have a system that allows Americans to voice their opinions and to hold government accountable, and that is so fundamentally central to the way our system works,” Oregon Democratic Secretary of State Tobias Read, who has been sued by the Justice Department, said in an interview. “We should be focused on how to make that better, not on erecting artificial barriers and putting people’s privacy and confidence at risk for no reason.”
Republican interest
Some GOP election officials have welcomed the Trump administration’s interest and have accused the Biden administration of not doing enough to help states vet their voter rolls. In particular, they praise the overhaul of SAVE, which some GOP secretaries of state had requested before Trump took office.
Some secretaries have touted the removal of noncitizen voters after using SAVE. Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican, in November announced three voters identified as noncitizens had been removed from his state’s voter rolls. Gray has also provided the Justice Department with full access to Wyoming’s voter roll.
“The voter list maintenance that we have been conducting is extremely important for election integrity,” Gray said in a news release.
4 Republican states will help Homeland Security obtain driver’s license records

But as of early December, nearly all states hadn’t provided the Justice Department access to their unredacted voter rolls, with Neff identifying only four that had shared their lists. It also remains unclear whether any state has signed the memorandum of understanding. No state has told Stateline it signed the document.
Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen, a Republican, has received a memorandum of understanding and plans to comply with the Justice Department request, pending the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit, Evnen spokesperson Rani Taborek-Potter wrote in an email to Stateline. A voting advocacy group has sued to block the release of the data.
In an interview with Kentucky Lantern, Kentucky Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams said that his office was “going back and forth a little bit” with the Justice Department over what federal law requires.
“We’ve not really figured out exactly where that line is of what-all they’re entitled to,” Adams said. “What’s not in dispute is they’re entitled to the vast majority of information — people’s names, addresses, birthdays — and we’ve given them all of that.”
Adams added that many state officials “are in the same boat of trying to figure out what exactly they need to do their job and what our obligations are legally.”
Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican, confirmed in a statement to Stateline that her office received a proposed memorandum of understanding from the Justice Department. “We are in the process of reviewing the document with our attorneys and carefully considering our options,” Henderson wrote.
Rachael Dunn, a spokesperson for Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, wrote in an email that the state hadn’t entered into an agreement with the Justice Department “at this time.”
DOJ ‘contractor’ could get voter data
The draft agreement would give the Justice Department wide authority to share the voter data of states that sign on.
The department would be authorized to share the data with “a contractor” who needs access “to perform duties related” to voter list maintenance verification, according to the draft agreement. The agreement doesn’t name any contractors or specify whether they would be inside or outside of government.
Two states have publicly rejected the draft agreement. Colorado Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced Dec. 11 she would refuse to sign the memorandum. The Justice Department sued Colorado the following day.
The Wisconsin Elections Commission also rejected the draft agreement that week. In a Dec. 11 letter to Neff, the Justice Department official, the commissioners wrote that state law prohibits them from releasing certain personally identifiable information, such as date of birth, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
“I don’t look at the action that we’re taking today to be commentary on the motive of the appropriateness of the Department of Justice’s request,” Commissioner Don Millis, a Republican appointee, said at a virtual commission meeting the same day. “The U.S. DOJ is simply asking the commission to do something that the commission is explicitly forbidden by Wisconsin law to do.”
The Justice Department so far hasn’t sued Wisconsin for its voter data.
Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, told Stateline in an email that he expects no states to sign the agreement.
“It’s no surprise that both Colorado and Wisconsin said no — and I don’t think that’s a question of political leadership,” Levitt wrote. “It’s hard for me to imagine any Republican state with faith in its own list maintenance capacity agreeing to outsource that decision to the DOJ.”

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota’s State Economist Derek Johnson told the state Banking Commission on Wednesday that a sluggish farm economy, driven by lower soybean, corn and wheat prices, has been a major factor holding down recent state sales tax collections. 
Johnson, with the Bureau of Finance and Management, said sales tax collections tied to farm equipment fell more than 20% in fiscal year 2025 compared with the prior year. He said collections on farm equipment have continued to slide in the current 2026 fiscal year, down year-to-date by about 16%.
Johnson framed the impact of falling crop prices as outsized for an agriculture-dependent state. 
“We know that in an ag-state like South Dakota, it bleeds into so many parts of the economy,” he said. 
Johnson shared the news two weeks after Gov. Larry Rhoden said in his budget address that overall sales tax revenue declined in fiscal year 2025 for only the third time in 30 years, by 0.6%. Sales tax revenues for fiscal year 2026, which ends June 30, are up over 4% so far. 
Johnson said the most recent month’s tax collections on farm equipment were higher than the same month a year earlier. That’s the first year-over-year improvement in roughly two years. 
Beyond agriculture, Johnson told the commission South Dakota’s labor market remains tight, with the nation’s lowest unemployment rate of 2% and roughly three job openings for every unemployed person.

(Photo by Florida Phoenix)The Florida Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the death sentence of a twice-condemned man, dismissing his constitutional concerns over a state law that allows just eight jurors to recommend death — the lowest threshold in the nation.
The state’s highest court in a 65-page opinion affirmed Michael James Jackson’s death sentence, which he’d received twice in 16 years for burying alive an elderly couple in 2005.
Although Jackson was one of 40 death row inmates resentenced when the state high court briefly found non-unanimous death recommendations unconstitutional, he remains the only one to be condemned again after lawmakers reversed course in 2023.
“In his initial brief, Jackson raises six issues (with some sub-issues) targeting the 2023 [law or its] application,” the opinion signed by six of the seven justices reads. “Each one fails.”
Jackson’s case falls amid a larger conversation in Florida spearheaded by Gov. Ron DeSantis and GOP lawmakers on expanding the death penalty. In 2025 alone, 19 inmates as of Thursday night will have been executed, shattering the state’s 1984 record of eight executions in one year.
Similarly, in the past few years, Florida has stretched the death penalty to include child rapists and human traffickers of children. It’s also allowed for fewer jurors to recommend death and increased potential execution methods.
Jurors death recommendations in Florida
The case centers on the state’s decades-long flip-flopping on how many jurors are needed to recommend the death penalty. For years, Florida allowed a simple 7-to-5 majority. Jackson, for example, was sentenced to death in 2007 on an 8-to-4 recommendation.
But in 2016, the state Supreme Court declared that unanimity was required for death recommendations, mirroring federal law and every other state except for Alabama (and now Florida). This led to the resentencing of dozens of death row inmates who’d been condemned by less-than-unanimous juries.
Jackson was on that list. So were Alan Wade and Tiffany Cole, his co-conspirators, although they both on resentencing drew life sentences instead of death.
Just four years later, in 2020, the state Supreme Court decided that the Florida Constitution does not require a unanimous recommendation of death. This prompted lawmakers in 2023 to lower the threshold for death recommendation from a unanimous jury to the 8-to-4 majority.
Florida is the only state to allow fewer than 10 jurors to recommend death. The only other state that doesn’t require a unanimous jury verdict is Alabama, with 10 jurors.
So, when Jackson had his resentencing trial delayed until just weeks after that 2023 law took effect, eight jurors recommended execution. And just like 16 years earlier, Jackson was sentenced to death by an 8-4 majority.
What did Jackson argue?
Jackson, now 43, argued a number of points, ranging from alleged improprieties during his initial trial to claiming that the 2023 law was unconstitutional, racist, indecent, and couldn’t apply to him.
Briefly, he also claimed that the law was improperly targeted at him. He pointed to legislative debate in which lawmakers acknowledged that only one pending capital case would be affected by the change, which was Jackson’s, and argued that this showed the statute was crafted to ensure it would apply at his resentencing.
Six justices rejected all of his claims, largely by pointing out that a non-unanimous jury is constitutional under the 2020 Florida Supreme Court case.
They also disagreed that Jackson’s resentencing order from 2017 prevented him from receiving the burden of a later statute, writing, “The 2017 order did no more than confirm that, under the decisional law at the time, Jackson was entitled to resentencing.”
Justice Jorge LaBarga, the sole moderate justice, concurred in a separate four-page opinion, writing that he wanted to respect precedent but emphasizing his opposition to the 2023 law.
“I write to underscore that the 8-4 threshold renders Florida the absolute outlier among states that impose the death penalty. Florida now has the lowest standard in the nation, requiring the fewest number of jurors to recommend the death penalty,” he wrote.
What happened in 2005?
In 2005, 61-year-olds Carol and Reggie Sumner allowed Jackson and Tiffany Cole to stay with them at their Jacksonville home, according to the case record. While there, Jackson noticed they were “frail and would be easy victims,” and he “informed [Alan] Wade of the Sumners’ financial position, which included $90,000 from the sale of their South Carolina home,” the opinion says.
They hatched a scheme, bringing in 18-year-old Bruce Nixon to help.
Days before the murders, Jackson, Wade, and Nixon dug “a six-foot-deep hole in a remote area of Georgia.” Then, on the evening of July 8, 2005, Wade and Nixon held the Sumners at “gunpoint” using a “toy gun” and bound them with duct tape.
Jackson then entered the home “and began searching for bank statements” and ATM cards. Wade and Nixon later “ordered the victims to climb into the trunk of the Sumners’ Lincoln Town Car.”
With the Sumners trapped, they drove to the Georgia gravesite, where the elderly couple was placed in the hole and buried alive.
Jackson later used their ATM card “several times,” and impersonated Reggie in phone calls with the bank and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.
The four were arrested in South Carolina. Nixon, who testified that Jackson was in charge and who led authorities to the gravesite, was the only one not sentenced to death in 2007. Instead, he received a 45-year prison sentence.
Cole and Wade had their death sentences changed to life during resentencing in 2017.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SupremeCourtIMG_20230907_163812140-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-12-18 15:57:34.524879

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Six days after the mass shooting at Brown University, questions hang heavy over a city gripped by grief and unease.
Who is responsible for the “unthinkable” act of violence that killed two students and wounded nine more people in the campus engineering building on Saturday afternoon? What motivated them? Where are they now?
Some answers will come when local, state and federal law enforcement make good on their pledge to find, arrest and convict the shooter. But other information that could help bring resolution and comfort to a grieving community will never be shared publicly, including the emergency phone calls made to first responders in the wake of the shooting.
Rhode Island is among a growing number of states that restrict release of 911 recordings or transcripts without consent of the caller or a judge’s order. The state law, passed in 1996 after a local journalist aired a 911 call in which the wife of a state prosecutor claimed her husband had beaten her, aims to protect people’s privacy during moments of extreme stress, trauma and vulnerability. 
But it also obscures key insight into the events behind emergencies — both personal and public —and how well first responders meet the calls for help.
Since the shooting on the East Side of Providence Saturday afternoon, public officials have repeatedly assured the public in daily press conferences that the response by Brown University and Providence police to the shooting was swift and vigorous. But without call records, transcripts, and, in the case of Brown University’s Department of Public Safety, access to any arrest reports or other written records of officer activities, there’s no proof.
“Over the coming days, months, weeks, years, there’s going to be a lot of scrutiny on how Brown and other police departments responded,” said John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island.  “We’re not going to have a very good window into some of that information.”
It’s a problem that Marion, and other open government advocates with the ACCESS/RI have sought to remedy for years through legislation that would update the state’s open records law. Among the 48 changes proposed to the Access to Public Records Act in the 2025 legislative session, and prior years: making 911 calls public in response to records requests, providing there is “good cause shown.” The legislation also sought to compel private university police to make arrest records public.
The legislation has failed to advance in either chamber of the Rhode Island General Assembly, buried by objections from Gov. Dan McKee’s office and his department heads. 
Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat and the bill’s leading sponsor for the last two years, said Wednesday that he intends to revive it, with no major changes, during the upcoming legislative session.

A call for change 
Could the tragedy still unfolding across Providence spur a change of heart toward public records reform this year?
Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, thinks it should.
“The terrible incident at Brown only amplifies the importance of these two parts of the proposed changes to the public records law,” Brown said in an interview Wednesday, referring to making 911 calls public as well as university police arrest records.
University police were first to respond to calls Saturday of a shooter in the Barus and Holley engineering building, with Providence police following suit soon after, Col. Oscar Perez, Providence Police chief, said during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. Perez, and other state and federal investigators, have declined to share many details about their ongoing search for the shooter, including a potential relationship to the university, or any of the victims. 
If there were any calls reporting suspicious activity in the residential neighborhood embedded within the Ivy League campus, those will never have to be shared publicly.  Any previous arrests or run-ins between Brown campus police and the shooter can stay closeted too.
And, if Brown police end up finding and arresting the suspect, that report also doesn’t have to be released.
“It’s difficult to fathom,” Brown said. “We’re not talking about gaining access to confidential investigatory efforts. These are basic records.”










Over the coming days, months, weeks, years, there’s going to be a lot of scrutiny on how Brown and other police departments responded. We’re not going to have a very good window into some of that information. 


– John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island


McKee’s office did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment, nor did the Rhode Island State Police, which was among the dozen government agencies with written objections to the omnibus reform bill during the 2025 session.
A university spokesperson also did not respond to requests for comment.
Both the university and state police have objected to closing loopholes in the state public records laws, citing privacy concerns of officers and the public.
Brown noted that the provisions around 911 calls and transcripts still offer some privacy protections, exempting the audio and documents from being released to anyone except those involved or related to the people on the call, unless there is “good cause shown” — like a mass shooting at a university, for example.
The Rhode Island Attorney General’s office, which is playing an active role in the investigation of the shooting, has not waded into the debate over public records reform in recent years. 
But, in January, the AG’s office upheld Brown University’s right to keep its arrest records private in response to a dispute between the university and two local journalists. The eight-page opinion by Paul Meosky, special assistant attorney general, said the private police department is not subject to public records law because it is not a government body or public agency.

Unique power 
The Ivy League public safety officers differ from their counterparts at other higher education institutions across the state because they also have the power to seize, detain and arrest people. 
The ACLU sued the university on behalf of the two journalists denied access to university police arrests in June, citing the unique powers of the university’s public safety officers. The complaint remains pending in Providence County Superior Court, with a hearing on Brown’s motion to toss the complaint scheduled for March 2026, according to the public court docket.
“The wheels of justice move slowly,” Brown lamented regarding the ACLU’s court case.
So too, does the legislative process. Rhode Island’s public records law was last revised in 2012. 
Many of the proposed changes are meant to recognize the modern world, incorporating new data sources like police body-worn camera footage, text messages and traffic accident data into the law. 
Advocates have been reluctant to let go of any of the dozens of changes encompassed in the legislation, noting that attempts at compromise have failed to yield results. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi suggested that a slimmed-down, targeted set of public records act revisions might be the way to go.
“I am all about it, I support the general concept of it,” Shekarchi said in an interview on Wednesday. “Like any issue, the devil is in the details.”
Shekarchi continued, “There is a bill to be passed here. It’s about bringing people together.”
Shekarchi declined to discuss other potential legislative responses to the shooting. He said it was not the right time.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Nebraska state official responsible for overseeing state data security and privacy allegedly submitted duplicate travel reimbursement claims on two occasions for his own financial benefit, according to a new report from the state auditor.
Auditor Mike Foley this week made public his office’s review of reimbursements sought by the state’s “chief information security and privacy officer,” a man whose state employment has since ended.

Identified as Patrick Wright, he worked under the Department of Administrative Services’ Office of the Chief Information Officer. The state information office said it alerted Foley’s office and the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office in December, when it found alleged improprieties.
The Auditor’s Office issued a 24-page report, largely copies of reimbursement forms, and recommendations for improvement to Wright’s supervisors, who said Wright at first was placed on administrative leave and then resigned during the investigation.
Contacted by the Nebraska Examiner, Wright and his lawyer said they were reviewing the auditor’s report and would make a statement at a later date. 
Foley said his team did not reach out to Wright for comment or explanation, given that the Attorney General’s Office already was involved. The AG’s Office did not immediately respond for comment. 
The auditing team noted that Wright was employed by the state from July 2020 through this February, and was paid about $120,000 when he left.
Foley called the situation concerning. 
“That these allegations of financial impropriety are leveled at someone to whom the state’s data security and privacy was entrusted should give everyone pause,” Foley said. 
 ‘Misunderstanding’ 

According to the auditor’s report, Wright during his tenure and on two separate occasions submitted reimbursement requests to both the state and third-party organizations for the same expenses, using “identical documentation.”
Wright allegedly received about $500 of undue duplicative payments, Foley said. Those were related to an August 2024 work-related trip to Milwaukee. 
Foley said the overall amount of alleged undue reimbursements might have been higher, but that it appears Wright sought to rectify a double payment situation a few months later related to a Washington D.C. trip, after officials questioned “suspicious” reimbursement requests. 
Wright in January returned a $2,266 check to a third-party organization, explaining in an accompanying letter that there was a “misunderstanding” and the check related to the D.C. trip should be issued to the State of Nebraska rather than to him personally. The letter was included in the auditor’s report.
“In addition to giving rise to concerns regarding possible theft, forgery and even abuse of public records, the putative double-dealing by the former Security and Privacy Officer could implicate him in having violated Nebraska law forbidding use of public office or resources for unauthorized personal gain,” Foley said in a news release.
He said the auditing team’s findings were turned over to the Attorney General’s Office, the Nebraska State Patrol, the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission and the Lancaster County Attorney’s Office for review.
While employed by the state, Wright also served on the executive committee of the Center for Internet Security’s Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center. The auditor’s report notes that he currently directs Cyber Strong Nebraska, a nonprofit dedicated to enhancing cybersecurity awareness, education and resources within the state. 
 Recoup funds

Foley said the state information office, directed by Chief Information Officer Matthew McCarville under Administrative Services, cooperated and pledged to take safeguards against similar situations.
The information office’s response included in the auditor’s letter said the agency would try to recoup any funds determined to have been improperly paid and said it would cooperate with any further investigations. 
McCarville, in a statement to the Examiner, said his office is dedicated to being a good steward of taxpayer dollars and that prevention of fraud and misuse of public funds remains a top priority. 
He  said the review led the information office to amend internal policies and to enhance procedures for approving travel expense reimbursement forms.
“Our agency acted quickly to ensure that proper and immediate reporting occurred to the State Auditor and the Attorney General’s Office when this situation came to light,” said McCarville.

The Trump administration said Thursday that hospitals participating in Medicaid and Medicare would be prohibited from administering gender-affirming care to minors, among other proposed rule changes.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Hospitals participating in Medicaid and Medicare would be prohibited from administering gender-affirming care to minors under one of several new proposed rules, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said Thursday.
The announcement appears to clash with Vermont’s 2023 “shield laws”, which offer protections to providers and recipients of gender-affirming care, and establish that treatment as an essential part of full insurance coverage. 
In a press conference Thursday morning, Kennedy said his department’s move was grounded in an executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. One new rule will seek to cut off Medicaid funds for “sex-rejecting” practices including hormone therapy and surgical procedures, among other treatments, while another proposes to withhold both Medicaid and Medicare money entirely from hospitals that provide those services.

“This is not medicine — it is malpractice,” Kennedy said of such care. “These procedures fail to meet professionally-recognized standards.”
Many of the country’s leading professional medical associations — including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics — are supportive of gender affirming care for minors.
The University of Vermont Medical Center’s Transgender Youth Program is the primary place in Vermont for young people to access gender-affirming care.
“We want our patients to know that as of today, there is no change in how we provide care,” a spokesperson for the hospital network said by email on Thursday. “We remain committed to ensuring the availability of evidence-based gender-affirming care … Research consistently shows that this care improves health and well-being, and decisions should remain between patients and their providers.”
Vermont Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant stressed the state’s commitment to providing gender-affirming care Thursday.
“Access to gender affirming care is the law in Vermont,” Hildebrant said in an emailed statement. “We will continue to support providers and work to preserve access to care for vulnerable Vermont communities, regardless of any potential federal changes.”
All of Vermont’s hospitals accept Medicaid patients. Indeed, each of the state’s hospitals relied on Medicare and Medicaid for more than two-thirds of inpatient care payments in 2022, according to an analysis by the American Hospital Association. 
Mehmet Oz, who heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the proposed rules would likely remain open for comment and deliberation for several months before they are finalized.
Advocates in Vermont expressed concern over Thursday’s developments.
“Vermont’s responsibility to provide access to affordable health care for all kids does not change based on federal Medicare and Medicaid rules,” said Monica Allard, a staff attorney at ACLU of Vermont, in a statement Thursday. 
“With these proposed rules, the Trump administration is trying to threaten health care access for everyone unless providers abandon trans youth,” Allard continued. “That’s not governance — it’s extortion.”
Kennedy said he expects legal pushback to the new rules.
“The number of lawsuits with my name on it right now is almost beyond counting,” he said, adding that he was confident of eventual success in such litigation.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a prestigious cultural hub in the nation’s capital, will be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Thursday.The renaming comes after President Donald Trump named himself chair of the board in February in a major shake-up. He later fired the Kennedy Center president as well as board members appointed by President Joe Biden before appointing his own members.Leavitt said the board unanimously approved the name change. However, a federal statute appears to prohibit the renaming of portions of the center, which is considered a living memorial to Kennedy.“After December 2, 1983, no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts,” according to the U.S. code. Congress likely would need to change the law for the center to be renamed officially. The Kennedy Center was renamed in 1964 to honor President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated.Leavitt said the renaming was “because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation.”“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!,” she wrote.Since the president’s takeover of the center, major artists and performers have canceled performances or boycotted performing. The artist Issa Rae, and the musical “Hamilton” will no longer perform at the center and dozens of cast members of “Les Misérables” refused to perform for Trump officials earlier this year.",,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

A House GOP proposal could take that nearly statewide. (Stock photo by Motortion/Getty Images)Twenty South Carolina sheriff’s departments have standing agreements to aid federal immigration officials. A House GOP proposal could take that to all but one of the state’s 46 counties.
A bill filed ahead of the legislative session that begins in January would require all law enforcement agencies that operate a jail to sign agreements with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement under its 287(g) program — named for the section of a 1996 law that authorized it.
“Many are already doing this,” Rep. Travis Moore, the bill’s lead sponsor, told the SC Daily Gazette. “We’re just making it equal across the board.”
The Roebuck attorney was joined by 47 other state House Republicans who signed on to the proposal.
Participation in ICE agreements has skyrocketed both in South Carolina and nationwide under the Trump administration.
In addition to the 20 South Carolina counties, seven town police departments and two state agencies also have signed agreements with ICE. None of the towns with existing agreements have jails, so the proposed new requirement would not apply to them.


If the bill were to pass, four more city police departments — Anderson, Greer, Myrtle Beach and Rock Hill — would have to sign agreements because they operate their own jails, along with 25 other counties.
The Richland County Sheriff’s Department would be exempt because the county, not the department, runs the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center.
Police and sheriff’s departments that do fall under the requirement would have to submit proof annually to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the state attorney general’s office showing they had signed agreements or had attempted to enter into one.
Those that fail to do so could be subject to state oversight or even suspension. The state’s Law Enforcement Training Council has the authority to temporarily suspend the certification of every officer working for a department, functionally blocking the department’s operations.
The law also mandates immigration-specific SLED training for all police and sheriff’s departments with a signed ICE agreement.
“It’s a public safety thing for me,” Moore said.
As a member of South Carolina’s National Guard, Moore has worked security at the southern border. In that time, he was part of teams that stopped large groups of people being transported into the country illegally via rail cars and trucks. Encounters such as these have him concerned about the trafficking of both humans and drugs, especially fentanyl.
“I don’t think people appreciate how serious it is,” Moore said of the deadly drug.
Moore stressed the purpose of the proposed bill was to aid ICE in detaining people who had committed crimes while they were in the United States illegally.
“These are people who have been arrested for committing crimes,” he said. “This isn’t a go out and find people thing. These are people processed into the jail.”
Sheriffs and police chiefs can choose any of three types of ICE agreements to meet the bill’s requirements.
The first type of agreement trains officers to serve warrants on undocumented immigrants already in jail for something else — called the “warrant service officer” model. The second, the “jail enforcement model,” lets local agencies identify people in their jail subject to deportation, according to the program website.
However, officers operating under the third, so-called “task force model,” recently reinstated by the Trump Administration, can challenge a person’s immigration status during their normal police duties, whether that person is arrested for another crime or not.
The two state agencies participating, SLED and the Department of Public Safety, which operates the state Highway Patrol, have opted into this agreement. As have 13 of South Carolina’s local law enforcement departments.
During the first 11 months of the year, only two sheriff’s departments, Horry and York, reported using the agreement, according to monthly updates compiled by ICE. Both have jail enforcement agreements signed in 2020. The two departments detained people from Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, the United Kingdom and El Salvador.
Those arrested stood accused of crimes including breaking into cars, petty theft, domestic violence, assault, drugs and weapons possession, sexual conduct with minors who ranged from age 8 to age 15, one person with a prior charge of distributing fentanyl and a drunken driving incident where a pedestrian was struck and killed.
Some SC officials want to give bonuses for law enforcement officers helping ICE

Most had entered the country illegally. But one person had overstayed a temporary work visa and another was a lawful permanent resident, according to the reports.
The counties and cities that have agreed to help out the federal government with immigration enforcement previously took on these extra responsibilities with no promise of funding for operating expenses or overtime pay for officers. And many jails in the state already face overcrowding and staffing shortages.
The proposed legislation does not call for any state money to help with costs.
But, the massive tax policy and spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 included funding to reimburse law enforcement agencies for salaries and benefits of officers hired to carry out the agreements going forward. It also funded quarterly bonuses to agencies based on the number of immigrants they find who don’t have permission to be in the country.
Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, has said he wants to take that a step further, creating a national fund of $1 billion, which participating states, counties and cities could use to give officers bonuses. The amount of funding would depend on the type of 287(g) agreement the agencies entered into, he previously told the SC Daily Gazette.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)An Assembly panel advanced legislation Thursday to expand protections for imprisoned women in New Jersey, after brutality and sex abuse scandals drove Gov. Phil Murphy to order the troubled Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women closed and replaced.
The bill, known as the Incarcerated Women’s Protection Act, would enact “gender-responsive” policies from entry through release and reentry, and require the state Department of Corrections to mandate annual gender-specialized training for all correctional officers who supervise imprisoned women.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez (D-Middlesex) chairs the Assembly’s community development and women’s affairs committee, which heard the bill Thursday.
The bill would codify protections adopted since sexual misconduct problems drove federal authorities to intervene in 2021 and declare oversight, Lopez said. It also builds on a 2020 law she also sponsored, known as the Dignity Act, that set new protections for incarcerated parents and pregnant women, she added.

“The time spent inside of prison informs life after prison, and if we truly want individuals to return and succeed in society, we need to ensure their experience while incarcerated is free from abuse and marked by support from the very beginning,” Lopez said.
The bill also would establish a special victims unit to investigate allegations of sexual assault or misconduct and require investigators to get gender-informed and victim-centered training on how to best investigate such cases.
A division of women’s services would be created to develop policies, programs, and services addressing treatment for physical or sexual abuse, parenting, and child reunification. The bill also would require the department to offer parenting classes, doula services, and family reunification programs for pregnant inmates and counseling and reentry services for women scheduled for release within six months.
Edwin “Chino” Ortiz, who heads a returning citizens support group of Essex and Union counties, called the measure overdue and urged legislators to pass it.
“Because someone commits a crime does not mean that they lose their rights to be treated as a human being,” Ortiz said. “We have a moral obligation as citizens of this state, of this country, to protect those who are most vulnerable and who are supposed to be protected.”
Groups supporting the legislation included the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, Salvation and Social Justice, and the state Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson.
The panel advanced the bill along party lines, with Assemblyman Al Barlas (R-Essex) voting no.
The bill, which has been stalled in the Assembly since it was introduced in September 2024, has a narrow window to make it to the governor’s desk, with the current legislative session set to end in less than a month. The bill’s Senate companion passed in committee but still awaits a full Senate vote.
Murphy in 2021 ordered that Edna Mahan be closed after more than a dozen correctional officers were arrested for brutally assaulting incarcerated women during a violent night of forced cell extractions.
While more than a dozen officers were arrested, a state judge dismissed their criminal indictment in October, citing deficiencies in the indictment and the state’s four-year delay in preparing the case for trial.
Construction on a new 420-bed, $310 million state prison for women began in October in Chesterfield, where the prison will relocate from Clinton.

Doctors and advocates have said joining such compacts would play a key role in addressing a statewide doctor shortage. According to research from the National Conference of State Legislatures, states that join the main compact for physicians, the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, have experienced a 10% to 15% increase in licensed physicians.
The compacts enable doctors in member states to more easily move between states. Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan advocacy group, compares the compacts to driver’s licenses that allow people to drive freely across the country; the New Mexico Medical Board compares them to TSA pre-check, saying the compacts allow doctors to be “pre-cleared” to work here but still subject to a rigorous screening process. 
But unlike 43 states, including New Mexico’s five border states, New Mexico is neither a member of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, nor part of eight other major compacts for paramedics, audiologists, dentists and other specialties, according to Think New Mexico.
Las Cruces doctors push for legislation to stem New Mexico doctor shortage

The physician compact was one of six that died in the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year after receiving bipartisan approval in the House. One of the others, the compact for social workers, received endorsements from the state health and education departments, both of which said joining was likely to help the state address its mental health provider shortage. According to the compact website, 30 states, including Arizona, Colorado and Utah, are part of the Social Work Licensure Compact. 
Think New Mexico issued a statement Tuesday describing a “growing coalition” pushing the Legislature, namely Senate Democrats, to join the compacts, and listed 16 health care providers, three chambers of commerce, four gubernatorial candidates, labor unions, nonprofits and civic groups across the political spectrum like the Coalition of Conservatives in Action and Indivisible Albuquerque. 
“Joining the interstate health care worker compacts unites New Mexicans all across the political spectrum,” said Fred Nathan, Think New Mexico’s director, in a statement.
Wirth, in an emailed statement Wednesday afternoon to Source NM, said joining the compacts is a complex undertaking, requiring negotiations with each compact commission while also maintaining the state’s authority in a way that “continues to protect patients and those who serve them.”
At the end of the first special legislative session in October, Wirth committed to involving Republican state lawmakers in a working group that would draft legislation. In an emailed statement Wednesday afternoon, Wirth said he expects the Legislature to pass both the physician compact and one for social workers early in the session beginning Jan. 20. 
“I’m pleased to report that the bipartisan, bicameral group working on the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact and the Social Worker Compact are close to finalizing legislation that will allow New Mexico to join both compacts,” he said.
NM Senate Dems unlikely to move on medical compacts for special session

As for the remaining compacts that Think New Mexico’s coalition are pushing for, Wirth said several are “in the pipeline,” including for paramedics, physical therapists and psychologists. 
“Each needs to go through a deliberate vetting process, similar to what we are doing with the medical and social work compacts,” he said. “I support joining compacts when the work has been done upfront to ensure that the state will truly benefit from the results.”
According to Think New Mexico, the state lacks 2,510 Emergency Medical Technicians, 526 physical therapists, 281 physician assistants and 114 occupational therapists to meet national benchmarks. The state also lost 248 doctors between 2019 and 2024, an 8.1% decrease in the same period that the United States saw a roughly 7% increase in doctors nationwide.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wirth_DP-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

On Thursday morning,[...]","Downed lines and trees were an issue in Missoula (NorthWestern Energy photo)High winds ripped across Montana on Wednesday and early Thursday, knocking out power lines, shutting down roads and generally causing havoc.
Gusts nearing 100 miles per hour battered the state, according to a National Weather Service report. Thousands across the state lost power, including more than 30,000 people in the Flathead Valley.
On Thursday morning, NorthWestern Energy’s outage map showed dozens of scattered outages across the state, including larger ones near Boulder and Clancy.
One day earlier, NorthWestern said 35,000 households had experienced outages, and crews were working as quickly as possible to safely restore services.
 More wind could be on the way — the National Weather Service has wind advisories in effect for western Montana, including the Missoula and Bitterroot valleys and wind watches in effect for west-central Montana. This includes locations in Cascade County, including the Little Belt and Highwood mountains, as well as eastern Toole and Liberty counties. Additionally, eastern Pondera County and eastern Teton County are also under a high-wind advisory through Friday morning.
The weather was well out of the norm, according to Trent Parker, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service based in Missoula.
“This is very unusual,” Parker said on Thursday, adding that strong wind is usually associated more with something like a thunderstorm, and that wasn’t the case.
“One of the key pieces is that we were so warm,” Parker said. “Usually this time of year, we’re able to lock in some colder air down to the lower valleys. And what that would do is it kind of puts a lid on top of us and prevents those really strong winds from mixing down towards the surface. Usually, if we have that cold air down the valleys, the wind kind of just rides on top of all those locations where we have a lot of people.”
Those strong winds came from the upper atmosphere, Parker said, with a low pressure system exacerbating their ferocity. Saturated ground is also an issue, he said — normally at this point in the year, the ground is frozen and trees would not have as much of an issue standing up to winds.
“That prevents the trees from really being cemented in the ground,” Parker said.
The highest wind gust recorded — 93 miles per hour — on Wednesday was in Park County, though the National Weather Service warned in the post not all recordings are considered official. Big Timber saw a gust of 88 miles per hour, while the Billings airport recorded wind speeds reaching 79 miles per hour. 
Firefighters in Billings said the wind event spawned more than 170 calls for service, including “multiple working structure fires,” according to a post from their union. In Missoula, the city said on Wednesday afternoon that it was responding to reports of downed trees and power lines.
Roads had to be closed in both Missoula and Helena because of the storm — including the usually busy intersection of Montana Avenue and Custer Avenue in the northern part of the Queen City. City officials also shut down Helena’s walking mall and warned pedestrians to take extreme caution.
In northern Montana, blizzard conditions brought travel in several counties to a standstill. It also led to a rare advisory.
“A Civil Emergency Message has been issued for Phillips, Valley, Roosevelt and McCone counties through 6 AM due to whiteout blizzard conditions,” a NWS bulletin sent shortly after 9:30 p.m. Wednesday reads. “Road closures include all of the City of Glasgow, US Highway 2 from Malta to Wolf Point and MT Highway 13 from Wolf Point to Circle.”
Highway 2 was reopened Thursday morning, according to a post from the Phillips County Sheriff’s Office. Law enforcement there reported multiple vehicles stuck “on all roads in Phillips County” on Wednesday evening.
“No travel is advised,” a social media post from the Phillips County Sheriff’s Department said. “If you feel the need to travel you better make sure you have supplies because we do not have the manpower to come rescue you.” 
According to its website, Phillips County has five dispatchers, five deputies, a sheriff, and an undersheriff.
Lincoln County, where flooding prompted an earlier emergency declaration from Gov. Greg Gianforte and request for federal assistance, also issued an advisory for its residents to not travel unless it was an emergency. 
Wheatland County also temporarily closed Highway 191 due to an incident involving a semi truck, though it was reopened late Wednesday night.
“Winds have been reported strong enough that patrol vehicles are unable to stay on the roadway,” Wheatland County Emergency management reported on Facebook on Wednesday.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MISSOULANWE597900415_1331820015651591_635131538495968923_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 14:58:33.678499

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Across the Northwest, a record warm fall and lack of snowpack going into the winter is putting more drought pressure on Oregon, Idaho, Washington and western Montana.
Despite record rain in western Washington recently, and earlier this year in central and southern Oregon, the showers are filling up already overdrawn reservoirs in many areas, scientists said on Monday at an online drought and climate outlook meeting hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
2021 heat dome left Rhode Island-sized damage in Oregon’s, Washington’s western forests

Snowpack in the region and in the Cascade Range, acting as a reservoir of its own for summer months when there’s little rain and many communities rely on snowmelt, is simply not piling up.
Snowpack in the Northwest is sitting at the lowest level for the region as a whole at this point in the winter since record keeping began in 2001, according to Jacob Genuise, a climatologist at the Washington State Climate Office.
“We’re seeing just really warm storms with a lot of rain and not a lot of snow,” Genuise said. “Given all this warm rain, it actually melted some of our snowpack, and we saw a decline.”
 Northwest had warmest season in more than 130 years of recordkeeping

The Northwest just experienced its sixth warmest August on record, the warmest September on record — about 6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal on average — and the second warmest November on record, according to NOAA data.
Taken together, August through November of this year was the record warmest on average across the Northwest in more than 130 years of record keeping. NASA scientists, using NOAA records of global average temperatures dating back to 1880, found that this November was the third-warmest November on Earth, behind only November of 2023 and 2024.
But in 2023 and 2024, a planet-warming El Niño weather pattern helped fuel record temperatures, according to the data. There was no El Niño event to drive temperatures this year.
Temperatures in the Northwest have been most abnormal across all of Idaho, eastern Washington and eastern Oregon, and in western Montana.
“It’s definitely not good,” Genuise said. “We’ve seen much more above normal years in the past few decades than we did in the past.”
 Rain, not snow

By the end of this summer, drought took hold of the Northwest, Genuise said, especially in parts of northern Idaho and southeast Washington. Snow melted too quickly in spring, creating drought as the summer went on, and abnormal heat also increased surface water evaporation in lakes and streams, lowering water levels that contributed to drought in parts of the region.
In the last month, most of western Oregon was at 50% of its normal level of precipitation for this time of year, according to Brad Pugh, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center.
Only southern and central Oregon have been spared major drought impacts this year, but reservoirs that filled from heavy spring rains are also being quickly depleted, he said.
Everywhere north of Oregon is experiencing above average rainfall, Pugh said.
This will potentially help pull the Northwest out of a region-wide drought in the coming weeks or month, according to Pugh, but much of that will also depend on whether or not it gets cold enough for rain to turn into snow and snowpack.
The only area in the region getting roughly normal snowpack is western Montana, where temperatures have been just-cold-enough to turn rain to snow. All of Oregon and most of southern Washington are seeing “really, really deep snowpack deficits,” Genuise said.
If the snowpack is still bad in the spring, there could be ongoing drought issues in the year ahead, Genuise added.
“We could see this change, and this is likely to change as we see some wetter and cooler systems later in the month, but we’re definitely sitting well below normal as we talk here today,” he said.

(Photo by Doug Mills - Pool/Getty Images)President Donald Trump is headed to Rocky Mount Friday night for his third visit to North Carolina this year, and the first of the upcoming campaign season for the 2026 midterm elections. 
According to a White House advisory, the doors of the Rocky Mount Convention Center will open at 6:00 P.M. Friday. The president will likely speak after 9:00 P.M.  
Rocky Mount is located in the newly-redrawn 1st Congressional District, which is now more likely to elect a Republican candidate after decades of representation by Black Democrats. Republican state lawmakers redrew the district in October at Trump’s request.
Incumbent Rep. Don Davis, a Snow Hill Democrat, has said he will run for re-election in 2026 despite the redrawn map. 
Several Republicans have already filed for the March primary, including state Senator Bobby Hanig (R-Currituck) and Laurie Buckhout, the winner of the district’s 2024 GOP primary. Buckhout lost to Davis in 2024 by only a few thousand votes. She’s been working in the Trump administration for the past year. 
The Trump administration hasn’t yet said what the president will be speaking about. His address from the White House Wednesday evening largely focused on inflation and rising health care costs. 
But if history is any guide, the president could use the event to make endorsements in the 1st district primary as well as the U.S. Senate primary. 
Former national GOP chairman Michael Whatley is the best-known name in the Senate primary, and the one with the closest ties to Trump through his work with Trump and daughter-in-law Lara Trump at the RNC. Whatley broke the news of Trump’s event on social media earlier in the week.
However, several other candidates have filed to challenge Whatley for the nomination, including conservative activist Don Brown and Michele Morrow, the 2024 GOP nominee for state schools chief who lost to Democrat Mo Green.

Alissa Furry’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, names as defendants Polk City; the city manager, Chelsea Huisman, and the city’s police chief, Jeremy Siepker.
According to the lawsuit, Furry’s performance reviews indicated she met or exceeded all expectations throughout her employment with the city as a state-licensed paramedic. In 2023, she received her first Lifesaving Award recognizing her work on a cardiac-arrest call, and in 2024, she was recognized with the Rookie of the Year Award and two additional Lifesaving Awards. In 2025, she was voted Medic of the Year by her peers and received a fourth Lifesaving Award.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit alleges Furry never faced discipline from the city and that the city never raised any concerns about her job performance.
According to the lawsuit, Furry was off duty on Sept. 10, 2025, when she posted a message to her private Facebook account about that day’s shooting of Kirk.
The lawsuit alleges that in her post, Furry wrote: “Why I really don’t care that this guy died from gun violence. He was a bigoted prick, and according to his own words he died in an acceptable way. I have as much sympathy and empathy for him as that insurance CEO that was killed. I do care that two high school students were critically injured today due to gun violence at their school. Unfortunately, I’m seeing way more about this a–hole on my Facebook than I am the kids that were hurt.”
Furry’s post was in reference to Kirk’s public comments in April 2023 in which he said, “I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”
The lawsuit claims that a former coworker of Furry’s immediately contacted her and advised her to be cautious about what she posted on social media. Within four minutes of posting the comment, Furry deleted it, the lawsuit alleges.
Later, while off-duty at home, she posted another comment to her private Facebook account that stated: “Meanwhile, all I’m seeing is people extolling the virtues of the guy that said empathy is fake and condoned deaths from gun violence as long as we get to keep the second amendment. And yet people who are out of empathy to care about him are the bad ones.”
Minutes later, the lawsuit states, Furry shared another post that consisted of a quote attributed to the 19th-century Irish poet Oscar Wilde, which read, “Some men improve the world only by leaving it,” and which included the caption, “I can choose to ‘not celebrate,’ but also not be sad.”
According to the lawsuit, Siepker, the Polk City police chief, called Polk City Fire Chief Karla Hogrefe on Sept. 11, 2025, to discuss the Facebook posts and to share that he had received complaints from city police officers about the posts.
On Sept. 16, 2025, the fire chief allegedly called Furry and informed her that she was being placed on administrative leave due to her social media posts while indicating she did not agree with the city’s decision but that her hands were tied.
The lawsuit claims that on Sept. 22, 2025, Huisman, the city manager, completed an internal investigation of the matter and recommended Furry be fired. On Oct. 24, 2025, the city issued its final decision in the matter and terminated Furry’s employment.
The lawsuit alleges Furry was fired because Huisman and Siepker disagreed with Furry’s opinions and that it is a “clearly established law that a public employer may not terminate an employee for speech made as a private citizen on a matter of public concern absent evidence that the speech meaningfully impaired discipline, workplace harmony, or operational efficiency.”
According to the lawsuit, other Polk City employees, all of whom are men, made “numerous political posts on social media, including derogatory remarks about political figures and jokes violating city policies, but received no discipline.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for First Amendment retaliation and also seeks an order that reinstates Furry to her position as a city firefighter and paramedic. The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Huisman and Siepker for comment.
Earlier this year, state Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and state Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, signed a letter to the Iowa Board of Regents calling for the immediate firing of employees who, in their view, had “publicly celebrated” Kirk’s death.
Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley, a Republican, took to Facebook to write that “teachers in Iowa (are) praising the assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Grassley wrote that he expected school districts to “investigate these posts and reprimand the posters appropriately,” adding that “if appropriate action is not taken, you can trust that the Iowa House Government Oversight Committee will address this issue and take action to root out this hate from our schools.”
In the days after Kirk’s death, a Creston school teacher, a state public defender, an Iowa State University employee, and an Oskaloosa school teacher were fired for comments they made in the aftermath of Kirk’s death.

Rank MI Vote, the grassroots organization pushing for a ballot initiative to establish ranked choice voting in Michigan, has paused its statewide efforts to get that measure on the 2026 ballot.

The measure would have needed over 446,000 signatures by June in order to be included on the ballot.
Republican House Speaker Matt Hall of Richland Township celebrated the decision to halt the campaign, calling it a “complete failure” and a “terrible proposal.” House Republicans passed a bill earlier this year that would ban all ranked choice voting in Michigan, which has been referred to the Committee on Elections and Ethics in the Senate.
“I said from the beginning that the people of Michigan strongly oppose ranked choice voting, and the news today shows exactly that,” Hall said in a press release. “We’re not going to allow out-of-state, left-wing radicals to come here and hijack our elections. Never going to happen.”
Ranked choice voting had been the target of conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation, who said that among the group’s 2026 priorities was to end ranked choice voting completely.  
It had also been criticized by some organizations of election administrators, specifically the Michigan Association of County Clerks, who passed a resolution in October urging voters to reject the proposal. 
Zabawa added that the “work is just getting started, and we will continue our efforts to advocate for and win Ranked Choice Voting throughout the state as we enter the new year.”

The land has been at the center of a controversy involving hunting interests, school trust principles and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation. (Courtesy of the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration) A Native American tribe alleges a top state lawmaker plotted with other officials to block it from buying a swath of mountain wilderness that is part of its ancestral land and popular with hunters.
The Ute Indian Tribe sued the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration and several state officials in 2023, saying the tribe’s bid of nearly $47 million was the highest “legitimate” bid for the Tabby Mountain lands spanning about 45 square miles in eastern Utah.
The tribe said in court filings it “was rejected only because of racial discrimination.” The trust land agency ultimately decided in 2019 not to sell the land to anyone.

An updated lawsuit filed in November names House Speaker Mike Schultz as a defendant, along with more than a dozen other current and former state officials. The suit alleges Schultz worked with fellow state lawmakers and officials at SITLA and the Utah Department of Natural Resources to keep the land in state hands and to pass a new law “in retaliation” against the tribe.
The lawsuit contends Schultz, while House majority leader in 2019, threatened a trust lands employee, telling him, “sell it to the Tribe and see what happens to you.” That employee, Tim Donaldson, went on to become director of the Utah Land Trusts Protection and Advocacy Office. 
In 2022, Donaldson filed a complaint alleging the sale process was rigged and was terminated from his job the following day, the lawsuit states. 
The 2024 state law allows the Department of Natural Resources preferential treatment in the sale of other large blocks of school trust land topping more than 5,000 acres. Its sponsor, Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, is also a defendant in the suit.
Critics say bill prioritizes hunting access over money for schools

Reps. Schultz and Snider declined to comment on allegations in the ongoing lawsuit. 
“However, the narrative being presented is simply inaccurate,” they said in a joint statement on Wednesday. “We firmly believe all Utahns should continue to have access to enjoy Tabby Mountain and all our state has to offer.” 
The lawsuit outlines an alleged conspiracy for the Department of Natural Resources to outbid the tribe with a “sham” $50 million offer that the department couldn’t actually pay, then for SITLA to postpone the sale indefinitely, citing issues with an appraisal. 
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Natural Resources said “DNR’s bids were made in good faith, and the money pledged in those bids would have been paid to SITLA had the property been transferred to DNR.”
Kim Wells, DNR’s communications director, noted the agency has been dismissed from the suit. She said the planned purchase would have added the land to an existing wildlife management area.
“Preserving public access and maintaining habitat for wildlife have been and continue to be the singular goals of acquiring this property,” Wells added, saying the department has “worked cooperatively with the Tribe for many years.” 
Tabby Mountain was originally included in the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, but President Theodore Roosevelt later designated it as national forest land. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 restored mineral rights to the tribe, but not ownership of the land underneath.
The lawsuit alleges discrimination amounting to civil rights violations and seeks a judge’s order compelling the sale of the land to the tribe and tossing out the state law. The Ute tribe is also seeking punitive damages to be determined at trial.  
The School and Institutional Trust Administration, now the Trust Lands Administration, did not immediately return messages seeking comment. They have previously argued the claim of racial discrimination is unfounded and the agency has broad discretion in managing public trust lands.

The grants and loans will be used to purchase firetrucks, warning sirens and to upgrade wastewater and water distribution systems in 20 Iowa counties, according to a news release Thursday from the department. 
More than $7 million of the total announced awards went to water improvement projects in Russell, Ricketts, Pisgah and the unincorporated community of Green Mountain in Marshall County.
The City of Russell received a more than $2 million loan and a $1.3 million grant to update old water pipes to meet modern standards and reduce water loss.

The City of Pisgah was awarded a nearly $1.4 million loan and a $1.1 million grant for the construction of a new piping, electrical gear, pumps and controls at its wells and ground storage sites. The funding will also go toward emergency standby systems, replacing lead elements in service lines, building hydrants and main lines through parts of the city. 
The City of Ricketts received smaller grants and loans through the same Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants program to line its sewers, seal manholes and build a new discharge lagoon for its wastewater treatment system. The city received a $200,000 loan and a $900,000 grant for the improvements. 
Iowa Regional Utilities received $650,000 total in grants and loans to build the first-ever centralized sewer system in the unincorporated community of Green Mountain.
North Iowa Area Council of Governments and the Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity received grants of slightly less than $65,000 each to assist with improvements to low-income housing. 
Communities received a cumulative total of $192,400 in grants to upgrade public safety equipment. 
The cities of Ashton and Miles will use the funding to purchase new siren and warning system. Waukon, Albia and Clarion received higher grant amounts to purchase a K9 law-enforcement vehicle, a fire rescue truck and a law enforcement patrol vehicle.
The cities of Epworth and Sabula will use their grants, to obtain firefighting equipment. 
Michael Sexton, the state’s rural development director, said the administration is “championing” infrastructure projects that give rural and agricultural communities “more solid footing for the future.”
“USDA recognizes the unique challenges faced by smaller Iowa communities as the need for clean water and emergency response grows in places that support our nation’s essential food supply chains,” Sexton said in the news release.

Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, filed to run for lieutenant governor on Monday, according to public records.
Ensler was elected to Alabama State House of Representatives in 2022, defeating incumbent Republican Charlotte Meadows. The district had been held by Republicans since 2002, but redistricting made it more favorable to Democrats. Ensler’s victory marked the first Democratic flip of a seat in the Alabama Legislature since 2010. 
He announced this summer that he would not seek re-election for House District 74 to move back to his home state, New York, to be closer to family.

“My mind has not been at peace since I made the announcement that I would be moving back to NY,” Ensler said in a statement Thursday morning. “My heart is here in Alabama and with the people who have become my extended family.”
Ensler is the first Democrat to join the race for the second highest state office. Until Wednesday, six candidates were in the Republican primary for the office. Former Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron dropped out of the race to “accept a new career opportunity in football.”
Current Secretary of State Wes Allen, Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries Rick Pate; businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth; former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and sheriff’s deputy Patrick Bishop are still in the GOP primary.
The lieutenant governor becomes governor if the office becomes vacant and has some appointment powers. The office once held powers equivalent to the Alabama House speaker, but Democrats who controlled the Legislature shifted those to the Senate president pro tem after a weeks-long standoff with Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a Republican, in 1999. The lieutenant governor now presides over the Senate and can vote in case of a tie, but has few powers otherwise.
In his first term in the Legislature, Ensler advocated for a statewide ban of Glock switches, devices that can turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic ones. A version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, became law in the spring as part of Gov. Kay Ivey’s public safety package. The bill was the first firearm restriction legislation to pass the Alabama House of Representatives since 2010.
The last Democrat to be elected to the office was former Gov. Jim Folsom Jr. in 2006.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents agreed to weigh feedback from professors, administrators and legislators before voting on systemwide faculty tenure and workload policies designed to bring accountability and transparency to academic personnel decisions at the state’s six public universities.
Since the Board of Regents released drafts of the policies in November, complaints surfaced that allowing the firing of university professors after two consecutive unsatisfactory annual evaluations was “overly rigid” and didn’t take into account “extenuating circumstances,” such as an employee’s personal crisis.
In addition, concern was expressed the workload policy conflicted with standards of the American Association of University Professors or with academic program accreditation guidelines.
Objections were raised about membership of post-tenure review committees and whether the university committee deciding to place a faculty member on a one-year improvement plan would be the same group that performed the follow-up evaluation. Another issue was that one year could be an unrealistic period of time for a faculty member to correct deficiencies in research productivity, officials said.
“We’re appreciative of that input because it is beneficial and helpful as we look at trying to stand up this policy,” said Board of Regents member Alysia Johnston, who has a background in community college administration.
She said the goal was implementation of umbrella policies applicable to the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Wichita State University, Fort Hays State University, Pittsburg State University and Emporia State University.
The Board of Regents engaged in general discussion of the draft policies Wednesday and could take formal action on both in January.
During the past few years, members of the Legislature have taken greater interest in university workload and tenure decisions. In 2024, a Kansas House committee welcomed to the Capitol a tenured faculty member at Emporia State who recommended retroactive elimination of tenure at state universities. The idea was opposed by K-State president Richard Linton and KU chancellor Doug Girod.
 
Return on investment
Rusty Monhollon, vice president of academic affairs for the Board of Regents, said the systemwide tenure and workload policies were the result of persistent calls for greater transparency and accountability regarding faculty appointments.
“It’s my own sense that very few faculty would be opposed to greater accountability because the work they do is good. They are very productive and they would stand up under scrutiny,” he said.
Monhollon, a former executive director of the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education, said tenure was awarded to faculty following extensive vetting of each person’s teaching, research and service performance over a period of years. Tenure was mistakenly viewed by the public as a lifetime appointment, he said.
Academic freedom, a pivotal component of faculty tenure across the United States, was essential to success of colleges or universities, he said.
“Tenure is there to protect faculty to pursue research or to take on topics that are controversial,” Monhollon said. “If those protections aren’t in place for faculty, I think we lose that ability of faculty to take on difficult challenges, maybe pursue paths that are a bit unconventional, that many times bear the kind of results that really advance society and benefit all of us.”
Matt Crocker, a Manhattan businessman appointed to the Board of Regents in October, said changes to workload and tenure expectations at state universities should recognize the value in making certain taxpayers received proper return on public investments in higher education. He serves as CEO of SPS Companies, which includes Steel and Pipe Supply Co.
He said Monhollon’s comments about protecting academic freedom raised the question: “Protect them from whom?”
“If an individual’s not working in line with the mission of the university, I’m not sure that’s really something we want to protect,” Crocker said. “I don’t think we want to mix a lot of concepts together inadvertently as we look through these policies.”
 
Revised expectations
Under the proposed reforms, the Board of Regents would adopt academic workload expectations and require post-tenure review of faculty at research-centered KU, WSU and K-State and the regional universities in Pittsburg, Emporia and Hays. The core obligation of all faculty in the system would be teaching, research and service, but instruction of students would be the most significant factor in assessments.
Faculty at K-State, WSU and KU would be expected to have teaching loads ranging from 40% to 55%. The three regional universities would have teaching loads of 60% to 75%. Research expectations for tenured professors would be specific to each discipline.
The faculty would have personalized work plans that were revised annually. Tenured faculty would be reviewed by a university committee every five years. Proponents of reform say collection of data on faculty would serve to better identify professors who excelled and those who fell short. The process could replace subjective elements of faculty evaluations with tangible evidence of research, teaching and service.
Each university would retain control of post-tenure faculty reviews and the provisions of self-improvement programs for faculty. Individuals could be placed in one-year remediation programs. The policy would enable universities to dismiss faculty who failed the follow-up review.
The universities would submit to the Board of Regents annual reports on tenure that included information on tenure awards and denials, the number of faculty placed on improvement plans as well as faculty resignations and dismissals. Biennial reports prepared for the Board of Regents would document faculty credit hour production, graduation rates, publications and research funding.
Johnston, who chairs the Board of Regents’ academic affairs committee, said she anticipated reports on tenure and workload to prove state universities in Kansas maintained high expectations of tenured faculty.
“I hope, with greater transparency, the data will prove just that,” she said. “I believe it will show that this is a rigorous process.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Matt-Crocker-regents-nominee-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-12-18 13:58:06.655119

The appellate court’s decision overturned a decision in the Western District of Michigan, which denied injunctive relief to the Catholic groups and kept the state’s ban in place. 
“We hold, therefore, that HB 4616 is subject to the strictest of scrutiny, under the First Amendment, as a content- and viewpoint-discriminatory restriction upon speech,” Circuit Court Judge Raymond Kethledge wrote in his decision, joined by Judge Joan Larsen. “Indeed, as a viewpoint-based restriction on speech, under the Supreme Court’s precedents, HB 4616 might be unconstitutional per se.”
Lawsuit seeks to overturn Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy for minors

Kethledge was nominated to the federal bench by former President George W. Bush, while Larsen, who formerly served on the Michigan Supreme Court, was nominated by President Donald Trump during his first term. 
The law in question, House Bill 4616 of 2023, banned conversion therapy, which Gov. Gretchen Whitmer defined in a press release at the time as “Any intervention that attempts to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity.”
In order to meet the strict scrutiny requirement, the government must show that the law is the “least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest” — which Kethledge said that the government had not yet met.
The sole liberal judge on the court, Judge Rachel Bloomekatz, dissented, writing that “Not all words receive the same First Amendment protection, as is evident from the law’s long tradition of subjecting speech that administers a medical treatment to lesser First Amendment scrutiny.” 
She added that the medical consensus around conversion therapy is that it is harmful and should not be done, and that it was created as an idea when both homosexuality and gender identity were considered mental illnesses. 
Bloomekatz was nominated to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden.
Federal judge denies request to ax Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy

The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry — in alignment with a number of other medical groups — has said that conversion therapies “lack scientific credibility and clinical utility” and that “there is evidence that such interventions are harmful.” As such, the group states that these kinds of attempted treatments should not be part of any behavioral health treatment for children or teens. 
Over half of U.S. states, including some deep red states, have conversion therapy bans in place, but the question of their constitutionality is set to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case contesting a similar ban in Colorado. If the Supreme Court rules against Colorado, Michigan’s ban would all but certainly be overturned as well, regardless of the outcome of this case.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7664-2-scaled-e1691081297929-1024x7681691185680-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 13:58:06.655119

Wood4Good is entering an exciting new phase of growth as we expand our free firewood program into new regions across Vermont. After another record-setting year serving families in need, we are taking intentional steps to ensure that no Vermonter is left out in the cold—no matter where they live.
In the coming year, Wood4Good will establish new processing and distribution locations in Rochester, Burke, and Rutland County. These sites were chosen to help us reach more rural and underserved communities where access to affordable heating support is limited and winter can be especially challenging. Expanding into these regions requires new equipment, storage, transportation, and local infrastructure.
This growth is only possible with the support of both volunteers and donors. We need volunteers to help process, stack, and distribute firewood, and we rely on donations to cover operating costs such as fuel, equipment maintenance, safety gear, and transportation. Every hour volunteered and every dollar donated directly helps keep a family warm.
Firewood from these new locations will be available starting next winter, and the work to make that possible begins now. With continued community support—through time, resources, and financial contributions—we can build a stronger, warmer Vermont and ensure that no neighbor has to choose between food and heat.

Centre students and students from nearby schools observed the proceedings. (Administrative Office of the Courts)Nearly a year after it upheld a law that would have opened a path for the General Assembly to impose laws on a single Kentucky locale or entity, the Kentucky Supreme Court has reversed itself and declared the law unconstitutional. 
In a 4-3 ruling issued Thursday morning, the high court overturned a 2022 law that would at present only apply to Jefferson County Public Schools based on certain specific criteria spelled out in the legislation.
The 2022 law passed by the legislature’s Republican supermajority would have shifted power from the elected school board to the appointed superintendent. The attorney for the school board, David Tachau, argued that if the court’s original ruling stood, it could pave the way for lawmakers to widely use “special legislation,” or narrow state legislation that impacts a county or city and is prohibited under the Kentucky Constitution. 
Matthew Kuhn, solicitor general in the state attorney general’s office, argued declaring the law unconstitutional could have broad implications, such as undoing the laws that allow merged city-county governments in Lexington and Louisville. 
Before Justice Pamela Goodwine joined the court this year, the Supreme Court narrowly ruled last December to allow the law to stand. In April, the court agreed to rehear the case at the school board’s request. Oral arguments were held again in August. 
Justice Angela McCormick Bisig wrote in the majority opinion that justices were not saying “that the General Assembly may never enact legislation addressed to only one particular type of county or form of county government, but rather only that it cannot do so unreasonably.” She was joined by Justices Michelle Keller, Kelly Thompson and Goodwine. 
In the majority opinion, Bisig said the ruling is not a commentary on the legislature’s policy. “Oour limited duty is solely to consider whether the statute complies with or violates the Kentucky Constitution.” By her analysis, the law is not in line with the state Constitution. 
“Today we remain both steadfast in our strict observance of the separation of powers and mindful of our duty of judicial modesty to respect the acts of the General Assembly and afford them the presumption of constitutionality they deserve,” Bisig wrote. “Nonetheless, we also cannot allow this modesty to blind us to our solemn obligation to safeguard the rights of the citizens of this Commonwealth to government in conformity with the limitations set forth in our Constitution.”

Bisig also defended the court’s authority to rehear the case, knowing that it would “be easy fodder for those unhappy with today’s decision to argue it is due to nothing more than a change in the composition of this Court.”
“The present case involves allegations of unreasonable disparate treatment of the largest school district in the Commonwealth,” she wrote. “It is a matter of statewide interest as it relates not only to a reduction of the Jefferson County Board of Education’s powers, but also a denial to every other public school superintendent in the Commonwealth of extra powers afforded to the Jefferson County superintendent. It is thus a matter of significant concern to all citizens of the Commonwealth, as it fundamentally affects the governance of public schools and thus the education of Kentucky’s children.” 
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Shea Nickell criticized the decisions to rehear the case, saying the new court “has taken result oriented decision-making and disregard of well-established procedural rules to a new level of ‘judicial fog.’” He wrote that the school board had ample opportunity to make its case during the original proceedings and the previous court duly applied the law. Chief Justice Debra Lambert and Deputy Chief Justice Robert Conley joined Nickell’s opinion. 
Nickell wrote that some may chalk the new decision up to “glib political maxims, such as ‘elections have consequences.’”
“However, such excuses conveniently ignore that, within our government’s three-branched framework, stated broadly, legislative bodies are elected to enact laws aimed at pursuing chosen public policy goals and executive officers are elected to execute and enforce enacted laws to administer and achieve adopted public policy objectives, while judicial courts — however chosen — are restricted to interpreting and administering enacted laws and determining their constitutional legitimacy absent review concerning the wisdom or correctness of underlying public policy,” Nickell wrote. “As a result, the American legal tradition has long recognized that legislators and executive officers are ultimately accountable to the people while judges and justices are ultimately accountable to the law.”
Justices, particularly Goodwine, faced new pressure once they signaled the case would be heard again this year. Goodwine’s campaign for Supreme Court received support from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and his political action committee. She was elected in November 2024. 
In October, a Louisville attorney and GOP official, Jack Richardson, filed a petition with the clerk of the Kentucky House calling for Goodwine’s impeachment for not recusing herself from the case. According to a report from Louisville Public Media, Richardson said it was improper for Goodwine to rule on the case after an independent political action committee heavily funded by the Louisville teachers’ union backed ads to help elect her in 2024. 
A high ranking member of House GOP leadership and Louisville lawmaker, Majority Whip Rep. Jason Nemes, wrote an op-ed for the Louisville Courier Journal in August saying that the court’s ruling would “not only determine the future of Jefferson County’s schools but could also unravel critical local policies that benefit urban, suburban and rural communities.”
Last month, when Lambert appeared before a legislative committee to make budget requests of the General Assembly, Nemes emphasized how different JCPS is from other Kentucky school districts as it is the largest school district in the state. Nemes added that “anybody who would say that we must treat JCPS the same as we treat Robertson County, which has 3,000 people in the entire county, I don’t think is understanding the real world.” 
Goodwine and Conley were present at the meeting, seated in the crowd. 
Reacting to the Thursday decision, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement he was “stunned that our Supreme Court reversed itself based only a new justice joining the Court.”
“This decision is devastating for JCPS students and leaves them trapped in a failing system while sabotaging the General Assembly’s rescue mission,” Coleman added.

Osten praised Lamont for recommending $24.6 million in emergency aid to food banks and pantries over the next 18 months but said that won’t be sufficient to protect some of Connecticut’s vulnerable residents.
Ensuring no residents go hungry is a fundamental responsibility of society, Osten said.
“We have Connecticut residents who are not getting the assistance they need,” she added. “I’m not willing to not try to figure out a way to [help] people eat.”
State officials estimate about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans, and people experiencing homelessness are at risk of losing federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits because of new work requirements and other changes ordered by Congress and President Donald Trump.
The at-risk individuals represent about one-tenth of Connecticut’s entire SNAP population, and that larger group receives about $72 million per month in benefits.
Osten said she believes Connecticut easily could handle the cost of assisting the smaller, at-risk group. State budget surpluses have been huge, averaging more than $1.8 billion or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, since aggressive budget caps were imposed in 2017.
Connecticut operated a purely state-funded food stamp program from the late 1990s through 2018 to aid residents that Congress disqualified from federal assistance while reforming welfare in 1996.
And Osten isn’t alone in pushing for a return to state-funded nutrition assistance.
The United Way, New Haven Legal Assistance and 15 other nonprofits, labor and business organizations and policy groups wrote Lamont and legislative leaders on Dec. 8, asking them to create such a program.
But Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, has traditionally been wary of using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
When asked Thursday about the prospect of ongoing state spending on food stamps, Lamont said, “I think we have a better alternative [with] what we’re doing in terms of the food banks and Foodshare.”
The governor said these pantries “will be able to notice folks who maybe are losing their SNAP benefits, show them where you can get the, you know, food on a ready basis.”
To further control costs, Osten said her proposal would include expanding job-coaching services to help as many at-risk residents as possible find work.
But some of at-risk group involves people with mental illness or severe autism, and many businesses won’t employ these residents, she said.
Osten added she believes it shouldn’t take the Lamont administration that long to create a new state-funded nutrition benefit to replace federal SNAP assistance.
Leaders of Connecticut’s food assistance nonprofits — while praising Lamont for earmarking emergency funding for their network — say it only can replace a fraction of the assistance households cut off from SNAP benefits have lost.
“We’re intended to be a supplement,” said Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of Foodshare. “There is not enough food at our food bank, or every food bank in the country put together, to make up for the number of meals that SNAP provides.”
And Sara Parker McKernan, a policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance, said food pantries are best suited to handle short-term food emergencies in households.
“If you go into a food pantry, you’re going to have a limited amount and a limited selection of what you can get,” she said. “To make that even harder, not everybody has access to food pantries because they’re open at odd times. People have to work. They have to pick up their kids. They might not have transportation.”
For example, Eastford, a small, rural community in Windham County, operates a food pantry out of the Town Office Building, but it’s open only from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. — and only on the first Monday of each month, according to the town’s website.
“It can be very difficult to get to a food pantry to pick up things,” McKernan added. “Having your own ability to pay for food, which you get when you have food stamps — that autonomy is key for people. We need to have a state-funded food assistance program so people can make those choices for themselves.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0523_SR_OstenWalker_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 13:58:06.655119

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Violet White’s experience in the Arkansas Department of Corrections taught her what helps — and what doesn’t help — formerly incarcerated people try to get their lives back on track.
At one point in her 17 years as an agency employee, White worked on a grant-funded program to help people acclimate to life outside prison. Having only about 30 cases meant she could spend enough time with people to get to know their wants and needs, which helps prevent them from reoffending, she said.

Third in a series on Arkansas’ crowded prisons

“You know their mom. You know their brother. You know where they live, where they work. You know all these things, and you can actually use your tools and the things that you have to try to help them do better,” said White, who left the corrections department in 2024. “But when you have 200 people, or even 150 people, which is not abnormal … you get 10 to 15 minutes with them to come in [and say], ‘Hey, how are you doing? Are you still working? Where are you living? Alright, see you in a month.’”
High caseloads are just one part of Arkansas’ uphill battle against recidivism, according to White, state officials and the findings of a legislative task force. The DOC applies the term recidivism to inmates who violate the terms of their release or are convicted of new crimes within three years of leaving prison.
It contributes to Arkansas’ rising prison population. 
As of December, roughly 72,000 formerly incarcerated people were on parole, probation or another form of supervision, meaning about 71% of the 93,000 Arkansans under the Department of Corrections’ control were out of prison, spokesperson Rand Champion said.
That represents an increase in the number of incarcerated Arkansans and a decrease in the number under supervision in nearly a year and a half. The final report from the Legislative Recidivism Reduction Task Force presented to lawmakers a year ago said that 90,700 Arkansans were under correctional control as of July 2024, of whom more than 75% were out of prison. The task force was created by the Protect Arkansas Act of 2023 and disbanded after its final report.
Furthermore, almost half of closed supervision cases from 2014 to 2023 involved revoking former inmates’ parole and returning them to prison, or giving them new sentences, the report states.

What is the Protect Arkansas Act?

 

A significant contributor to recidivism is “inconsistent adherence to evidence-based practices for programming provided both in house and by community partners,” according to the report. Examples of programming for current and former inmates include job training, mental health care and substance use disorder counseling.
The Department of Corrections has not consistently monitored whether its programming for current and former inmates is effective, White said.
“We really never did any research to see if [programs] worked for our population, and that’s just not good business practice,” she said.
White worked as a parole officer in Pulaski County for several years. Her final job before leaving the corrections department in 2024 was in probation management.
The department adopted the Ohio Risk Assessment System in 2011 but stopped using it in 2014, White and Champion both said. ORAS evaluates the likelihood of reoffending and what people need to help prevent it.
ORAS is widely accepted as an effective correctional tool. White said the information it yields is detailed and valuable, especially since the department’s previous assessment was “very basic,” but the department “just didn’t have the staff” for a program that “takes a good hour to an hour and 45 minutes” per inmate.
The Arkansas Board of Corrections approved a contract with the University of Cincinnati Corrections Institute to resume using ORAS in 2024. The recidivism task force report says ORAS “cannot achieve its intended impact” in Arkansas without “more officer training and resources.”
“Many officers know best practices and wish to implement them but are hindered by short office visits and lack of cognitive tools,” the report states.

 Caseloads and staff turnover

The Department of Corrections has 426 supervision officers with active caseloads, Champion said on Dec. 3.
That’s a decrease of 31 officers in only a month, since a quarterly report from the department released Nov. 3 stated there were 457 filled caseworker positions.
Asked about the average number of cases each officer handles, Champion said it “varies depending on a variety of factors.”
Department officials told lawmakers in 2024 that the average caseload per officer was about 100 and that the ideal caseload would be 50-80, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
The demands on supervision officers have been a concern for state Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, who has sponsored multiple laws aimed at reducing recidivism over his years in the Legislature. He shared a similar perspective to White in an August interview, saying that officers’ caseloads “are completely untenable” and too heavy for them to “provide meaningful supervision.”

The corrections department has also seen high levels of staff turnover. White said having to rebuild from scratch inmates’ relationships with correctional officers hinders the department’s efforts to meet offenders’ needs and help them avoid reoffending.
“[For] some offenders that really want to do well, it just creates instability for them,” White said. “And [for] offenders that don’t want to do well, it creates an opportunity for them to manipulate.”
A new state employee pay plan, effective as of this summer, gave five-figure raises to the starting and average salaries for several hard-to-fill jobs, including corrections officers. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other state officials have said they hope the pay plan will increase recruitment and retention in those positions.
Besides caseworker continuity, another major need for both inmates and people under supervision is more effective mental health care and substance use disorder treatment, White said.
The Legislative Recidivism Reduction Task Force’s 2024 report said there is a “higher probability of recidivism for people with behavioral health referrals.”
“Individuals successfully released from supervision were less likely to have received substance use or mental health referrals than those who received a revocation or a new sentence,” according to the report.
The ideal post-incarceration outcome is for people to get steady jobs, be able to support themselves, take mental health medication if necessary and remain sober from substances if necessary, White said.
Those goals become a “hard sell” for people with untreated mental and behavioral health needs and if employment is hard to come by, White said. She also said former inmates would be less likely to reoffend if they were paid living wages at their post-incarceration jobs.
“It’s really hard to convince [people] to go flip burgers for $10 an hour when they can go sling dope on a corner and make a couple thousand,” White said.

 New policies

Sanders signed three new laws this year spawned from the recidivism task force’s recommendations. All three laws received bipartisan support from lawmakers and went into effect in August.
The identical Act 769 and Act 694 require a “validated risk and needs assessment,” or a standardized evaluation process that quantifies an inmate’s risk of recidivism, for each inmate brought into state custody.
It also requires assigning inmates to “a program or meaningful activity that corresponds with the inmate’s risk of recidivism in accordance with the inmate’s needs such that the higher the inmate’s risk of recidivism, the more programs or meaningful activities the inmate will be assigned.”
A study of the corrections department’s “social and organizational climate,” released in October, stated that inmates “want to use their time in prison productively to focus on personal growth” but “feel stuck and need access to positive programming and reentry programming that will enhance their chances of being approved for parole.”
White agreed, saying recent programming for inmates lacks variety and capacity.
“Prison’s the perfect opportunity for that because they’re a captive audience,” she said. “Once they hit the streets, they’ve got a lot of distractions.”










Many officers know best practices and wish to implement them but are hindered by short office visits and lack of cognitive tools.


– Legislative Recidivism Reduction Task Force final report, December 2024


Act 670, sponsored by Tucker, requires inmates’ post-release reentry plans to continue the constructive activities assigned while incarcerated, “including without limitation continued employment and continued participation in mental health treatment or substance abuse treatment, or both.” The law also requires the creation of an oversight body for evidence-based correctional practices.
The Department of Corrections “was already implementing many of those aspects and had a team in place to prioritize programming aimed at reducing recidivism” before Act 670 became law, Champion said.
“This Act codified much of the work that was already being done by existing staff since 2021,” he said, adding that the department’s existing Quality Improvement and Program Evaluation team fulfills the oversight body requirement.
Another requirement in Act 670 is for corrections officials to find ways to maximize the use of “nontraditional correctional facilities.”
The state has six residential community corrections centers, and Champion said the department has been working to “streamline intake” at those facilities.
As of last year, community corrections centers “are already implementing many evidence-based practices and seeing good results, but the potential to have a greater impact is hindered by capacity limitations,” according to the task force report.
Arkansas governor’s recidivism reduction program to launch at Little Rock facility

Limited capacity for state facilities to house inmates is one reason Sanders has proposed building a new 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County. The plan has met pushback from nearby residents and state lawmakers.
In August, the Board of Corrections unanimously approved a request from Sanders to reallocate 100 beds at the Central Arkansas Community Corrections Center in Little Rock for a recidivism reduction pilot program.
The program helps inmates within six months of release find stable housing, work and opportunities for community integration and engagement, Sanders’ chief legal adviser, Cortney Kennedy, told the board. The program will also involve community and faith organizations and the private sector.

(AP Photo/Vasha Hunt)
On Saturday afternoon, Ole Miss will become the first Mississippi team – ever – to compete in the NCAA FBS College Football Playoffs. 
We’ve got the Rebels vs. the Tulane Green Wave, 2:30 p.m., at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. I’s time to put aside all the game’s peripheral aspects, of which there are so many. It’s time, finally, to forget Lane Kiffin and his messy exit from Oxford. It’s time to put aside the transfer portal – who’s staying and who’s leaving – at least until the new year. It’s time to stop talking about the movement of assistant coaches, too. It’s time, as coaches say, to spot the football.
Rick Cleveland
It’s time to see which team, Tulane or Ole Miss, will advance to play Georgia in the Sugar Bowl.
Ole Miss, which comes in with an 11-1 record, is a 17-point favorite to win handily over Tulane, the American Athletic Conference champion that comes in at 11-2.
That point spread, it would seem, is based primarily on the fact that, when the same two teams played on the same field 12 weeks ago, Ole Miss smashed Tulane 45-10. That game was every bit as one-sided as the score would indicate. The Sept. 20 game wasn’t a case of Ole Miss capitalizing on Tulane turnovers or making several big plays in the kicking game. It was no fluke. The turnovers were even. Tulane threw an interception; Ole Miss lost a fumble. The Rebels nearly doubled the Green Wave in yardage. Indeed, Ole Miss punted only once. The Rebels won nearly all the big downs. Tulane converted just six of 15 third downs and zero of three fourth downs. 
“We played rotten, they played good,” Tulane coach Jon Sumrall said earlier in the week. “They are clearly a big-time team, but I want us to play like a better version of ourselves. I think we’re a better team, but we gotta go prove it.”
There were some extenuating circumstances the average fan probably did not realize at the time. For one, Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff, a transfer from Brigham Young University, was making only his fourth start after arriving at Tulane in July. For whatever reason – and the Ole Miss defense was a big part of it – Retzlaff played the worst game he would play all season. The numbers were ugly: He completed only five of 17 passes for 56 yards. He did run eight times for 51 yards, but that was more rushing yardage than any of his running backs.
One reason for that is that redshirt freshman running back Jamauri McClure carried the ball only three times for Green Wave in that earlier game. Since then, he has emerged as Tulane’s best back. He ran for 94 yards on just 10 carries against Florida on Nov. 15, for 122 yards on 17 carries against Temple on Nov. 22 and for 121 yards on 22 carries against North Texas in the AAC championship game on Dec. 5. McClure averaged nearly seven yards per carry.
No doubt, his emergence has greatly enhanced Retzlaff’s play, which has been remarkably better than what he showed back on Sept. 20. Retzlaff has thrown for 2,862 yards and 14 touchdowns (vs. six interceptions). Perhaps more impressively, he has run for 610 yards and and 16 touchdowns. He really is a dual threat.
An even bigger reason for Tulane’s offensive woes in the earlier meeting was a key injury in the offensive line. Left tackle Derrick Graham, a fifth-year senior and a transfer from Texas A&M, did not play against Ole Miss because of an ankle injury. That caused a wholesale shuffling of the offensive line with guard Shadre Hurst moving out to tackle, and a back-up guard moving into the lineup. Any coach at any level of football can tell you how disruptive an injury to a key offensive lineman can be. It changes what you can do on offense. Against Ole Miss, Tulane could not do much of anything.
Pete Golding summed it up this way: “This is not Week 4 Tulane,” he said. “They are playing at a much higher level.”
High enough to make up for a five-touchdown deficit in the earlier game?
“We’re playing a conference champion that beat the ACC champion,” Golding said.
Still, if Ole Miss is focused and ready to play – despite all the peripheral distractions – the Rebels are surely the more talented team. But keep in mind, every week in college football, 17-point underdogs – and even higher – win football games. 
So, spot the ball. Here we go…",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/18112514/AP25264563850563.jpg,,,2025-12-18 12:57:49.530440
,DC,2025-12-18 17:47:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judges hear case on requiring immigrants without legal status to register and carry documents,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judges-hear-case-requiring-immigrants-without-legal-status-register-and-carry-documents,,"WASHINGTON — A panel of appellate judges seemed skeptical during Thursday oral arguments that the Trump administration erred in relying on a decades-old statute to require millions of noncitizens to register with the federal government and carry documentation.But they did take issue with the paperwork required of immigrants without legal status as well as the consequences for those who fail to register, and questioned if the practice violated due process and self-incrimination rights.In February, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the agency would enforce a rule under the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires all immigrants in the country without legal status to register with the agency or risk fines or potential jail time.  A federal court in April sided with the Trump administration, allowing the registration requirement to go through.The suit, brought by immigration rights advocates, does not challenge the statute from 1940 requiring those without legal status to register, but instead the process used by DHS in rolling out the policy without a proper notice and comment period. The suit also challenges a penalty for not filling out paperwork, as the form is only in English and can only be accessed with an internet connection.Administration positionArguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Kartik N. Venguswamy from the U.S. Attorney's Office said a notice and comment period is not needed because the form is just procedural and a new rule is not created. He added that the rule does not cause irreparable harm, because any harm is from outside forces, such as immigration enforcement or deportation that could follow registration with the federal government.  Judges Patricia A. Millett, Gregory G. Katsas and J. Michelle Childs heard the case in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Former President Barack Obama nominated Millett; President Donald Trump nominated Katsas in his first term; and former President Joe Biden nominated Childs.The judges raised concerns with the form itself, including one question that requires the noncitizen to report any crimes they have committed, regardless of whether they were charged or convicted. That wades into violation of the 5th Amendment’s protections against self incrimination, one judge said.“That's asking you to confess to things that no government authority is aware of,” Millett said of the final rule. “And it’s a big step toward the 5th Amendment.”The Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan immigration think tank, estimated that between 2.2 million and 3.2 million immigrants will have to register. The registration requirement could be a powerful tool in the Trump administration’s efforts to carry out mass deportations.Rule has gone unenforcedMichelle Lapointe, arguing on behalf of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, said the federal government has not enforced the rule for nearly 80 years. The registration requirement is authorized under a wartime act known as the Alien Registration Act of 1940 that was first used in World War II. It was rarely used after that, but briefly in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. During that time, any noncitizen males older than 16 who hailed from 25 countries with a Muslim majority had to register with the federal government. But the program led to no terrorism convictions and was eventually dissolved in 2016.Lapointe said because the rule would apply to as many as 3 million immigrants without legal status, a notice and comment period must occur. Under the rule, immigrants 14 and older who are required to register will need to carry registration documents at all times or risk potential prison terms or fines of up to $5,000.“It is solely for the process of deportation,” Lapointe said.As the Trump administration continues with its immigration crackdown, federal immigration officials could carry out their plans for mass deportations by having easy access to records of immigrants unlawfully in the country.But Childs seemed skeptical that the federal government couldn't use the statute, because it’s on the books.Katsas also said the rule is not new — the government has just decided not to enforce it since 1940.“It seems like a more fair account” that the government is ending a long policy of not enforcing a rule that, on its face, “covers all aliens,” he said.But Katsas said the “rule does expand the category of information and that’s new.”That category of information includes the requirement to detail to the federal government any crime the individual has committed, which Lapointe argued would violate 5th Amendment rights. Registration form debatedChilds and Millett questioned the roll-out of the form, the fact that it’s only accessible online and in English, and the penalty for not registering with the federal government.“These are forms regulating a community … where English is not their native language,” Millett said. Venguswamy said the forms were in English because “English is the language of the United States government at this point.” Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to adopt English as the official language, including paperwork.  Millett asked Venguswamy if it’s the government’s position that an immigrant who doesn’t understand English will not be charged or issued a penalty for failing to register. “I'm not in a position to speak to whether or not that is the position the government will take,” Venguswamy said. Millett then asked why a proper notice and comment period is not needed for a new process, even if it’s not creating a new statute. She gave Venguswamy an example of the IRS not changing the tax code, but issuing a new tax form for taxpayers to fill out.“We're gonna issue new tax forms, for everyone to fill out their taxes, we’re not creating tax obligations, just new forms in Ancient Biblical Greek,” Millett said. She asked Venguswamy if a proper notice and comment period would be needed for those new tax forms.He said it would not, because it's a change in procedure, not a change to the rule.“Wow,” Millett said. “We can all be criminally prosecuted for not filling out our taxes unless we can find the five people in the United States who know how to speak Ancient Biblical Greek.”",,,,2025-12-18 12:57:49.530440

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In late June, when the New Hampshire Legislature passed its two-year budget, it imposed a roughly $51 million cut to the Department of Health and Human Services. This week, the department told the Executive Council it would reduce several of its contracts by millions of dollars.
The “back-of-the-budget cut” mandated by the Legislature gave officials within the department the latitude to decide where operational cuts would be made.
On Wednesday, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver received approval from the Executive Council to move forward with shrinking seven contracts in the first round of cuts.

The department is reducing its contract with NFI North in Contoocook, which provides mental health services to New Hampshire residents with serious or persistent mental illness, by $1 million from roughly $20.9 million to $19.9 million. NFI North will eliminate one personal care assistant, one licensed nursing aide, and two registered nurses from its staff as part of this contract amendment.
The department is also reducing its contract with Community Action Partnership of Strafford County, Granite VNA in Conway and Laconia, the Family Resource Center in Gorham, Waypoint in Manchester, TLC Family Resource Center in Claremont, and VNA at HCS in Keene by $2 million, collectively. The organizations provide home visits from nurses to pregnant women and families with young children that may be at risk for domestic abuse or other harms.
Relatedly, the department is cutting its contracts with Waypoint in Manchester and the Family Resource Center in Gorham by a combined $575,000. The contracts are meant to support programs attempting to intervene and assist families at risk of state intervention (via the Division for Children, Youth, and Families, New Hampshire’s child protective services agency) to prevent that outcome.
It also cut its contract with the University of New Hampshire to provide training for DCYF employees by $575,000.
It is also reducing its contract with Tri-County Community Action Program, which runs a cold-weather homeless shelter in Berlin using state funds, by $100,000. Health and Human Services reported that the organization plans to deal with this cut by centralizing its cold-weather shelter into its other emergency shelter and having one employee manage them both.
It also cut $80,000 from Granite Pathways’ Strength to Succeed program, a substance use disorder program in Manchester.
Finally, the department has also reduced the number of services it’s purchasing from the Tilton-based dentist who treats residents at the Sununu Youth Services Center, a juvenile detention facility in Manchester, by $24,000 over the months since the cut was implemented.

The first round of cuts add up to roughly $4.3 million. Several more rounds will be necessary for the department to meet its mandate of $51 million.
Weaver told councilors all of the contracts were underutilized. She said the state had used fewer services than were included in the contracts and that the reductions placed the department in line with the number of services the vendors actually provided. She said no families would lose services.
“We’ll still continue to serve families,” Weaver said during the meeting. “We just can’t expand beyond and keep going. We’re going to have a limit with how far we can go, but no existing family would be getting any cuts.”
Weaver declined to elaborate immediately after the meeting and did not respond to emailed questions.
“I certainly appreciate the difficult circumstances that you are in of having to make major cuts to programs and that you’re doing it in a very mindful and thoughtful way to mitigate as much harm as possible,” Executive Councilor Karen Liot Hill, the council’s sole Democrat, said during the meeting. “But at some point, people are going to be harmed by these budget cuts.”
Gov. Kelly Ayotte, however, refuted that, pointing to Weaver’s testimony: “I think I just heard that no family is going to be harmed here or not served.”
Left-leaning advocacy groups in New Hampshire were quick to condemn the cuts.
“Instead of lowering costs, New Hampshire conservatives want to take dental care away from kids and let people in Grafton and Coos Counties freeze to death,” Lucas Meyer, founder of Our Economy Our Future, said in a statement arguing the cuts were meant to create space in the budget for recent tax cuts. “Instead of representing working families, they’re prioritizing tax cuts to a handful of out-of-state corporate CEOs who back their campaigns, rig the economy, and drive up property taxes for the rest of us.”
Christina Warriner Hamilton, New Hampshire state director for Reproductive Equity Now, said in a statement that the cuts “would be devastating for New Hampshire families” and “undo bipartisan progress and deny families the care they deserve.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/weaverexeccoun-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 12:57:49.530440

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Ours is a nation of small kindnesses and large cruelties. 
The United States is home to more than 340 million people, each with an emotional design that is fully unique and infinitely complex, to dizzying effect. Someone could find it easy to dehumanize strangers yet bestow unconditional love on friends and family. They might unleash sweeping hatred online yet hold the door for the person behind them in town. They could one day rail against assistance programs and the next feel compelled to help a neighbor shovel their driveway. 
Every moment in every life is an exercise in contradiction, all because we have only the vaguest sense of the active ingredients of our own recipe, never mind that of the society we inhabit. We are creatures of memory and perception, a Frankenstein’s monster of scar tissue and wounds that won’t heal, who may strive toward altruism but remain earthly chained by desires defined, mostly, by experience. 
Community has long been a defense against pure self interest, but the walls are crumbling.
Individual disconnection enables large cruelties — and this country is more disconnected than it is divided. In such a place, there is nothing small about small kindnesses. Each is an act of rebellion against the prevailing cold. Not every rebel is a saint, but there has never been a saint who wasn’t first a rebel.
There are countless state and national policies in action whose feasibility relies on widespread public disconnection. The brutal immigrant detention and deportation program is the most obvious, where migrants are narratively stripped of their humanity so politicians can sell clear barbarism as statecraft. Anti-transgender legislation functions in the same way. Too much would be revealed if a lawmaker cited “a hatred born of disconnection” as the reason to persecute transgender people through statute, so the politicians instead construct an illusory identity as a protector of girls and women. 
These are the lazy lies people embrace to absolve themselves of culpability in large cruelties, and it is a political epidemic. Even community issues that should be resistant to polarization, like the clear public good of public education, are susceptible to the politics of disconnection. 
I don’t have any issues at all with the parents of the roughly 10,500 New Hampshire students now benefitting from the state’s education freedom accounts program. If a voucher means the difference between struggling and thriving for even one family, I’m grateful EFAs exist. Less suffering is always better.
My contradiction is this: The architecture of the program seems to be bad for New Hampshire in every other way.
In a draft report issued this week by the Republican-majority Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee, after a year of not meeting, the authors said: “After five years of growth and success, it is obvious that opponents of school choice will never accept the value of giving New Hampshire parents discretion to use state education funds in the manner they believe would best benefit their children.”
But it’s the disconnection at the heart of the voucher program that I can’t accept.
First, while many of the families currently benefiting from EFAs may now be content, that’s not the case for most of the politicians championing the program. I’m not sure what a fully built-out voucher system is supposed to look like, but I imagine something of a splintering of public education followed by major corporate consolidation of the fragments. And that’s really easy to imagine, too, because it’s what always happens. It’s also a big part of why, as The Guardian reported last week, we live in a world where “fewer than 60,000 people — 0.001% of the world’s population — control three times as much wealth as the entire bottom half of humanity.” This movie plays on a loop.
Second, the EFA program does nothing (despite EFA supporters’ fantastical math) to address the fundamental problem — overreliance on local property taxes to pay for public education.
Third, the very existence of the voucher program means New Hampshire no longer views public education as a core public responsibility. If you tell families the money paid into an education fund for all kids actually belongs to them, how does that strengthen the bonds of community? How does the EFA program build on the idea of a shared responsibility, whether you have school-age children or not, to educate the next generation? Well, it doesn’t. It just promotes self interest and furthers disconnection.
Perhaps worst of all, voucher proponents often employ the same tactics that are used to sway public opinion against immigrants and transgender people. It’s not enough to advocate for what they call school choice, they must simultaneously trash public schools and the people who work in them as if they were an outside threat. As if the schools weren’t built by us, for us. 
What young person coming of age in this environment would choose to become a teacher amid the harassment whipped up by lawmakers who are incapable of looking beyond their immediate desire to dismantle public education? That is how shortsighted spin creates lasting harm.
I don’t expect an end any time soon to large cruelties or the politics of disconnection that enable them. Nothing is easier for a politician than pitting “us” against “other,” and ease alone explains the prevalence of the technique.
The American people can, however, become more alert to the many ways policy contributes to disconnection, in all its forms, while at the same time committing fully to the reign of small kindnesses.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana State Ethics Commission on Thursday approved a settlement requiring former Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green to pay a $10,000 civil fine, closing the ethics case against her — but potential criminal charges remain under review by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office.
The bipartisan, five-member commission voted unanimously to accept the agreement during its public meeting, adopting findings that Green violated Indiana’s political activity and misuse of state property rules. 
Approval of the settlement ends the ethics commission’s jurisdiction over the case.

But officials confirmed during Thursday’s meeting that the Indiana Office of Inspector General has already referred the matter for criminal review, and that process remains ongoing.
Elaine Vullmahn, chief counsel for enforcement at the inspector general’s office, pointed commissioners to a section within Indiana Code that mandates the OIG to forward evidence of potential criminal activity to the appropriate prosecuting attorney.
Findings in Green’s case were sent to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office for grand jury screening on Oct. 30.
Vullmahn said the referral included investigative records concerning potential violations of Indiana’s statutes related to ghost employment, retaliation and official misconduct, adding that the prosecutor’s office “will be reviewing the investigative materials and render a decision at the conclusion of their review.”
It remains unclear if or when Green — who is also an Indiana congressional candidate — could face criminal charges, however. The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office did not immediately respond to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment Thursday.
Green’s attorney, Jennifer Lukemeyer, declined to comment on possible criminal charges but said after the meeting that the commission’s decision “is a total victory for Jennifer-Ruth Green.”
Green’s congressional campaign echoed that characterization in a lengthy statement released after the meeting, calling the settlement a “major legal victory” and sharply criticizing the OIG.
The Committee to Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green said the inspector general “attempted to throw the kitchen sink at her based on a politically motivated sham of an investigation,” and alleged the office “completely caved for a settlement to save face with the ethics commission.”
Details from the ethics settlement
Green admitted in the settlement that she violated Indiana’s political activity rule when she had state employees generate content and proofread posts for her “Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green” Facebook account.
She also admitted to violating the misuse of state property rule by using — and directing a state employee to use — her assigned state vehicle, a 2024 Chevrolet Suburban, for personal tasks.

With approval of the agreement, Green waived her right to a public hearing.
The former state official is required to pay the $10,000 fine within 60 days of the commission’s approval. But the settlement explicitly bars the commission from imposing any additional sanctions.
Under the state ethics law, commissioners could have imposed a higher penalty, like more serious fines or a ban on future state employment.
Vullmahn told commissioners that state law allows fines of up to three times the benefit received for ethics violations. Investigators calculated that state employees spent time worth about $1,300 creating and posting political content for Green, and that she logged roughly 7,000 personal miles on her state-issued vehicle — a combined benefit of about $5,000.
“The $10,000 fine represents approximately two times the total personal benefit received,” Vullmahn said, calling it “a fair, appropriate and proportionate response.”
One commissioner asked whether the inspector general considered barring Green from future state employment as part of the settlement.
Vullmahn said that option was considered but deemed unlikely to be relevant, given that Green had been an appointed official and that “any basic background check would find this information.”
Green absent from ethics meeting
Green abruptly resigned from her cabinet post in early September, but the inspector general had been investigating her conduct months earlier, including concerns about her use of state employees and state property for political and personal purposes.
A remediation agreement signed earlier in the summer — and later obtained by the Capital Chronicle — showed state officials had attempted to address those concerns internally before Green ultimately stepped down.
The document outlined allegations that Green directed state employees to draft and edit political content during work hours; used a state-issued vehicle for personal and political travel; and held campaign-related meetings in state facilities.
It also raised concerns about possible retaliation against employees who cooperated with the inspector general’s investigation, warning that substantiated violations could result in further discipline, including termination.
Story continues below.
JRG Settlement
 
The remediation agreement warned that if additional violations were substantiated, Green could face further discipline, including termination.
The inspector general filed a formal ethics complaint after Green’s resignation and originally alleged additional violations, including retaliation against an individual who provided information to investigators. Under the settlement, though, Green admitted to only two of the four alleged ethics violations.
Vullmahn cited aggravating factors considered by the OIG, including Green’s senior leadership role, the pattern and duration of her misconduct and the impact on public trust.
“As secretary of public safety … Green held one of the highest leadership roles in state government,” she said. “These positions carried significant responsibility overseeing the agencies tasked with law enforcement, emergency response and safety policy for Indiana families.”
Vullmahn said the inspector general weighed mitigating factors, too, including Green’s cooperation with investigators, acceptance of responsibility and her voluntary resignation.
Green was not present at Thursday’s meeting, but Lukemeyer, her attorney, told commissioners that further review of evidence revealed “evidentiary challenges” to portions of the original complaint and said the settlement reflected that reassessment.
Green also submitted a personal statement to the commission, which Lukemeyer read aloud.
“As a leader, I know that I am responsible for what happens within the domain over which I led,” Green’s statement said. “The violations of the ethics code are aberrant behavior for me. The violations were mistakes … not made with any malicious intent or for gain.”










The violations were mistakes … not made with any malicious intent or for gain.


– Former Indiana Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green


In its post-meeting statement, Green’s campaign said her legal team presented “affidavits, recordings, text messages, emails, and phone records” that it said undermined the inspector general’s allegations and prompted the move to settle.
The campaign described the admitted violations as “minor” and said Green’s use of her personal Facebook page and the state vehicle had been “explicitly approved” by her government attorney. Green’s campaign said the OIG “never bothered” to interview that attorney “during its sham investigation.”
The statement further accused the inspector general of attempting to “smear” Green — portraying her as “immoral,” “deviant,” and as a criminal — and framed the investigation as politically motivated.
“Jennifer-Ruth accepted this settlement and responsibility for minor violations because she has integrity, and she recognized that justice and fairness were unlikely in an environment where pursuing full vindication would require a prolonged legal battle costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, against vindictive actors wielding unlimited taxpayer-funded resources to attack her reputation, character, and career,” the statement said. “She walks away with her integrity fully intact and immense pride in the work she performed across Indiana alongside dedicated public servants.”
“The people of Indiana now face a clear choice: believe a decorated combat veteran who has devoted her life to service or believe political hacks and faceless bureaucrats motivated by petty grievances and personal career advancement,” the statement continued. “This episode should serve as a warning to every Hoosier. If powerful government actors are willing to weaponize the state of Indiana against Jennifer-Ruth Green — just as the federal government was weaponized against President Trump — they are more than capable of doing the same if they seek to destroy you.”
Green’s resignation marked the first departure of a cabinet-level official in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration.
Following her appointment in January, Green’s responsibilities included oversight of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Correction, the Criminal Justice Institute and the Parole Board.
Despite the pending ethics charges, Green announced in October that she will run again for Indiana’s 1st Congressional District. She first challenged Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan in 2022 but was defeated.

After Beacon, a chain of hospitals based out of northern Indiana, bought four Ascension Borgess hospitals in southwest Michigan in July, nurses at Beacon Kalamazoo hospital say that the new health insurance offered to them is not meeting their needs. 
“Beacon has really let us down with the ability to care for ourselves as nurses,” said Lori Batzloff, the president of the local nurses union. 
There are three major issues at hand, Batzloff explained — an end to Medigap insurance reimbursements for retired nurses, an end to short-term disability insurance and limited in-network health care providers in the Kalamazoo area. 
Medigap insurance is private health care that Medicare recipients can buy to supplement the gaps in that Medicare insurance — and up until August, the cost of that supplemental insurance was covered by Ascension for retired nurses. 
Linn Crutcher is one of those nurses, having worked at Ascension Borgess for 38 years until she retired in 2016. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When she received a letter in August saying that Ascension was ending its Medigap coverage, she assumed that Beacon was assuming that responsibility — until a few weeks ago, when she received a message from a colleague that Beacon would not be reimbursing for Medigap. 
“It was just a punch in the gut that I was not expecting at all,” she said. 
Without that reimbursement, and as the premiums for her Medigap insurance itself are increasing, Crutcher will have to pay around $2,700 annually out of pocket to have adequate health care.
“That will be a liability for me, and that, by coincidence, is almost exactly what I receive in a social security check, every month,” she said. “So in reality, I will be missing one social security check every year. One entire social security check will go to pay for my Medigap insurance. That’s not manageable for me.”
Heidi Prescott, a spokesperson for Beacon Health System, wrote in a statement that Beacon did not assume Medigap reimbursement benefits as a part of the acquisition of the hospital. 
“Former Ascension associates who previously received Medigap reimbursement benefits have been directed to contact Ascension,” Beacon’s statement read. “Under the terms of the agreement executed at closing in July 2025, all obligations related to Medigap remained with Ascension.”
Ascension did not respond to requests for comment. 
Beacon added, “We recognize and appreciate the decades of service provided by our retired nurses, understand the concerns raised in recent reports and acknowledge that after an acquisition, benefit transitions can be difficult to navigate.”
But Crutcher is not convinced. 
“Corporations are treating nurses as a liability. We’re an expense to them,” she said. “Of course, they couldn’t survive without us.”
The issues with health care under Beacon are not limited to retired nurses, Batzloff said. 
Losing short-term disability insurance, she said, would cost her over $200 per month if she were to pay for it herself.
And beyond the loss of short-term disability insurance, “the actual health care coverage itself is woefully inadequate, especially among dental providers,” she said. 
Emily Fredericksen, who has worked as a nurse at the hospital for 27 years, explained that for her whole family, limited coverage had been a repeated issue, but especially for her 20 year-old son. He has gone through serious bouts of mental health issues, but has a long-standing history with his current therapist and has improved significantly. 
But that therapist does not participate in the new insurance under Beacon. “We’ve been paying out of pocket, which is to the tune of about $200 for a visit,” Fredericksen said. 
And when he needed an emergency root canal in August, Fredericksen had to pay $600 just to get in the door at an endodontist, because the only in-network provider in the area had limited hours.
“This was something I expressed, being very frustrated with Beacon’s HR, because she argued with me and said that this was restorative care,” she said. “I am a former critical care nurse, and I know how bad dental infections can go very quickly.”
“While I am lucky enough to work part time in my role, and I’m married and I have another income that comes in, not everybody can afford $600 out of pocket to be seen,” she continued. “And what happens then is people don’t go to the doctor, and then things get bad.”
Batzloff said that she believes the root of the problem is that the new health insurance provider — part of the Aetna network — is based out of Indiana, which is also Beacon’s home. 
“So they think this is a great plan, and it probably is, if you live in that area and you have multiple in-network providers to choose from,” she said. “The problem is Beacon bought facilities far north of Indiana, here in Kalamazoo County and the surrounding areas.”
Batzloff added that nurses in the union reached out to Beacon to discuss changing health care coverage prior to the sale, but that the hospital failed to meet with them. 
“We’re getting to the final straw. To be honest, we feel we’ve been very patient. We repeatedly asked for discussions prior to the purchase of the hospital last July,” she said. “And I feel like Beacon could have gotten in front of this before it became this big mess.”
“I hope that they’re listening,” Fredericksen said. “I hope that they understand the hardships of not giving quality health care to your employees that are in the health care industry.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2385-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-18 12:57:49.530440

Spanberger’s Affordable Virginia Agenda, announced one day after outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin introduced his final biennial budget proposal to the General Assembly, outlines a suite of legislative proposals aimed at reducing consumer costs across three major categories: health care, energy and housing.

The plan comes against a backdrop of rising living expenses that many voters cited as their top concern during the 2025 elections, when Democrats swept all statewide races and increased their majority in the House of Delegates by 13 seats.
“Today, I am proud to unveil the beginning, the first step of these efforts, our agenda, to build a more affordable Virginia,” Spanberger said at a news conference in the state Capitol. “We cannot accept the status quo when it comes to the high cost of living. It is hurting the financial security of our economy, our communities, and our neighbors.” 
Spanberger — the first woman to be elected governor in Virginia — rallied Democratic leaders behind her push but emphasized her willingness to work with Republicans where possible. 
She said affordability is not merely a household concern but “essential” to Virginia’s economic competitiveness, a message she says resonated with voters from the Eastern Shore to Southwest Virginia.
 Health care: scrubbing costs, curbing middlemen

At the heart of Spanberger’s agenda is a multifaceted health care package designed to tackle out-of-pocket costs and limit insurance practices she says have siphoned money from patients and providers. Much of her plan echoes the health care priorities she outlined on the campaign trail earlier this year.

A centerpiece of the plan would restrict the role of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which Spanberger’s plan describes as predatory middlemen that can inflate drug prices. A bill that created a sole PBM for the state’s Medicaid program was signed into law by Youngkin in May, setting the stage for further reforms in the coming legislative session. 
The proposed 2026 bill would prevent PBMs from steering patients to affiliated pharmacies, require that drug rebates be passed through to health plans or patients, ban misleading statements, prohibit retroactive payment clawbacks and establish reimbursement standards for independent and community pharmacies.
“No Virginian should have to choose between paying their healthcare and putting food on the table,” Spanberger said, emphasizing the need to hold PBMs accountable for driving up drug costs.

Another proposal would limit prior authorization requirements, which often require insurer approval before patients receive medications or treatments. Spanberger argued that excessive prior authorizations delay care, can lead to complications and ultimately raise costs for patients and the system alike.
House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, said Spanberger’s health care proposals address real problems that families hear about every day.
“We need common sense answers to real issues of affordability that these families hear in the commonwealth,” Herring said. She cited lowering prescription drug costs, reforming prior authorization processes and expanding access to health care as critical steps forward. “It’s a brand new day for the commonwealth,” she added.
Spanberger’s agenda also calls for investing in the health care workforce, including a proposal to transfer management of health incentive programs from the Virginia Department of Health to the Virginia Health Workforce Development Authority, which she says will help ensure patients have access to both routine and complex care.
In addition, her plan would stabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplace through targeted premium assistance, establishing a pilot program for individuals most likely to drop coverage due to federal premium increases — a concern echoed by health policy analysts across the country. 
Another measure, House Bill 1639, sponsored by Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, earlier this year but vetoed by Youngkin, would remove the sunset on a law banning extra insurance premium charges for tobacco users.
Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said rising costs have forced difficult decisions for many families this holiday season, including choosing between heat and housing or prescriptions and groceries. 
Locke said the time for posturing is over.  ”Gov.-elect Spanberger is ready to govern, and so are we,” she said. “The people are watching, and they are counting on us to deliver.”
 Energy: efficiency, forecasting and storage

Spanberger also made stabilizing energy costs a priority, highlighting widespread concerns about utility bills in the midst of growing peak demand driven in part by data centers and other high-load infrastructure across the state.
Starting in January, she said, lawmakers will pursue expanded energy storage to help lower peak power prices by allowing stored energy to be used during periods of high demand. A revived 2025 proposal would raise energy storage capacity targets for Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power subject to approval by the State Corporation Commission.
“We will make expanded energy storage a top priority,” Spanberger said, “and we will improve energy efficiency across our commonwealth.”
The agenda also calls for expanding programs to reduce heating and energy costs for low-income Virginians and establishing a weatherization and energy efficiency task force within the Department of Housing and Community Development.

Small solar systems, such as balcony-mounted panels, would be exempted from typical utility approval requirements under her plan, facilitating wider adoption.
The agenda further advocates for improving utility demand forecasting to avoid overestimations that can lead to unnecessary infrastructure investments and higher rates for consumers.
Herring praised the plan’s emphasis on solar and renewable energy, saying it reflects a commitment to using technology to reduce costs and ensure a strong, resilient grid.
 Housing: boosting supply, strengthening protections

Addressing the ongoing housing affordability crisis, Spanberger further seeks a combination of tenant protections and measures to expand the supply of affordable housing across the commonwealth.
Her proposals include extending the grace period before landlords can file eviction proceedings, authorizing localities to adopt affordable housing dwelling unit programs and giving local governments a right of first refusal to preserve existing affordable housing stock.
Spanberger’s plan also calls for creating a revolving loan fund for mixed-income developments, expanding the Virginia Eviction Reduction Program, and using the commonwealth’s bonding authority to support affordable housing projects.
“It doesn’t matter, either in Northern Virginia or Southside Virginia,” Spanberger said, “starting in January, we will give every locality the option to increase the supply of affordable housing in their community.”
 Balancing affordability and fiscal stability

When Youngkin delivered his budget proposal Wednesday, he stressed a thriving economy and cautioned against policies he said could jeopardize Virginia’s business environment. The outgoing governor’s plan continues tax cuts and boosts spending on education, public safety, and Medicaid, though analysts have noted potential strains ahead due to federal shifts and slower revenue growth.
While Youngkin’s budget warns of anti-business policies, Spanberger underscored concerns about rising costs for families and the need to safeguard Virginia’s fiscal health.
She reiterated her support for maintaining the state’s AAA bond rating and fulfilling the constitutional requirement to balance the budget. Spanberger acknowledged that growth projections for the coming years are weaker than in the recent past and that lawmakers must navigate “real fiscal challenges” in crafting the next biennial budget.
“That is why many of these efforts to lower costs for Virginians either don’t utilize general fund dollars or are cost-neutral,” she said, noting that her team hopes to plan for worse economic scenarios than might materialize.
Spanberger’s pitch drew broad support from Democratic legislative leaders, who characterized the agenda as a direct response to voter concerns about everyday costs — and a mandate to act. 
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said voters didn’t send Democrats to Richmond to admire architecture but to deliver results.
“They sent us here to do a job, they want us to lower costs,” Scott said, taking aim at federal economic policies and asserting that Spanberger’s focus aligns with constituent priorities.
Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, emphasized fiscal responsibility and stability, noting that Senate budget negotiators strive to protect taxpayers while investing in communities and ensuring prosperity.
Spanberger said her agenda represents a starting point from which lawmakers and stakeholders will build over the coming legislative session. She also expressed optimism about bipartisan cooperation, saying conversations with House and Senate leaders indicate a shared willingness to act on affordability.
“We will work to make everyday life more affordable for Virginians,” she said.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation YouTube channel)TOPEKA — A Kansas tribe terminated its involvement in a federal contract to design large-scale migrant detention centers, a tribal leader announced Wednesday.
In a recorded address, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Tribal Council Joseph Rupnick said the Nation and its subsidiaries have fully separated from a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The contract was a source of scrutiny for the tribe, and Rupnick’s announcement came less than a week after he expressed his heartbreak, drawing parallels between immigrant detention and America’s history of forced removal of Native Americans. Some members of the Tribe’s leadership were part of the company that contracted with ICE, KBP Services, and were subsequently fired for their involvement. The company was a subsidiary of the tribe’s business arm, Prairie Band LLC. 
“I’m very happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE,” Rupnick said in the address. “As a result, Prairie Band, LLC is no longer a direct or indirect owner or participant in, or otherwise affiliated with, any ICE-related projects, contracts or operations.”
A spokesperson for the Tribe did not immediately respond to questions from Kansas Reflector.
A federal database showed the $30 million contract between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and KPB Services, an affiliate of the tribe, was still active as of Thursday morning.
The contract asked KPB Services to conduct “due diligence” and “concept design for processing centers and mega centers throughout the United States.” The contract was last modified Dec. 5, adding an additional facility and adjusting the period of performance. 
Rupnick said the Prairie Band Tribal Council will discuss at its upcoming January meeting “the steps we will take to ensure that our Nation’s economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-1024x580.png,,,2025-12-18 11:58:31.024726

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Des Moines University is gearing up to offer residency programming in partnership with area hospitals and clinics, having received initial approval from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to become a “sponsoring institution.”
The private medical university announced this month it is developing its first residency program, which it hopes to launch in 2027, said Jennifer Beaty, DMU associate dean for graduate medical education. The one-year program will be housed at the university’s osteopathic manual medicine clinic and focus on osteopathic neuromusculoskeletal medicine, with just one or two residents to start.
While the majority of the program can be handled on campus or at its clinics, Beaty said there are hospital medicine components that a partnership is required to fulfill.

“Des Moines University doesn’t have a hospital. We aren’t capable of starting our own program completely independently,” Beaty said. “We need to partner with hospital systems and clinics around the state so that we can help provide, with our partners, excellent educational experience and residency programs.”
As an “osteopathic medical institution” teaching “osteopathic principles,” Beaty said this area of study was a good choice for the university’s first program. DMU is currently in the process of applying to sponsor this specific program, as earning the “sponsoring institution” title was just the first step. In order to qualify for the residency, students will need to have already completed a primary care residency.
While the residency will allow DMU graduates and those from other medical universities to apply for the program, Beaty said DMU’s expansion of offerings will help those at the university who are worried about where they’ll have to go to complete their education and training. This could also help keep students in the state for longer, furthering the chances of them staying permanently.
David Connett, dean of the DMU college of osteopathic medicine, said in a news release this step will lead to the university “strengthening the state’s physician workforce while expanding high-quality clinical training opportunities for our students.”
“This designation will enable DMU to develop innovative, mission-aligned GME programs within our own clinical system and in partnership with hospitals and community sites statewide,” Connett said in the release. “Ultimately, it allows us to help meet Iowa’s growing need for physicians, retain more of our graduates locally, and ensure patients throughout the state benefit from exceptional, osteopathically-informed medical education and care.”
DMU is currently in the process of engaging with Iowa health systems and clinics to identify potential partnerships, Beaty said, with a focus on rural areas for future programs.
Beaty said developing residency programs with partners across the state was Connett’s vision, one he brought with him and started working on as soon as he joined the university 18 months ago.
State attention on medical education has been high, Beaty said, with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signing into law proposals to expand rural access to medical care and physician training programs. The state of Iowa graduates more medical students annually than there are residency positions available, and DMU wants to ensure it is entering smart partnerships to create high-quality programs.
“We don’t want to just open a program to open a program and say we did it. We want to make sure the need is truly there,” Beaty said. “We believe it is, but we want to make sure it’s truly there, and that the support in the communities it’s going to take place in is strong, so that the program can be successful.”

The three-year contract was ratified by an overwhelming vote of 483-3, according to a news release from the university system Wednesday. It comes after roughly 900 part-time graduate student workers began bargaining with the university in 2023. The contract includes pay increases, tuition discounts and insurance benefits for the students, most of whom are research and teaching assistants at UMaine. 
“When weeks dragged into months and then into years, there were those who doubted they could do it, but they proved that workers can wield tremendous power when they band together in a union and refuse to give up the fight for fair wages, quality health care and a collective voice in the workplace,” said Maine AFL-CIO President Cynthia Phinney, in a statement.
UMaine grad students hoping to secure higher pay, more transparency in first contract

Workers from several industries have rallied around the student union, which is affiliated with the United Auto Workers. In August, a paper worker, an ironworker and a nurse spoke out in support of finalizing a contract for the graduate workers at a rally in Orono.
The system’s board of trustees is expected to give final approval of the contact at its Jan. 26 meeting in Orono. It would take effect immediately after that vote; however, pay and benefit provisions would start July 1, with the start of the next fiscal year. 
“This agreement achieves the right balance — recognizing that graduate student workers deserve fair compensation and working conditions that reflect their essential role in our education and research mission, while also upholding our responsibility to keep Maine’s public universities affordable for students and taxpayers,” said university Chancellor Dannel Malloy and President Joan Ferrini-Mundy in a joint statement. 
The new union contract provides a one-time $750 ratification bonus, as well as stipend increases of $3,000 to $5,000, along with guaranteed annual stipend increases. 
For example, master’s students covered by the union who work 20 hours per week will see their nine-month stipend increase from $17,000 to $21,000. Doctoral students will jump from $20,000 to $23,500.
Students will also be eligible for university-funded health insurance under the new agreement. UMaine will pay 65% of premium costs in the first two years of the contract and 85% in the third year. It will also pay 50% of the premium cost for dental insurance plans. 
The university system will also waive nine credit hours of tuition per fall and spring semester — which comes to more than $10,000 annually — for most graduate student-workers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0808-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 10:58:12.698690

“The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address.
The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut.
“I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence.
The Dalios commitment, which will total at least $75 million, follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income.
The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term.
The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts.
“Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday.
Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose.

Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business.
Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children.
Jane Waldfogel, a professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, said ideally, governments would provide benefits that help families with children afford immediate expenses and programs like the Trump Accounts that help families save for a child’s future.
“The problem that many scholars have tried to address and many politicians have tried to address with these child savings accounts is that low-income families and even middle-income families struggle to put aside money and save money for their children’s future,” said Waldfogel, who recently published a book about child benefits.
Without regular government contributions targeted toward poorer families, Waldfogel does not expect the accounts to decrease economic inequality as affluent families will take advantage of them but other families will not.
Steven Durlauf, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, said he expects the accounts to make a very modest contribution toward the resources of young adults. His research has examined what factors impact the success of children and he said improving early childhood education and rectifying racial and economic segregation at schools and in neighborhoods would do more to give children the skills and opportunities they need to be productive.
Durlauf also said as much as the philanthropy of the affluent is admirable, he thinks it should remain out of politics and controversies.
“This is integrating the wealthy into the support of particular government programs that are associated with particular political figures,” he said. “And that strikes me as extraordinarily dangerous.”
The Dalios have granted tens of millions to Connecticut public schools over the years, though a $100 million initiative launched in 2019 that would have involved matching public funds fell apart after state lawmakers raised questions over transparency. Altogether, the Dalios say they’ve given $7 billion through their philanthropy, which has focused on education, support for economic advancement and ocean research and education.

The Missouri Department of Public Safety has been negotiating with Mighty Good Solutions DBA Stercus Bioanalytics, and the Missouri-based company is now the contractor on a $7 million statewide project.
The project is planned to test the wastewater of 12 schools around Missouri for drug use and was touted by Gov. Mike Kehoe in January.
“In an effort to identify areas of high fentanyl use in schools across the state, we are including $4 million in investment for fentanyl testing in wastewater systems at schools,” Kehoe said during his first State of the State address in January.
An additional $3 million was allocated to the project to fund wastewater testing involving law enforcement efforts. The project was then moved from the Missouri Department of Health and Human services to the Department of Public Safety, Mike O’Connell, public safety communications director, said in an email.
“I believe that at that point, the decision was made to move the whole program to DPS,” O’Connell said.
Last month, Missouri school superintendents received emails asking them to notify the agency if they are interested in enrolling in the wastewater test program, O’Connell said.
In the email sent to superintendents and obtained by the Missourian, the program is said to include ongoing weekly testing that will provide insights into short- and long-term trends.
“Through the collection of one small wastewater sample per week, schools will receive near real-time insights into local substance misuse trends at no cost and with no additional responsibilities for your staff,” said Mark James, director of the Department of Public Safety in the email.
The project dates are not yet set, but the email asks that superintendents request inclusion in the program by this week, adding that the data from the testing may be used to shape initiatives that attempt to counteract drug use.
Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for those aged 18 to 44 in Missouri, according to the Health and Human Services website.
The project had received $2 million in funding from former Gov. Mike Parson in his 2025 budget. No wastewater testing in schools has taken place yet.
The company in charge of testing, Mighty Good Solutions, says on their website, “By analyzing wastewater for specific biomarkers, we provide governments with powerful tools to detect narcotics prevalence, understand usage patterns, and identify trends — all through anonymous, macro-level data.”
Plans for testing don’t give specific details on how the Department of Public Safety will use the data to help combat opioid usage. Other states have been in conversations with the same company, and Mississippi lawmakers are currently considering them for wastewater testing.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Covid-19 pandemic was an overwhelming event in Alaska, and a new state report describes how Indigenous residents, the elderly and Asian people and Pacific Islanders suffered the most as the state’s experience with the disease transitioned through different phases.
From the time the first Alaska case was detected on March 12, 2020, to the end of the declared public health emergency in May of 2023, there were seven distinct periods of the pandemic in the state, according to the report, which was released as a bulletin from the Alaska Division of Public Health’s epidemiology section.
State epidemiologists have classified the seven periods as eras, distinguished by different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions — defined as public health measures to limit the community spread, such as school closures – the availability of vaccines, the variants of the virus that dominated, the availability of antiviral medicines and other factors.
Of the seven eras, the most serious was the fourth, which was dominated by the Delta variant of the virus. That era started in July of 2021 and ran through the end of that year. During that period, 2,021 Alaskans were hospitalized with the disease and 719 died from it, according to the report. Nearly half of Alaska’s COVID-19 deaths occurred then and COVID-19 was the state’s leading cause of death during the period, the report said. Over that entire year, COVID-19 ranked as the third leading cause of death in Alaska, behind cancer and heart disease.
The Delta variant era also proved to be the most dangerous for younger Alaskans, with nearly two-thirds of the deaths among those under 55 years of age.
The Delta variant emerged after the start of vaccinations and Alaskans who had been fully vaccinated were better protected against the disease, the report said. Earlier research by state epidemiologists found that unvaccinated Alaskans with COVID-19 were 4.49 times more likely to die than were Alaskans who had received their full vaccine doses, as recommended by health officials.

	The second era, from June to December of 2020, ranked as the second most dangerous, with 968 hospitalization and 291 deaths. And two eras, spanning the period from January to October of 2022, were characterized by Omicron subvariants, and resulted in high case numbers but lower severity, with lower death rates and hospitalization rates.
Alaska Natives and American Indians consistently had the highest rates of death and hospitalization during the entire pandemic, reflecting some longstanding health disparities, the report said.
In some parts of rural Alaska, lack of adequate water and sanitation service was a key factor in those disparities, earlier research found.
There were some sharp geographic differences in vaccination patterns, the report showed. Vaccination rates were highest in Southeast Alaska, Anchorage and Southwest Alaska; they were lowest in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and in the Gulf Coast region.
The epidemiologist team that compiled the report said there are lessons from Alaska’s COVID-19 experience that should be useful for the next pandemic.
The most important of those lessons, the team said in a written statement, “is that early, well-coordinated, and community-centered public health measures are crucial.”
That means ensuring that communities have timely access to prevention and response tools and that local leaders are involved in the effort, the statement said.
Another respiratory illness, though of a nature yet to be determined, is considered the likeliest cause of the next pandemic, the statement said.
“While it is impossible to predict the exact cause of a future pandemic, global health experts consistently point to respiratory viruses such as new influenza strains or emerging coronaviruses as the most likely sources, making continued readiness in this area especially important,” the statement said.
Although the public health emergency is over, COVID-19 has not disappeared. The virus continues to circulate in the population. In 2024, it was the cause of 58 Alaska deaths, according to state records.
Age-adjusted COVID-19 death rates among Alaska residents are broken down by race and pandemic era, from March 2020 to May 2023. Beyond the first era, when the virus was new to Alaska and case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths were few, Alaska Native and American Indians consistently had the highest mortality rates.

After moving to the nation’s fourth-largest city in 2021, Jackson native Elizabeth Evans said she’s had an easier time meeting new people because of Houston’s offerings – popular concert tours, Texans NFL games, fitness-driven outdoor functions, Jazzy Sundays in the park. Many of these new Houston friends hail from Jackson State University.

Evans, 33, is among the thousands of Jacksonians who have left home for other states. A majority of these expats from Hinds County, where Jackson is located, remained in the South – hundreds in Georgia, Tennessee and Louisiana in the last few years.
But from 2017 to 2022, the county saw a whopping 5,500 of its residents move to Texas, according to Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by researcher Jake McGraw at Rethink Mississippi.
“Dallas and Houston are the two biggest recipient locations of people moving out of Mississippi, but very few make the move back east from those places,” McGraw told Mississippi Today.
Evans had never lived outside Mississippi’s capital city, but she’d gotten a remote job in communications for a nonprofit organization and realized she could work from anywhere. 
“I’m a Southern girl to the core, and I didn’t want to immediately leave the South,” Evans said. 
Since 2020, Jackson’s population has declined 8%, by more than 12,000 people, according to the Census Bureau. To be sure, when people leave Hinds County, the two most common destinations are adjoining Madison and Rankin counties, McGraw said, but when they leave the state entirely, Texas is by far the most popular landing spot.
Though Texas is politically similar to Mississippi – Republican state leaders, a six-week abortion ban and growing anti-immigrant sentiment – Evans said she feels like the issues she cares about are amplified in Houston. She has found a community that believes in what she values, such as reproductive justice and voting access. Part of her political awareness began because she grew up in Jackson, a city that she said is plagued with issues of racial inequity and environmental challenges. 
“It’s easier to distract yourself from those things when you are in other places, but I think here (in Jackson), being so deeply connected to people and the landscape of the city, it will certainly radicalize you,” Evans said. 
More than 200 miles away in Dallas, another Jackson native is advancing in a marketing career. Bianca Tatum said Texas has offered her an opportunity to be ambitious with work that Mississippi didn’t. The Mississippi State University graduate lived in Illinois and Alabama before making the journey to Houston, then Dallas.
“Dallas and Houston, I feel like, are safe for Mississippians,” said Tatum, 32. “It’s not so far that you won’t know anybody or you’ll get a culture shock, because Houston and Dallas are a lot like Jackson.”
The similarities are simple – tight-knit neighborhoods, good food and a close circle of friends. But that wasn’t enough to offset the lack of recreation and low salaries for Tatum to justify staying in Mississippi. 
“I think they need to make it more desirable for young people to be there,” she said. “Give us more things to do. Give us more money.”
Tatum said moving around the country opened up her worldview. She’s proud of being from Mississippi, but she said the change of scenery pushed her out of her comfort zone. 
“I’m just grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to develop myself in other ways before taking the route of getting into a serious relationship or becoming a mom,” Tatum said. “I don’t think I would have had the opportunity to meet more of myself before making these big life decisions.” 
The issue of brain drain isn’t new for Jackson. Since the 1980s, when its population crested over 200,000, the number of residents has declined – sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly. 
Jackson native Charles Miller moved back to his hometown with his wife after graduating law school in 1979. Even at the height of Jackson’s population, the capital city made them restless. They moved to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1982 after Miller found work as an in-house attorney for an energy company.
“I was frustrated,” said Miller, 71. “Everything seemed a little bit slower after my time at Vanderbilt and at Emory. My internal clock had changed. I wasn’t happy in Jackson.”
Since making the journey west, Miller has raised a family, taught business classes at a university and retired. For a brief period, he said he considered moving back to Mississippi. 
“I could not go back to Jackson now. I realized that about 15, 20 years ago,” Miller said. “I go back to visit, but for no other reason. Texas is where I am and who I am.”
Sondra Collins, senior economist with Mississippi’s University Research Center, said in order to combat brain drain, the state has to find ways to attract more young people and prioritize jobs that compensate employees fairly. Mississippi has fewer positions available for people with bachelor’s degrees, Collins said, which means some with a degree may end up taking a pay cut just to remain employed in the state.
“Having a population that doesn’t have as many people with bachelor’s degrees, even some skilled certificates, tends to mean that the jobs that are in the state are going to be jobs that are for people without a bachelor’s degree, without certificates, and those jobs tend to be lower-paid than jobs that require more,” Collins said. 
Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show the private average hourly income in Mississippi is $28.10, compared to $34.28 in Texas, which adds up to thousands of dollars per year in earned income potentially left on the table for those remaining in Mississippi 
Collins said while other states also experience brain drain, their populations are replaced by people moving in. For people looking for larger city life, Mississippi doesn’t get consideration.
“We have to land some of those young people from other states who are wanting to explore,” Collins said. “We want them to come explore here in Mississippi. That has to be a bit of a priority.”
Jackson native Adam Luckett moved to San Antonio right after he graduated from the University of Mississippi with his degree in chemical engineering. He and his wife Tera Eichelberger love their neighborhood and its offerings – authentic Hispanic and Asian food, and a diverse community. But they also miss the familiarity of Jackson.
“There was more of a community in Jackson,” Luckett, 31, said. “You feel a lot more connected to the people around you, even if you don’t know them, if it’s a smaller town.”
Eichelberger, 34, said in order to move back to Jackson, she’d like to see more jobs created in the tech field. The city would also need to invest in public transportation and infrastructure. Jackson has long struggled with its water system, from a city-wide outage due to a winter storm in 2021 that left residents without running water, to a federal receivership that led to the system being controlled by a private utility, JXN Water.
“The water situation is something you really can’t stress enough,” Eichelberger said. 
While they’ve grown in their careers since moving, they both agree they would be able to see themselves in Jackson long-term if there were opportunities to earn more money. 
“Your life isn’t going to magically get better because you move to a larger city,” Luckett said.

Since 2010, Mississippi has lost 80,000 more people than it has gained, according to the Census Bureau. Justin Ransburg, who went to college in Texas, is one Jackson native who made the decision to return home. What he anticipated to be a few-month stint ended up capturing his 20s.
“ I’ve always said that I wanted to move outside of Mississippi to see what else is out in the world,” Ransburg said. 
The visual artist and comics teacher attended Texas Southern University, a historically Black university in Houston. He’d only planned to return to Mississippi for six months after graduating in 2012, he said, but once he was home, he didn’t want to leave. He became a part of the local art scene and worked at various galleries. But most importantly to him, he was able to take part in his nieces’ and nephews’ lives.

“When I actually did come back, a lot of the things that I was looking for that I found in Houston, I found here in Mississippi,” Ransburg said. 
Ransburg said he was searching for more opportunities to create art, try out coffee shops and restaurants and attend events where he could meet like-minded creatives. He found that in the Fondren and Midtown districts, and at one point, he and a friend created a group called the Jackson Drawing Club.
“ I’ve been able to meet people that I wouldn’t have in Houston,” he said. “ As a person, it showed me things that I value more than I realize, and how to care for those things to make sure that they last a long time and also what to let go of.”
People discredit Mississippi’s rich history and focus only on the issues that persist, such as bad infrastructure and homelessness, he said. To him, Mississippi isn’t just the sum of its problems.
“ People need to have their own perception of a place or of people,” Ransburg said, “because if you’re just going by stereotypes or things you’ve heard, it’s like you’re letting the propaganda get to you.”",https://mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-2.gif,,,2025-12-18 10:00:51.188463

In 2022 Gov. Gavin Newsom floated a new concept to get seriously mentally ill individuals the help they need, and get them off the street. Many Californians, especially family members of people that need extra help, felt buoyed by this promise. 
Newsom’s idea became CARE Court, and it rolled out to a few counties at first, and the whole state by the end of 2024. CalMatters reporters Marisa Kendall, Jocelyn Wiener, Yue Stella Yu and Erica Yee spent much of the past year investigating how the program has done. 
While CARE Court has helped some people, many of the families and individuals interviewed for these four stories expressed frustration at the limits of the program versus what they felt was promised. 

Ronda Deplazes, a mother who is fighting for her son to be released from CARE Court: “We get so pumped up with hope. I think the frustration and disappointment is more than a person can bear. That’s the truth of it. That is the bottom line.”

A sales tax to prevent the next wildfire?

Could raising Los Angeles County’s sales tax help residents avoid the next great wildfire?
Two nonprofits are pushing that idea in a report released today detailing what policymakers, public agencies and other stakeholders could do to lessen wildfire risks and help communities still struggling after January’s L.A.-area wildfires.
One suggestion from Climate Resolve and Resilient Cities Catalyst is raising L.A. County’s 9.75% sales tax to create a “Los Angeles County Resilience District,” which would fund projects related to protecting residents from wildfires, earthquakes and other natural disasters. 

The report: “Preparedness saves money. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that every dollar invested in disaster prevention saves $13 in avoided damages, cleanup, and lost economic activity. … A quarter-cent sales tax in Los Angeles County would yield $600 million per year, funding important mitigation measures.”

But raising taxes and creating the district would be a tall order, requiring approval from the state Legislature and voters through a 2028 ballot measure — an effort the nonprofits anticipate would cost about $5 million to carry out.



1 in 5 CA households food insecure, says PPIC

On Wednesday members of the state Assembly’s human services committee and a select Assembly committee on CalFresh and nutrition, convened in Alameda to discuss food insecurity and how recent federal action has affected food programs.
During the hearing, Tess Thorman, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, gave testimony detailing the prevalence of food insecurity in the state and some of the challenges facing CalFresh, the state’s version of the federal SNAP food benefit program.
Using data from the annual U.S. Department of Agriculture’s food insecurity survey, PPIC determined that 23% of California households in 2023 experienced some type of food insecurity. Households with children, as well as Latino and Black households, were more likely to experience food insecurity.
Federal policy changes under President Donald Trump are also anticipated to worsen the situation: New work requirements for CalFresh enrollees could mean as many as 620,000 Californians losing benefits, according to Thorman. In September the USDA also said it would stop conducting the food insecurity survey, after a 30-year run, which would make it more difficult for policymakers to understand and combat hunger.

Most cities and towns, the state housing office regularly emphasizes, have gotten on board and submitted plans to zone for a district of multifamily housing near MBTA service areas, as called for in the 2021 law. But a group of holdouts is banking on the very court that declared the legislation mandatory  – and enforceable – in January to rule that the mandate is illegal without dedicated funding included in the law. 
Marshfield was one of a bundle of towns that wanted a Plymouth County Superior Court judge to declare they cannot be forced to rezone and bear the potential burden of more density. Lawmakers are not permitted to hand down “unfunded mandates” that create financial obligations on cities and towns without a way to pay for them. 
But Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea dismissed suits brought by Duxbury, Hanson, Holden, Marshfield, Middleton, Wenham, Weston, and Wrentham, plus taxpayers in Hamilton. Gildea said the towns’ anticipated possible costs were “indirect,” nonspecific, and therefore not in need of dedicated funding from the state. Beyond that, he wrote, there are already available grants for infrastructure needs and the process.   
Marshfield appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court, which agreed to take the case directly to consider the unfunded mandate question. The town argues that Gildea should not have agreed to dismiss the case, asserting that they did describe all the elements of an unfunded mandate in their complaint.  
“In addition to suffering a irreparable loss of awarded grant funds in enumerated grant programs, it is/was foreclosed from all other discretionary grant funds not mentioned in the statute,” the town argues in its brief. Plus, the town says, there were costs associated with evaluating and drafting the zoning bylaws and presenting them to the Town Meeting, and they expect to have additional costs based on the rezoning.   
The Healey administration has provided nearly $8 million worth of technical assistance and grants to more than 150 MBTA Communities to support the implementation of this law, the housing office said.   
“The MBTA Communities Act is one of many tools that Massachusetts is using to increase the production of reasonably-priced housing and lower costs for everyone,”  Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities Secretary Ed Augustus said in a statement, noting that 6,000 new housing units are already in the pipeline in the communities. “We continue to work with the remaining communities to support them in passing zoning that meets their needs, as well as moving forward on many other initiatives to make housing more affordable,” he said.    
Marshfield is using the SJC’s own conclusion earlier this year as the basis for the town’s grievance. Writing for a unanimous court on a suit brought by Attorney General Andrea Campbell against the town of Milton, which was resisting compliance with the new statute, Chief Justice Kimberly Budd stated plainly that the MBTA Communities law is not a suggestion. 
Because the law itself says cities and towns “shall” zone for multifamily housing, “it is clear that the Legislature intended to require MBTA communities to comply with the act,” she wrote in a footnote. To enforce it, the court concluded, the attorney general’s office can wield the sweeping powers of her office and penalties for noncompliance are not limited to losing four state funding sources listed in the initial legislation. 
The high court spent much of its energy in oral arguments and its ruling on the consequences for recalcitrant municipalities, appearing piqued at some points that the cities or towns might simply decide to take a financial hit to avoid rezoning. 
“If we were to adopt the town’s interpretation, the only consequence to an MBTA community for failing to comply with the act would be the loss of certain funding opportunities,” Budd wrote in the Milton ruling. “Thus, those communities, like the town in this case, which choose to forgo the identified funding programs, would be free to ignore the legislative decision to require towns benefiting from MBTA services to permit their fair share of multifamily housing near their local MBTA stations and terminals.”  
This, she said, would “thwart the Legislature’s purpose by converting a legislative mandate into a matter of fiscal choice.” 
Either enthusiastically or through gritted teeth, 92 percent of all MBTA Communities have passed new zoning so far, according to the state housing office.  
Three communities facing a December 31 deadline have not yet adopted new zoning, and 10 municipalities did not meet a July deadline and have yet to adopt MBTA Communities zoning. Marshfield is not among them, having passed compliant zoning in October as a precaution. 
The housing office and Marshfield are scheduled to file additional briefs in January, and the court could hear the case as early as February. 
“We appreciate the 164 communities, including Marshfield, that have put zoning in place to comply with the law,” Campbell said in a statement, “and given the urgency of addressing the housing shortage, we look forward to the SJC taking up this most recent challenge early next year to clarify, once and for all, that every community must comply with the law.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Worcester_Housing_Triple_Three_Decker.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s CARE Court changed the way California treats people with severe mental illness. We spoke with dozens of participants to learn how it’s working.


Gov. Gavin Newsom two years ago launched a new program called CARE Court that gave hope to families struggling with severe mental illness.
It promised to provide treatment and housing through court-supervised plans that would keep difficult-to-help individuals on track. 
We spent much of the past year talking with dozens of people who’ve interacted with CARE Court as participants, petitioners and as employees trying to fulfill the program’s goals.
Here’s a sampling of their experiences.

‘I felt so defeated’
Last summer, June Dudas was in church when she got a text message from her 84-year-old aunt: “He’s here.” 
Dudas called back, and, in a whisper, her aunt said she’d locked herself in the bathroom to hide from her son, Ed, who was outside her San Diego home. It was an all-too familiar situation. Over the years, Dudas had helped her aunt fortify her fence, install multiple security cameras and file restraining orders. It was an effort to protect her from a man who, when not gripped by psychosis, was a “gentle giant” who loved animals and made jewelry out of gemstones – but, when at the mercy of his delusions, could turn violent. 
This time, Dudas told her aunt, she had a new solution. She had just learned about CARE Court, which she’d heard could compel people into treatment. Dudas’ aunt quickly submitted a CARE Court petition on her son’s behalf. 
But when the CARE Court team offered Ed help, he refused, according to Dudas. Saying there was nothing more they could do, a judge dismissed his case.
“I felt so defeated for my cousin,” Dudas said. “It’s like, ‘OK, Eddy, they’re saying that when you’re well enough to understand how sick you are, then they’re ready to help you, but until then you’re on your own, buddy, and there’s nothing they’re going to do for you.’ And it just struck me as very callous.”
Dudas’ aunt tried again with a second petition in October. That one was dismissed as well. 
Now, Ed is in jail for violating his mother’s restraining order. Dudas worries that when he gets out, which likely will be early next year, her family will be back where they started: With her and her aunt living in fear, and Ed still not getting the help he needs.

‘Life’s treating me pretty good’
When outreach workers found J.M. in February, he was sleeping on some blankets under an awning in Oakland. He didn’t have a tent, despite the winter cold, and he couldn’t walk due to a foot injury. He wore multiple pairs of pants and socks in an effort to compress his foot and relieve the pain and swelling.
J.M., who had been homeless for several years, asked CalMatters to refer to him using his initials, to protect his privacy.
At first, the county sent J.M. to a psychiatric hospital on a temporary hold. He received treatment for his foot and for his mental health, but said it was frustrating to have no choice in the matter. He found the facility depressing and didn’t like the food.
When he was discharged, CARE Court got him a room in a hotel in downtown Oakland that was converted into temporary housing for clients who need mental health services. 
Now, J.M. regularly walks the half mile from the hotel to the waterfront at Jack London Square, where he sits and watches the water. 
He wants to go back to school and get his GED diploma. He dropped out of high school in ninth grade, and he’d like to find a tutor to help him with his reading, spelling and vocabulary – areas he’s always struggled with. He’s looking for work, and trying to quit smoking cigarettes.
“It’s been pretty good,” J.M. said. “Life’s treating me pretty good.”

‘They were so caring’
CARE Court has been a lifeline for 64-year-old Mary Peters of Riverside. Until then, Peters was navigating her younger sister’s mental illness all on her own. 
In addition to her sister, Peters was helping to take care of their father, who had dementia. Meanwhile, her sister bounced in and out of the hospital and homelessness. Sometimes, Peters didn’t know where she was or how to find her. Even if she suspected her sister was hospitalized, hospital staff often wouldn’t give her any information, citing patient privacy. 
Peters filed a CARE Court petition on her sister’s behalf in October 2023, and all of that changed. Suddenly, she had people to help her. The CARE Court team tracked down her sister when Peters’ couldn’t, and got her into a sober living facility. When her sister didn’t like that facility, they helped her move somewhere else, Peters said. 
“Without the CARE team, it would have been impossible for me to do this,” Peters said. “There were times when I wanted to give up. There were days when you just kind of throw your hands up, if someone is feeling so hopeless and you’re doing everything you can to try to help.”
Peters’ sister graduated from CARE Court earlier this year, in a small courtroom celebration with cupcakes. Now, she lives in her own apartment in Riverside.
Her sister still has her ups and downs, but she seems more clearheaded now, she reconnected with her two adult sons, and she feels less hopeless, Peters said. And she credits CARE Court.
“They were so patient,” Peters said. “They were so caring.”

‘My sister that I used to know …’
Antonio Hernandez first learned about CARE Court when he saw a flyer that his older sister brought home after being discharged from a treatment facility.
“I was so excited about this CARE Court,” he said. “Oh my gosh, that’s exactly what we need.”
His sister, who has schizophrenia, was stable then, taking medication and talking about getting a job. 
Hernandez filed a petition for his sister to enter CARE Court in Kern County. The county’s CARE Court process was rife with delays and extensions, her brother said. In the meantime, he said, his sister was left in limbo and began decompensating.
Eventually, she was evicted from a Bakersfield room and board and transferred to a sober living home, he said. Six months after he first petitioned, he said, his sister signed the CARE agreement. That same day, she was kicked out of the sober living facility, too.
She became homeless, camping in the park and talking to herself, he said. She stopped taking her medication.
“You have to be at your worst for them to help,” he said. “It kind of makes no sense. They expect you to be at your worst to be accepted. At the same time, they expect autonomy from patients to make their own decisions when they’re at their worst.”
He worries about the irreversible damage being done to his sister’s brain.
“My sister that I used to know, I’ll no longer get to have that sister anymore because of their failure, their negligence, and their inability to follow through with what the law states,” he said.

A life-changing program
C.M., 55, was on the verge of homelessness when CARE Court stepped in last January. 
In her 40s, she’d started experiencing bouts of psychosis when she was under extreme stress, with terrifying symptoms that included hearing cruel voices or feeling like her body was being shocked with electricity. 
In her 50s, she lost her construction management job because of one of those episodes, and struggled to pay the rent on her San Leandro apartment. Her disability benefits were about $1,600 a month, but her rent was $1,750. She drove for Lyft to try to close the gap, but then her Lyft app started glitching, she said. She knew she couldn’t pay her bills, and the stress sent her spiralling into another episode of psychosis. 
In January 2025, one of the EMTs on San Leandro’s mental health crisis response team saw that she needed help, and filed a CARE Court petition on her behalf.
Now, C.M. has her own room on the first floor of an old Victorian house in West Oakland, with a window overlooking a yard and a giant agave plant. She’s taped photos of her two adult sons as little boys to one of the walls, next to a printed-out list titled “coping skills.”
“I literally didn’t spend any time on the streets after I got evicted, because of CARE Court,” said C.M., who asked to be referred to by her initials out of fear that being associated with schizophrenia would hurt her chances of getting a job.
She can live there rent-free while her caseworkers help her find permanent housing. That stability is important for anyone, but it’s particularly life-changing for C.M., as financial stress and the fear of homelessness are psychological triggers that can launch her back into psychosis.
Now, C.M. is looking toward the future. She’s starting school for construction management next year, and hopes to find another job in the industry. But there’s some uncertainty there as well. C.M. is set to graduate from CARE Court in April, and as that date fast approaches, she’s still not sure where her next housing placement will be.

‘This is what families have to endure’
At first, Anita Fisher was an enthusiastic advocate for CARE Court. She met with Gov. Newsom to discuss it. She appeared on 60 Minutes talking about how the program was a promising tool to help people with serious mental illness.
At the time, her own son, who is diagnosed with schizophrenia, was doing well. 
Some of her last words in the 60 Minutes interview? 
“I hope he will never have to use it.”
Then her son stopped his medication and ended up in a mental health crisis.
Fisher’s petition for CARE Court in San Diego County was accepted. But, soon, her son was arrested. Then he was discharged to the streets. At one point, he went missing.
“Can you imagine having to wonder if your son is alive or dead for three weeks?” she said. “This is what families have to endure.”
Her son, who she describes as a sweet, docile man, had been an Army medic with an impeccable record until his illness popped up at the age of 21. Now he kept going to jail.
Two years after she first petitioned CARE Court to get him help, she has nothing positive to say about the program she once lauded.
“I look at it as a total failure,” she said.

The Death Penalty Information Center reported Monday that Alabama tied with Texas and South Carolina for the most executions in 2025, even as public support for the practice continues to decline. (Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)A new report found that Alabama put more people to death in 2025 than all but one other state.
The annual report from the Death Penalty Information Center, published Monday, also noted that states which impose capital punishment are intensifying efforts to expand its use even as public support for it continues to decline.
“The data are really interesting this year in that they show two, very different trends,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a national nonprofit that is focused on capital punishment. “On the one hand we have public support for the death penalty continuing to drop. We have opposition to the death penalty continuing to grow.”

The report said there were 48 executions in the nation this year. That was almost double those in 2024, but they were concentrated in a handful of conservative states.
Florida carried out 19 executions in 2025, roughly 40% of the total. The next three states — Alabama, South Carolina and Texas — conducted five executions each.
“If you took Florida out of the equation, we would have a total for executions this year that would not look very different from other years,” Maher said.
Where death sentences are handed down in Alabama

Alabama put Demetrius Frazier to death in February, James Osgood in April, Gregory Hunt in June, Geoffrey West in September and Anthony Boyd in October. Those were in addition to the six executions that the state carried out 2024, when it led the nation in executions.
Of the people who were executed during the year, more than 83% had some type of documented vulnerability. Twenty-eight had a serious mental illness while 26 had an intellectual disability. Twenty-nine experienced significant childhood traumas. A total of at least 40 prisoners executed this year had one or more of those factors.
The country also executed an unusually high number of veterans, 10, for the year, with Florida executing seven of them.
“In many of these cases, jurors did not hear meaningful evidence about how the defendants’ military service had affected them,” the report states. Several were executed for crimes they committed while younger than 21 years old.
The organization warned that some of the figures in the report are preliminary because, even with days left in the year, one sentence hearing and three executions remain pending before the end of 2025.
As the number of executions spiked, legislatures throughout the country were intensifying efforts to expand the application of capital punishment.
Idaho enacted into law a bill that made aggravated lewd conduct with a minor child age 12 or younger eligible for the death penalty.
In Alabama, Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, prefiled a bill to make it a capital offense if a person commits murder while “the defendant knowingly creates a great risk to multiple persons.”
Nationwide, support for the death penalty remains far below its peak in the 1990s. In October, a poll published by Gallup indicated that 52% supported the death penalty. That figure is lower than the 80% of people who approved the death penalty in 1994, the peak of support for capital punishment. In parallel, those who oppose capital punishment continue to increase, from 16% in the 1990s to about 40% in recent years.
New death sentences continue to decline from its peak as well, going from 315 at its peak in 1996 to 22 this year, and imposed in a handful of counties throughout the country. More than half of juries in capital cases (56%) opted to recommend life in prison instead of the death penalty.
“It does suggest to me that they are out of touch with the way that the American public feels about the death penalty,” Maher said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/death-chamber.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536
,California,2025-12-18 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s $18 billion budget gap has roots in pandemic aid ending,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/newsom-deficit-budget-local-schools/,"During the pandemic, federal money flooded into state and local coffers. Once that funding ended, government spending didn't adjust downward.","When Gov. Gavin Newsom unveils his first draft of the state’s 2026-27 budget next month, he’ll reveal whether he intends to deal squarely with its chronic, multi-billion-dollar deficit or punt the shortfall to his successor.
Legislative Analyst Gabe Petek, the Legislature’s independent fiscal advisor, estimates the state faces an $18 billion gap between projected spending and likely revenues next year and, if left unaddressed, the deficit will grow to $35 billion a year.
Meanwhile, Petek says, the state has rung up $21.6 billion in off-the-books debt to cover deficits in recent fiscal years.
Petek and others have warned about the possibility of a serious recession afflicting the national economy which would exacerbate the budget’s imbalance and strain California’s emergency reserves, which have already been tapped to cover shortfalls.
Even without a recession, California’s economy is, in Petek’s words, “sluggish.” Jobs are shrinking, and at 5.6% of the labor force, California’s unemployment rate remains the highest of any state.
The recent history of papering over deficits with gimmicks and borrowed money is not an encouraging signal of a forthright approach. However, perhaps Newsom will opt to balance California’s books before embarking on a near-certain presidential campaign.
Unfortunately, the state is not alone in being plagued by yawning gaps between income and outgo. Throughout California, school districts, cities, counties and other units of local government are facing deficits rooted in the same dynamics that led to red ink in state finances — immense injections of federal relief funds during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s been estimated that the feds pumped as much as $600 billion into California through state and local governments to counteract the pandemic’s economic impacts, not counting many other billions that businesses and individuals received directly.
The federal aid gave officials cash to spend with few safeguards and fueled a short-lived jolt of taxes, particularly income taxes.
The Newsom administration interpreted the windfall as a permanent increase in revenue that led the governor to declare, in 2022, a $97.5 billion surplus. He and the Legislature immediately ramped up spending. But the surplus never materialized, and eventually the administration acknowledged that it had over-estimated revenues by $165 billion four years.
By then, however, the additional spending, especially for an expansion of medical care, was lodged in state law, and the state was left with what is termed a “structural deficit” in the $20 billion range.
Meanwhile, local governments and school districts were using their pandemic aid to satisfy the demands by employee unions for salary increases, which often could not be covered once the federal aid vanished. Inflation in living costs ratcheted up union salary demands even further.
A new report by the Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance Team, which monitors California school district finances, examined the chronically troubled Sacramento City Unified School District and described how federal aid led to its financial quicksand.
The report catalogued the district’s history of overspending revenues and said, “This (federal) funding masked the district’s existing structural deficit, delaying the necessary actions to be taken to address it.”
Even after the federal aid stopped, the district continued to sign union contracts calling for raises that it could not afford. And it failed to implement the cost-saving steps it had pledged to balance its budget, the analysis found.
The budget problems in other school districts — Oakland Unified is a notorious example — and in local governments such as the City of Los Angeles have a similar ring. School trustees and city council members, elected with union support, squandered federal aid. Then they approved unsustainable contracts and blamed the resulting deficits on insufficient revenue.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)In the next few weeks, the public will get their first look at a critical document two and a half years in the making that will define how the Colorado River is managed for the next decade.
The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – is on track to release a draft environmental review by early January with a range of options to replace the river’s operating rules, which are set to expire at the end of 2026.
Several elements of the draft were shared during the annual Colorado River Water Users Association’s conference in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace Wednesday.
Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules will be required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.
Interior Department Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, Andrea Travnicek, said the agency is committed to meeting the self-imposed January deadline in order to finalize new rules before the current ones expire.
“The Department of the Interior recognizes a shrinking timeline is in front of us in order to operate under a new potential agreement,” Travnicek said.
In an unusual move, federal water officials said the draft will not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer, which is typically included in environmental reviews. 
“We will not be identifying a preferred alternative, but we anticipate the identification of that between the draft and the final,” said Bureau of Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, Carly Jerla.
Instead, the draft environmental review will list a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply. 
“We want to continue to facilitate, but not dictate these operations. The goal here is to inform decision makers and encourage parties to adopt agreements that put consultation and negotiation first,” Jerla continued.
Lower Basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — have been at an impasse for months over how to manage the Colorado River’s shrinking water supplies.
Last month, the states missed a federally-imposed deadline to submit a preliminary seven-state consensus plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines after days of intense closed-door negotiations.
States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer  with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
The Bureau of Reclamation’s Acting Commissioner Scott Cameron said he and other federal officials have intensified efforts to bring states to a consensus, flying out West every other week since early April to meet with the seven states’ river negotiators.
“There are a number of issues from decades past that some people are having some difficulty getting past,” Cameron said, adding that states must “be willing to set aside previous perceived inequities and unfairness.”
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.
Despite states missing past deadlines, Cameron said he was “cautiously optimistic” states will reach a consensus deal by the February deadline.
“It’s not unusual in the negotiating process that tougher decisions get made the closer you get to the deadline. And frankly, there are tough decisions that have to be made,” Cameron said.
On Tuesday, California’s biggest water districts said they were willing to “set aside many of their legal positions” in order to reach a seven-state agreement.
The Bureau of Reclamation provided a broad overview of the components that will be included in draft’s range of options, including guidelines to reduce water deliveries from Lake Mead during shortages, coordinated reservoir operations for Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and storage and delivery mechanisms for conserved water.
Jerla, Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, said the draft alternatives will include some components previously proposed by states.
She said the agency has adopted a number of temporary operational agreements since 2008 to address changing conditions on the river. Those agreements have served as test runs for a long term agreement and emphasized the need for more flexibility when managing the river from year-to-year.
“We want to preserve ourselves the flexibility to come back to the table, to do reviews, to make consensus adjustments if needed,” Jerla said.
That flexibility to operations will likely be needed again this year due to a less-than-average upcoming snow season, that combined with a dry spring or early summer in 2026, could create conditions for another low runoff year.
“We’re monitoring the forecast, and we’re seeing not a great start to water year 2026. It’s still early in the year, but the way things are setting up it isn’t looking good,” Jerla said.
The two biggest reservoirs in the country, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are currently at a fraction of their full capacity. Lake Mead is at 32% capacity, while Lake Powell is at 28%. 
Additionally, water inflow into the reservoirs in 2026 are projected to most likely be 75% of the average, according to the federal agency. The minimum probable inflow forecast for 2026 is 44% of average, indicating a potentially very dry year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC08945-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

Phaneuf and Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/18/lamont-aid-food-pantries-planned-parenthood/,"Lamont announces $168 million to offset federal cuts to nutrition assistance, reproductive health services and health insurance.","Gov. Ned Lamont announced more than $41 million Thursday to aid residents losing nutrition assistance and offset vanishing federal funding for reproductive health services.
The governor also expanded his own recent commitments to fight homelessness and provide relief for thousands losing federal assistance for health insurance.
“It is a shame that the federal government is cutting back on these services that provide a safety net for those who are most in need and which ultimately support the health and safety of our entire country,” Lamont said. “These are services that must continue to be supported, and here in Connecticut we will stand behind them.”
The Democratic governor now has committed nearly $168 million from a special $500 million reserve the General Assembly established last month to blunt the worst of federal human service cutbacks ordered in July by President Trump and Congress.
Lamont notified the legislature’s six highest-ranking leaders of his proposals by letter early Thursday. The Democratic-controlled panel, which has authority to block the initiatives but cannot modify them, is expected to endorse the full plan.
A big investment in Connecticut’s food banks and pantries
One of Lamont’s largest proposals would allocate $24.6 million over the next 18 months for food pantries — which provide free and discounted groceries to low-income households, and the food bank services that help stock these facilities.
Legislators, advocates for nutrition assistance and others have pressed the governor particularly to aid about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness at risk of losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits between Dec. 1 and March 31 because of new work requirements and other changes Congress ordered in July.
Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of Foodshare, said his organization will use the funds to help more people access food, but pantries won’t be able to offset all lost SNAP benefits.
“Additional appropriations are always appreciated,” he said. “That amount, over 18 months, will help. It’s definitely not going to solve the problem created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
 “SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in this country, period. We’re intended to be a supplement,” he added. “There is not enough food at our food bank, or every food bank in the country put together, to make up for the number of meals that SNAP provides.”
With as many as 36,000 residents having lost or at risk of losing SNAP benefits in the coming months, “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that lines at our mobile trucks and our local pantries are going to increase,” Jakubowski added. “By how much? I don’t know, but they’re definitely going to increase.”
To further help households in need find local nutrition assistance, Lamont also committed $4.7 million from the reserve to the state’s 2-1-1 information line service and to the network of regional, nonprofit community action agencies, which steer hundreds of thousands in need toward a wide array of social services.
“This is a really positive start on how to better support those families,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way in Connecticut, which runs the 2-1-1 service and operates a major food bank serving pantries in southeastern Connecticut.
The 2-1-1 service, which hasn’t received a funding increase for its main referral program in 15 years, has seen inquiries surge dramatically since the federal government shutdown in October and early November stalled federal funding for SNAP and other programs.
Though the state shares a portion of SNAP’s administrative costs, benefits are funded entirely by the federal government.
But the United Way, New Haven Legal Assistance and 15 other nonprofits, labor and business organizations and policy groups recently urged state officials to create a state-funded nutrition assistance benefit for those displaced by last summer’s congressional changes.
“What we really need is to give people a choice in what they’re eating and what they’re going to be spending money on so they can feed their families in the way they need to,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance.
“Having your own ability to pay for food, which you get when you have food stamps — that autonomy is key for people. We need to have a state-funded food assistance program so people can make those choices for themselves.”
The governor’s plan also includes $1.5 million for the state Department of Social Services to help residents comply with work requirements and other new eligibility rules and thereby preserve their SNAP benefits.
More funding to fight homelessness, blunt premium hikes
Lamont also stepped up his own recent proposals to assist households facing steep hikes in health insurance costs and individuals and families facing homelessness.
The governor last week proposed $70 million to assist tens of thousands of households that are losing the enhanced federal tax credits and subsidies that help them purchase health insurance on the state’s exchange.
Lamont now wants to invest almost $120 million through June 2027.
That includes $50.8 million to replace lost subsidies and another $64.1 million to temper expiring tax credits and to reimburse some carriers facing increased claims for healthcare services.
The governor also would channel $5 million to Connecticut’s federally qualified health centers to reflect increased demand for services there, particularly from patients with incomes less than 100% of the Federal Poverty Level. For a family of four, the current FPL is less than $32,150 annually.
Lamont also wants to upgrade a plan he announced just three days ago to commit $5.2 million to counter shrinking federal support for programs to combat homelessness.
But the plan the governor sent Thursday to legislative leaders would instead dedicate $6.9 million for grants to organizations fighting homelessness and to maintain previously federally funded vouchers for supportive housing.
Aid for Planned Parenthood could spark partisan debate
A final element of the governor’s proposal likely will spark objections from some Republicans in the Democratic-controlled General Assembly.
The governor would send $10.4 million to Planned Parenthood of Southern New England to offset shrinking federal reimbursements and family grants frozen by the Trump administration.
These and other proposals in the $168 million in funding commitments Lamont recommended would be drawn from $500 million — one-fifth of last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus — that state legislators set aside during last month’s special session.
Most of that surplus is being used to shrink Connecticut’s hefty pension debt and to build reserves, two efforts that generally enjoy bipartisan support.
But when the $500 million reserve was established, many minority Republicans argued Connecticut shouldn’t spend local dollars to temper or reverse ongoing federal cutbacks.
Many Republicans here also have objected over the years to sending state dollars to Planned Parenthood, arguing Connecticut shouldn’t invest public dollars in an organization that provides abortion services.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_047-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

(Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A board overseeing a program allowing taxpayers to make donations to support rural hospitals Wednesday discussed how two third-party entities would fit into the program. 
In addition to 50 rural hospitals that donors can direct donations to, the Alabama Health Research and Education Foundation (AlaHA) and the Alabama Rural Hospital Foundation are also eligible to receive donations. 
Rob Pearson, chair of the board, said in an interview after the Wednesday meeting that the third parties must direct those donations to eligible rural hospitals.

“They’ll have to report the money they received and how much they sent each hospital, so there’ll be some accountability for that,” Pearson said. 
Pearson said the legislation creating the program allowed the Alabama Rural Hospital Foundation will have its own allocation system. AlaHA must distribute its donations using a need-based tiered system. 
The board approved that system for other undesignated donations earlier this month.
Cameran Clark, a board member representing the Alabama Department of Revenue, said a donor can choose any eligible hospital or a third party.
“They’d still be listed, but they would not be able to be selected,” Clark said of hospitals once they receive the maximum donations.
Starting in January, Alabama taxpayers will be able to make donations to help rural hospitals, which officials say are the backbone of the state’s health care system.
The Rural Hospital Investment Program Board was created through legislation that passed this spring. It created a dollar-for-dollar tax incentive program for individuals and businesses that donate to rural hospitals. It has an annual statewide cap of $20 million for 2026, $25 million for 2027 and $30 million for 2028 and beyond. It requires a 10% match from local communities.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
Many of Alabama’s existing hospitals are struggling. The state’s hospitals have long pushed for Medicaid expansion, saying it would provide needed funding to keep doors open. 
While Alabama Republican House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
Board members and hospital officials have said the program will help, but would not save a hospital in danger of closing.
Pearson, who lives in west Alabama, said that investing in rural hospitals will improve the quality of life of the communities the hospitals are in.
“Rural health care is on the front lines of quality of life. Quality life means workforce availability, and it impacts your workforce participation,” Pearson said. “It’ll show up in the workforce participation rates and in the total economics of the state, and in longevity in health benefits.”
The program is one of two additional funding sources for rural hospitals in the state. Alabama’s rural hospitals will also be receiving funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. 
According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Gov. Kay Ivey announced in November that the state submitted its application for the federal program and expected to hear back by the end of the year. A message seeking comment from Ivey’s office was left Wednesday afternoon.
Pearson said the two programs will serve different purposes for rural hospitals in the state. Where the state program will help hospitals offset operation costs to keep them open, the federal program aims to make rural hospitals a more sustainable model.
“By the end of January, these hospitals are gonna have cash in their hand,” Pearson said. “That’s exciting for every rural hospital in Alabama.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.
The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect … Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”
That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.
Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”
“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.
The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”
More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”
The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As the Michigan House Judiciary Committee debated overturning the state’s red flag law, gun rights advocates aired their grievances with the law and how they considered it to violate constitutional rights. 
The main point that proponents of the three-bill package made was that the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, passed in 2023, specifically provisions for ex parte orders that are able to be issued if there is clear and convincing evidence that a person will harm themselves or others with a gun, insisting it violates due process rights by removing the gun without a prior hearing. 
The legislation, introduced by Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton), has a near-zero chance of passage through the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate, much less past Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Regardless, DeSana said his intent in bringing the bills forward went beyond adherence to the Second Amendment.
“Another constitutionally protected right is the right to due process, and I cannot think of any more important right than the right to your day in court and the right to face your accuser and the right to tell your story, which has been denied our gun owners in the state of Michigan,” DeSana said.

Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi), who had chaired the House Judiciary Committee during the passage of the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, repeatedly pushed back against DeSana and others testifying in favor of the bill. She argued that, because of the option to have an appeal hearing on an Extreme Risk Protection Order, due process was not being violated and people were being given their day in court. 
Representatives from multiple gun-rights organizations, including the National Rifle Association, testified in favor of repealing the red flag law, with Tom Lambert of Michigan Open Carry saying the law was an overreach in its ability to temporarily take away a person’s guns. 
“Contrary to the claim of its proponents, this law has not made us safer, but what it has done is allowed for countless legally owned firearms to be confiscated from otherwise law-abiding citizens without due process,” said Brenden Boudreau, the executive director of Great Lakes Gun Rights. “Red flag laws are a failure. They’re an abomination to the rights we have as citizens of this constitutional republic.”
However, two of those testifying advocated for the continued need for a red flag law and the usefulness of Michigan’s current statute. 
“The state of Michigan, and the country, for that matter, is in a mental health crisis,” Aaron Huguhey, a deputy chief with the Southfield Police Department said. “And so the passing of the ERPO law has been an effective tool for law enforcement agencies such as the Southfield Police Department to effectively remove firearms in those situations.”
He added that Southfield had seen 10 cases between 2024 and 2025 in which the Extreme Risk Protection Orders were issued. 
Nearly 300 gun confiscation orders were granted in Michigan’s first year of “red flag” laws

Kelly Dillaha, the Director of Red, Wine and Blue and a member of End Gun Violence Michigan, said families in Michigan can use the law to help prevent a crisis from turning into a tragedy. 
“Law enforcement is using the tool responsibly and effectively, as we just heard, and we are all safer because of it,” Dillaha said.
The debate came just days after a deadly shooting at Brown University in Rhode Island, and Rep. Helena Scott (D-Detroit) suggested that a repeal of this law would be “a proverbial slap in the face” to those who had lost loved ones in similar tragedies in Michigan, including mass shootings at Oxford High School and Michigan State University. 
“Incredibly, gun extremists have decided to attempt to weaken our gun laws just days after the school shooting at Brown University. School shootings are now so common that at least three Brown students had survived a previous school shooting, including MSU,” End Gun Violence Michigan said in a statement after the hearing, adding that repealing this law would cause more murders and suicides in the state.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/flag-gun.jpg,,,2025-12-18 07:59:04.490415

Vermont's experience integrating 650 allies who risked their lives for America contradicts harmful rhetoric painting them as security risks and economic drains
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Molly Gray: What Washington gets wrong about Afghan refugees.","This commentary is by Molly Gray. She has served as the Executive Director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance since April 2023. Previously, she served as Lt. Governor of Vermont from 2021 to 2023.



I was a senior in high school when 9/11 happened in 2001. I will never forget where I was or how the day unfolded. I wasn’t yet 18, but my entire adult life would be shaped by that event. Soon after, the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, and then Iraq. U.S. involvement in Afghanistan would last 21 years, and at one point Vermont would have the highest per-capita population of servicemembers serving in Afghanistan and Iraq in the nation. 
Yet as harmful rhetoric from Washington portrays Afghan allies as security risks and economic burdens, Vermont’s experience tells a strikingly different story. Over the past three years, some 650 Afghan allies who risked their lives supporting U.S. missions have settled across our state, filling critical workforce gaps, revitalizing rural communities and contributing far more in taxes than they’ve received in resettlement support.
Over the last three years as the Executive Director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, I’ve met countless veterans, former aid workers, lawyers, contractors and others who worked in Afghanistan. U.S. efforts focused on everything from counterterrorism and the rule of law to education and agriculture.
During the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, the U.S. evacuated an estimated 125,000 Afghan allies. That was only a fraction of those who had worked with the U.S. government over two decades. An estimated 145,000 Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) were left behind, along with countless wives and children. Many men evacuated in 2021 were told to leave their families behind with the promise of reunification within a year, yet separation continues. 
The Vermont Afghan Alliance began in 2022 as a scrappy, GoFundMe-funded, volunteer-led effort to help newly arriving Afghans learn to drive and obtain a license. In Vermont, we all know that without a car, employment options shrink quickly. Today, Afghan allies live in more than a dozen towns—from St. Albans to Bennington and Rutland to Hartford—well beyond traditional resettlement hubs like Burlington. 
In 2023, I joined the Alliance as an “interim” executive director to help grow and professionalize the organization. While I never worked in Afghanistan, I spent much of my twenties with the International Committee of the Red Cross, promoting U.S. compliance with the Geneva Conventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and at Guantánamo. My brother served in Iraq, and like so many of my generation, my adult life has been shaped by the so-called “Global War on Terror.”
I felt a deep responsibility to a community that had risked so much in support of U.S. missions abroad. I also felt a strong sense of Vermont’s hospitality—that if you welcome someone into your home, at a minimum you provide food, shelter and safety. Finally, as someone long concerned about our demographics, the truth is simple: we are not going to birth our way out of our workforce crisis. The solution lies in welcoming people—and their talents—from across the country and the world.
Since 2023, the Alliance, together with community partners, has welcomed and served Afghan allies statewide with employment, driving lessons, housing assistance, immigration legal services, civic education, health programming and more. We’ve partnered with dozens of employers across northern Vermont eager to hire Afghan allies and willing to make small workplace adjustments. Through our driving program alone, more than 60 individuals have passed the Vermont road test. From manufacturing to healthcare, education to commercial truck driving, Afghan allies are filling high-demand jobs, strengthening our rural economy and enriching our communities.
A recent USCRI policy report found that Afghan allies nationwide have contributed an estimated $1.79 billion in local, state and federal taxes, including contributions to Medicare and Social Security. Contrary to harmful rhetoric, Afghan allies are not a “drain” on the system. Their contributions far outweigh the short-term support provided during resettlement.
A damaging narrative suggesting Afghan allies are “unvetted” or pose a security risk to this country is circulating from Washington. In reality, those fleeing the Taliban are among the most thoroughly vetted individuals in this country—they were screened during employment with the U.S. government, during immigration processing and again with every status adjustment.
Afghan allies are our neighbors, friends and colleagues. At the Alliance, the majority of staff and board members are Afghan allies themselves—thoughtful, courageous, emerging leaders raised in an Afghanistan backed by the U.S. They understand, as deeply as we do, the hope and possibility that come with a free and democratic society. I’ve been inspired daily by what these young leaders have achieved for Vermont and the talents they’ve already contributed to our state. 
As I prepare to transition from the Alliance and pass the torch to new leadership, I’m struck by what Vermont has accomplished. We’ve shown what’s possible when communities pool resources and talents around a common purpose. The infrastructure we’ve built – from volunteer networks to employer partnerships – proves that welcoming refugees isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s an investment in our state’s future. The path forward is clear: continue expanding housing solutions, strengthening workforce connections, and ensuring every Vermont community has the tools to welcome new neighbors. The work ahead is significant, but so is Vermont’s capacity to lead by example.

Ron DeSantis’s eighth and final legislative budget makes another run at redirecting cancer funding in Florida, including jettisoning a requirement that funds be awarded only to peer-reviewed projects and empowering an eight-member “collaborative” to direct how the state spends hundreds of millions of dollars on cancer care and research.
The push by the governor is likely to spark another largely behind-the-scenes battle among those who rely on the state money to help with their research programs.
Specifically, DeSantis’s proposed budget eliminates a decade-old law that spells out how $127 million should be distributed to four National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated facilities: Moffitt Cancer Center; University of Florida Health Cancer Center; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center; University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Instead, the governor’s budget would empower the Cancer Connect Collaborative to distribute the money to all cancer providers, with a requirement that at least 60% continues to be spent on the four NCI facilities. NCI is the federal government’s principal agency for cancer research and training. There are 72 NCI-designated facilities nationwide.
The collaborative, established in law in 2024, is a group of eight people — three appointed by the governor, two by the Senate president, and two by the speaker of the House.
Lobbyists representing the four NCI facilities did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment on the proposal. But representatives of the four facilities testified against a similar plan in a House Health Care Budget Subcommittee earlier this year.
John Cleveland, Moffitt’s executive vice president, director, and scientific officer, told members of the House House Health Care Budget Subcommittee in February that NCI facilities have recruited 980 premier investigators since the Legislature created the program in 2014 and has helped changed cancer care in Florida.
“Florida used to be a state where you flew to New York City or Boston to get your (cancer) care. No longer,” Cleveland said. “So, now they actually want to stay in the state. And I think that’s super important — we have to support our citizens. Having them get on a plane to get their care up in other states is just ridiculous.”

Florida has the second highest cancer burden in the nation. Between 2021 and 2023, the total number of cancer deaths in Florida was 140,955, according to the Florida Department of Health (DOH).
Former Gov. Rick Scott championed the NCI program, which was passed by the Legislature in 2014. Lawmakers pumped an additional $37million into the program in 2022 and renamed it the Casey DeSantis Research Funds.
 Cancer innovation and incubator funds

The DeSantis administration first tried to steer funding away from NCI facilities to additional providers during the 2024 session and again in 2025.
The DOH issued a long-range report in 2024 noting that restricting the funding to NCI facilities “limits funding accessibility for other cancer facilities and research institutions across Florida, including those in rural or underserved areas.”
Another legislative tussle in the works over Florida cancer research funding

Although the Legislature refused to go along with the changes, lawmakers did agree to create and fund two new cancer grant programs: the Cancer Innovation Fund in 2024 and the Cancer Incubator in 2025.
There is $60 million available in Cancer Innovation Fund and $30 million in the Cancer Incubator program, which is directed toward research at children’s specialty hospitals
The cancer collaborative oversees both grant programs and is charged with making recommendations to the DOH, which awards the grants.
DeSantis awards $30 million in cancer research funds to four pediatric hospitals

The governor announced in November that four pediatric hospitals were each receiving $7.5 million grants: Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami; John’s Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in Tampa; Wolfson Children’s Hospital in Jacksonville; and Nemours Children’s Hospital in Orlando.
Statutes require that proposals for both the Innovation Fund and the Cancer Incubator program are “appropriate and are evaluated fairly on the basis of scientific merit.” To that end, the law requires the DOH to appoint peer review panels of independent, scientifically qualified individuals to review and score the merit of each proposal.
DeSantis’s proposed budget eliminates the requirement that grants for either fund be peer reviewed.

Barbershop owners say colleague had taken steps to work legally in the U.S. and his partner is due to give birth any day.
The post Cheyenne couple seeks support for family after barber taken into ICE custody appeared first on WyoFile .","Carlos Montes was driving with his family on South Greeley Highway on Nov. 26 when a Laramie County Sheriff’s deputy pulled him over for what first appeared like a routine traffic stop. 
Instead, the deputy took Montes into custody as his pregnant partner and 5-year-old son watched helplessly, his friends say.
For three weeks, his family and friends were desperate to find answers, including where the expectant father was being held. They say they were met with silence, conflicting reports and overall confusion when dealing with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Montes is a barber at Drew’s Barbershop in Cheyenne, according to husband and wife shop owners Drew Weston and Andrea Shipley. The couple is leading the effort to help his family navigate an increasingly difficult situation. 
They maintain he was wrongly detained by immigration officials despite trying to methodically follow the process to work legally in the U.S. Once he was taken by ICE, his friends and family describe how a distressing process left them in the dark about his whereabouts and well-being while putting up barriers to even simple steps like sending money to him to pay for phone calls. 
Originally from Nicaragua, Montes and his partner had been living in Cheyenne since 2023, Shipley said. (His partner did not want to comment for this story.) As a licensed barber, he started working at Drew’s Barbershop in April of this year and had already gone through the proper immigration and licensing process, she said. 
“Carlos has a naturalization number, and all of those things were approved through the state of Wyoming with the Attorney General’s office,” she said. “He’s worked at four different shops in town; he’s well known.”
After Montes disappeared into ICE custody last month, the couple encountered an immigration process that has been confusing and hard to navigate, Shipley said. “Communication can be really difficult.” 
“If you are not an attorney, it can be really difficult for families to talk to ICE.” Attorney Elisabeth Trefonas
That’s left the couple trying to piece together what happened to the barber. Weston theorized that some piece of paperwork might have been lost or missed in the long process. There’s also a chance that Montes entered the United States when migrants from Nicaragua were offered temporary protected status. The Trump administration terminated that status for Nicaraguans in September.
“I know that he has done so much paperwork to even be here and get his license, that he’s a guy who will do what he needs to do the legal way,” Weston said, “so for this to pop up and then to be treated like this, oh my God.”
After numerous requests for comment, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to Oil City News on Dec. 9 with an email stating: “Carlos Fausto Montes Calderon is an illegal alien from Nicaragua. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge June 6, 2024. He was arrested by ICE Denver Nov. 26, 2025 and removed to Nicaragua on Dec. 4.” 
That was information Montes’ distraught family and friends said they were unable to get from ICE. Then on Monday, after weeks of silence, the family finally heard from Montes. He had been deported back to Nicaragua and was able to connect with family there. 
“If you are not an attorney, it can be really difficult for families to talk to ICE,” said Jackson-based immigration attorney Elisabeth Trefonas.
Although Trefonas isn’t representing Montes, she told Oil City News that his circumstances are familiar. It’s also not uncommon for people to have removal orders filed even though they believe their immigration papers are in order, she said.  
The arrest
Montes was with his partner and child in the car when a sheriff’s deputy stopped the family, according to Shipley. 
“She is going to have a baby any day,” Shipley said. “It’s heartbreaking what is happening.”
At first, the barbershop owners believed Montes had been sent to the ICE holding facility in Aurora, Colorado. But dozens of attempts to reach him were futile, they said.
Oil City News attempted multiple times to reach the privately-run Aurora Detention Center through its published number, which rang but was not answered.
Weston said a family member got through to the facility, but was unable to talk to Montes, even after putting money on his account for phone calls. Families of detainees have described the need to pay for phone calls and FaceTime to communicate with detainees.
In an attempt to see Montes, a family member traveled to the Colorado facility on Dec. 2 for a visitation, but was told that he may have already been deported. Two days later, a family member was able to reach Montes and confirm that he was still in the United States but had been sent to an ICE facility in a different state. On Dec. 5, the family used an online ICE locator tool that showed he was being held in CoreCivic’s Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi. Montes’ information was later missing from the locator tool when the family and Oil City News tried again. Four days after the locator tool indicated he was in Mississippi, ICE responded to Oil City News with the email saying Montes had already been deported on Dec. 4.
According to Shipley, Montes had told a family member that he had “signed some paperwork,” but wasn’t sure about the document’s meaning.
A spokesperson for Gov. Mark Gordon’s office said a representative had been in contact with the family, but was not directly involved and could only offer advice. 
The Laramie County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that their deputies made the initial traffic stop that night for an inoperable headlight. “ICE authorized deputies to take Montes into custody,” a spokesperson said.
Montes has been stopped by law enforcement before. Last fall, he was pulled over three times and issued citations for traffic violations, court documents show. Most of the citations were for improper registration, not having a valid driver’s license and not possessing insurance. Otherwise, Oil City News did not locate a criminal history for Montes.
Trefonas, the Jackson-based attorney, cautioned that it’s risky for people to be driving if they have uncertainty about their immigration status, “but I’ve also had U.S. citizens wrongfully detained as well with mistaken identities, particularly with common last names.” 
After being swiftly transported to a facility, she described, it’s possible the detainee either didn’t have a phone number memorized or didn’t have an opportunity to call anyone. “And then they’re moved or removed from the country before there was any time to talk with them about it.” 
Montes does not have an immigration attorney, according to Shipley. Immigration attorneys interviewed by WyoFile recently said the confusing process of detaining, moving and eventually possibly deporting migrants to different countries has become typical as the Trump administration increases its deportation efforts.
“We’re seeing people moved around so much they lose track of what day it is … they don’t know time and place,” Laura Lunn, of the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, told WyoFile. “People [end up] detained in Aurora, Colorado, and don’t know there’s a giant mountain range outside their front door.”
Shipley and Weston have been posting updates on the Drew’s Barbershop Facebook page, trying to rally community support for Montes, and established a GoFundMe fundraiser to offer financial help for his family, and to possibly hire an attorney. Shipley said they are determined to help bring him back to Cheyenne to be with his family.
Aside from the personal cost, the couple said the aggressive crackdowns have taken a toll on small businesses, including theirs.
“It’s not about the money, it’s about the humanity,” Shipley added. “We’re taking a big hit and other small businesses affected by this are taking huge hits too, but the fact is the people in the barbershop are losing a colleague, they’re losing a trusted friend and part of the culture of the barbershop, a community watering hole where people are supposed to be safe.”
While Montes is now in Nicaragua, his pregnant partner, son, and job remain in Cheyenne.

(Photo by Getty Images)With high grocery prices continuing to squeeze Minnesotans, a newly unsealed antitrust complaint provides a path towards relief. 
The complaint is a revealing look at the way big retailers can wield their power over food manufacturers to drive up prices — while crushing competitors. The lawsuit also underscores that if Minnesota legislators are going to effectively address sticker shock at the grocery store, they must address the consolidation that has a stranglehold over the industry.
A judge recently ordered that an antitrust complaint against PepsiCo that was brought by the Federal Trade Commission under the Biden administration, but dropped earlier this year by the Trump Administration, be unsealed and made available to the public. 
The complaint provides a unique look at price discrimination in practice, which involves charging retailers different prices for the same good, often at the behest of powerful retailers. That practice is a violation of an antitrust law known as the Robinson-Patman Act.
For the past decade, according to the unsealed complaint, Walmart has used its immense power to demand promotional payments and allowances from Pepsi that have kept prices of soft drinks lower than other retailers. Walmart has also used Pepsi to help it monitor prices of soft drinks at competing retailers. When the gap between Walmart and others is too low, Pepsi limits allowances and raises wholesale prices for those companies. “Rather than simply working with Walmart to reduce prices, Pepsi’s actions have had the effect of raising prices for customers of competing retailers,” the complaint says.  
While Pepsi revealed to investors it could not risk angering Walmart, they did benefit from preferential promotion and in-store placement. 
“Walmart’s promise is: Keep us the king of our domain and we’ll make you the king of yours,” wrote Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self Reliance, the organization — with a strong Minnesota presence — that sued to unseal the FTC’s complaint. 
While the FTC lawsuit targeted soft drinks, this is just a glimpse at a more pervasive practice. 
A small food cooperative in New London told legislators this year about the disparity in wholesale prices they face. 
Meanwhile, a study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta last month found market consolidation has driven food inflation higher.
From the 1950s until the early 80s (a time of aggressive Robinson-Patman Act  enforcement) independent grocery stores captured over half of America’s grocery dollar. 
Today, the four largest grocery chains capture over half of America’s grocery dollar while the market share of independents has dropped to 22%. Walmart alone commands a fifth of the grocery market nationally, 19%  in the Twin Cities, and over half of the market in some parts of rural Minnesota. Meanwhile, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1.6 million Minnesotans have low retail access and 16%  of the state’s census tracts are food deserts. This transformation of the grocery industry over the past four decades follows a decision by presidents of both parties to let the law collect dust.
While Minnesota cannot revive enforcement of the Robinson-Patman Act, it can create its own standards. 
The bipartisan Consumer Grocery Price Fairness Act would do just that. 
The legislation would give Minnesota clearer and stronger tools for policing price discrimination in the grocery industry. Building off the principles of the Robinson-Patman Act, the law would require suppliers to offer goods to retailers on equivalent terms and prohibit retailers from extracting unfair concessions from suppliers.
The legislation also addresses key loopholes in the Robinson-Patman Act. This includes the ability of suppliers to engage in price discrimination if retailers are in different “channels” such as giving a preferential price to a dollar store chain compared to a traditional grocery store. The legislation would also ban the kind of access discrimination experienced during the pandemic, i.e., Walmart threatening to fine suppliers that did not give them preferential access to goods.
The Robinson-Patman Act was passed in 1936 when Minnesota stood at the forefront of a nationwide movement to address the harms of chain stores. 
Gov. Floyd B. Olson of the Farmer-Labor Party secured passage of a tax on chains. 
His predecessor, Republican Gov. Theodore Christianson, advocated for a national version of the tax. “Selling the goods is far more important than manufacturing them,” Christianson told Congress in 1940. While the taxes Olson and Christianson fought for were eventually tossed out by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Robinson-Patman Act became the enduring legacy of that movement.

New abortion data backs our longstanding argument: that legal doesn’t mean accessible.
State data reported in The Missouri Independent, and subsequently backed up by a national report released last week by the Society of Family Planning (SFP), shows the $31.5 million investment last year to help pass the abortion-rights constitutional amendment yielded, according to the state health agency, fewer than 100 in-clinic abortions statewide this year — almost identical patient numbers in Missouri the year before Roe fell. 
SFP’s report is the first national state-by-state data drop that shows abortion numbers after November 2024, when Missouri and six other states voted to protect abortion rights. The chart is a stunning rebuke of campaign “strategy” and the $300 million invested nationwide. Access in states with newly amended constitutional protections, including in Missouri, which was the lone state in the abortion ballot cohort to claw back a total ban, saw almost no change in the number of people who could access an in-clinic abortion in their home state.
It might be why the well-funded anti-abortion right withheld money to fight ballot measures — spending money to keep things the same seems like a waste. In fact, the pro-abortion side outspent anti-abortion opposition eight to one nationwide in 2024. One should question such a lackluster response from the usually rabid anti-abortion zealots.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services counted 80 in-clinic abortions in the past year. That’s nearly $400,000 per abortion in Missouri. In capitalist terms, that’s an abysmal return on investment that should be a warning shot across the bow for funders and donors even thinking about further investments in policies that mimic the failed Roe v. Wade framework. 
Beyond the dollars and cents of it all, what did this cost us in human capital? I’m thinking about the countless supporters who spent their free time collecting signatures and knocking doors to sell the same false hope that turned them out to volunteer. Will they answer the call next time? Did this erode the hope we cling to when we all diligently participate in democracy year after year?
After all, the same legacy organizations and institutions who made big asks of supporters are the same ones choosing inaction after securing their limited victory. Planned Parenthood, the only abortion provider in the state, has kept abortion appointments largely unavailable and self-imposed a gestational limit well before the state’s cut off. 
More than 800 Missouri physicians who signed a letter in support of the reproductive freedom amendment last year are nowhere to be found providing abortion care while capacity is repeatedly cited as a challenge to expanding access.
The Missouri Abortion Fund is experiencing a decline in donations while footing the bill for out-of-state abortion care, which accounts for the majority of Missouri patients. Those lucky enough to get an appointment in-state still face an insurance ban leaders of last year’s campaign did not bother to challenge in their litigation strategy. What’s Next member, Right By You, took on parental involvement laws that effectively ban abortion for young people, expensive and time-consuming legal work that should never fall to already under resourced grassroots organizations.
One year later, the reality is abortion access looks much the same. It’s inaccessible. What’s worse is, as an early member of the campaign coalition, I know the focus was to turn out pro-choice Republicans to win limited abortion rights, ignoring the wider consequence of doing so. As a result, the hole in which we are trying to dig ourselves out of is deeper than ever.
Missouri’s anti-abortion supermajority grew, as these same majority “pro-choice” voters ushered in a second Trump presidency. 
What we must do next is openly analyze this with truth, transparency and accountability so it doesn’t repeat. Rote victory statements, in these dark times, are unproductive at best and threaten our collective fight for progress.
As an organizer, I’ve been trained never to engage the public without a call to action. Yet, these are the hardest times to come up with a clear ask when the problems we face are intricately weaved in a multitude of harms. 
So, I default to the basics. I call on allies to oppose efforts that uplift the Roe status quo. Insist on bodily autonomy. Resist the temptation to advocate in binary terms. It’s more than abortion. It’s about the freedom to parent, or not; birth your children with dignity and autonomy. 
The right to end a pregnancy on your own terms. And liberation to make these decisions without punishment. You can’t have your freedom and your fascists too.
Use your power — whether it’s your voice, your money, your time or your work — to demand, fund, and support solutions that end pregnancy punishment. 
On the cusp of a midterm election, be ready to see the same hollow promises and find the guts to challenge it with your vote and your voice. Let’s lock arms with one another and demand better from the leaders and institutions we fund and elect to represent our interests.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8060-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

He is shown in May when he announced a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The capital gains tax cut passed this year by Missouri lawmakers will cost far more than expected and shrink state revenues, a new state budget estimate shows.
The consensus revenue estimate, issued Wednesday, anticipates that revenue in the year ending June 30 will be $400 million below estimates made a year ago. Growth will return for fiscal 2027, the estimate predicts, but the rebound will be modest, state Budget Director Dan Haug said in an interview with The Independent.
“The governor has been pretty transparent and pretty vocal that this is going to be a difficult budget year,” Haug said.
Gov. Mike Kehoe is scheduled to deliver his budget proposals on Jan. 13.
When lawmakers voted on the bill exempting profits from the sale of stocks and other assets from Missouri income tax, the official estimate put the revenue loss at about $160 million in the current fiscal year, with ongoing revenue losses at $111 million.
The state is now expecting a revenue loss in the current fiscal year of about $500 million from the cut, with an ongoing revenue loss of $360 million annually, Haug said. 
That is close to the approximately $600 million estimate for the loss from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and reported by The Independent — and disputed by the state revenue department — weeks before the final vote in May.
During the most recent complete fiscal year, Missouri collected $13.4 billion in general revenue. 
Through Tuesday, tax receipts for the year have grown 3.5%, enough to generate about $350 million in unanticipated revenue if continued through June 30 The capital gains tax cut, and to a smaller degree state tax impacts of federal changes, will help push the trend line into negative territory, with a contraction of 2.1% and total revenue of $13.15 billion.
“What we expect to happen is that most of the reduction from capital gains will occur in that February to April period when people start filing their returns,” Haug said.
The state does have a cushion to absorb the loss of revenue. 
For several years, Missouri has enjoyed historically large reserves of surplus cash. The surplus peaked at nearly $8 billion in June 2023. Large sums have been set aside for improvements to Interstates 70 and 44, a major expansion of the Capitol Building and construction projects on college campuses and elsewhere.
The state employee pension fund received a one-time injection of $500 million and state employees have seen pay raises of as much as 35% since the start of 2021.
And lawmakers have been able to earmark hundreds of millions for pet projects and programs, despite vetoes by Kehoe and his predecessor, Gov. Mike Parson, that cut many of the expenditures.
For the past three years, appropriations for ongoing programs have exceeded current revenue, with the shortfall coming from the surplus.
“We’ve sort of gotten a little out of what on ongoing expenditures versus ongoing revenues,” Haug said. “We need to get that back under control.”
Kehoe has said he will make eliminating the state income tax, which accounts for about 65% of general revenue, his top goal for 2026. 
The budget will be “challenging,” Kehoe said In the news release reporting the new revenue estimate
“Spending, not revenues, is the problem facing state government,” Kehoe said.
Republican budget leaders from the House and Senate, quoted in the news release, echoed Kehoe. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Rusty Black of Chillicothe said he will “develop a fiscally responsible budget,” while House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton of Noel said his goal is to “deliver a sustainable budget.”
The top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, said the state has problems that require attention — and money — and the issue is insufficient revenue, not overspending.
Democrats warned that the capital gains cut was being low-balled but had no power to stop it, Fogle said. Being correct doesn’t help fund services, she said.
“What helps me is making sure that my constituents have a strong social safety net, have access to good public schools and have a state government that is more focused on making proper investments in the next generation and less focused on winning a primary election,” Fogle said.
Issues that require immediate attention, Fogle said, include the growing number of people languishing in jail while they wait for state mental health evaluations and treatment, which has doubled in two years to nearly 500, and federal program changes that increase state costs for Medicaid and other benefits.
Lawmakers must also deal with department budget requests that have identified more than $1 billion in new costs to continue current programs. 
“Very few people in the General Assembly have been at the table when we’ve had to make drastic cuts,” Fogle said. “It’s very important that we do so in a thoughtful way that protects the core vital services of our departments.”
It would be irresponsible to eliminate the income tax, Fogle said. 
“I cannot believe we are having a good faith conversation about the elimination of the income tax and blowing a $9 billion hole in our state budget,” Fogle said.
For the past three years, appropriations for ongoing programs have exceeded current revenue, with the shortfall coming from the surplus.
“We’ve sort of gotten a little out of what on ongoing expenditures versus ongoing revenues,” Haug said. “We need to get that back under control.”
The current budget, after Kehoe’s vetoes, projects spending $15.7 billion in general revenue, about $2.6 billion more than the new estimate anticipates in revenue. 
Fogle said she is worried that the state will cut optional services for Medicaid recipients or reduce funding for higher education and public schools to align expenses with receipts.
Kehoe will include some surplus funds in his budget proposal, Haug said. 
“One nice thing about the fund balance we do have is it does let us try to solve this problem over a couple of years, versus having to solve it all in one year,” Haug said. “And so I think what you’re going to see with our budget this year is the beginning of that process, sort of reining in some of the spending.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_kehoe2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

“I knew it might be coming,” said Sandra Graves, director of Champlain Valley Head Start. “It's kind of hard to know what words or phrases might trigger a question.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
After Sandra Graves, the director of Champlain Valley Head Start in Burlington, submitted her annual application for federal funding, federal officials sent the request back to her with several issues flagged. Among other similar critiques, the phrase “cultural and linguistic responsiveness” had triggered a hold on her request while she amended her language.
“Though it does not explicitly state the terms diversity, equity, or inclusion, the term ‘cultural and linguistic responsiveness’ can be seen as a similar word to DEI,” read a communication to Graves from the federal Office of Head Start, which lies within the Health and Human Services Department, headed by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“I knew it might be coming,” Graves said of the challenge to her application. “It’s kind of hard to know what words or phrases might trigger a question.”
But this particular query was surprising, Graves said, given that the language in question was drawn verbatim from federal Head Start performance standards, and further grounded in the program’s statutory mandates. 
Head Start is a federal program that provides child care, meals and other services to young children, parents and pregnant women who have an income below the federal poverty line. In Vermont, roughly 1,250 kids are enrolled in the program, of which advocates report roughly one-fifth are experiencing homelessness.
The complications with Graves’ application occurred in what was already a challenging time for many Head Start providers, with the government shutdown this fall causing funding delays across the program. Though Graves’ grant was nearly a month late, her organization was able to avoid layoffs or service freezes, with the Vermont Department for Children and Families offering no-interest loan options to Head Start providers as a backstop.
As programs in Vermont continue to apply for their annual federal funding allocations this year, they have encountered significant changes to how federal agencies are handling such requests. While national Head Start leadership remains confident in the program’s stability, Vermont providers are expressing concern about how such modifications will affect them.
This focus on ensuring that federal funds do not support DEI-related programming has become par for the course, according to Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the nonprofit National Head Start Association.
The messaging around DEI under President Donald Trump’s administration, Sheridan said, has been a “180 degree difference” from the policies set out by President Joe Biden’s administration.
“The Office of Head Start will not approve the use of federal funding for any training and technical assistance (TTA) or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,” read federal guidance Graves received in March.
But in practice, Sheridan said, determining the details of what this shift means has often been challenging for providers.
“We have not really received effective guidance at this point from the (Trump) administration about what they’re looking for,” he said Monday.
Christy Swenson, who chairs the board of the Vermont Head Start Association and directs the Head Start Program at Capstone Community Action in Barre, said guidance from the federal level has not only been unclear but at times also contradictory to law.
“Many of the guidances that have been provided over the last nine months are directly in opposition to the Head Start Act,” she said in an interview earlier this month. 
It’s a potential conflict that has drawn national attention in recent months, as Head Start associations in a handful of states sued the Trump administration earlier this year for alleged violations of the 2007 Head Start Act.
“We have to follow the law,” Swenson added. “I’m sure there are a lot of programs (that) are confused.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Swenson and Sheridan said they had heard a number of reports that artificial intelligence had been used to complete application screenings. Federal communication to Graves referred to a “manual review” of certain phrases in her application, leaving an open question about what other, initial methods were used to screen the document.
While the use of AI would be a concern in itself, Swenson said, that practice would be part of a larger movement toward a new kind of federal application review that is simultaneously more cursory and more targeted.
Swenson said under the Biden administration, funding request screenings were extremely detailed. In-depth budgets would generate dozens of questions from officials each cycle, she said, with multiple follow-ups over the course of the year to ensure compliance. 
Without that oversight, Swenson said, she’s concerned that a small number of programs could begin to misuse funds, which could nonetheless “really darken the reputation of all Head Start programs.”
Graves said a small handful of DEI-related queries were the only questions she received from the Office of Head Start this year. 
The new process also comes after significant layoffs of federal workers from the Office of Head Start earlier this year, Swenson noted.
Graves said the mandatory revisions she had made to her organization’s budget request were essentially semantic. Her team, she said, is “complying to the (federal) directives while still carrying out the individualized services to children and families.”
She received her funding award shortly after making those changes to her applications.
What “cultural and linguistic responsiveness” actually means for Graves is individualizing her organization’s support for each family, she said. Champlain Valley Head Start provides not just early childhood education, but also home visits for young families and translation assistance when necessary, among other programs.
“We live in a very, you know, culturally diverse setting here in Burlington, Vermont,” Graves said. “We will continue to provide those services.”
Swenson agreed, citing the Head Start Act once again.
“Really at the heart of its intent,” she said, “is that we meet families where they’re at.”
Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association, said he had heard from the Office of Head Start that the changes in application requirements were designed to streamline and “simplify” the review process. The changes, while “a little bit of a surprise,” hadn’t had harmful results for programs so far, he said, though his team will be monitoring the situation closely.
But the new guidance surrounding DEI has affected this year’s funding application process significantly, he said, with programs like Graves’ frequently having requests returned.
“We’ve had to go one way, and now we’re having to go the absolute opposite direction,” he said.
Nonetheless, Sheridan said he was confident in Head Start’s stability, despite suggestions earlier in the year that the Trump administration might attempt to eliminate the program.
“Head Start has continued to have strong bipartisan support,” Sheridan said. “Policymakers trust us — they know that Head Start has strong evidence of its effectiveness.”

(Getty Images)As Indiana lawmakers prepare to reconvene in January for a shortened 2026 legislative session, multiple Republican legislators have filed bills to expand how the state carries out death sentences — reopening a debate over capital punishment that stalled in the Statehouse earlier this year.
At the heart of two bills — one in the House and another in the Senate — are additional execution options beyond lethal injection, which is currently the only method authorized under Indiana law.
Senate Bill 11, authored by Indianapolis Republican Sen. Mike Young, would allow Indiana to use a firing squad to carry out executions under certain circumstances.
Under Young’s proposal, the death penalty could be inflicted by firing squad if the Department of Correction determines — at least 30 days before a scheduled execution — that it is unable to conduct an execution by lethal injection due to the unavailability of required drugs.
The bill would also allow a condemned person to request execution by firing squad at least 30 days before the scheduled date.
Separately a House bill authored by Republican Reps. Jim Lucas of Seymour and Andrew Ireland of Indianapolis, would allow executions to be carried out by either firing squad or nitrogen hypoxia. Lucas said lethal injection would remain the default method, but condemned individuals could request an alternative.
Story continues below.
20251216111200206
 
The Indiana Capital Chronicle obtained a copy of the bill which was filed this week but as of late Wednesday had not yet been published on the General Assembly’s website where all filed bills are publicly accessible.
“It’s a simple bill,” Lucas told the Capital Chronicle. “We’re going to go with drugs as the first option,” Lucas said. “But if (the condemned) want to choose one of these other options, they can.”
Lucas said the measure was drafted in collaboration with DOC officials and is driven largely by the state’s difficulty securing lethal injection drugs and the cost associated with executions. In the last year, Indiana officials paid up to $300,000 for a single dose of pentobarbital.
He said the goal is to align Indiana’s exertion protocols with other states and the federal government, and that his bill “was an ask from the White House.”
Could legislation pass — or stalemate?
Young’s legislation additionally details procedures for firing squad executions, requiring a five-member team made up of DOC officers selected by the prison warden.
Four officers would fire weapons containing live ammunition, while one would fire a weapon containing a blank round, with firearms loaded in a way that prevents squad members from knowing which ammunition they are firing. The bill would also shield the identities of firing squad members from public disclosure and legal discovery.
Currently, five states authorize the use of firing squads under certain circumstances: Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and South Carolina.
Nine states permit executions by lethal gas, but only five — Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma — specifically autho­rize death by nitro­gen hypox­ia, a process that deprives inmates of oxygen using nitrogen gas.

So far, Alabama and Louisiana are the only states that have per­formed exe­cu­tions by nitrogen gas, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Lawmakers are set to reconvene Jan. 5.
Republican leadership has not yet said where the supermajority caucuses in either chamber stand on new legislation, or if the bills will get committee hearings during the short session, which is scheduled to conclude by the end of February following redistricting debates in December.
The proposed bills follow more than a year of concerns over the state’s ongoing difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs. The problem that has delayed executions nationwide and prompted states to revisit alternative methods.
Indiana has spent more than $1 million over the last year to procure pentobarbital, and Gov. Mike Braun said previously that the state has faced difficulties accessing the lethal injection drug.
But when asked earlier this week about pending death penalty legislation, the Republican governor struck a cautious tone.
“Even though I’m anticipating that there might be some stuff there — I’ll look at that,” Braun said, referring to death penalty bills. But he added that such measures “don’t rise to the level of other issues,” such as lowering health care costs and passing reforms related to education and utilities.

“If it comes up,” he continued, “then I’ll view it on the merits at the time.”
Hoosier prosecutors, meanwhile, have urged lawmakers to preserve the death penalty as an option. 
Vicki Becker, the Elkhart County prosecutor speaking on behalf of the Association of Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys, said prosecutors oppose removing capital punishment as a tool — regardless of how the legislature ultimately structures it.
“State of Indiana, prosecutors don’t want to lose tools. They don’t want to lose tools,” Becker said. “And in the grand scheme of things, when we have cases that truly are the worst of the worst, we need to have those tools.”
Becker said prosecutors will serve as subject-matter experts as lawmakers debate the issue but emphasized that the final decision rests with the General Assembly.
Opposition mounts, too
Opposition to the death penalty has also intensified. 
On Tuesday, more than 70 handwritten letters from pastors and members of Indianapolis First Friends and Shalom Zone, a self-described interfaith group, were delivered to the governor’s office calling for abolition. Braun briefly met with the group and promised a more formal conversation would follow.
“Like so many Hoosiers, 23 other states, and the entire European Union, we believe the death penalty should be abolished,” said Jodie English, a Quaker who helped organize the letter drive.
Braun — whose administration oversaw two executions in 2025 — has called on lawmakers to take up the issue but has stopped short of endorsing any specific execution methods.
The governor has pointed to South Carolina, however, which recently reinstated the firing squad as an option after years of delays due to its inability to obtain lethal injection drugs.
In June, Braun disclosed that Indiana officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
But Braun’s office has since refused to disclose how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the DOC in recent months. At least one of those doses was used for Roy Ward’s execution in October.
Braun has maintained, too, that the high cost and short shelf life of the drug should prompt new discussions on how the state approaches capital punishment moving forward.
Lawmakers failed to advance several death-penalty-related proposals during the 2025 session, including a Republican-backed bill to abolish the death penalty altogether.
‘A hell of a lot less expensive’ than lethal injection: Could Indiana approve firing squads?

That proposal drew some bipartisan support in both chambers but never received a committee hearing. At the time, House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said the issue lacked sufficient consensus to move forward during an already hectic session.
Lucas said he’s confident that his bill will receive a hearing in the House and advance out of the chamber, but he was less certain about its prospects in the Senate.
“I absolutely refuse to predict what the Senate is going to do on anything,” he said. “I’m over in the House. I’m working the House side. That’s my focus right now.”
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row at the state prison in Michigan City. Since December 2024, the state has carried out death sentences for three inmates: Joseph Corcoran, Benjamin Ritchie and Ward. Corcoran’s marked Indiana’s first executions in more than a decade. 
The state has not requested execution dates for any of the remaining death row inmates.
“We’re not relitigating the death penalty or anything like that,” Lucas said. “And we want to keep this as humane and efficient as possible, for all parties involved.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)One in seven people who died in New Jersey’s state prisons since 2018 died of “unnatural causes” including overdoses, suicides, homicides, and accidents, a state watchdog found in a new report.
Investigators from the Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson found that 336 people died in state Department of Corrections custody between 2018 and 2024, with medical examiners attributing most — 83% — to natural causes.
While the number of deaths held fairly steady at an average of 41 per year (excluding a pandemic-related spike in 2020), the prison population fell by a third from over 19,000 in 2018 to under 13,000 last year, the report notes. That means the overall death rate rose over that time.

Of deaths deemed unnatural, 20 people fatally overdosed, 13 died by suicide, six were murdered, and eight died of accidents (including falls and one accidental choking believed to be related to drug use or medical issues), researchers found. Most unnatural deaths occurred at Northern State Prison in Newark and New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. Nine people who died were 25 or younger, with the youngest just 20. Eight of those deaths were ruled unnatural, the report notes.
Of natural deaths, 48 were attributed to COVID-19 and 172 others to cardiac issues, cancer, and respiratory or pulmonary diseases, the report says. Most occurred in hospitals. About a third were receiving end-of-life or advanced nursing care in an extended care unit at South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton.
A Department of Corrections spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Investigators examined only death trends and did not assess preventative or emergency responses by the state Department of Corrections or medical providers, incident reports, patients’ medical records, or the department’s process of assessingthe morbidity and mortality of people in its custody.
The findings are meant to allow the public, policymakers, and prison administrators “to have an initial understanding of the big picture, ask questions, flag concerning trends, and engage in a policy discussion about how to prevent deaths in the future,” said Terry Schuster, the state corrections ombudsperson.
Schuster recommended that the Department of Corrections begin publicly reporting on deaths in custody, including “contextual information” about the people who died and the causes, circumstances, and locations of deaths.
“There are many reasons why publicizing information about people who have died in state prisons is critical,” Schuster wrote. “Doing so may help create transparency for the public, queue up important questions for prison officials and health care providers, understand the scale of an epidemic, and draw needed attention to facilities or custody settings where unnatural deaths or other preventable deaths are occurring in larger numbers.”

The Wisconsin State Public Defenders Office released a video Tuesday of an incident involving a staff member repeatedly punching a then-15-year-old at a juvenile detention center.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The incident took place on May 27 and involved a youth at the Jonathan Delagrave Youth Development and Care Center in Caledonia.
 The video appears to show four staff members directing him to move from a spot by a wall in a hallway, possibly to a nearby room, and Elliott not moving. After a staff member swung at him, the situation devolved into a struggle. Elliott was struck repeatedly by staff before and after he was on the ground.
The incident occurred less than a month after the 48-bed facility opened on May 1, the State Public Defenders Office (SPD) said. According to the SPD, the teen had bruises, swelling on his right eye, blurred vision and headaches, scrapes and cuts and dried blood in his ear, based on records from evaluations arranged by the facility. 
“To the parents who have kids in a detention center, check on your babies,” said Kianna Reed, his mother.
The SPD wants its client immediately transferred from the facility and placed in a group home “where he can receive specialized therapy and support.”
“The people in this video should have never been entrusted with caring for children. This is a sickening act of violence,” State Public Defender Jennifer Bias said in a statement. 
The family is looking for an attorney for a civil lawsuit against Racine County, the SPD said.

In the SPD release, Reed said that “seeing that video and knowing my son is still in that facility is terrifying,” and that “the staff need proper training and accountability.”
In a statement emailed to the Examiner, a Racine County spokesperson described the publicly released video as a partial record of a longer incident  and said that staff’s interaction with the youth took place over several minutes. It said the youth clenched his fists and made multiple threats of physical violence to other juveniles and staff.
“Maintaining the safety of youth and staff in our facilities is our highest priority,” Amberlyn Yohn, administrator of youth rehabilitation services, said in the county’s statement. “Situations like this are complex and unfold quickly. While one employee’s actions became the focus of this incident, our broader team followed established protocols and cooperated fully with the review process.”
The county commits to making sure staff have the training, oversight and support needed for managing difficult situations, Yohn said.
The “primarily involved staff member” was immediately placed on administrative leave after the incident and resigned within three days, Racine County said in a statement emailed to the Examiner. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, his name is Robert Knight, and he told the Journal Sentinel his actions were justified based on Elliott’s history at the center. He disputed that he resigned because of the investigation.
A different worker seen repeatedly striking the teen was ordered to complete eight hours of remedial training and appears to still be employed at the facility, according to the public defender’s office. Three of the four staff members involved are still employed at the center, according to the public defender’s office, which obtained records showing the staff’s employment status.
Knight said her son was displaying signs of aggression at the time of the incident, according to the Journal Sentinel. He said he intended to force the boy back rather than strike him.
The teen had been found guilty of charges of retail theft and obstructing an officer.
A new alternative
Efforts to close the Lincoln Hills facility have not yet proven successful, and its location makes it difficult for youth there to maintain contact with their community and families.
Years after a 2017 lawsuit filed over abuses, Gov. Tony Evers announced in October that the state had reached full compliance with all of the court-ordered reforms. The Department of Corrections’ website describes plans to build smaller facilities and keep youth closer to home.
In addition, the state has awarded money to counties to establish Secure Residential Care Centers for Children and Youth (SRCCCY). Milwaukee’s is expected to open in 2026; Racine’s is the only one that is currently open. The county website says it provides a “structured and rehabilitative environment for male youth.”
The facility was built as an alternative to the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake youth prisons, the SPD said in its release. Some juvenile offenders can now go to the facility instead of Lincoln Hills, Eileen Fredericks, the SPD’s youth defense practice coordinator, told the Examiner.
Fredericks said that “we only have one, and then shortly after it opens, we have this really serious incident.”
The county’s website says that youth are placed in the SRCCCY under a statute that requires that the youth committed an act that would carry a sentence of six months or more if the youth were an adult. The youth also must have been found to be a danger to the public and in need of restrictive custodial treatment.
In the weeks before the facility opened in May, the Racine County Eye reported that officials said the center is a more cost-effective and compassionate alternative to state-run youth correctional facilities such as Lincoln Hills.
According to the public defender’s office, at the time of the incident, the teen was a few weeks into a five and a half-month period of participation in the SRCCCY’s RISE-UP program. He has been in detention consistently since December 2024, the SPD office said.
In the SPD’s release, Bias argued that building “shiny new prisons” won’t prevent situations like what happened to the teen. 
“We need meaningful reforms to the way our children are treated in the juvenile justice system,” Bias said. “We need judges who will prioritize alternatives to incarceration and detention workers who value care over punishment.”
Fredericks said she wants “these kids to be seen as kids” and that “there’s kind of this mindset that they’re less than kids, because they’ve done something wrong.”
Transparency concern
Bias accused the county of seeking to “sweep this incident under the rug.” The public defender’s office called for a “full-scale” investigation into conditions at the facility and the qualifications of staff members who interact with children. 
Reed told the Examiner she did not see any of the video released Tuesday by the SPD until October. 
In its statement, the county said that immediately after the May 27 incident, the mother of the youth and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections were notified. The Examiner reached out to the DOC and was told that the Jonathan Delagrave facility is county-run, and questions regarding personnel or those housed there are best directed to Racine County. 
The county said important privacy protections for juveniles must be respected, but that the county has been and remains transparent in its response to the incident. 
Law enforcement and independent human services agencies fully investigated and reviewed the incident, the county said. The details of the investigation and relevant video were provided to the Racine County District Attorney’s Office, which declined to pursue prosecution, the county said.
Warning: the video released by the Wisconsin State Public Defender’s Office contains graphic footage of violence against a child.

WyoFile digs into Wyoming’s 84-page Rural Health Transformation Project application, examining proposals that include nursing grants, EMS incentives and a state-run insurance plan.
The post What’s in Wyoming’s application for up to $800M in federal health funds? appeared first on WyoFile .","With the smallest population in the country spread over a huge area, Wyoming’s rural health care gaps are acute. Patients drive long distances for care; hospitals struggle to hire medical professionals and health care is expensive — even with insurance.
These realities underscore a huge opportunity looming for the state. Wyoming is vying to receive up to $800 million in federal funds over five years for initiatives designed to innovate and revolutionize its rural health care system. 
The Rural Health Transformation Program, a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is designed to funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. The program aims to offset a portion of the federal funds for health care that were cut in the Beautiful Bill. Wyoming submitted its application in November and should learn its fate at the end of the year.
There’s no guarantee Wyoming’s initiatives will be fully funded. But a dive into the 84-page application reveals both compelling data about the state of health care here and an innovative array of proposals aimed to bolster it.
Proposed initiatives take many forms. They include incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to prop up the industry.
The community engagement involved and breadth of proposals in the Department of Health’s application are impressive, said Healthy Wyoming Executive Director Jenn Lowe, whose work advocating for health care access often makes her skeptical of state policy. 
“The Department of Health did a superb job in pulling this application together in a brief amount of time,” Lowe said. “It is analytically strong. It is data driven, and it is grounded in community input. It comes up with some innovative solutions” and has gone beyond many other states from a transparency standpoint. 
However, Lowe said, there are some vulnerabilities, and the implementation window for deploying what could be an enormous tranche of funding is very short — which concerns her. 
What’s in it 
The application opens by describing the particular characteristics responsible for such steep challenges in Wyoming. 
Wyoming’s census-designated “frontier” areas comprise most of the state in terms of both area and population — approximately 253,000 people, or 44% of the population, live in frontier areas. That’s compared to 30% in rural areas and 26% in urban cores, the application states.

Populations in the frontier areas are also disproportionately older — meaning care needs are higher in those areas. In addition, services are more sparse and emergency response times longer in these lightly populated places. 
Areas of concern range from Wyoming’s high suicide rate to an anticipated jump in uninsured residents to a notable erosion of maternity care services. 
“Our biggest challenge lies in access to basic medical care,” the application states in identifying its top priority.  
Other priorities include building up the state’s health care workforce, improving residents’ metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioral health and using technology to improve chronic disease management and bring care closer to home. Here are some of the initiatives proposed to address those priorities:

Build cooperative agreements for EMS agencies to work together on a regional basis, using regional dispatch to coordinate things like interfacility transfers.
Create financial incentives to persuade small designated “Critical Access Hospitals” to focus on essential community services of an emergency department, an ambulance service and a delivery facility for babies. Currently, small hospitals sometimes opt to close delivery facilities, which are not profitable, but continue to offer other, more lucrative procedures. 
Establish a state-operated public insurance plan, dubbed “BearCare,” that would cover health care emergencies, such as a car crash or a bear attack, for dues-paying members. 
Bolster the medical workforce by offering grants for Wyoming educational institutions to do things like hire faculty or develop career pipelines.
Fund, in perpetuity, an annual number of awards to cover educational costs for individuals interested in joining one of four clinical pipelines: nursing, EMS, behavioral health and physician.
Add more slots to Wyoming’s existing accredited programs for post-graduate medical education, likely in new sites. 
Implement the Presidential Fitness Test in Wyoming’s primary and secondary schools. 
Limit the state’s SNAP benefits to healthy food purchases, not including things like sodas and candy. 
Stand up a grant process for technology that promises to improve care delivery closer to home or build systems that can work across providers.

At the core of Wyoming’s sustainability plan, the application reads, “is the establishment of a dedicated, purpose-driven, and actively-managed Wyoming Health Transformation Perpetuity.” 
Similar to Wyoming’s Permanent Mineral Trust Fund, this “perpetuity” would use investments to continually generate revenue for health care programs, the application says.
The application’s vision is sprawling and ambitious. Implementing it will require manpower. With almost 1,400 employees in four divisions, the Wyoming health department is a “superagency” that’s well-equipped for the challenge, the application states. 
“We have a lot of infrastructure in the department that does this kind of stuff already,” said Franz Fuchs, WDH deputy director and the application’s lead author. The department would also anticipate hiring around 13 contractors to help with the load, he said.

The public process confirmed what the Health Department has suspected for some time, Fuchs said, which is that a fundamental mismatch between fixed health care costs and Wyoming’s rural volume is at the heart of many of its needs. 
“And so we’re really trying to target these really big economic problems,” he said, rather than proposing more gimmicky and short-term fixes. 
What now
The process began in September, when Wyoming Department of Health staff kicked off eight in-person and three virtual meetings to gather feedback. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. The application was then drawn up and submitted by the Nov. 5 deadline.
“It was definitely a tight timeline,” Fuchs said. The ultimate product, he said, reflects the community feedback received during the meetings as well as stakeholder meetings with groups like hospital CEOs, long-term care facility managers and representatives of the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes. 
“We definitely let the public process, the public feedback we received, drive everything,” he said.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to announce its funding decisions by Dec. 31. The way Fuchs understands it, the feds can ultimately pick and choose which parts of the application to fund — rather than approving or denying the entire thing.

It’s impossible to say how much Wyoming will receive, but health news outlet KFF anticipates the state is looking at $750 million. 
A federal announcement, however, won’t spell the end of the process. The Wyoming Legislature, which has shown skepticism of the size and breadth of the health department, will have to appropriate the funds. There are also some statutory requirements, such as the creation of the perpetuity and other state policy changes. More significant initiatives, such as BearCare, would likely require standalone approval, Fuchs said.
Worries and hopes 
Even with the initiatives still in the application phase, opinions are emerging about the appropriateness and feasibility of Wyoming’s Rural Health Transformation proposals. 
The Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee just wrapped up two weeks of budget meetings. As lawmakers reviewed the Health Department’s numbers, lawmakers discussed the application. One proposal that lawmakers frowned upon was the state-run catastrophic health insurance plan. 
“I’m struggling with how we should go into the free market,” said Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, who has no relation to the name BearCare. “I’m not inclined to want to compete in the private sector. I don’t think it’s the proper role of government to do so.”
Bear was also skeptical of the proposed perpetuity’s ability to keep pace with ever-rising health costs and remain effective.

The BearCare proposal is coming at a time when many in Wyoming are bracing for the country’s largest spikes in Affordable Care Act prices. Affordability of insurance in general was the No. 2 concern that came up during the public process, WDE Director Stefan Johansson told the committee. 
Freedom Caucus lawmakers on the appropriations panel derisively called BearCare “GordonCare” in a reference to Gov. Mark Gordon, who has supported the state’s application process. 
“Families, seniors, and communities are stronger when they are healthy and have reasonable access to healthcare,” Gordon said in a budget message statement last week. “We must maintain access to safety net services for all Wyoming communities, including quality care for children, seniors, people with developmental disabilities, and others who lack physical or financial means.”
Lowe of Healthy Wyoming said that while it’s promising, the implementation piece of the plan worries her. It’s a big ask for an agency that is facing likely cuts. 
“I think that there are many moving parts that must align — legislatively, operationally and across different provider types on a pretty short implementation window,” Lowe said. The biggest obstacle, she added, may very well be found in the Wyoming Legislature. 
“There’s so much discord in the state Capitol these days that we have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I’m afraid we’re going to squander it a little bit,” Lowe said.

Laramie County commissioners selected Fornstrom to represent a House seat vacated by the late John Eklund.
The post A Q&A with Pine Bluffs’ Justin Fornstrom, Wyoming’s newest state lawmaker appeared first on WyoFile .","Rep. Justin Fornstrom was sworn in Tuesday as a state lawmaker, filling a vacancy in House District 10 left by John Eklund, who died in November after a battle with cancer. 
House District 10 encompasses a central section of Laramie County and its southeast corner and includes the towns of Albin, Burns and Pine Bluffs. 
Fornstrom, a Republican, is the former mayor of Pine Bluffs, where his family has been based for generations. A rancher and business owner, he graduated from high school in 1990 and earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Wyoming in 1995. Soon after college, Fornstrom started a farming operation with his dad and brother. He and his wife, Kara, have a daughter. 
Fornstrom spent about 16 years on the Laramie County Fire Board, mostly as president, and was elected Pine Bluffs mayor in 2021. 
WyoFile spoke with Fornstrom by phone on Wednesday following his swearing in. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. —Ed. 
WyoFile: Starting about halfway through the term, how are you preparing for the job and the upcoming budget session?
Rep. Justin Fornstrom: Well, I’ve been working with [the Legislative Service Office], they do a great deal of training. I actually had training all day yesterday. None of it was about the budget, just about practical things. But they have a great deal of content, which I’ve just kind of really scratched the surface of, but intend to drill down here as we go. But a lot of good budget training, the interim committee work is all archived, and so they’re very helpful and that’s what they’re charged with doing. Any bit of background or help I need in that area, they’ve been very gracious about supplying, and to be honest with you, I’ve just really got rolling in that process. So I think I’m behind the eight ball, for sure, just on a time basis, but I fully intend to devote the time and get up to speed to the best of my ability, and look forward to putting in the work and being as informed as I can going to the session. In addition to that, just speaking to other representatives, lawmakers, people who are familiar with the process has been very helpful. So I look forward to taking input from wherever I can get [it] to do the best job I can for the people in House District 10 and the state of Wyoming. 
WF: What encouraged you to serve in House District 10?
JF: Frankly, it hadn’t really occurred to me to do this. I had a great deal of respect for John as a legislator and a good man in general, a good community man, and a good family man. So it never really occurred to me that he wouldn’t be there, so I hadn’t given it a lot of thought. But after his passing, I got a lot of encouragement from people around me that felt like I would be able to do a good job. So there was some struggles, and a little bit in that decision making. But really it was just about an opportunity to serve a greater number of people and all those folks in House District 10, as well as the state of Wyoming, and maybe have an opportunity to influence some of the policies statewide. It was a general interest in it, but also a desire to serve. And so even as mayor, on the fire board, I’ve always had a desire to give back to the community or to the area, and maybe now the state, and so I put my name in and just kind of let things end up where they got. 
WF: You mentioned serving as mayor of Pine Bluffs. What did you learn from the experience of serving in local government?
JF: Well, my background really is in management. So being a mayor is — much of it is a management job. But also, you get to learn the inner workings of various levels of government from the bottom up. And [I] spent a lot of time working with the county, some special districts, other municipalities, other organizations in the state, and understanding where money comes from for municipal government. And just really kind of honed some skills about budgeting and revenue and some of that, obviously, on a different scale than statewide budgeting, but the principles are similar. And learned a lot about how important those financial sources are to do good work for the people of your community, and what it takes to access those and figuring out how to best be responsible with those funds for the greater good of your community. 
WF: Speaking of local government — in recent years, lawmakers have made several changes to residential property taxes, including a 25% cut. And there’s now a discussion to eliminate residential property taxes and to raise sales taxes to replace that resulting revenue loss for local governments. From your perspective, what do you think are some of the appropriate next steps for lawmakers to take?
JF: It’s pretty early on for me, but I can tell you I don’t want to speak to, nor do I know about all of the discussions that have taken place surrounding this. I more or less sat on the sideline and watched, so I don’t feel like I have the full set of information to understand everybody’s train of thought on this. However, I also know that these cuts are difficult for municipalities and county governments and special districts, for sure, and so I guess I would say that I would like to see maybe more discussions surrounding what those cuts look like. I mean, what do they actually look like to the people when they happen? I’m in the same boat on this, I’m a taxpayer, a citizen as well, and so I understand the sentiment and this kind of quick rise we had in property taxes, perhaps, is faster than anyone would have liked. And obviously, I see the need for certain areas of that to get some tax relief, but I also think, simultaneously, you have to inform the public about what that looks like, what reduced taxes looks like in terms of reduced services. And I don’t think you can have one conversation without having the other. But if the conversation is more or less just about cutting your property taxes, well, of course, myself and everyone else in the state is going to be in favor of that. Everyone would like to keep their taxes at least reasonable.  Zero [residential property taxes] is also, as you mentioned, on the table. So if you don’t know how that’s going to impact your daily life in your community or your county, then that’s a pretty easy decision to make. But if you’re armed with more facts, perhaps we all come to a different decision about the need to completely eliminate property taxes.

WF: Switching gears a little bit — lawmakers have also spent a lot of time in recent years aiming to overhaul the state’s election system. From your perspective, do Wyoming’s elections need improvements?
JF: So my feeling is Wyoming has one of the safest, straightforward election systems in the country. I will say this, I’m not fully versed on everything that was put forward in the interim, and so I don’t want to speak to individual bills. But just on the whole, we have a safe system. I think we did the low-hanging fruit, and now we’re maybe starting to get into areas that are more difficult for the average person to understand why we’re still trying to shore up problems that aren’t readily seen. And that’s a pretty political answer, but I would say I just don’t want to comment a lot, because there’s quite a few additional proposed changes coming our way, and I would need to review all of those, and haven’t at this point, but I generally think we have a good, safe election system as it stands today. And so I would need to be more informed and probably convinced that we have continuing issues that need to be resolved.
WF: Generally speaking, are there areas that you would like to see lawmakers focus more of their attention on?
JF: Obviously, the budget, as a newtimer, is my primary focus — to learn, understand and make responsible votes about the budget. Then there’s our state’s energy sector, another spot where we have legacy energy sectors that we need to support and that’s a pretty complex issue. There’s a lot of things going on in that space, including a greater focus on nuclear. And as I’ve said in other forums, we’re blessed with our great natural resource of uranium in Wyoming. And how do we best use that? Does it all need to leave the state? Or should we be adding value to it here in Wyoming? And the jobs that that might create, I think that’s a pretty interesting topic. And how communities feel about uranium and nuclear energy can be controversial, and I think we need to take a really hard look at what that would mean to our state in terms of revenue and in terms of jobs, and so those are a couple issues. The last thing I would say is, what we do to promote business in Wyoming, those type of activities, and what the most effective way to do that, and the jobs that the businesses provide and quality of life for our citizens and hopefully potentially stop or reduce the out-migration of our young people by just having a really, really good climate for business and the jobs it does bring.
WF: What else would you like your constituents to know about you?
JF: Just that I’m a person that enjoys learning, enjoys hearing different perspectives, that I have a pretty even personality and like to make good, solid, informed decisions. And I come from an agricultural background and Speaker [Chip] Neiman was gracious enough to give me John’s [committee] assignments in Agriculture and Select Water. And so I feel like I bring some value to those. But I’m interested in other facets of what goes on in our state, and I do enjoy the process of understanding issues and feel like I am pretty even-handed and like to make decisions as such. And so my intention, in addition to the statewide issues, is that House District 10 has its own things going, and much of that is agriculture and just general citizen issues and other things. Really, my objective is to represent House District 10, much like John did. I can only aspire to do a good enough job to live up to his example as a legislator and as a family man, and all those things. That’s my objective.

Being socially reserved has its place, but it shouldn't come at the expense of telling the truth, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post Telling my wife I love her appeared first on WyoFile .","“Oh, my god,” my friend says, rushing up to me, “Did you hear about the Norwegian farmer?”

Opinion

“No, what?” I ask.
“He said he loves his wife so much he almost told her.”
This is the kind of joke I heard growing up in a Norwegian-American family. It’s one of many light-hearted critiques of Scandinavian reserve. Another of these jokes I heard defined the difference between Norwegian introverts and extroverts — introverts look at their shoes when they talk to you, while extroverts look at your shoes.
This famous Norwegian reserve is part of a broader cultural sensibility we often attach to Americans of northern European Protestant Christian backgrounds. The Minnesota writer Carol Bly, who worked for the National Farmers Union, published an entire book — “Letters from the Country” — in which she sought to understand and articulate some of the reasons why we often feel lonely and dissatisfied. One of the things Bly noted was that Midwestern mothers taught their children three rules above all: be nice; think nice things; and if you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything. That is, be reserved.
Of course, as Bly knew, we should try to be nice — don’t be rude to people. But the rule to think nice things — that’s never going to fly. Still, our thoughts can stay inside us, so perhaps we can modify this to say, “don’t cling to your cruel thoughts and don’t act on them.” It’s rule No. 3 that worried Bly the most, for in saying nothing, we often repress truths that need to be told for our own good and the good of those around us. Sometimes the truth really will set us free.
I have a friend who came to Wyoming after living much of her life in New York City, where she said people met regularly and talked about everything, including their fears, their anger, their doubts — in short, their feelings. If they couldn’t meet in person, they talked on the phone. “Every day,” my friend told me, “Talk, talk, talk about everything. We knew each other. Here in Wyoming, you could live next door to someone for 10 years and know almost nothing about them. Hello, hello and that’s that, plenty said.”
While my friend’s experience may be at the extreme end of our culture of reserve, it’s not completely inaccurate. I, too, have noticed that it can be hard to get to know people. Another friend told me that when he moved to Wyoming, people asked him which church he would attend. When he explained that he was not a churchgoer, he was then asked how he thought he was going to make friends. Staying in our own closed spheres is another part of reserve.
One thing that happens when we practice too much reserve is that minor disagreements and social conflicts get bottled up. Time goes by, and we’re jamming more and more of these pieces of discord into the bottle until one day it can’t hold anything else and we explode. We go to meetings where people shout obscenities at one another, where someone gets shoved or punched. Our annoyances, kept in check for too long, become rage — and then, watch out.
I was once at a rather fancy dinner party here in Wyoming where people got to arguing about politics. I expressed views that another person disagreed with and as we talked, the person suddenly stopped and asked me, “Where are you from?”
“What does where I’m from have to do with the subject?”
“Where are you from?”
“Really, it has nothing to do with…”
“Where are you from?” The person asked yet again with barely withheld fury.
“Well, I live here in Wyoming but I was born in Oregon and grew up in Arizona.”
“Born in Oregon — that’s just the East Coast on the West Coast.”
That was the end of the talk, as my place of birth was enough to indicate that whatever I said was not worthy of consideration. It was as if I’d drunk dangerous thoughts with my mother’s milk.
All these little vignettes are related in that they deal with how we understand reserve and its link to both politeness and social conflict. I think Carol Bly is right in arguing for telling the truth, while I recognize that we can’t tell all the truth all the time. Maybe in those moments when the truth won’t serve anyone, reserve is the best option. But really, reserve’s limitations or possibilities aside, that Norwegian farmer should tell his wife he loves her.

“I’m not in politics because I want to make a career out of it,” Aranda said in a recent interview. “I can work across the aisle.”

Aranda, 35, is one of a growing number of hopefuls aiming for the Democratic nomination to run against Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, now in his fourth term. Other declared Democratic candidates are ironworker Randy Bryce, emergency room nurse Mitchell Berman, Racine community activist Gage Stills and Janesville union leader Enrique Casiano.
“I’m the only one who has won a political campaign,” Aranda said. “I know how important it is to bring people together and stay united.”
The Cook Political Report’s most recent update, Dec. 9, maintained the 1st District’s projected 2026 outcome as “likely Republican.” Despite such forecasts, in the current cycle the district has drawn a broader array of potential Democratic opponents than it has seen in years.
The party’s last contested primary came in 2020. In 2024, what was expected to be at least a three-way primary race was avoided after Peter Barca’s late entry into the contest led the rest of the field to drop out by summer.
Aranda is the associate director of a college readiness program at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.
A Spanish speaker and an active Democratic party volunteer for the last 15 years, Aranda has organized bilingual workshops at party events. When the Whitewater school district held a referendum to raise property taxes in support of school district operations in 2022, Aranda said, he did presentations directed to the local Spanish-speaking community.
Public education is one of his top campaign priorities, he said. While funding is primarily a state and local function, the federal role in supporting public schools is important, he said, and he opposes the Trump administration’s attempts to dismantle the federal Department of Education.
“There’s a lack of public education funding,” Aranda said. “Local constituents are going to feel it in their pocket. Republicans aren’t doing much to assist in our investment for the future.”
Aranda’s parents, both Mexican immigrants, settled in Whitewater in the early 1990s, he said, and he grew up in the community, which straddles the line between Walworth and Jefferson counties.
“When we came to Whitewater, the only people that helped us were public school teachers,” Aranda said of his family’s experience.
He said immigration reform is another of his campaign’s concerns. On that, “there’s a lot of things at the local level we cannot do,” Aranda said. “I truly believe immigration reform that is comprehensive and fair will help not just public education but a lot of the scarcity and pain that people are feeling.”
Aranda has a master’s in business administration. He’s also held a variety of other jobs, he said, giving him the sort of direct experience he believes many voters can identify with.
“I’ve worked in call centers, custodial services and fast food,” Aranda said. “People want a good, stable job — this message is very simple. That’s what I want to guarantee for others.”
He supports a proposal advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, for a federal law setting the minimum pay for public school teachers at $60,000.
“Republicans say you can’t do that, but now you see ICE [agents] offered more money and debt forgiveness,” Aranda said.
While Aranda is not the only Hispanic entrant in the Democratic contest, he considers an ability to appeal to Hispanic voters to be one of his selling points. The 1st District has “a lot of Latino potential voters,” Aranda said. “They’ve been frustrated with both political parties.”
Aranda said he’s been traveling throughout the district to meet with Democratic Party groups and solicit their support. He also has been trying to educate and engage casual voters and non-voters, he said.
He described a recent visit to a college organization of Latino students. After introducing himself and his campaign for the 1st District, “Nobody knew who their representative was,” he said.
“Some don’t know what a Republican or a Democrat is and what they stand for,” he added. “Republicans take advantage of that, too.”
Aranda believes motivating more people who have been largely detached from politics to take an interest and go to the polls can help Democrats flip the seat.
“I think there’s a huge opportunity there,” he said. “I think there’s an opportunity for younger voters, too — for their voice to be heard.”

(Photo by Kirsten Strough/USDA)Cattle was “king” when it came to Idaho agriculture in 2025, but other farmers may be facing headwinds in 2026. 
Tariffs, inflation and hot and dry weather are likely to continue to put pressure on Idaho farmers and producers heading into the new year, according to a number of experts who spoke Wednesday at the University of Idaho Ag Outlook Seminar in Boise. 
Speakers at the event discussed economic conditions, weather forecasts, state and federal policy considerations and specific commodity outlooks. 
 Idaho’s agriculture cash at all-time high, largely driven by cattle and beef industry 

Agriculture makes up around 17% of Idaho total’s economic output. 
In total, cash receipts from Idaho agriculture in 2025 are predicted to reach an all-time of $12.1 billion, up 2% from last year. For the first time since 2003, the cattle industry brought in higher receipts than milk. 
“Whether it’s Idaho or the country, it’s a tale of two ag economies,” said Brett Wilder, U of I assistant professor and area extension educator covering farm business management. “One, is cattle is king right now. If you’re in the beef cattle industry, you’re probably the only one feeling really good about your financial situation. If you are in any other sector of agriculture, oftentimes, probably find yourself sitting at the table wondering what the seed bill is going to be, repairs, fertilizers. … expenses are high.” 
Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses

Cattle and calves generated around $3.89 billion in cash receipts in 2025, which was about 32% of Idaho’s total and an 18% increase from the previous year. 
However, crops like wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, and barley were all down from the year before. Sugar beet prices are expected to continue to drop, Wilder said, with an expected additional 30% to 40% drop in cash receipts. He said this was largely due to demand lessening for sugar, too much supply, and lots of sugar coming from other parts of the world.
“When you think about what is the state of Idaho’s ag economy, we’re at record highs in cash receipts. Things look really good, but when you get under the hood, there’s a lot to unpack,” Wilder said.
Since 2009, the inflation-adjusted cash receipts for cattle have risen 180%, he said. 
Some typical farm expenses were down. Spending on feed decreased 6% and fertilizer decreased 8%, he said. Labor costs rose around 6%, storage and transportation rose 9%, and interest expense went up 5%. 
Idaho farmers and ranchers are expected to have spent $717 million on interest by the end of the year, Wilder said, which is up 78% since 2021. 
“If you’re a small producer, starting producer, leveraged producer, you’re carrying the majority of that burden,” he said. 
Leveraged producers are those who borrow funds for their operation. 
All told, net farm income was up 6% from last year, he said, to about $2.7 billion.

 Idaho’s trade was strong in 2025, will be watched closely in 2026 

Wilder said Idaho is expected to finish 2025 with a record high in agriculture exports of $3 billion. Of all Idaho’s agricultural cash receipts, exports make up about a quarter, Wilder said. 
Many of those exports were completed under preexisting contracts and negotiations that occurred in 2024, he said. 
Going into 2026, it’s hard to say what will happen. U.S. trade with other countries has been volatile, as President Donald Trump has escalated trade wars with a number of countries using high tariffs, including Canada. 
Trump administration tags $700 million for regenerative farming

Canada accounts for 32% of Idaho’s agricultural exports. Mexico accounts for another 19%. 
Although the rates have changed over time, the U.S. and Canada for a time went back and forth with high tariff rates — which are taxes on imports. Most of Canada’s counter-tariffs have been removed under an agreement that went into effect in September. Similar tariffs and counter tariffs were threatened with Mexico, but most were removed under the same September agreement. 
Most of Idaho’s exports are dairy products, accounting for 22%.
“Geopolitics and trade are absolutely going to be front and center,” Wilder said of 2026. 
Asked if the U.S. trade relationship with Canada had been damaged to the point where it might affect Idaho agricultural exports, Wilder responded, “We’re still seeing trade move forward, but what that’s going to look like going forward will likely change.” 
Doug Robison, Idaho president of Agwest Farm Credit, said Wednesday he predicts tariffs will “continue to be a headwind for agriculture and agricultural commodities over probably the foreseeable year.” 
 Idaho entering winter with high precipitation, low snowpack 

Although much of the Western U.S. is experiencing high rainfalls from the “atmospheric river,”  high temperatures have meant that it hasn’t resulted in mountain snowpack, said Troy Lindquist, senior service hydrologist with the National Weather Service office in Boise. 
“We’re just flirting with record-low snow pack,” Lindquist said.
Average temperatures across the Pacific Northwest have been six to 10 degrees above normal the last few weeks. The state also experienced low precipitation this spring, which is contributing to low snowpack levels. 
It’s early in Idaho’s typical snow accumulation season, he said, so there’s a chance for the outlook to improve. Nearly every basin in the state is about 50% or less of its normal snow pack, he said. The Snake River headwaters area is an exception, sitting at about 70% of normal. 
However, drought conditions that had been improving from the extreme conditions that had been occurring in September, especially in North Idaho. 
The region is expected to experience “weak La Niña” conditions, he said. Historically, these conditions, brought on by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific, are associated with cooler-than-average temperatures. However, actual weather outcomes during these conditions have varied considerably over the years, Lindquist said. 
Sometimes, higher-than-average precipitation is also a result of these conditions, especially in northern Idaho. 
Weather forecasts through early January are showing a continuation of “active” weather patterns, with high precipitation, Lindquist said. There’s an equal chance of temperature coming in above, below or at normal, he said. 
In a more extended forecast of January through March, cooler-than-average temperatures are anticipated, especially in North Idaho. Northern and eastern parts of the state may also see above-normal precipitation, he said. 
Most of the state is expected to see more precipitation in February through April, with the exception of southwest Idaho. 
Heading into summer, forecasts show above average temperatures and below normal precipitation. Idaho had the fourth warmest “water year,” which ran Oct. 1, 2024, to Sept. 30, 2025, on record. 
“Climatologically, we’re just seeing pretty persistent above normal temperatures across the region,” he said, “especially during the summertime.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)A South Korea metals company will invest $6.6 billion to build a minerals refinery on the site of a shuttered mine in Smith County, marking the largest single economic investment in Tennessee history, Gov. Bill Lee announced this week. 
Korea Zinc will partner with the federal government in a joint venture that federal officials say aligns with the Trump administration’s goals to limit reliance on China for minerals critical to U.S. semiconductor, artificial intelligence, aerospace and defense industries. 
The public-private partnership gives the federal government a 40% stake in the company’s Tennessee operations, where some 540,000 tons of materials will be produced annually, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
The investment is expected to create 320 jobs in Smith County and 420 jobs in Montgomery County, the planned site of the company’s new U.S. headquarters.

“These hundreds of new jobs will drive economic prosperity across the region for generations to come,” Lee said in a news release.
State leaders called the investment a major economic milestone for Tennessee, but did not disclose whether the deal came with the promise of taxpayer-funded incentives. 
“Details about grant assistance can’t be shared until contracts are fully executed,” a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development wrote Wednesday in an emailed response to questions about potential incentives.
The Commerce Department has awarded the project $210 million in direct funding, the agency announced. The federal government will gain a 40% stake in the U.S. operations. As part of the deal, the federal government will also own 5% of the global Korea Zinc operations.
In a post on X, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called the deal a  “big win for America.”
The announcement comes amid uncertainty over the future of BlueOval City, Ford Motor Company’s electric truck campus lured to west Tennessee with $1 billion in taxpayer incentives for thousands of promised jobs.
Announced in 2021 as the then-largest investment in state history, the campus’ opening has since been delayed multiple times. Ford announced this week it had scrapped plans for electric pickup manufacturing in favor of gas-powered vehicles.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Clubway Apartments in Greenville, North Carolina, was an “amazing” place, Barbara Gaskins remembers.
“When I was in high school, we used to come over here, all of us as teenagers,” said Gaskins, now 43. “There was a pool and a clubhouse. It was amazing back in the day.”
Gaskins is now a tenant at the 1960s-era apartment complex, and claims neglectful management and ownership has allowed it to deteriorate to the point where tenants’ health is at risk.
In recent months, Gaskins has been a strident critic of management at the apartment complex. She’s complained to city officials and posted videos on her social media feed showing falling ceiling tiles that she says expose mold, bathtubs that don’t drain and half-hearted attempts at repairs.
A woman who answered the phone at Clubway Apartments identified herself as a member of its management team. She declined to discuss tenants’ concerns with NC Newsline. And a man with Apartment Advantage Group LLC (AAG), the complex’s Panama City, Florida-based management firm, declined to identify himself or to discuss the matter when reached by phone, telling a reporter that the firm is “not commenting on any of that.” Multiple messages left with Greenville’s code enforcement department were not returned.
North Carolina law guarantees tenants the right to safe, habitable housing, privacy, protection from discrimination and the right to proper eviction procedures. It also limits security deposits to up to two months’ rent and prevents landlord retaliation.

Then-attorney general Josh Stein reminded tenants of their rights to safe housing in a March 2024 column about unscrupulous contractors and the challenges homeowners and renters face.
“Landlords are required to provide their tenants with a fit premises,” Stein wrote. “If you discover that something needs to be fixed, ask to have it repaired. Let your landlord know about the problem immediately over the telephone or in person, but follow up with a written request and keep a copy of it for yourself.”
If the landlord refuses to make repairs or remedy the condition in a reasonable period of time, Stein wrote, you may file a complaint with your local authorities, such as a code enforcement agency or fire and safety inspector.
But Nick MacLeod with the North Carolina Tenants Union says those steps aren’t always enough to get problems resolved for low-income renters.
The North Carolina Tenants Union, a statewide tenant advocacy group created 18 months ago, has had notable success organizing tenants across the state to fight against high rents, unlawful evictions and substandard rentals.
Most recently, the union helped Durham tenants win an amendment to the city’s housing code that prohibits landlords from collecting rent if a housing unit is found to be “imminently dangerous” to tenants’ health and safety.

MacLeod, the union’s executive director, said some tenants feel trapped in substandard housing because low-income residents often can’t afford higher-end, higher quality rentals. 
“When we talk to folks about why they stay,” MacLeod said, “the answer is ‘Well, this place is dangerous, but it is probably better than sleeping under an overpass.’” 
People who have been incarcerated, have poor credit or an eviction on their record are often forced into substandard housing because the bar to rent is lower, MacLeod said.
“What are the other options folks have, given that it’s often so hard to find an affordable place to live and moving is quite expensive?” MacLeod said.  
Nina Woods says she turned to the Red Cross for help when the ceiling in her Clubway Apartment came down, exposing mold.
Woods is a dialysis patient, and she’s concerned about her health. “I have a catheter in my chest, so I’m not even supposed to be breathing these toxins in at all,” Woods said.
The Red Cross provided money for a hotel and food after the incident, but only enough for a few days, she said.
“After that, I was right back in the apartment and they [Red Cross] told me that was a one-time thing,” Woods said.
Woods lives with her 13-year-old son. She has begun to limit her grandchildren’s visits, concerned about exposing them to mold.
Gaskins and Woods pay around $1,000 a month each for their two-bedroom apartments they share with their children. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Greenville is $1,200 per month, according to ZillowRentals. Gaskins said higher-end apartments can cost $1,800 or more per month.
“That’s kind of what the hardship is, because it’s hard to find affordable housing,” Gaskins said, adding that the same group that manages Clubway Apartments also manages several of the other lower-cost apartment complexes in Greenville.

In early October, Gaskins and other tenants reached their breaking point after water and sewer lines at the apartment complex malfunctioned, leaving them without water and sewer service for several days.
Gaskins reached out to city council members and the city’s code enforcement team to alert them about living conditions at Clubway Apartments.
“We couldn’t use the bathroom, we couldn’t do anything,” Gaskins said. “There was raw sewage in some people’s apartments. I mean, it was bad.”
City officials, Gaskin said, told tenants that the apartment complex’s management must be given “reasonable time” to make repairs. Tenants are still waiting to see what happens while they live in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, she said. 
“I don’t think asking to be able to go and use the bathroom or to be able to go to the sink and get some water,  I don’t think that’s asking too much,” Gaskins said.
NC Newsline left multiple messages with Greenville code enforcement officials, but they did not respond.
On Oct. 28, a little more than two weeks after Gaskins stepped up complaints, she was awakened by what she described as a team of eight to 12 sheriff’s deputies. 
They had been sent to raid her apartment after receiving an erroneous tip from a “trusted” confidential informant that she had drugs stashed in the apartment. No drugs were found and no charges were filed against Gaskins.
Still, Gaskins was handcuffed in front of her two sons, ages 10 and 14. Her 18-month-old daughter was not at the apartment during the raid. 
“They were frozen,” Gaskins said of her sons. “They didn’t know what to think. I didn’t want to show them that I was upset and get them upset. I tried to stay as calm as possible.”
Gaskins believes her criticism of management at Clubway Apartments led to the raid on her home. She is convinced someone at the apartment complex falsely reported that she was dealing drugs.
While the raid took place, an apartment manager was in the parking lot recording it, said Gaskins, who shared a copy of the recording with NC Newsline.
“The whole while of this so-called drug raid, the apartment managers were outside going live on Facebook, saying that because I wanted to air them out [by reporting problems at the apartment complex], they were going to air me out,” Gaskins said, “and that it was a drug raid and they felt vindicated and wanted to see me come downstairs in handcuffs.” 
Gaskins is in the early stages of preparing a lawsuit, which she said could include claims that her Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful searches and seizures were violated. Gaskins said she is also considering a defamation claim because her “political career has been completely destroyed” by the news of a drug raid on her apartment. Gaskins is a community activist and former congressional and mayoral candidate.

Pitt County Sheriff Paula Dance has apologized to Gaskins and acknowledged the raid was a mistake. She said it occurred after a longtime, trusted informant got the apartment number wrong, sending deputies to Gaskins’ apartment. The informant, Dance said, has no connection to the management at Clubway Apartments. 
Dance knows Gaskins. She follows her on social media and even considered hiring her for a program at the Pitt County Detention Center. Dance said she can see how the timing of the raid could lead Gaskins to believe deputies were used to get back at her. 
The fact that an apartment manager live-streamed the raid further fueled Gaskins’s thinking that the raid was a “set up,” Dance said.
“I can guarantee you that this sheriff will never allow my office to be weaponized against anybody, let alone somebody I know personally,” Dance said, “It is just all an unfortunate set of circumstances.”
MacLeod, the tenant union’s executive director, said it’s important for tenants in substandard rentals to band together to fight for improvements. Doing so, he said, makes it more difficult for landlords to retaliate against tenants. 
“Ask yourself, ‘How many people would I feel safe going to do this with?’ and that will help you have a sense of whether we need 30% of the complex signed on to this, or 50% or 80%,” MacLeod said. “Get enough people before you go public to fight for the real big things.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-825x1024.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

(Photo by R. Lehman/U.S. Forest Service)Public lands belong to all Americans — not just a fortunate few or the highest bidders. They’re a shared national treasure that defines our identity as Westerners. 
Last summer, Idahoans from every political background stood together to reject a dangerous plan to sell off these lands, and leaders like Congressman Mike Simpson and Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo stood with us. Public lands aren’t a luxury — they’re a legacy. Once they’re privatized or sold, we never get them back.
That legacy faces a serious new threat. Congressman Russ Fulcher is pushing a plan to explore transferring management — and eventually ownership — of Idaho’s national public lands to state government. He’s called this transition “imminent,” pointing to frustrations with federal agencies and concerns about programs like Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) and Secure Rural Schools (SRS).
Rep. Fulcher proposes exploration of transferring Idaho federal land to state and local control 

But his plan ignores a simple fact: Idaho cannot afford the more than $500 million annual cost of managing these federal lands. With Idaho already facing a $58 million shortfall this year and up to a $1 billion shortfall next year, the state would only have two options: raise taxes or sell our land. And Idahoans have made it clear repeatedly — they don’t want either.
Public lands are part of our family traditions, passed down from one generation to the next. They aren’t just property; they’re a way of life. Our public lands sustain local communities through Idaho’s multi-billion-dollar outdoor recreation economy; they support our $20 billion agriculture economy, and they’re the source of our clean drinking water. Congressman Fulcher’s proposal threatens those values and our way of life.
A recent survey found that 96 percent of Idaho registered voters want public lands to remain in public hands — a clear mandate from the people who live, work, and recreate here.
But there are real challenges on our public lands that need addressing, and that includes support for our public lands counties. The federal programs that help fund county services such as PILT and SRS enjoy a long history of strong bipartisan support from across the country. 
Just last week, the U.S. House reauthorized Secure Rural Schools funding on a 399–5 vote, hardly the sign of a program in danger. But these programs aren’t perfect, and Idaho’s counties deserve practical solutions from Congress that strengthen and stabilize county budgets without selling off or privatizing the lands that define Idaho.
This starts with improving PILT so that large public lands counties get their fair share of payments to handle the costs associated with providing access to our public lands, such as county road maintenance. We also need to work to make sure that SRS is reauthorized before it expires in the future. Critically, Congress needs to authorize permanent funding to cover the needs of both programs so that our counties have long-term budget security and stability.
We agree that public lands need improved management. Partnership programs like Good Neighbor Authority and Shared Stewardship programs have increased the capacity to get work done, but more improvements are needed. 
Agencies require funding and an adequate workforce to protect clean water, restore habitat for fish and wildlife, manage recreation, reduce hazardous fuels, and manage wildfire.

We also need to deepen collaboration with local communities, Tribes, and state agencies; and modernize policy so land managers have the adaptive tools needed in a changing West.
There are real challenges on our public lands but handing them over or selling them off to the highest bidder is not the solution. The responsible path is to work together with our counties, our state, Idahoans, and our federal delegation to strengthen county finances and ensure strong local input — while keeping these lands in public hands, where they belong. 
Congressman Fulcher’s proposal is a short-sighted plan that risks our way of life and robs future generations of what makes Idaho, Idaho.
Let’s keep Idaho’s public lands public, conserved, and accessible. Once they’re gone, they’re gone for good.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Louisiana cannot enforce a 2023 law that requires social media platforms to verify the ages of its users, a federal judge ruled Monday, declaring that it violates the First Amendment.
U.S. District Judge John deGravelles of Louisiana’s Middle District ruled in favor of NetChoice, a trade association for companies such as Meta, Snapchat, X and YouTube. The group sued the state in March to block the Secure Online Child Interaction and Age Limitation Act. It calls for all social media sites with more than 5 million users to make “reasonable efforts” to obtain proof of age to establish an account. Underage users need parental consent to join such platforms. 
In his 94-page ruling, deGravelles said he agreed with NetChoice’s arguments that the law is overly broad and said it takes an “all or nothing” approach to policing social media use. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Judge deGravelles, a federal court appointee of President Barack Obama, described the act as “under-inclusive” because minors could access the same adult-oriented content on unregulated websites and would not be protected from such materials if they meet one-time age-verification and parental-consent requirements.   
The law also goes to the other extreme, deGravelles said in his opinion.
“It is over-inclusive in that it burdens a large amount of protected speech — for minors and adults alike,” he wrote. “And it is seemingly largely redundant of existing parental controls, meaning that there is a less-restrictive alternative: Louisiana can encourage the use of available tools.”
Attorney General Liz Murrill, who was a defendant in the case, called the ruling from deGravelles “very disappointing” in a statement and said she intends to challenge the decision before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeal. The ruling calls for the state to cover NetChoice’s attorney’s fees and court costs.
“It’s a very reasonable policy decision by the State Legislature to impose age verification requirements on these companies,” Murrill said. “They can do it, it is not burdensome, and it’s unfortunate that NetChoice chooses to litigate over this issue instead of voluntarily putting those protections in place for kids. We have an all-hands-on deck problem, and they should be a part of the solution.”
The act, authored by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, allowed the attorney general to fine social media companies up to $2,500 for each violation of its terms.
Murrill has previously gone on the offensive against online companies, filing a lawsuit against Roblox in August in state court. The attorney general described the popular gaming site as “overrun with harmful content and child predators.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/social-media-phone.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 06:59:16.554380

(Screenshot via WisEye).Legislative leaders have been in discussions with WisconsinEye, the broadcast network that recently stopped offering coverage of state government business, about a potential long-term solution for the financial crisis facing the organization, the president of the organization told the Wisconsin Examiner Wednesday.
Due to a lack of funding, WisconsinEye halted its livestream coverage of state government on Monday and pulled down its video archive of over 30,000 hours of state government proceedings, candidate interviews and other programming. WisconsinEye launched in 2007 as an independent, nonprofit organization funded mostly by charitable donations.
Jon Henkes, president of WisconsinEye, has said that the organization had trouble raising sufficient funds to meet its operational costs due to a competitive fundraising environment. The organization sent a letter to lawmakers in November asking them to modify the terms of $10 million in state matching funds set aside for an endowment for the organization, giving it access to the money without raising the dollar-for-dollar match.
Henkes told the Wisconsin Examiner on Wednesday that conversations are taking place in the state Capitol as legislators look for a solution so that WisconsinEye can continue in its current form. 
“We’re not there yet. This is a process, and it’s going to take a little bit of time as it relates to when will we go back up,” Henkes said. “The conversations going on right now would be a long-term solution.” 
The organization has until June 30, 2026, to raise matching funds to access the $10 million endowment funding first set aside in the 2023-25 state budget.
WisconsinEye asked the state to provide about $1 million in funding without the matching requirement to cover its 2026 operational budget. 
Henkes said another potential solution would be for the state to remove the matching requirement and manage the money as an endowment on behalf of WisconsinEye. He said there would be a “significant amount of money that would generate earned income” to take care of the majority of the organization’s budget and complement the income WisconsinEye brings in from on-air sponsorships and small online giving.
“It’s early in the process, but the signals that we’re getting from the people who are the decision makers are very encouraging to us,” Henkes said. 
The Wisconsin Examiner reached out to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) for comment but did not hear back by Wednesday evening. 
LeMahieu has expressed skepticism about giving the organization state funding, telling the Associated Press that it’s “important to make sure the public can view what’s going on in state government” but that “looking at the way [WisconsinEye is] currently run, it seems like they’re really burning through money. It’s not the most effective use of taxpayer money, so we’re not going to give WisconsinEye a blank check to keep running it irresponsibly.” He also told the Wisconsin State Journal that it “may not be the most responsible way to provide this service to the public.”
Democratic Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview last month that she thinks WisconsinEye is “essential” and that lawmakers “should have structured their funding a little differently in the state budget, but we have an opportunity to do so now to make sure that they can provide that service.”
Democratic Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) told the Examiner in an interview on Monday that WisconsinEye has been a “helpful tool” that has been “nice for people to be able to stay at home and be able to watch what we’re doing” and she is open to having conversations with her Democratic and Republican colleagues on a path forward. 
Henkes said the organization is still looking for funding from donors to help get its coverage up and running in the short term. 
“There are a couple of six-figure gift requests that are under consideration right now with prominent people in Wisconsin,” Henkes said, adding that those donations would put WisconsinEye in the position “to bridge the gap toward what the state intends to do and get us back on back on the air. We’re hopeful.”
“Our board has said, well, if we’ve got an agreement for the long-term, and we found some short-term funding, we’re back in business,” Henkes said.
Four Democratic lawmakers propose replacing WisconsinEye
A group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Rep. Brienne Brown (D-Whitewater), introduced their own proposal on Tuesday to replace WisconsinEye with a public affairs network run and operated by the state government. 
“Thanks to this shutdown, the public will not have online access to committee hearings and public meetings happening this week, which they have come to rely upon,” the lawmakers said in a co-sponsorship memo. “This failure underscores a fundamental need: Open government requires reliable and permanent public infrastructure, not a private entity that can be shut down due to difficulties raising funds or in an attempt to pressure legislators to provide funds. Public access should not be dependent on the generosity of donors.”
Under the proposal, the $10 million would be repurposed to start an Office of the Public Affairs Network that would be attached to the Department of Administration. The office would have a $2 million annual appropriation under the bill.
The network would need to provide live coverage of state government including all legislative floor sessions, all meetings of legislative committees, meetings of executive branch agencies, the state Supreme Court and other judicial proceedings, news conferences as well as related civic events.
According to the lawmakers’ memo, the office would need to operate in a “strictly nonpartisan manner” and “guarantee unrestricted public access without requirements such as online account registration, paywalls, or other burdens.”
A Public Affairs Network Board would also be created that would be responsible for appointing the director of the office and overseeing its activities. The board would include the governor, two public members appointed by the governor and four state lawmakers.
The bill also includes a provision to allow current employees of WisconsinEye who have demonstrated their talent and technical expertise to be rehired.
The DOA would also need to attempt to obtain the complete digital archives of WisconsinEye in order to permanently maintain them as part of the new network’s archive.
Henkes had a number of concerns about the proposal. 
“WisconsinEye, as an independent network, is in fact in the tradition of Wisconsin’s commitment to open, transparent government of the people, for the people, by the people,” Henkes said. “We just strongly believe that a state-run, government-controlled state Capitol network is not in the best interest of Wisconsin.”
Henkes said the proposal brings up questions about whether having a board that includes lawmakers and the governor could politicize things and “inject partisanship into decision making on programming and what committee gets covered and what committee doesn’t get covered.”
Henkes said he is also concerned about the expanded capacity that lawmakers proposed. He said that under its contract, WisconsinEye is required to cover floor sessions as well as a certain percentage of committee hearings, but not everything. 
“Truth be told, the Legislature in its wisdom in the current contract with WisconsinEye does not require us to cover every committee hearing because they know that some of those are of minimal interest to the public and would probably draw the attention of 10 viewers,” Henkes said, adding that he also thought the cost to expand that coverage would be “at least double” the $2 million lawmakers included annually.
Henkes added that for 18 years WisconsinEye has exceeded its contractual obligations and that includes covering over 14,000 hours of live video, which is also archived, as well as over 16,000 additional hours of interviews with hundreds of candidates for office, news conferences, rallies, debates and other coverage. 
“We bleed for this mission and we care greatly about civil dialogue in this state and inspiring informed voter participation, and it’s a model in terms of programming and coverage that’s exceptional,” Henkes said. “Its just that the funding model in the current philanthropic environment is not sustainable.”

(Photo of Martin Administrative Building, City of Martin Facebook)MARTIN, Tenn. — The City of Martin’s Finance Committee — a group of community members and aldermen responsible for overseeing the taxpayer dollars that keep the city running — met Monday for the first time in several months. 
They had a lot to talk about. 
Martin’s former mayor Randy Brundige and former economic development director Brad Thompson were indicted on felony charges on Nov. 12 after a Tennessee Comptroller investigation found they misused hundreds of thousands of dollars of public funds. The Martin Board of Aldermen accepted their resignations on Nov. 25. 
During the last three years of Brundige’s administration, the finance committee met about once per year in May to review the city’s proposed budget. Meeting minutes are not available on the city’s website from 2023 through present day.
Now, Martin’s finances are “under watch,” recently-appointed Mayor David Belote, a long-time alderman who previously served as vice mayor, said Monday.
The state’s comptroller instructed the city to build its cash reserves and retire more debt over the next five years. Martin had $257,000 in its cash fund at the end of the 2025 fiscal year. By 2030, that cash fund should hold more than $2.7 million, according to the comptroller’s plan. 
That means the city should have $465,000 in the fund by the end of fiscal year 2026.
Martin reels after former mayor, economic development director charged with theft, misconduct

Those goals have Martin officials shaking the proverbial couch cushions for savings, however large or small.
“It’s going to take some hard work for a lot of people in the next few years,” Belote told the Lookout following Monday’s meeting.
Searching for savings
Belote presented the committee with a list of savings possibilities totaling $111,250. It includes shifting the $48,750 mayor’s salary from the general fund to other sources, freeing up general fund dollars. Savings possibilities include trimming administrative expenses, cutting $10,000 from the legislative out of town travel budget and saving a remaining $6,000 intended for legislative board-approved projects. Closing out the Community Development director’s salary, travel, and other line items could save another $34,500.
These suggestions are not final and would need approval from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. 
Martin will retire around $800,000 of debt in the next five years, Belote said. 
“This is a call to be creative. No stone unturned, here. That’s what we’ve got to do,” he said.
The committee also discussed exploring the potential sale of the Weldon Building, a historic building that once served as the city’s post office and later the city library. A series of leaks and air conditioning problems has left the building with extensive damage that will not be covered by insurance. 
The committee agreed that the city should begin researching renovation costs and the building’s value in its current state.
Committee members voted unanimously to recommend that the Board of Mayor and Aldermen sell two city-owned vehicles previously used by Brundige and Thompson — together worth an estimated $80,000 that would be returned to the city’s sewer and gas fund for public works equipment needs.
The committee also voted to recommend halting three ongoing grant-funded projects that require city contributions to move forward, including:

Two sidewalk renovation and street beautification projects on Elm Street that would cost a combined $695,000 to complete (already-completed engineering work can be revisited in the future)
A multimodal project on N. Lindell street from Brian Brown Memorial Greenway to Palace Street, connecting to Park Place Apartments that would cost $113,800 to complete, and is not expected to start this fiscal year

‘Moving forward’
City officials are still in the early stages of sorting through the fallout from Brundige and Thompson’s indictments. 
In late November, when Belote took the reins as mayor, he too said he would consider resigning after several community members voiced their concerns about an overall lack of oversight from the Board of Aldermen during Brundige’s tenure. 
But Belote led the city’s next Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting on Dec. 8, where the board selected Ward 1 Alderwoman Celeste Taylor to serve as vice mayor. 
“We’re moving forward,” Belote said Monday, reiterating that he plans to retire after the city elects a new mayor in 10 months.
Belote’s former Ward 2 seat is now vacant, and is expected to be filled by an alderman selected by the board from a pool of applicants in January.
Martin mayor indicted on theft of funds, official misconduct 

Ward 3 Alderman Jacob Crowe in November called for the resignations of Belote and Aldermen Danny Nanney and Terry Hankins, as the trio served on the Finance Committee during the period when the former mayor and finance director allegedly misused city funds. Hankins said he will not seek reelection in 2026. 
Belote announced on Dec. 8 that Crowe, who has a background in finance, will now serve on the Finance Committee after his seat is confirmed in January. Crowe attended Monday’s meeting and was invited to be part of committee discussions, though he cannot yet vote. Another community member seat on the committee is vacant and is expected to be filled in January. 
The Finance Committee on Monday voted to recommend that the Board of Mayor and Aldermen further expand the committee, adding an additional two community seats. The committee also decided to meet regularly on the third Thursday of each month.
The mayor is responsible for calling finance committee meetings, Belote said. At the beginning of Brundige’s 20-plus-year tenure as mayor, the committee met every month. Belote said three aldermen can together force the mayor to call a finance committee meeting. Though Belote said he did personally ask the mayor to hold more committee meetings over the last three years, it does not appear that the board took action to force Brundige’s hand.
“It got very lax,” Belote said Monday. “But we are back, and we’re going to talk about things.”

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)As West Virginia leaders plan to make economic development a cornerstone of the 2026 legislative session, a new report published Wednesday shows the state has far to go — both technically and financially — in addressing basic infrastructure needs.
The report, published by the American Society of Civil Engineers’ West Virginia Section, has the state receiving an average of a “D+” grade for its infrastructure. It accounts for 18 infrastructure categories, ranging from roads, bridges and dams to school facilities, drinking water, broadband and more.

ASCE publishes these state-specific report cards about every four years. The most recent one published in West Virginia, according to Tabitha Lafferre, the president of the ASCE’s West Virginia Section, was in 2020 and only covered five infrastructure categories. That year, she said, the state received a “D.”
At a news conference on Wednesday, Lafferre said it was good to see the state improve slightly in its infrastructure status. But, she continued, it’s clear that much work remains to be done.
“This [D+] is still two notches below the national grade of a C, and unfortunately, it’s not a grade that we can find acceptable if we want an infrastructure network that can protect our residents and businesses sufficiently,” Lafferre said. “However, this represents progress and I will say, it’s something that we should be proud of.”
Seven of the 18 categories detailed in the report card — aviation, broadband, dams, drinking water, roads, school building infrastructure and wastewater — included estimates on how much funding will be needed to both maintain current infrastructure and meet potential future needs. Those seven categories alone totaled nearly $13 billion in estimated funding needs over the next several years. 
The report card emphasized that extreme weather events in West Virginia — which are becoming increasingly common due to climate change — present massive challenges in addressing infrastructure needs. Other challenges highlighted in the report throughout several categories include the state’s population decline, rapidly aging and out-of-date infrastructure, rugged natural terrain and funding restraints.
Throughout the state report, authors stressed the importance of federal funding in both upkeeping and improving the state’s existing infrastructure. 
The report does not account for previously allocated federal infrastructure funding sources — grants and otherwise — that have been under threat by the Trump administration over the past year. Those include initiatives passed by Congress through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the American Rescue Plan Act, which were both signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2021.
Lafferre, responding to a question regarding federal funding instability, said Wednesday that part of the reason the report card is compiled is to show lawmakers — statewide and federally — how critical it is to protect and increase funding for infrastructure initiatives.
“One of the most fundamental things about the report card is we can use it as a tool to take to our legislators to show, you know, this is the reason we need more funding,” Lafferre said. “The IIJA is great. But it was a one time thing. We need that (funding) consistently across the state to improve our efforts.”
Lafferre called the state’s infrastructure systems the “backbone of West Virginia’s economy.” 
“When it’s functioning as planned, it’s often out of sight, out of mind,” Lafferre said. “But when infrastructure encounters a serious problem or a system fails, the consequences can affect people’s quality of life and have serious, widespread economic impact.”
Rodney Holbert, the region four governor for the statewide ASCE chapter, said improving the state’s infrastructure and ensuring funding is secured to address future needs is crucial if the state wants to build up its economy.
“The future of our state relies on our ability to maintain and improve upon the current conditions of these infrastructure networks,” Holbert said. “These systems drive economic growth, create jobs, improve public health and protect us from environmental threats.”
West Virginia’s below-average infrastructure grade comes as state leaders plan on making economic development a cornerstone of the upcoming legislative session. Republicans in the state House of Delegates said earlier this month that they want to see heavy investment and innovation for the state’s aviation industry. Per the report card, the state’s airports are estimated to need at least $132 million in infrastructure investments over the next five years to adequately operate.
Throughout his first year in office, Gov. Patrick Morrisey has repeatedly touted his “Backyard Brawl” economic growth plan, which aims to see West Virginia compete more aggressively with surrounding states in recruiting businesses, increasing development opportunities and more.
Per the ASCE, every state surrounding the Mountain State — Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania — received higher average infrastructure grades than West Virginia in their most recent report cards.



The 2025 ASCE Report Card for West Virginia’s Infrastructure was compiled by a committee of more than 25 civil engineers from throughout the state with support from about 50 former Fairmont State University Students.
The infrastructure report card is published about every four years, with the last statewide report coming out in 2020.
The 2025 report looked at 18 infrastructure categories and used several metrics — including the condition of the infrastructure, its current and future capacity, funding sources compared to estimated future needs, operation and maintenance needs and more — to assign letter grades.
Grades given in each of the categories are meant to reflect how the infrastructure itself is performing, not the work done by individuals to maintain and upkeep it.

 The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has agreed on a deal for 120 beds at the Burleigh/Morton jail in Bismarck. 
The agreement guarantees that the state agency will pay for the beds, even if not all of them are full, at a rate of $105 per day or $4.6 million annually. The daily rate is less than the Burleigh-Morton jail’s typical rate of $115 per bed that it charges other counties and federal agencies. 
The state will use the Burleigh/Morton jail for minimum security inmates and programming. The corrections department will provide case managers and treatment staff but the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Office is in charge of staffing correctional officers.

“It’s going to work out pretty nice for both of us,” Colby Braun, director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said in an interview. 
Burleigh County Sheriff Kelly Leben said the contract helps offset the jail’s operating costs. 
“We pay the same price to heat and cool that building, whether there’s one inmate in there or 500. It just gets a lot cheaper, the more you got in there,” he said. 
The 120-bed area had been used by the jail before, but is sitting unused in part because of staffing challenges, Maj. Trent Wangen of the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Office told a group of state lawmakers last week. 
The jail has been able to hire more staff in recent months, making the deal possible.

Braun said the jail in Bismarck along with 96 beds from a temporary mancamp on the grounds of the Missouri River Correctional Center should satisfy the corrections department’s space needs in the short term, which was an issue during this year’s legislative session.
The corrections department hit its capacity for male inmates of 1,624 in 2023. The number of inmates has continued to grow. The male population as of September was 1,919.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s budget proposal highlighted money for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to staff and operate a new section of the Grand Forks County Correctional Center. 
But the Grand Forks County Commission eventually backed away from the deal. 
Grand Forks County Sheriff Andrew Schneider, who operates the jail in Grand Forks, said the negotiations with the corrections department hit some snags.
Schneider said one issue was concerns from county commissioners about inmates being released into the Grand Forks area. Schneider said the corrections department eventually addressed the concern, but Grand Forks County chose not to reopen negotiations. 
Schneider said the new section of the Grand Forks jail has been used to allow for some renovations on older parts of the facility. The sheriff said he hopes to have the staff in place by Feb. 1 to use all the beds at the jail. 
The Legislature passed a budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that included $28.4 million for payments to county and regional jails to house state prisoners. 
Leben said state funding in the 2027 legislative session will be key to keeping the arrangement going.

Wangen said he expects the arrangement to continue through multiple two-year budget cycles. 
Wangen and Schneider said their jails often provide space for federal agencies, too, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Marshals Service. 
Rachelle Juntunen, deputy director of adult services for the correction department, also told lawmakers that the Heart River Correctional Center in Mandan for female inmates is progressing and is expected to open in late 2027. 
When it is open, the Dakota Women’s Correctional Rehab Center in New England could be converted into a facility for up to 126 male inmates, Juntunen said. 
In addition, the North Dakota Legislature set aside $20 million to plan a new medium-security prison that’s proposed next to the State Penitentiary.

As an acute care physician in rural Michigan, I encounter patients with psychiatric crises, often due to inadequate access to preventive mental health services. These are Michiganders who either don’t have insurance coverage, or if they have it, are unable to access consistent outpatient care due to constraints such as lack of reliable transportation to appointments, prohibitive expense of medications, and limited coverage of outpatient facilities due to Medicaid cuts.
Consequently, these patients are brought in by police or EMS when at a point of crisis, often arriving with complicated acute medical conditions in addition to a psychiatric emergency. Unfortunately, due to societal stigma and policy decisions over generations, we have underfunded both research and medical care for this population.
My role in these cases is to stabilize the medical issues before transfer to a psychiatric unit. However, a significant bottleneck arises when medically stabilized patients wait days in the emergency department for an available psychiatric bed, lowering ER bed availability for other critically urgent cases.
The increase in ER case load prolongs their confinement in a stressful, uncomfortable environment. The overcrowded ER, with just a curtain separating each patient, is inherently ill- suited for people grappling with severe distress, anxiety, and psychosis.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Psychiatric patients are either transferred to the psychiatric unit or, if ineligible for inpatient care, there is compounded pressure on the hospital social worker to secure long-term support with paltry outpatient options as their only recourse.
Without realistic access to medication, reliable transportation, or stable housing, an aspect that could easily be addressed through public policy – many fall back into crisis and return to the ER, perpetuating a cycle of readmission that is tough to break.
This reality is particularly dire in our rural communities, where mental health professionals and social resources are especially scarce, inpatient beds are few, and transportation barriers make continuity of care nearly impossible. The hospital in these scenarios serves as a safety net with critical resources that are necessary because the preventative resources are inadequate.
Without policies to protect Michiganders from private interests profiting through insurance and third-party actors like pharmacy benefit managers, we will continue to see worsening health outcomes and rising costs.
We know that for every percentage increase in local public health spending, there is a decrease in mortality rates for that region, particularly in rural communities. We know that publicly funded programs such as Medicaid improve access to primary care and timely care for chronic conditions. This is especially crucial for rural communities which often see the largest benefits in reduced cost- related barriers to care.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed earlier this year, will exacerbate our collective crisis. The current mental health crisis is the result of decades of neglect and flawed public health policy, heightened by societal stigma and underfunding. Historic cuts to public health, including the 1965 Medicaid prohibition on hospital funding and the subsequent 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act’s reduction of mental health grants, shifted patient management away from community care and onto the criminal justice system and ERs.
In the setting of this larger picture, I return to my community hospital and the health care access it provides for my community. The most dangerous action Congress could take now is to cut resources from our already overburdened community hospitals, which function as a critical social safety net when our public health fails. Losing further resources in this context means those on the margins will be the hardest hit, deepening a systemic crisis initiated by policy decisions decades ago.
Medicaid and Medicare funding cuts will further limit hospitals and providers’ ability to provide around-the-clock support, slashing the very funding that sustains behavioral health teams, community partnerships, and other critical resources that hold the system together.
When Congress slashes hospital reimbursements and critical access resources, it is not cutting inefficiencies; it is cutting lifelines. The result is predictable: longer waits, fewer staffed psychiatric beds, and patients discharged back into crisis because there is nowhere else for them to go.
Continuing to target health care access will further abandon American hospitals already stretched thin by treating those impacted by the opioid epidemic, workforce shortages, continued burdensome and excessive policies from commercial insurers and lingering pandemic pressures.
Protecting funding for Medicare and Medicaid means protecting access, ensuring that the next patient in crisis finds care and not a crowded waiting room.

This story was produced by the Tennessee Lookout and WPLN News, with support from the Pulitzer Center and the Education Writers Association. 
After the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests about racial injustice in 2020, the Tennessee Legislature formed a committee to answer a question: How much do we owe Tennessee State University?
TSU was created in the early 1900s as a land grant university for Black residents who weren’t allowed to attend the state’s other land grant university, the University of Tennessee. This was not unusual: Every Southern state founded at least one Black public university, as part of their efforts to maintain segregation while remaining eligible for federal funds.
These universities were all poorly funded by their state governments throughout the Jim Crow era. And even after, states often continued to shortchange their historically Black universities. But the exact amount of underfunding is vast, hard to calculate, and even harder to make a political case for. 
Here are four ways to make that calculation.
State land grant funds since 1957: $544 million
Because TSU was created as a land grant school, it’s entitled to money from the federal government to fund certain programs related to science and agriculture. The state is then legally required to match those funds.
Rep. Harold Love, D-Nashville, spoke on the House floor in 2016 about the state’s ongoing failure to match those funds for TSU’s land grant programs. The legislature agreed to start matching the funds from that year forward, but Love wanted the state to rectify the previous years of underfunding.
He then chaired the bipartisan Joint Land-Grant Institution Funding Study Committee, which sought to tally how much the state owed TSU. According to a report by the Office of Legislative Budget Analysis, the state failed to allocate any land grant funds to TSU from fiscal year 1957 through 2007. The University of Tennessee, however, did receive its full state match and sometimes even more than what was federally required.
The committee calculated the total sum owed as between $150 million and $544 million. (The difference depended on which ratio the state used to determine how much federal land grant funding was allocated to TSU compared to UT.) These numbers did not account for inflation. The legislature later budgeted $250 million in backpay for TSU.
State land grant funds before 1957: Unknown
Love says he still wants to know how much state funding for TSU’s land grant programs was missing before 1957. Those budget books weren’t in the legislative library when Love was researching the funding a few years ago, he says, but he has since found the records. He has not yet finished the calculations.
Love says asking for additional back pay would require some political strategy. He declined to say whether he would bring it up in the state legislature in early 2026. 
 ”I would probably work on the rest of the $544 (million) first,” he said. “It’s been my experience that people like to get one thing and then move to the next.”
Per-pupil spending since 1987: $2.1 billion
In 2023, the Biden administration shared a vastly different calculation: Instead of looking specifically at land grant funding, it researched how much Tennessee spent per pupil at its two land grant universities since 1987, based on their overall state allocations and enrollment. 










We can clearly see how these institutions are being robbed, literally robbed, to preserve segregation.


– Crystal Sanders, Emory University


It found that the state spent significantly more on each UT student compared to each TSU student, for a total financial gap of $2.1 billion. While the disparity is not necessarily illegal, it is a meaningful indication of how much the state has invested in the students at each of its two land grant universities.
Biden’s education secretary, Miguel Cardona, urged Tennessee at the time to make “a substantial state allocation” in addition to doubling its land grant matching money going forward. Although the $2.1 billion figure became a rallying cry on TSU’s campus, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee quickly dismissed the Biden administration’s calculation as a “political number.” It has not gained additional traction in the state legislature.
The Debt: Almost 60 years ago, a court case at TSU transformed Tennessee higher education

Segregation scholarships in the ‘30s-’60s: $8 billion
Crystal Sanders, a professor of African American studies at Emory University, identified another slice of funding that was taken from many public HBCUs around the South from the 1920s to the 1960s. During segregation, Black students couldn’t attend predominately white institutions, and Black universities had limited options for graduate programs. 
So Tennessee passed a law in 1937 saying that the state would pay for Black students to go to graduate schools out of state — and would pull the money directly from TSU’s budget. This worsened the financial strain on public HBCUs that were already struggling with poor state funding.
“We can clearly see how these institutions are being robbed, literally robbed, to preserve segregation,” Sanders said.
Sanders found the budget books that show how much money the state spent on each Black graduate student. She estimates that, with inflation, Tennessee owes TSU about $8 billion to account for the funds it took from the school for segregation scholarships.
It’s a large sum, but Sanders believes using historical records to make a calculation is pivotal to making the political case for repayment. “ You can say, here are my receipts. This is what I’m owed,” she says. “This is not how I feel on Monday, and maybe my opinion’s going to change on Thursday. … This is about a debt that the state owes, and states have to pay their debts.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)In recent months, Memphis residents have been told — by federal officials and echoed by local leadership — that the city is safer. 
Crime statistics are cited. Task forces are announced. Press conferences are held. Yet for many Memphians, especially those who live in over-policed neighborhoods, these assurances ring hollow — not because reform is impossible, but because accountability remains largely unproven.
Nearly a year ago, Mayor Paul Young announced the formation of a task force focused on policing and public safety. Since then, there has not been a single comprehensive, public-facing document outlining that task force’s findings, recommendations or implementation outcomes. No clear timeline. No benchmarks. No explanation of what has changed as a result of its work. This silence echoes the skepticism many residents already feel toward initiatives like the Memphis Safe Task Force — initiatives that promise reform but rarely show their work.
This is not merely a matter of political theater or messaging. It is a question of political leadership.
The Department of Justice’s Pattern and Practice Investigation into the Memphis Police Department documented serious and, in some cases, unlawful conduct by officers. The findings were not abstract. They were specific. They detailed patterns of excessive force, unconstitutional practices and systemic failures that demanded more than acknowledgment. They demanded consequences.
Stockard on the Stump: Memphis mayor balks at community call for police consent decree

Yet to this day, there is no publicly identifiable officer that city leadership can point to as having been disciplined, terminated or otherwise held accountable as a direct result of reforms implemented in response to the DOJ’s findings. If accountability has occurred, the public has not seen evidence of it. And accountability that cannot be demonstrated cannot be trusted.
It is important to be clear: This critique is not rooted in a belief that Mayor Young is incapable of political courage. In fact, the opposite is true. The mayor has demonstrated fortitude and resolve on other contentious matters. He has stood firm amid criticism surrounding major development projects, including xAI. He has asserted his authority decisively when he believed boards were operating inadequately, as seen in his intervention with the Memphis Area Transit Authority Board. In those instances, whether we agree with his actions or not, the mayor showed a willingness to confront dysfunction directly and publicly.
That is precisely why the absence of comparable leadership on police reform is so troubling.
When it comes to policing, the mayor’s office has not exhibited the same level of urgency, transparency or political courage. Nor has Police Chief C.J. Davis offered the public a clear accounting of how DOJ findings have translated into concrete disciplinary actions or structural reforms within MPD. Leadership that expects trust must be willing to demonstrate accountability, especially in an institution with a long history of harming the communities it claims to protect.
Compounding this failure is the role of the Memphis City Council. The council possesses oversight authority,approving budgets, receiving briefings and having the power to demand documentation, timelines and measurable outcomes. Yet far too often, members have functioned as a passive audience rather than an active check. When legislative bodies fail to insist on evidence, executive silence becomes normalized. Oversight deferred is accountability denied.
This is not a call for spectacle or public shaming. It is a call for governance. Police reform cannot be reduced to dashboards, talking points or selective statistics. Reform requires public documentation, clear standards and demonstrable consequences for misconduct. Anything less erodes trust and deepens the very crises of legitimacy city leaders claim they are addressing.
If Memphis leadership is serious about reform, it must answer a basic question: what, if anything, has the mayor’s task force actually produced? The absence of any public findings or recommendations suggests that reform has been reduced to performance rather than practice. 
In the meantime, the city’s dismissal of the Department of Justice’s report as “meaningless” has left thousands of residents — already subjected to pretextual and racially disproportionate traffic stops—exposed to the very forms of police misconduct reform was supposed to address. This is not public safety. It is punitive populism masquerading as policing, operating without transparency, accountability, or meaningful oversight.
Memphis does not need more assurances that it is safer. It needs evidence that leadership is willing to govern with transparency, courage, and integrity — especially when it comes to policing. Political courage has been shown in other arenas. It is far past time to show it here, too.

Sarah Beckstrom's casket is displayed at a funeral home in her hometown of Webster Springs, West Virginia, on Dec. 5, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Department of Defense)It takes right at two hours to drive from Webster County High School to Grafton, West Virginia. 
That’s if you run over to Cowen and cut across to Birch River and U.S. Route 19, then up Interstate 79. Going the old way through Hacker Valley, French Creek, Hodgesville, Philippi and up will take you a half hour longer through some of the prettiest country God ever created. 
It took Sarah Beckstrom 20 years and a very different road for her to get there. 
It is a 280 mile drive from the Webster County High School to the corner of 17th and I streets in Northwest Washington, D.C. Five and a half hours by car, not counting the District’s infamous traffic, from unincorporated Upperglade, West Virginia. Home of the fighting Highlanders, where Sarah Beckstrom graduated high school in 2023.
Martinsburg, West Virginia, is much closer to the nation’s capital, both as officially part of the DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area and as the terminus of Maryland Area Rail Commuter’s Brunswick Line train service to Union Station. Andrew Wolfe has spent almost all of his 24 years there. 
Two West Virginia communities that, while vastly different from each other, share the universally understood nomenclature of “back home” to the two activated troops explaining where they are from. Troops who were supposed to be working through the Thanksgiving holiday. Two West Virginians, from a state that is roughly 0.05% of the American population, at that moment part of the less than 1% of Americans serving on duty in uniform at any given time. 
Until a monster with murder on the mind turned that corner near Farragut Square and opened fire on both of them. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom was mortally wounded and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe was badly hurt, but miraculously survived and is now in a rehabilitation facility. 
The news of Sarah’s passing was announced by the president on Thanksgiving night. The cold, huddled group holding American flags, singing and praying in a downtown Webster Springs vigil switched from hope to grief when informed. Their response was agreement to reconvene the next night and hold another vigil with more prayer, more sharing, more community. On that Saturday night, the gymnasium of Webster County High School hosted a more formal observance. The school’s JROTC color guard posted the colors, normally a routine formality of honoring the American flag, now heavy with symbolism that was anything but routine to the gathered mass coming to grips with one of their own killed in the service of their country. 
West Virginians serving in harm’s way is nothing new. During the Vietnam Era, West Virginia had more military deaths per capita than any other state. For a state that does not have a major active duty military presence, a tremendous number of Mountaineers have served in uniform. West Virginia ranks 11th among the states in veterans per capita according to 2023 data.
All those dearly departed service members across generations who did not go to Arlington or family plots, or just want to be with their own kind, or take the government up on burial benefits, need somewhere to rest. West Virginians have been burying their service members and veterans in Grafton since the Civil War. There are two national cemeteries there, some four miles apart. The Grafton National Cemetery lies in town, a grid of white headstones on a meticulously maintained three acre green square with names and dates stretching back to the alleged first casualty of the Civil War. The West Virginia National Cemetery replaced it in the 1980s after two World Wars, Korea, Vietnam and Cold War veterans filled the old one with 2,100 service members. 
On Thursday, Dec. 11, among 90 acres and nearly 7,000 of her fellow West Virginia servicemembers, Sarah Beckstrom arrived in Grafton and her final resting place. There were full military honors. The Army honor guard performed many of the same motions their Webster County High School juniors did, but with the crisper professionalism the weight of the moment required. There were words of comfort and tears of grief. There was a rifle salute. Taps pierced through the cold air. There was the prescribed statement of thanks on behalf of a grateful nation as the meticulously folded flag was passed from casket, to honor guard, to General Seward, to grieving parents. 
All prescribed and rigidly adhered to ceremonies guided by protocols, tradition, generations of military customs and courtesies that govern the honoring of the dead. Honors delivered by service members who all understand one day, one way or another, it will be themselves under the flag, their family in the chairs along the grave, their dates inscribed on the stark white headstone. 
The civilian political, social media and news media worlds have no such protocols.  
There will always be a fairytale longing for a world where the military and the folks who serve in it are “not political,” but that isn’t the world we live in. While America has a unique all-volunteer civilian-controlled military, that civilian control is mostly selected, appointed, confirmed and answerable to elected officials. Service members swear an oath to the constitution and have an official policy of being nonpartisan, while taking orders from people who had to master partisan politics to be in the position to give orders in the first place. As the attention and content economy come to dominate news media and become the primary tool of politics, it is foolish to think the military is not going to be used for political reasons. 
But that isn’t new either. Ask mistreated troops returning from Vietnam if the military was “political.” The latest batch of American veterans flooding the Veteran Affairs system from the global “War on Terror” have plenty of thoughts on two decades of being the instrument of government policy and power projection, fancy words for politics. Some of them served in Afghanistan, and with the in-custody accused terrorist coming from there, they will once again watch the debate over operations in which they personally served rehashed by folks who mostly didn’t. 
There will rightfully be outrage at the heinous attack and the perpetrator who did it. There will be scrutiny of the investigation. The unraveling of decades of overseas conflict, years of policy, months of controversial coverage, and weeks of legal challenges leading up to the chain of events that had two West Virginia Guard members in Farragut Square the day before Thanksgiving will be messy, emotionally charged, highly political. And it will mostly break along lines of what folks’ political and ideological priors were the morning of the attack. 
“They shouldn’t have been there” is a natural response, a trending take, possibly even true, and misses the point entirely in the uncoupled world of hot takes. The service is never not dangerous. Spc. Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Wolfe were there, right where they were told to be, doing what they were told to do, because that is what troops do. They stood their post; they fought, bled — and in Beckstrom’s case, died — as their comrades and first responders rushed to help. If history is any judge at all, those facts will be quickly lost in the policy and political debate that is coming. 
To send troops anywhere is to understand that troops are in harm’s way everywhere. That is the downside to having the entire burden of upholding the American experiment of a people self-governing on the shoulders of less than 1% of the population on active military duty at any given time. So few shoulder the burden, the burden isn’t even understood, knowledge of it mostly reduced to well-meaning platitudes. The wider political debate will always be exponentially more widely covered than the circle of family, friends, and community that bear that burden, and those who directly suffer the loss because of it.
The “should they have been there” discussion should be focused on the civilian leadership that gives the orders. Fair questions on their preparedness, rules of engagement, levels of readiness and such should be debated. The civilian leadership of the military and chain of command always should give an account for the loss of the troops they command. Anyone in the military or chain of command who deflects or avoids accountability and answers is unfit for that role. But that accountability debate should be had far away from the families cleaning up the aftermath of those political and policy decisions, while understanding that debate does nothing to lessen their loss. 
The families of the fallen always live in an almost parallel world during the grieving process. They are in our world but not of it, their loss becoming a bubble with a perimeter of well-meaning folks wanting to help. But only they are experiencing the loss, no matter how much sympathy the world tries to guide their way. There is the coverage and outpouring of emotion, the support, the thoughts and prayers, the military and civilian leadership offering anything they can do to help. But graveside service ends. The car doors shut and drive away. The grave is closed. The stillness of the cemetery among the rolling hills of Grafton returns as status quo, and the family waits for time to try and ease the loss as best it can. The news cycle moves on, evidenced by the burial getting only a fraction of the news coverage the heinous shooting that necessitated it did. 
Meanwhile, West Virginians mourn one of their own, while trying to support and pray another of their own through to recovery. Martinsburg presses on supporting one of their own as Wolfe recovers. Webster County honors and grieves for their fallen Beckstrom. The wider world rages and turns. The monster that did this will get a fair trial, far more than he gave American service members with his wicked attack. The political debates will overshadow the citizen soldiers, though memorials and remembrances will be made. And all the while, others will take up the mantle of the 1% serving so the 99% can go about their lives in peace and freedom. 
Among the rolling hills and stark white markers of the service members’ graves in Grafton, the family, honor guard and media depart and reverent silence once again rules. Until the next burial. The uneasy peace and quiet that hang heavy in places of remembrance like the West Virginia National Cemetery. Reverence we think of as honoring the dead, but really it is the living trying to make sense of it all, trying to understand the enormity of eternity from the mortal plane, and come to peace with what is. Peace that feels — for the family, friends and community of Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe, and the country that they took those bullets for — so very far away.

(Photo submitted)Estill Curtis Pennington Jr., the art historian who more than anyone else insisted that Kentucky’s visual culture be taken seriously — on its own terms and in its own voice — died in Paris on  Dec. 16. He was 75 and spent his final months at Bourbon Heights Nursing Home.
For decades, Pennington, widely known as “Buck,” stood against a stubborn assumption in American art history: that important work originates only in New York, Boston or Paris (France). With patience, rigor and an unmistakable Central Kentucky accent, he demonstrated otherwise. His life’s work mapped a tradition of artists rooted in the Ohio River Valley and the broader South whose achievement, he argued persuasively, belonged at the center of the national story, not at its edges.
“Kentucky has lost its premier interpreter of Kentucky art history,” said Richard H.C. Clay, trustee emeritus of the Speed Art Museum in Louisville. “His expertise on Matthew Harris Jouett, Oliver Frazer, Joseph Henry Bush, and Aaron Corrine — along with our Commonwealth’s later portraitists — was unparalleled. I, like so many, have lost a treasured friend.”
Pennington’s most widely cited book, ”Lessons in Likeness: Portrait Painters in Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley, 1802–1920” (University Press of Kentucky, 2010), remains the indispensable work on early regional portraiture. Drawing on decades of archival research, he traced painters from frontier itinerants to academically trained professionals, revealing how portraiture chronicled ambition, authority and cultural change in a young and evolving society. It is a book that quietly reshaped how scholars understand American portraiture beyond the eastern seaboard.
Estill “Buck” Pennington Jr.
Earlier, he had published ”Kentucky: The Master Painters from the Frontier Era to the Great Depression” (2008), a sweeping survey that placed the commonwealth’s artists within national artistic movements while never losing sight of local circumstance or individual temperament. Louisville writer Warren Payne edited the volume; his wife, Julie, provided the photography. “For his books, Estill knew exactly what he wanted — from layout to illustration to even the paper used,” Payne recalled. “‘Kentucky: The Master Painters’ is the art history of Kentucky. We were glad we could help bring it to fruition.”
Pennington’s reputation extended well beyond Kentucky. His ”Look Away: Reality and Sentiment in Southern Art” (1989) helped establish Southern art history as a scholarly field, while ”Downriver: Currents of Style in Louisiana Painting, 1800–1950” (1991) offered a richly layered account of artistic exchange along the Mississippi River. These works made clear that Southern artists were not merely provincial imitators but engaged participants in modern cultural currents. The results of his intellectual reframing work can be seen in museums every day, including the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans.
Even as his health declined, Pennington remained intellectually engaged, giving public lectures on art history, advising art collectors and putting the finishing touches on Volume Two of “The Annals of Bourbon County.” He was recently interviewed for the forthcoming documentary, ”2 Gents,” produced by Louisville filmmaker Eleanor Bingham Miller, which explores the collaboration between her father, publisher Barry Bingham Sr., and artist Henry Varnum Poor on the frescoes in the lobby of the Courier-Journal building at Sixth and Broadway, painted during the building’s construction in the late 1940s.
“As a preeminent scholar of American and Kentucky art, and as a dear friend of Barry Bingham Sr. and his family, Buck will be an outstanding spokesman,” Miller said. Directed by Bruce Skinner, the film examines a rare moment when journalism, patronage and art converged to produce a lasting work of public culture.
The future of those frescoes remains uncertain following the newspaper’s departure from the building in September.
In addition to his books, Pennington wrote extensively for exhibition catalogues and monographs, including studies of Will Henry Stevens and a co-authored volume on Douglas Bourgeois. He served as editor of The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, Volume 21: Art and Architecture (2013), a role that reflected both his authority and his sense of stewardship.
Pennington held academic and curatorial positions associated with multiple art institutions and universities, including Transylvania University and the University of Kentucky Art Museum, but he wrote in a style free of jargon, trusting the work — and the reader. Time and again, he restored overlooked artists to visibility and provided frameworks that others could build upon.
“Although he served as an archivist, museum director, and curator,” said Peter M. Morrin, retired director of the Speed Art Museum, “Buck is best remembered for his devotion to the history of art in the South. He was fiercely loyal to his Bluegrass roots and will be remembered especially for his work on 19th century Kentucky artists.”
Equally important was his role as mentor and connector. He urged younger scholars to look closely at their own communities and advised collectors and institutions on preservation. In Paris, the Kentucky town where he lived, he embodied his conviction that intellectual life and local commitment are not competing virtues.
Penningtons’s combination of playful humor and deep faith in humanity made him an especially memorable teacher, friend and colleague. 
“He loved Bourbon County,” Clay said, “which he always referred to as Heaven.”
Paris was where he was born on Oct. 3, 1950, and in a 2022 oral history with Allison Cox, he fondly recalled his youth there. His colorful memories included all the stores downtown during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as the Paris-Bourbon County Library, where he spent many hours as a youth devouring books under the guidance of the chief librarian.
“Buck Pennington was first, foremost, and always a quintessential Kentuckian,” Clay added. “He knew and upheld our Commonwealth’s history and artistic heritage. Over many years, he offered wise counsel — always accompanied by joy and raucous laughter.”
Warren Payne remembered him as “larger than life — mercurial, cutting at times, but also kind, generous, and deeply amusing. His death is a great loss to the Commonwealth. Who will now tell us what is a Jouett — and what isn’t?”
However, Pennington summed up his philosophy of life best of all: “History is not our friend but our partner.”
Survivors include his stepfather, Glen Phillips Wagner; his brother, Richard Lee Wagner (Cheryl Bussell); his stepbrother, Robin Stivers (Debbie) of Mississippi; and four nieces and nephews. He was also a proud great-uncle to nine great-nieces and great-nephews.
Funeral services will be held at 2:30 p.m. Friday, Dec. 19, at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, 311 High Street, Paris. Visitation will begin at 1:30 p.m. at the church. The body was cremated. Hinton-Turner Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements.

Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s) is vowing to fight a determination by the state legislature’s ethics committee that he cannot hold a job in Prince George’s County government as long as he remains in the Senate.
Muse said he vehemently disagrees with a letter he received from the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics that determined it is unlawful for him to hold a Prince George’s County job while serving as a state senator and that he will challenge it —  in court if he has to.
Muse’s comments come as his colleague Sen. Ron Watson (D- Prince George’s) opted to resign from the job he took this summer with Prince George’s County schools, in the face of a similar ruling from the ethics committee. Watson said he also disagreed with the committee’s determination, but decided against challenging it. Muse appears to be taking a different tack.
“We are challenging that, because we think that it’s wrong. We think that every person deserves a job,” Muse said.
Muse did not immediately confirm the nature of his job at the county, nor did he provide the letter from the ethics committee in response to requests from Maryland Matters. Letters issued by the committee are not publicly available.
But a spokesperson for Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy said Muse started a job in October as ombudsman for the county’s procurement office. The $180,000-a-year job is “merit based,” said Sharon Taylor, the spokesperson, and Muse does not serve at the pleasure of the county executive. The position was posted publicly in August, Taylor added, and Muse applied and was selected.
Maryland senator drops Prince George’s schools job amid ethics concerns

“We assumed that Sen. Anthony Muse followed the state legislative ethics rules before accepting the job, which he was obligated to do,” Taylor said.
Muse noted that legislative job is a “part-time job paying almost no money.” Individual state legislators, who do much of their work during the state’s 90-day legislative session, were paid $55,526 in 2025 and will get a raise to $56,636 in 2026.
“We are in government, and when you get to my age, where else can you get a job, but in government? So we are challenging it, and we’re going to win,” said Muse, 67, who has served in the Senate since 2007.
State legislators, like Muse and Watson, are generally prohibited from holding paid jobs in state or local government, because of possible conflicts of interest. Exceptions can be made on particular grounds.
Deadra Daly, ethics counsel for the General Assembly, cannot speak about individual cases such as Muse’s. But she said state law does not lay out an appeals process.
“They [a lawmaker] might ask the committee to reconsider, but the law does not specify a decision may be appealed,” Daly said. “The law just doesn’t contemplate that. So there is not really an appeals process.”
Nor does the law require the Joint Ethics Committee — a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House and Senate — to issue exemptions to lawmakers, it merely allows the committee to do so, Daly said.
“The law says the committee ‘may’ grant an exemption,” Daly said. “So, I don’t know how one would ask a court to require the committee to exercise discretionary authority.”
Muse said he deserves additional opportunity to plead his case.
“That’s what we do down here, we debate, we deliberate, we discuss — until we reach a final decision. And I think that’s my right, as one of the senior senators here, to do that,” he said.
Muse argued the committee should reevaluate its ruling, but that if it doesn’t reverse course, he intends to bring a court challenge.
“I only ask for their patience to deliberate this, and if it goes further we will do a court case that only involves getting an opinion as to who is right, who is wrong,” Muse said. “Judges are the ones who interpret the law, and they should be the ones who decide.”
If a lawmaker does not abide by an Ethics Committee decision, Daly said they could be investigated, and ultimately sanctioned. A complaint from the committee, the presiding officers or a member of the public could trigger such an investigation, she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate President Bill Ferguson’s (D) office declined to comment on the matter.
An online description for the Prince George’s ombudsman job says its responsibilities include providing “guidance, advocacy, and support to small, minority, County-based businesses seeking to do business with the County. The Ombudsman acts as a liaison between the business community and County government, assisting firms in navigating procurement processes, addressing barriers to participation, and ensuring compliance with applicable legislations and policies.”
State law lets General Assembly members keep paid positions in state or local government if they held those jobs prior to filing for election. It also allows them to work as teachers, non-elected law enforcement officers or emergency responders. A final exemption allows lawmakers to keep non-managerial state or local government jobs obtained through a “merit system hiring process,” a standardized procedure or test used to rank applicants based solely on merit.
“The committee is pretty strict,” Daly said of the merit-based exception. “We want it to be very much an objective ranking system. Then, one can’t argue that this person only got the job because the agency was trying to curry favor with the legislator.”
Currently, no member of the General Assembly has such an exemption, Daly said.
“If we look at legislators who have government employment, most of them are people who came in with a government position,” Daly said. “I have a bunch who are teachers, adjunct professors, substitutes — I have a golf coach. I have nobody who has a merit-system exemption right now.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC02316-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 05:57:19.300261

(UCAR)NCAR is a prized Colorado landmark.
The modernist federal facility in Boulder that houses the National Center for Atmospheric Research was completed in 1966, having been designed by I.M. Pei, who also created the Louvre Pyramid in Paris. The NCAR building had a star turn in the 1973 comedy “Sleeper.”
The center, which employs more than 800 Coloradans, also happens to conduct some of the best climate research in the world. Its work is crucial for scientific understanding of Earth systems, and it provides early warnings of natural disasters.
But its truth-telling about climate change and its location in a state dominated by Democrats who have refused to go along with President Donald Trump’s authoritarian abuses of power might have doomed it. Far-right zealot Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, confirmed a report Tuesday that the National Science Foundation will be “breaking up” NCAR, falsely maligning it as a source of “climate alarmism.”
The dismantling of NCAR wouldn’t just create a dangerous vacuum of knowledge about a warming planet. It would destroy a Colorado point of pride. And it’s only the latest instance of Trump’s degradation of Colorado through his misuse and abuse of federal resources located in the state.

U.S. Northern Command was established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on American soil and is headquartered at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs. But while Coloradans can be proud that protection of the homeland is overseen from their state, their view must now account for the command’s dark mission under Trump, who put it in charge of federalized National Guard troop deployments to American cities.
The deployments are a brute show of force against blue cities and states amid Trump’s out-of-control immigration crackdown and in advance of the 2026 election. They’re meant to intimidate. The Colorado general in charge of them, Gregory Guillot, head of Northern Command, in an appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week demonstrated that he enthusiastically approves of the deployments.
Guillot was in the audience during Trump’s infamous speech to top military commanders in September, when the president described his conflict with left-leaning cities as “a war from within.” He told the commanders, “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military — National Guard, but military.”
Asked what he thought of this directive from his commander-in-chief, Guillot offered no reassurance that civilians are safe from his troops when he responded, “I haven’t thought into what he might have meant.” 
Few features are more quintessentially Colorado than its wide open natural spaces. But so much of the state’s wildlands are managed by the federal government, which under Trump’s leadership are threatened like never before.
Colorado is home to 23 million acres of federal public lands, which in addition to their outsize role in the state’s appeal and personality are a key economic driver. But MAGA leaders are trying to sell them off. They’re trying to build roads through them to accommodate destructive industry. They’re opening them up to more oil and gas extraction.
Trump has nominated Steve Pearce, an anti-public lands activist and former U.S. representative from New Mexico who has deep ties to the oil and gas industry, to lead the Bureau of Land Management. The bureau manages 8.3 million acres of public lands in Colorado.
The nomination “is an insult to Colorado,” U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said, adding, “Pearce’s views on public lands are completely out of touch with Colorado’s values. He will be the first to sell off our public lands, promote Trump’s misguided ‘drill baby drill’ policies, and demolish the protections that ensure our kids and grandkids will benefit from public lands as we do now.”
Bennet’s statement, touching on Colorado values, underscores the penetrating damage that abhorrent Trump policies pose to the state’s character. 
U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette raised a similar theme when he blasted the decision to crush NCAR, which sits in his district. Referring to the center’s employees, he said, “They are a core component of our state’s economy and an integral part of the fabric of Colorado.”
As Trump’s infinite corruption and lawlessness brings discredit to Washington, MAGA malfeasance debases Colorado.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)For residents of the Washington metro area including Virginia’s Arlington, Fairfax, and Loudoun Counties, the majority of their water supply comes from one place – the Potomac River. A recent study by the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin found that climate change and data centers could create major challenges down the road for the water source.
“We’re 100% dependent on the Potomac River, and only have a one day backup water supply that’s close at hand, and those are two conditions that are not found in any other major city in the United States,” said Michael Nardolilli, executive director of the commission.
A map of WMA water supply service areas. The system serves over five million residents, “with suppliers withdrawing and treating water from the Potomac River and off-Potomac reservoirs before distributing it to retail and wholesale customers,” according to a report by the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin released in December 2025. (Photo courtesy Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin)
The report, which is conducted by the commission every five years, found that the region will have more than enough water most years in the future. But there is a growing chance that there may not be enough water to meet user demand or manage the aquatic habitats downstream in future decades. The study indicated a 1% increase in that risk in 2030 and a 5% increase in 2050.
The population in the Washington metropolitan area has steadily been growing for years but water use has stayed relatively stable. But now researchers expect a 17% water use increase by 2050. With potential droughts in the future due to a changing climate, the river’s flow could be impacted and create a major challenge for the area. Man-made environmental disasters could also occur that affect water supply, a possibility researchers are preparing for. 
“As the seat of the federal government, we could have a contamination event that’s deliberate, and we could also have a contamination event that’s accidental, say, a trail derailment at Harpers Ferry,” Nardolilli said. “So we are working with the Army Corps of Engineers to try to look at these different options for making the water supply more resilient.”
There are some backup options to help meet demand if the Potomac gets too low to pull water from upstream reservoirs – Jennings Randolph and Little Seneca in Maryland. 
But it takes multiple days to get the water delivered. Other options for additional help could come from Fairfax Water’s Occoquan reservoir and WSSC Water’s Patuxent reservoir. There is only enough back up water available in the Washington area to last for one day, the research showed.
With these increased risks projected, the commission is urging local, state and regional governments to plan for more back up water sources. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has launched a feasibility study to look at water resiliency options. But with federal funding in limbo, it could delay the findings. There are multiple bills moving through Congress that, Nardolilli said, would contain funds for the feasibility study. 
There are two drinking water reservoirs in the planning stages in Loudoun and Fairfax that should be operational in 2028 and 2040, respectively. 
A different study found that should there be a significant disruption to the water supply, it could lead to an estimated $15 billion in gross regional product and tax loss within a month. 
The growth of data centers in the area has also raised concerns about how much water from the river is being used to cool the centers. The exact amount of water that is used for individual data centers is often shrouded in secrecy – which Nardolilli said creates a challenge of trying to accurately project the water needs of the region.
“When the rivers have the lowest flow, the data centers would have the highest demand for water,” Nardolilli said. “That combination gives us some pause. You know, looking at the numbers right now, it’s a very manageable situation, but if the data centers continue to grow, that puts an additional strain on the system.”

(Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)As pennies vanish from the American landscape, many businesses are clamoring for federal guidance on how to handle cash transactions in a penniless world.
Should retailers round up or down? Should they round in favor of the customer? Or in favor of the business?
So far, calls for federal direction have gone unanswered. Some businesses are setting their own policies, but states are now beginning to act amid growing uncertainty.
While the question revolves around only a few cents per transaction, it does raise important consumer protection and legal questions for states to consider. Retailers must weigh threats of potential lawsuits, while policymakers worry about protecting the most vulnerable consumers who rely on cash for everyday purchases.
President Donald Trump in February moved to eliminate the penny from U.S. pocketbooks, citing the high cost of minting them — about 3.7 cents per penny. But even before the coin’s final production run last month, U.S. retailers and banks were reporting widespread penny shortages.
To provide clarity, lawmakers in New York have proposed legislation mirroring Canada’s rounding standard — up or down to the nearest five cents. And officials in Georgia and Utah have issued nonbinding guidance to businesses.
“States do not have the luxury of waiting for the federal government,” said Katherine Tschopp, senior associate at government relations firm MultiState.
Complicating the issue are the growing number of jurisdictions requiring businesses to accept cash — a move aimed at protecting vulnerable consumers who may not have access to credit cards or electronic payment systems.
In November, New York became the ninth state to add such a rule, according to tracking from MultiState. At least eight major cities also require businesses to accept cash.










In the absence of federal action, I think it's important that the states act to provide clarity — clarity for everybody: clarity for the consumer, as well as the merchant and the state.


– New York Democratic Assemblymember John T. McDonald III


A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers have proposed legislation in the U.S. House and Senate to require all cash transactions be rounded to the nearest five cents, but neither proposal has made it to a floor vote.
The record-breaking federal government shutdown and heated debate on health insurance subsidies have sidelined the penny discussion, Tschopp said. She thinks the federal government will likely determine a national rounding policy — eventually. But in the meantime, she expects more states to weigh in.
New York Democratic Assemblymember John T. McDonald III said he agreed with Trump’s move to phase out the costly production of the penny. But businesses are asking for some kind of guidance now, he said.
“In the absence of federal action, I think it’s important that the states act to provide clarity — clarity for everybody: clarity for the consumer, as well as the merchant and the state,” McDonald told Stateline.
Approaches to rounding
McDonald’s proposed legislation mirrors Canada’s rounding policy following the 2012 elimination of its one-cent coin. His bill calls for so-called symmetrical rounding of after-tax cash purchases to the nearest five-cent mark. Purchases ending with one, two, six or seven cents would be rounded down. And purchases ending in three, four, eight or nine cents would be rounded up.
So, a consumer would get no cash back from a $1.99 purchase. But a retailer would hand over a nickel to someone spending $1.97.
Americans haven’t saved for retirement. States are creating automatic savings plans.

McDonald sits on the National Conference of State Legislature’s State and Local Taxation Task Force that has been examining the penny issue. That task force has recommended symmetrical rounding as the fairest method for merchants and consumers.
McDonald noted that the NCSL group reached a bipartisan consensus on the issue. And he said he’s found no opposition from New York businesses or consumer groups on his bill.
“In this day and age where we seem to have a lot of fractious conversations on other issues, it’d be nice to find something that actually we can all agree on,” he said. “And to have it start with the good old little penny would be a good spot.”
On Wednesday, South Dakota Republican state Sen. Tim Reed urged state lawmakers to start communicating with agencies, retailers and the public over the issue.
A co-chair of the NCSL task force, he said businesses need guidance and consumers may need reassurance. While he acknowledged concerns about “strategic pricing” — in which retailers set prices to push rounding to their advantage — the group’s report characterized that as a “limited risk.”
“Everybody’s thinking, ‘Oh, I’ll get overcharged, or I’ll get undercharged,’” Reed said at an NCSL virtual event about the penny. He said it would be good for people to know that “really this is all going to kind of wash out in the end.”
New York Democratic state Sen. James Sanders Jr. said the cash acceptance law he sponsored earlier this year ensures people without access to smartphones or banking are not excluded from commerce. That law also says customers paying with cash cannot be charged more than other buyers.
“Otherwise, you absolutely have a two-tiered system,” he said, noting that cash is “a lifeline” for working families, older adults, immigrants and small businesses.
Sanders said he would prefer for retailers to round down to the nearest nickel on cash transactions to protect consumers.
“For the large corporations, this could be a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they are steadily rounding up,” he said. While each rounding transaction represents a loss or gain of only a few cents, Sanders said, “multiply that by tens of thousands of people, and you’ve effectively raised the price of your product without any type of sanction.”
Citing potential for fraud, blue and red states pass new crypto ATM laws

Sanders said he plans to introduce legislation on the matter soon, but added that he remains open to McDonald’s current proposal of symmetrical rounding. More than anything, he said, businesses desire some kind of guidance.
“We’re not trying to cheat business. We’re just trying not to be cheated by business,” he said. “The people I’ve been speaking to are honest souls, and they just want to know the right thing to do in a penniless society.”
A rapid change
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia printed the last penny on Nov. 12, but pennies were already scarce at that time.
By mid-November, more than 100 of the government’s 165 coin distribution sites across the country were without pennies, according to the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents major chains including CVS, Target and 7-Eleven.
In a November survey of its members, that organization found six national chains had more than 1,000 stores that had no pennies.
The association said most of its survey respondents were rounding cash transactions to the benefit of customers — always down to the nearest five cents. While it’s fair for shoppers, it’s “costing businesses millions of dollars as small amounts add up across thousands of daily cash transactions.”
While states weigh the issue, the association is pushing for a federal answer.
“We are urging the federal government to quickly address the problem, to allow for uniform adjustments by retailers that operate in a multitude of states,” Austen Jensen, the organization’s senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement to Stateline.
Other groups, including the American Bankers Association, have also pushed for federal action.
‘Black market’ dining reservations sell for thousands. States want to stop that.

“They’re obviously concerned about it and wanting a federal fix,” said Christopher Phillips, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight. “The government fairly abruptly decided they weren’t going to mint any more pennies and these shortages of pennies spread fairly quickly across the country.”
For retailers, the problem is both practical and legal, said Phillips, who represents payment system companies and financial technology firms.
In many of the jurisdictions that require merchants to accept cash, the laws explicitly forbid charging cash customers more — and have a per-transaction fine for violations, raising the possibility of big fees. And Phillips said merchants could face class-action lawsuits for rounding policies in which plaintiffs argue they are charged more than advertised or face unfair or deceptive business practices.
Federal regulations also ban retailers from charging more for purchases made with food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP. Cash rounding policies complicate that rule, as some customers would be charged less for certain cash purchases than those using SNAP cards.
“The unintended consequences of these administrative actions, and these laws and how they flow together to create real problems that were certainly never envisioned,” Phillips said.
So far, merchants have come up with their own policies.
Because of the penny shortage, the East Coast convenience store chain Sheetz asked customers to move to cashless payments or round up to support charitable causes. It even offered free beverages for those willing to cash in 100 pennies.
Kwik Trip, which operates convenience stores across the Midwest, in October announced its registers would automatically round down cash transactions to the nearest nickel in favor of customers.
But without a federal standard, the landscape is patchy, Phillips said. Rounding creates a winner and a loser in each cash transaction. Some companies have pushed to standardize their practice across the country, but others will only choose to round down if required.
“Others are like, ‘You know what? This is actual money for us,’” he said. “‘We’re not just going to give it up for the sake of convenience.’”

That has an advocate for immigrants calling on the agency to explain what it’s doing to screen agents as it seeks to rapidly grow its ranks.
ICE didn’t respond when asked that question.
President Donald Trump came into office promising to deport what he claimed were undocumented, violent criminals. 
But NPR reported last week that more than a third of those arrested — about 74,000 — had no criminal records. 
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

Of the rest, about half have pending charges and half have convictions. Most of the convictions are for low-level offenses such as traffic violations, the news organization reported. 
As they’ve tried to conduct mass detentions and deportations, the conduct of ICE agents has been controversial. 
They’ve been accused of violently arresting people, including some who are in the country legally. And CBS News reported that masked agents have used tactics during protests that violate federal policy and a court order.
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said ICE agents have been accused of violence against women closer to home.
In March, a federal judge sentenced deportation agent Andrew Golobic to 12 years in prison. 
A jury convicted him of “using his position to solicit and coerce sex from vulnerable women under his supervision” during his 14 years in the Blue Ash ICE office, federal prosecutors said.
In October, NBC reported that in the agency’s rush to staff up, some agents have reported for training without being fully vetted.
On Dec. 5, the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s office charged Samuel Saxon, 47, with assault, domestic violence and strangulation of his partner, WVXU reported. 
In the 18 months that the ICE agent has been based in Cincinnati, police have been dispatched to his house during disputes 23 times, prosecutors said.

In one incident, Saxon’s partner’s pelvis was fractured, although no charges were filed, they said.
Tramonte said it’s disturbing that a federal agency would put such people in positions of power over others.
“There’s a real problem with gender-based violence by ICE agents, and the agency is not taking it seriously,” Tramonte said last week in a written statement. 
“Andrew Golobic used his position of power against women who feared deportation to extort sex. The police have been called to Samuel Saxon’s home 22 times… Anyone familiar with the pattern of domestic violence knows strangulation is part of a pattern of escalating behavior that often ends in murder.” 
Saxon’s attorney told WXIX that his client had been suspended from his job.
Tramonte said ICE needs to explain internal procedures that allowed Saxon to keep his job after having so many brushes with the law.
“This is an agency that demonizes immigrants who have committed no crimes, yet it fails to police its own ranks,” she said. 
“The hypocrisy is breathtaking, and the threat to public safety is clear. We want answers from the Detroit ICE Field Office and Cincinnati Local Office: Do ICE agents have to inform their employer when they come under scrutiny by other law enforcement agencies? If no, why not?”

Marjorie Taylor Greene and term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp are at the center of some of the biggest political storylines in Georgia going into the new year. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGov. Brian Kemp is entering his final year in office. Georgia Republicans find themselves at a crossroads as they fight over his successor. Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is gearing up for the biggest fight of his young career. And one of Georgia’s most outspoken members of Congress is on her way out the door.
With 2025 coming to a close, several big questions are looming on the horizon. A transition of power is set to unfold at the governor’s mansion this time next year, and Republicans must decide who (and what) comes next. Ossoff will again aim to shatter fundraising records and defy expectations as he fights for a second term. And Democrats are in search of a new leader who can capitalize on a turbulent political climate.
Here are five big questions facing Georgia heading into the new year.
Will the Georgia GOP embrace the MAGA brand in 2026?
It wasn’t long ago when then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp sought an endorsement from President Donald Trump to help win his party’s nomination for governor. The two have had a rather icy relationship in the years since but seem to have somewhat patched things up.
But behind the scenes, a proxy war is well underway between the two leaders and their inner circles: Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is seeking to drop the word “lieutenant” from his title, and the president has thrown his full support behind the Butts County native and longtime friend.
Two other statewide officials are standing in Jones’ way to the GOP nomination, though: Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Kemp is unlikely to publicly take sides, but many of his closest allies and advisers have ties with Carr’s campaign. Both Carr and Raffensperger have butted heads with White House, particularly after the 2020 election, which means they run the risk of splitting the anti-Trump lane in the primary,
Regardless of who wins the primary, the future of the Georgia Republican Party and its image is set to be decided next spring.
Can Ossoff do it again?
Nearing the end of his first six-year term, Ossoff is preparing for what might be the biggest test of his short career. As the only Democrat running in a state Trump carried last year, he is a sitting duck for national Republicans as they fight to expand their Senate majority.
But Republicans must sort out their own messy primary before they can turn their attention to the 38-year-old Atlanta Democrat, who will be armed with a multimillion dollar warchest. The Republican primary has turned into a three-way battle between U.S. Reps. Mike Collins of Jackson and Buddy Carter of St. Simons Island, along with attorney and former football coach Derek Dooley.
Dooley, whose father Vince spent more than two decades as the “top dog” at the University of Georgia, has been endorsed by Kemp and is being boosted by many fundraising committees and leadership groups aligned with the popular Republican – who declined to enter the race himself despite heavy recruitment efforts. Carter and Collins are both trying to make inroads with the president’s supporters, though the president himself has yet to pick a side.
Ossoff will need to walk a very narrow line in his fight for a second term: he must channel the frustration of an angry Democratic base while also convincing swing voters and independents that Trump isn’t fulfilling his promise to lower prices. But as one of the most prolific fundraisers in his party, he will start off in a strong position as his Republican rivals fight it out.
Can Georgia Democrats end 20-year drought?
Democrats in Georgia may have found success in recent presidential and U.S. Senate contests. But it has been two decades since the party last won a race for a statewide constitutional office at the top of the ballot. After a string of recent wins in off-year special elections and a chaotic first year of Trump 2.0, Georgia Democrats sense a rare opening to finally break their losing streak for high-profile statewide offices.
But Stacey Abrams, the two-time nominee for governor who has become one of the party’s most recognizable faces, is unlikely to be the one leading the way. Just like their Republican counterparts, Democrats must also find a new standard-bearer who can lead them into next year’s elections.
Despite the renewed optimism, however, the biggest headlines in the race for governor have been about who isn’t running rather than who is: Abrams, former state Sen. Jason Carter and even U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Marietta) have chosen to stay on the sidelines, even though each one would have entered the race as a prohibitive favorite.
The race for governor has so far been slow to take off: many of the candidates don’t have the name recognition or a national fundraising network like Abrams, so they will be spending a lot of time introducing themselves to primary voters ahead of a likely runoff.
But as the party faces questions about the types of leaders that are needed for this moment, do they run the risk of nominating candidates who won’t unify a frustrated base?
How will Brian Kemp spend his final year in office?
The sun is setting on Kemp’s two-term tenure in the state’s top office: this time next year, the departing incumbent will be preparing to hand the keys to the governor’s Buckhead estate over to his successor.
As we wait to find out who will follow, we are also going to get a better look at how Kemp plans to cement his legacy. He will enter his final legislative session in January with a lot less leverage over his Gold Dome allies, many of whom are already grinding axes in Republican primaries or are candidates for higher office themselves. How the lame duck Kemp wields his remaining power over Republican lawmakers, who have worked hand in hand with him to enact his agenda and raise money for Republican causes, will be a key part of how his time in office will be remembered.
But he is placing a lot of his remaining capital in the race for U.S. Senate – a primary contest he could have had all locked up by now had he decided to run. A family friend of the Dooleys, Kemp wasted no time endorsing the ex-Volunteers coach’s campaign to unseat Ossoff. But his decision to stay out of the race and endorse an untested candidate has not gone over well with some in his party.
Poll after poll shows that Kemp is the most popular elected leader in the state. And at 62, it is not inconceivable that he could wind up on the ballot again in the near future. For now, his main focuses are the upcoming legislative session and boosting Dooley’s Senate bid. But Republican legislators and primary voters will be the ones who decide how much he gets done in his final year.
MTG’s next move?
U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s surprise exit from Congress following her public falling out with Trump has become one of the biggest headlines of the year. And for good reason: Greene was one of the president’s most ardent supporters on Capitol Hill.
Greene first arrived in Congress in 2021 as one of the most controversial and outspoken members of her party. But she has been growing more critical of the Trump administration as his second term got underway. Things between the two escalated over the summer as Greene emerged as one of the few voices in her party to support the release of all files related to the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
The biggest question that will follow the Rome Republican on her way out the door: What will she do next?
It’s no secret that Greene was contemplating a run for higher office next year; Democrats even tried goading her into challenging Ossoff. But Trump and White House officials were said to have talked her out of a statewide campaign after internal numbers made them nervous about her chances.
While she is unlikely to be a candidate for office next year, her involvement on the campaign trail supporting the Republican ticket will be closely watched. It could also give us a glimpse into whether or not the 51-year-old has any appetite to run for office again.
Georgia is entering 2026 with more questions than answers. With Kemp on his way out, both parties have just one year to nominate and rally around new leaders. Ossoff’s race for a second term will hinge on how well he can navigate a divided and unhappy electorate. And Greene’s next moves could give us an early look at her future plans.
It’s more than just elections on the line: it’s the direction of the state and the political futures of many key power players that could all be decided by this time next year.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ossoff-greene-kemp-combo-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-18 05:57:19.300261

The science of reading is based on decades of research that shows how the human brain learns to read and incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.   
“We have an obligation to act with great urgency to make sure every future teacher is taught by our colleges and universities the best way to teach reading,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during a press conference. 
The science of reading was signed into law by DeWine in 2023 through the state’s two-year operating budget, which gave $86 million for educator professional development, $64 million for curriculum and instructional materials, and $18 million for literacy coaches.
Colleges and universities teacher preparation programs were required to be fully aligned with teaching the science of reading by Jan. 1, 2025.
The Ohio Department of Higher Education Chancellor Mike Duffey created an audit process that demonstrates how each educator training program aligns with teaching the science of reading instruction.
The formal audits started in January 2025 and took place during the spring semester. The colleges submitted syllabi, materials, and assignments in addition to reviewers visiting campuses, observing classes, and interviewing staff.
Any college or university that does not become fully aligned by next December will have their approval revoked by Chancellor Duffey. All programs will be reviewed every four years. 
“For the students who are becoming teachers, it will improve their job prospects,” DeWine said. “It will make future generations of children also better readers. Teacher prep programs at our colleges and universities need to be using only the science of reading.”
Bowling Green State University, Central State University, Cleveland State University, Defiance College, Ohio Christian University, Ohio Dominican University, Ohio University, Ohio State University, University of Toledo, and Wright State University were not in alignment — meaning they had at least one violation for teaching the three-cueing approach, which is a banned teaching practice in Ohio. 
Ten Ohio colleges and universities were not in alignment with the science of reading, according to an Ohio Department of Higher Education audit. (Photo provided by the Ohio Department of Higher Education).
The “three-cueing approach” is any model of teaching students to read based on meaning, structure and syntax and visual cues. It often encourages children to read words by asking three questions: Does it make sense? Does it sound right? Does it look right?
Ohio’s law bans school districts from using the “three-cueing approach” in lessons unless a district or a school gets a waiver from the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce or a student has an individualized education program that specifically includes the “three-cueing approach.” 
“Many of these 10 colleges are actually teaching the science of reading very well,” DeWine said. “All 10 of these colleges were found to have at least one instance of using the banned training in their material.”
All of these schools say they are now in compliance and ODHE is verifying they are now fully aligned with the science of reading, DeWine said. 
Ohio State University had 17 noncompliant course sections, the most of any university, according to the audit.
“The audit … identified a limited number of cases where outdated curricular materials do not fully align with (science of reading) standards,” said Ohio State University spokesperson Chris Booker. “Those materials are being updated to fully comply with the new standards.”
Capital University, God’s Bible School & College, Ohio Wesleyan University, Ursuline College, and Western Governors University had partial alignment, meaning they met between 50-70 audit metrics and had zero violations for banned teaching practices. 
“For some universities, it’s cultural set in,” DeWine said. “They’ve taught another way for a long, long period of time. It’s tough to change. … But it’s also tough for teachers who are out in the classroom, who now have to switch over and so it’s just a moral imperative that we get this right.”
Five Ohio colleges and universities were in partial compliance with the science of reading, according to an audit from the Ohio Department of Higher Education. (Provided by the Ohio Department of Higher Education).
These colleges and universities were in alignment, meaning they met at least 71 out of 73 audit metrics and had no violations for banned teaching practices:

“We have a lot of schools that are doing a great job,” DeWine said. “… Many schools are excelling with their implementation of the science of reading and their students are better off.” 
33 Ohio colleges and universities’s educator training programs were found to be in alignment with the science of reading, according to an audit by the Ohio Department of Higher Education. (Provided by the Ohio Department of Higher Education).
DeWine said he’s heard from principals and superintendents that some of their new teachers are coming out of college with a good foundation in the science of reading.
“Sadly, some of the principals and the teachers pointed out that they are still receiving new teachers coming out from Ohio universities that do not have that good preparation,” DeWine said. “That creates a huge problem. 
This is the second academic year Ohio school districts are required to teach the science of reading curriculum. 
“We’ve watched some amazing teachers use the science of reading to help their students,” he said. “Every single child is engaged in what they’re learning. … We’re making great strides in our K-12 schools.”
Forty percent of Ohio’s third-graders were not proficient in reading in 2023 and 33% of third graders were not proficient in reading before COVID-19. 
Literacy scores were up slightly from last year, with 64.5% of third graders reading at or above grade level compared to 62.3% from the previous year, according to this year’s state report cards that were released in September. 
The Ohio Department of Education and Workforce was required to come up with a list of curriculum and instructional materials that align with the science of reading.

(Photo by David Espejo/Getty Images)Artificial intelligence is already used by certain New Hampshire state entities for limited purposes. But Rep. Keith Ammon, a New Boston Republican and the founder of the Emerging Technologies Caucus, wants to see the state keep evolving.
Legislators and officials could conscript AI agents to streamline their work, but such tools also carry risks and warrant regulation, employees of AI developer Anthropic said to representatives at a Dec. 15 meeting of the caucus. The discussion followed a recommendation in last week’s Commission on Government Efficiency report that the state government increase its adoption of artificial intelligence to streamline tasks and reduce administrative workloads. 
“I see AI as, the genie’s out of the box,” Ammon said at the meeting. “… I’m also worried about people falling behind, because they’re really not paying attention to how fast this space is changing.”
Opportunities and current uses
Ammon said he sees AI as a potential “personal assistant, or many personal assistants, that can do all kinds of tasks,” raising users’ standards of living. Such AI “agents,” or programs that are capable of performing certain online tasks on behalf of users, were the subject of that day’s demonstration. 
Anthropic software engineer Dylan Shields presented a series of examples using the company’s large language model, Claude, on behalf of a hypothetical legislator. The demonstrations showed the model pulling events from multiple websites into one calendar, then creating a map of an electoral district and highlighting regions the legislator had not visited recently, based on events in their calendar and their emails. 
Several state entities already utilize artificial intelligence in their operations, or are rolling out plans to do so, according to a July 1, 2025, report by New Hampshire Department of Information Technology Commissioner Denis Goulet. 
The New Hampshire Department of Justice uses Lexis+ AI, a legal research program, to “streamline legal research for … attorneys,” according to the report. The New Hampshire Veterans Home, meanwhile, uses ChatGPT for “professional letters/communications and client notes.”
Other departments developing or exploring frameworks to employ AI, as of July 1, included the Department of Information Technology, the Department of Administrative Services, New Hampshire Employment Security, and the New Hampshire Banking Department, according to the report. 
Across U.S., states’ use of AI varies
A survey undertaken this year by the National Association of State Technology Directors indicated that, of the 41 states that responded, 1 in 5 was already using AI to interface with constituents for some services. Another 41% of the states, meanwhile, were in the process of incorporating AI for such a use, while 39% were not.
At Anthropic, “state government customers are one of our fastest-growing customers,” said Olga Medina, who advises on state and local policy at Anthropic. 
In November, the company reached an agreement with Maryland that will see the state deploy its AI tools across a number of departments.
Challenges and concerns
AI systems’ ability to take action on behalf of users, rather than simply consult with them, is relatively new, and comes with its own set of challenges in addition to those of previous AI models, said Gabriel Nicholas, of Anthropic.
Once an agent is allowed to take an action — say, by editing a Google Calendar, as in the demonstration, or clearing out an inbox — the changes it makes cannot necessarily be undone, Nicholas said. And the programs aren’t immune to mistakes, such as inadvertently revealing confidential information to which they were previously given access, he said. 
Requiring the program to get permission from a user to complete a permanent action is one way developers try to prevent these errors, Nicholas said. 
Cybersecurity is also a concern, as is security within the systems themselves. In some test scenarios that Nicholas called “extreme,” models have been documented turning to blackmail and threats against their users. Nicholas called for continued research into these responses, safeguards, and transparency from developers about the risks and behaviors of AI.
Beyond security, Ammon said he had heard a range of constituent concerns about artificial intelligence and its impact on the economy, jobs, human welfare, and the environment.
“At least in our small state, I hear people being afraid that AI is going to replace jobs, it’s going to trick our kids into hurting themselves, it’s going to use up all the energy and all the water and make a lot of noise,” he said.
Medina did not refute those points.
“I think that a lot of the concerns and fears about AI’s impacts are legitimate. I think, as a company, we think they are legitimate,” she said.
Education, transparency, and regulation would be key to mitigating negative impacts, she said. 
Ammon and Medina noted that a recent executive order from President Donald Trump that aims to override state-level regulations on artificial intelligence could affect states’ abilities to regulate AI themselves — though some state legislators from across the country said after the order that they will continue to pursue state-level regulations anyway. 
Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, has advocated in favor of allowing state-level AI regulation, citing the fast-moving and experimental nature of the field. 
Ammon said he was conflicted on the matter. While he said he felt the preemption of state law was “stepping on” his authority as a state legislator, he also said that preventing early regulation of the internet had helped the U.S. get ahead.
“There’s also a national security implication, right, if we lose the AI race,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chatbot-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 04:57:20.345177

(Photo by gorodenkoff/ Getty Images; Text via Kennebec County Sheriff's Office)Speeding. An overdue inspection. A crack on a windshield. Police cited these reasons, among others, for traffic stops in Maine that ultimately led to drivers, passengers and people who later arrived at the scene being detained for alleged immigration violations.
These are the types of instances that a forthcoming law aims to prevent. 
Almost a year into President Donald Trump’s second term, it is clear that Maine is part of the apparatus holding up the president’s mass deportation agenda, with jails housing detainees and federal authorities reporting record arrest numbers, citing collaboration with local and state police as a key factor. 
But unlike many other states, in Maine that support does not come from formal partnerships. Decisions to loop in federal authorities during routine work have long been left up to officer discretion. 
The stakes of those decisions have changed as federal immigration authorities under Trump have taken increasingly aggressive tactics and disregarded due process while trying to meet arrest quotas, mostly detaining people on civil offenses after the administration said it would focus on deporting violent criminals. 
Explaining that she could not ignore how Trump has “weaponized” federal agencies, Gov. Janet Mills earlier this week announced her intention to allow hotly debated legislation to become law. Though it won’t take effect until later in 2026, the new law will set specific restrictions to ensure Maine officers and agencies are enforcing state law, not federal immigration law.
Local police are not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws. The Trump administration revived a program called 287(g), which deputizes local police officers to detain immigrants. Maine doesn’t have any such agreements after the Wells Police Department, the only local agency that had entered into such a contract, canceled its agreement this fall following public opposition.
Police departments, sheriff’s offices and Maine State Police currently do not have written policies or procedures for when to loop in federal immigration authorities, though a few law enforcement leaders sent out letters with guidance to their teams since Trump’s reelection, agencies confirmed with Maine Morning Star. 
The new law bans state and local law enforcement from investigating, detaining or searching people solely for immigration purposes. But it also has exceptions, such as allowing local authorities to share information about suspected criminal activity and participate in federal task forces as long as the sole purpose is not immigration enforcement.
Law enforcement leaders and Republican lawmakers in Maine argue the new restrictions will create obstacles for upholding public safety and could jeopardize federal funding due to concerns about retaliation from the president. Civil rights groups and Democrats argue the rules are necessary to ensure rights aren’t violated, though they caution the law is not a total remedy.
The bill creates obligations, but it doesn’t specify consequences for failing to abide by them, leaving enforcement up to those wrongly detained seeking justice in court, said Michael Kebede, policy director at the American Civil Liberties of Maine, who helped write the bill. Given how quickly people are often moved around, Kebede said that will logistically be difficult. 
“Ultimately, as with any law that regulates public officials, there’s going to be a lot of training necessary and a lot of reliance on oaths,” Kebede said.

How routine work police work becomes a federal immigration matter
When Kennebec County Detective John Bourque was on patrol in Litchfield on March 13, he saw a van pass him on Richmond Road that had an expired inspection sticker and a crack across the windshield, so he pulled the van over and requested the driver’s information, according to the police report. 
The report notes that, while the driver gathered his information, Bourque also asked for the passenger’s identification. Bourque said he noticed someone in the van’s rear cargo area and found more people after inspecting the back of the truck. The detective asked for the identification of all of those passengers, who had photos of their passports but not physical documents. The police report notes that the incident involved juveniles.
“I was assured by the driver all in the van were workers and not in the country illegally,” Bourque wrote in the report. But the detective contacted U.S. Border Patrol, which “advised these men were likely not legally in the United States” and said agents would come to the location to assist. Ultimately, Border Patrol took all of the people in the van into custody. 
There was no crime involved, according to the report, which labeled it an “assist other agency” event. 
Kennebec County Chief Deputy Chris Read described the actions taken as standard procedure, which is also how he classified two other incidents this year where  sheriff’s office personnel called in immigration authorities to a traffic stop. 
“If we come across somebody like that, that we can’t verify who they are, where they’re from, and sometimes it’s a language barrier that we can’t understand, we ask for help,” Read said of contacting federal authorities. 
Local law enforcement will be banned from using federal immigration officers as interpreters under the forthcoming law, a change the Maine Chiefs of Police Association said was among their members’ concerns in a recent letter to Mills calling for her to veto the bill. 
The association’s president, Brunswick Police Chief Scott Stewart, also wrote that the restrictions may confuse officers. “The bill’s complexity alone creates unnecessary risk of missteps and unintended consequences,” Stewart wrote. 
Also in Kennebec County a few days after the incident with the van, on March 20 a sheriff’s office deputy pulled over a car for speeding in China and asked both the driver and passenger for identification. According to the police report, they provided Ecuadorian identification documents and said they were going to work. The deputy relayed this information to a federal agent who told him they were “interested” in both people and ultimately took both men, and a third later found in the back of the vehicle, into custody. 
While the officer pulled over the car for speeding, there is no charge for speeding in the incident report, which again labels the event as an “assist other agency” with no crime involved.










People are afraid to leave their homes. They are afraid to go to work. They're afraid to be on the roadways. They are afraid to send their children to school.


– Lisa Parisio, policy director for the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project


Up to now, police leaders say contacting immigration agents, or collaborating with any type of federal agency, has been left up to officer discretion. 
“Even before Trump won the election and started his nationwide initiatives, we’re following the same practices we’ve always had,” Androscoggin County Sheriff Eric Samson said. “Nothing’s changed.”
The same is true if an immigration agency calls for help, Samson said. 
“We’re gonna go and assist them because it’s officer safety, much like any agency available,” he said. “I guess some people might have a problem with that, but that’s just the right thing to do. And, I try to avoid the politics of it. I’ll tell you the truth.”
But Anahita Sotoohi, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said just because it’s the way something has long been done doesn’t mean it is right. “I wouldn’t really consider that a rebuttal,” she said, “so much as an admission, to be honest.”
Sotoohi said traffic stops that result in immigration detentions always run the risk of violating the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, given that people are being held on the side of the road for a reason unrelated to the traffic stop.
While many of these cases differ in their specifics, they often begin with minor offenses, which Sotoohi said raises concern about racial profiling. In the March 13 and 20 incidents, the ethnicities of the men detained are all listed as Hispanic in the police reports, with their place of birth listed as unavailable. 
In other cases, the people detained arrived at the scene after the traffic stop. In Waldo County in March, an officer stopped a car for speeding and called in Border Patrol, whose agents ended up arresting a passenger in the vehicle as well as a relative of the driver who showed up afterwards to drive the men home.
Sotoohi questioned why traffic stops warrant requesting identification from passengers, while Read said it’s typical practice to try to identify everyone in a car. 
Passengers generally have more rights than drivers during traffic stops and only have to identify themselves under certain circumstances, including if they’re suspected of a crime or if the officer wants to write them a ticket for something like not wearing a seatbelt.
That was the case during a traffic stop in Gardiner on Aug. 1. Police officer Michael Caputo was parked when he noticed a Subaru with three men approaching. According to the police report, as the car started to pass him, the man in the back seat “ducked his head down and covered his face with his hand.”
Gov. Mills OKs restrictions on local involvement in immigration enforcement

Caputo pulled out behind the car and started following it. After it entered a 25 mph zone, he took down the car’s speed: 45 mph. 
According to Caputo’s account, he pulled the car over and as he spoke with the driver and passenger, he noticed that the rear passenger didn’t have a seat belt on, which is subject to a fine under Maine law. The officer requested the identification of that passenger, Dieusoir Britus, who provided a social security card, a U.S. employment authorization card and a Haitian passport.
Caputo said he contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to check Britus’ status, which authorities told him was revoked. That dispatcher transferred Caputo to Maine Border Patrol, which advised him to detain Britus and transport him to Kennebec County Jail. 
When asked why the officer requested identification from the passenger, Chief Todd Pilsbury said, “It’s a pretty simple answer. He was asked for his ID because he didn’t have a seat belt on.”
The police report lists revoked immigration status as the offense in this case. It’s unclear where Britus is now, as his records do not show up in ICE’s detainee lookup system. He was not charged for the seatbelt infraction. When asked about this, Pilsbury said it was his understanding that the officer “didn’t want to lump everything on.”
Frequency
Federal agencies have cited the support of state and local law enforcement as key to their increased arrests. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did so last month when announcing their agents have apprehended 725 people in the state as of Oct. 1, exceeding the prior record of 685 apprehensions set in 2001. 
ICE has arrested 230 people in the state through mid-October, which amounts to a 73% increase compared to the year prior, according to figures released from the Deportation Data Project earlier this month. Only about 20% were people convicted of a crime. 
It remains unclear how frequently traffic stops have led to immigration arrests in Maine. Several agencies said it’s not something that happens often, maybe a few times a year. For example, the one involving the Gardiner officer was the only for that small department since December 2024. 
Since March, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 22 traffic stops from which more than 50 Maine residents and workers were handed over to immigration officials by state and local law enforcement based on suspected immigration status.

“But I truly believe that is just the tip of the iceberg of what’s happening in our state,” said the organization’s policy director Lisa Parisio. The legal group has received other reports of traffic stops resulting in detentions but could not verify enough information to include those in their tracking, because of challenges keeping in touch with people in detention and others fearful of speaking out, she said. 
When the Maine Office of the Attorney General proposed rules for law enforcement to collect traffic stop data in 2023, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project requested that data include whether law enforcement contacted immigration agents or authorities as an outcome of the stop — a proposal that did not make it into the final rule. Parisio said the organization continues to believe a rule to that effect would help provide a better picture of enforcement.
911 calls also not off limits
Traffic stops are not the only interactions with local agencies that have led to detentions. There have also been instances in Maine where 911 calls about unrelated issues result in immigration arrests. 
On June 14, someone called 911 to report a drowning on Papoose Pond in Waterford. Pedro Quizhpi was unresponsive after his canoe capsized. Quizhpi, who was originally from Ecuador, was pronounced dead at 9:20 a.m., with records from the Maine Warden Service characterizing his death as an accident. 
But the incident prompted a statewide search involving four local agencies that led to the detention of 14 men, including Quizhpi’s brother.
Sotoohi said this incident is the most egregious she’s aware of in Maine. “This is somewhat unusual,” she said, “but it’s only unusual in its scale.” 
In another incident on Oct. 25, Monmouth-Winthrop Police Department received a 911 call from someone who didn’t speak English and could not explain their situation beyond requesting help, but the police report indicates that the caller was likely one of the three people that federal authorities eventually detained after police contacted them. 
These examples demonstrate, in Sotoohi’s view, the risks of local involvement in federal work: expending local resources on a federal job and deterring people from calling 911. 
The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project has heard this fear from clients firsthand. 
“People are afraid to leave their homes. They are afraid to go to work. They’re afraid to be on the roadways. They are afraid to send their children to school,” Parisio said. “They’re afraid to call the police for help in any situation, whether that’s protection from domestic violence, coming forward about labor exploitation and trafficking, serving as witnesses in criminal cases.”

Lack of policy
Before the governor’s announcement, more than a dozen local agencies said different variations of officer discretion being at the core of all cooperation with federal authorities. There were a few exceptions.
Portland Police Department is banned from inquiring about a person’s immigration status under city code. “We do not cooperate with ICE, nor would we ever call them to a scene,” said the department’s Public Information Officer Brad Nadeau.
Earlier this month, Rockland also prohibited its city employees and departments from assisting or cooperating with federal agencies on immigration enforcement, except when required by state or federal law or court order. This ACLU of Maine also helped draft this ordinance, which has many of the same exceptions as the state legislation. 
But, for the most part, it has been as Penobscot County Sheriff Troy Morton put it: “Deputies utilized their knowledge and training when it came to requesting assistance from any agency.” 
Shannon Moss, public information officer for the Maine Department of Public Safety, described coordination with law enforcement partners as a routine part of Maine State Police’s duties that varies based on circumstance. That’s why the agency doesn’t maintain written policies for its communications with any federal, state or local agencies, she said. 
Some agencies have issued guidance and expectations since Trump’s reelection. 
Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce advised his officers in a February letter to act on state law and then make a referral to ICE if the officer suspects someone to be in the country illegally. Meanwhile, Lincoln County Sheriff Todd Brackett wrote in a letter to his staff in October that if an officer has charged or has probable cause and plans to charge someone with a crime, they can contact any federal agency to assist if they “feel it is appropriate given the circumstances.”
While public records of traffic stops show some departments contact federal authorities when someone’s identity is in question, the Lewiston Police Department doesn’t run routine license checks through federal partners, according to the department’s public information officer Lt. Derrick St. Laurent.
However, similar to Brackett’s guidance, St. Laurent said, “when we encounter someone suspected of a violent offense whose identity is in question, we may request their assistance.”
St. Laurent added, “We owe it to our community to use every resource available to protect innocent people.”
The forthcoming law distinguishes between when police can contact federal officials for criminal activity and when they can for immigration matters, which are civil offenses. 
Brackett, the Lincoln County sheriff, had also sent a letter to his staff in February relaying information from the National Sheriff’s Association, which noted local authorities may come across more people with immigration arrest warrants during daily work since the Trump administration issued roughly 700,000 of these civil warrants at the start of the president’s second term. 
Only departments deputized under the 287(g) program could serve or arrest someone on these warrants alone, the association noted, as they don’t constitute a federal or state crime. 
But if someone is arrested on a state or local charge and transported to jail, the association’s memo read, “the normal process of identifying ICE should occur.” 
But as recent events show, that “normal process” differs, not only between agencies, but in each scenario.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-18 04:57:20.345177

(Getty Images)A friend’s saying reminds me daily of our present situation: “Bullfrogs blinking in a hailstorm.”
The image sticks. It runs through my head when I hear people saying: “Well, you know, we’ve had good and bad presidents (legislators/governors/city commissioners), and they all balance out over time.” Or: “It’s like a pendulum. You just have to wait until the next swing back.” Or: “Empires rise and fall; it’s just history repeating.”
This comes from people who acknowledge something’s up. But non-blinking frogs are our greatest worry. In large numbers, they share the misguided assumption that we’re impervious. Particularly in Kansans.
They neither know nor care that our own lawmakers in Washington, D.C., cut all funds to public broadcasting. Ignoring that loss increases the chance they are also unaware that our beloved state is now more vulnerable to recession (and depression) than any others except Alaska and Mississippi.
They are more likely to know that 200,000 Kansans’ ACA insurance premiums are skyrocketing, but they still buy the line that this is part of cutting “waste, fraud, and abuse.” This while health care costs are Kansans’ top concern, with 90% of those surveyed worried about care costs. Not to mention hospitals, with 30 in Kansas at immediate risk of closure.
Among our aging Kansas population are farmers. If the years don’t get ‘em, the tariffs will.
Whole farm communities suffer from the soybean fiasco, while Trump promises $40 billion to Argentina’s dictatorial president, who if re-elected will funnel yet more funds to that country’s oligarchy. Javier Milei’s first-year economic “shock therapy” slashed government spending by about 30%, partly by cutting pensions and reducing public employee wages. You don’t need sharp eyes and ears to see and hear echoes of MAGA.
When faced with a sinking ship, Republican response is predictable. Circle the wagons and attack the “other.” Attacks on DEI are only one example. Politico reported on the worst of such attitudes from Young Republican leadership. Leaked chats revealed racist, homophobic an neo-Nazi messages.
William Hendrix, the Kansas Young Republicans’ vice chair, used the words “n–ga” and “n–guh,” variations of a racial slur, more than a dozen times.
This is violence. It’s not gun violence, but violence, nonetheless. Couple that with (not just Republican) tax support of $3 billion a year and $16 billion recently to fund genocide and total elimination of Gaza’s land and people, and the crisis seems stark. As Jesus said, “The stones themselves cry out” (Luke 19:40), and so must we. Silence is violence.
One means of distraction from such violence, ironically, is football. Even there, our chickens come home to roost. In America’s unquestioned leading sport, its players are idolized.
Consider 24-year-old Dallas Cowboys player Marshawn Kneeland, who in November scored his first touchdown in front of 80,000 cheering fans. His whole life ahead of him. An Adonis emulated by many admiring young men. He died by suicide two days after.
Dallas news media clamored to understand the role that chronic traumatic encephalopathy and head injuries may have played in his suicide. But CTE was not mentioned in ESPN’s coverage. When the NFL owns 10% of ESPN, the cause of silence seems manifest. It’s maintaining audience. It’s money.
The NFL’s blue tent on the sidelines shelters players who may have suffered concussion. But also shelters fans from the truth. Vomiting and other violent symptoms remain hidden. Unseen, unsung.
So far in 2025, nine former and current NFL players under the age of 48 have died. Of those nine, seven were the result of suicide or actions that signaled deep mental duress.
As Nation sportswriter Dave Zirin put it: “Media members who once predicted that our knowledge of CTE could endanger the sport are now more interested in the gambling experience of fans than the workplace safety of players.”
Zirin’s comment reveals yet another layer of silence. Reports on betting’s harms are scarce. Nonetheless, it’s now clear that since 2017 Kansas has seen significant increases in the number of individuals at risk for problem gambling. The number of people at high risk has skyrocketed from 4% to 20% in 2025. The number of Kansans at moderate or high risk for problem gambling has more than tripled.
Yet the Kansas treasury’s benefits are paltry, at best. Kansas “received less than a 1% cut on more than $2.7 billion in bets in the past fiscal year,” Kansas Reflector reported. Big Buck Boys make money from both players and gamblers and keep it to themselves.
But aren’t so many Kansans placing irresponsible bets right now? Like those amphibians blinking away under a barrage of icy projectiles, we’re assuming that our state and nation will be fine. We just need to hold out and wait for the weather to change.
Let’s stop being bullfrogs. Let’s stop just blinking. Jumping into action might bring us shelter from the storm. It’s our choice.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)I was a sophomore in high school when an Omaha-based organization, Students for Sustainability, introduced me to the North Omaha coal power plant.
The group’s leader handed me a crumpled flyer in the bathroom, fighting against the roar of the hand dryers as members invited me to join the strike. The walkout ultimately brought 300 students to Memorial Park, gathered in opposition to the plant’s continued operation, including me.
This was in 2022, the first time the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) betrayed the public in revoking its promise of halting coal operations at the North Omaha Station (NOS). Yet we remain in the same position today.
On Nov. 18, the OPPD Board proposed a resolution that would allow for the indefinite continuation of North Omaha in its current configuration until “such time as system conditions, customer demand, regulatory requirements and infrastructure readiness enable a responsible transition of the NOS generation units.”
A shiny new timeline emphasizes “readiness,” an ambiguous term that serves its insubstantial promises, like those that previously guaranteed closure in 2023 and then 2026.
Yes, energy demands are increasing. Yes, we must keep rates low. But at what cost? Until twice, three times, four times as many people perish from sulfur dioxide emissions? Until Nebraska lies at the top for the worst asthma rates in the country due to the plant’s pollution?
Until I can’t go back to my hometown because it silenced the community’s voice and showed me there’s no place for someone like me — someone fighting for my future, hoping those making decisions about it will listen.
Until recently, our state proudly touted the slogan “Nebraska, honestly, it’s not for everyone.” Perhaps this is the most fitting description of a state that perpetuates environmental injustices.
In Nebraska during the 1920s, industrial facilities colluded with the maliciously pervasive practices of redlining — a form of systematic residential segregation through exclusionary leasing — to place their hazardous facilities in “undesirable” regions, often occupied by minorities.
Now, 68% of North Omaha’s population is people of color, people who suffer disproportionately from respiratory and heart diseases, health issues notoriously attributed to coal plants nationwide.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Based on data from 1995 to 2016, there were twice as many asthma deaths per million of Black Nebraskans as there were per million of white Nebraskans. Postponing the decommissioning of the units at the North Omaha Station nurtures such discriminatory health patterns.
Moreover, coal is all but economical. In November, the Department of Energy (DOE) ordered the J.H. Campbell coal-fired plant in Michigan to remain open, marking its third consecutive delay since its scheduled shutdown in May. Under the Trump administration, the DOE cited an energy “emergency” despite warnings that continuing operations would lead to billions of dollars in unnecessary energy costs and environmental harms.
Coal plants are increasingly expensive to maintain. A 2023 Energy Innovation report found that 99% of U.S. coal plants are more costly to operate than alternative renewable energy sources.
Nebraska has the opportunity to seize hold of a renewable economy. Clean energy has generated $21.5 million in annual local and state tax revenues.
Renewables are viable alternatives. Energy demands are not an excuse. OPPD CEO Javier Fernandez said, “We face a real-time supply challenge. The demand is outpacing generation … converting the North Omaha Station now would compromise our ability to serve new and existing customers.”
Fernandez and OPPD point to data centers for surging energy demand, but what goes unstated is that the utility is practically luring these companies in with low industrial power rates and compelling Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that guarantee stable energy pricing. This strategy effectively subsidizes corporate energy giants at the expense of Nebraska residents, forcing rate hikes and stunting other economic development.
A proposed 6.3% average rate increase for 2026 would make AI’s insatiable appetite the taxpayer’s problem.
The public health, economic, and energy burdens created by the North Omaha coal power plant benefit few Nebraskans and allow filthy facilities to infiltrate our residential neighborhoods and farmland to cater to corporate interests. What do Google CEOs know about Runzas and college baseball?
At the Dec. 18 board meeting, OPPD will vote on the resolution to extend coal operations at the North Omaha power plant indefinitely, and Nebraskans will make their voices heard. These are our energy rates, our communities and our Nebraska, and I don’t see billowing smokestacks being part of “The Good Life.”

,California,2025-12-18 05:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,CARE Court was created to help California’s toughest homeless cases. Why that’s been so hard,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/12/care-court-homeless/,CARE Court was supposed to be a new way to help homeless Californians in the grip of psychosis. But people are still falling through the cracks.,"Every time Jennifer Farrell got close to her brother, he slipped through her fingers.
As she walked the railroad tracks on the border of San Lorenzo and Hayward last month, searching for signs of her homeless younger sibling, she thought she caught a glimpse of him on a discarded mattress. But it turned out to be someone else.
Store clerks in a nearby strip mall and the groundskeeper at a local park all knew her brother. They told Farrell they’d seen him recently lying on the sidewalk outside a Jack in the Box. Another time, he was walking down the street, dragging a blanket behind him. He was spotted outside a church just that morning, someone said.
But he remained a phantom. Everywhere Farrell looked, it seemed like her brother had just left.
Farrell wasn’t supposed to have to do this anymore. Last Christmas Eve, she’d jumped at the chance to get her 59-year-old brother, who has been homeless off and on since 2017 and struggles with schizophrenia and meth use, into a new program called CARE Court. It was supposed to help people like him stabilize their mental health and get off the streets.
For a short time, it did. Her brother moved into a converted hotel in Oakland in late April, Farrell said, but five months later, he fled the hotel and disappeared.
“We’re coming up on a year (since he enrolled in CARE Court),” Farrell said. “And we are nowhere…we’re probably in the same place we were when I filed. And maybe even worse off.”
Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced CARE Court in 2022 in part as a way to bring people with serious mental illnesses off of California’s streets. He continues to tout it as part of his homelessness strategy, as recently as this month in a news release.
But data from the state and counties, as well as interviews with service providers, CARE Court participants and their family members, highlight the ways in which the program is struggling to help homeless Californians. 
More than two years after the program first launched, most people starting the CARE Court process aren’t homeless, and those who are homeless aren’t always getting what they need most: housing.
To assess the program, CalMatters requested housing information from California’s 25 largest counties, as well as all of the ones that first launched the program. Of the 2,362 CARE Court petitions filed in those counties, fewer than a third were for people who were homeless. 
When asked how many people were housed through CARE Court, even the most successful counties reported just a few dozen. 
Six of the counties polled by CalMatters either did not track housing status or total number of petitions, or did not disclose that data.
The state has not made detailed, up-to-date data about CARE Court performance public. Tracking housing status by county is difficult, as counties collect that data in different ways. Some count people as homeless if they are incarcerated or hospitalized, and some don’t. In some cases, counties don’t know the housing status of the client when a petition is filed. CalMatters asked each county included in this report for its most up-to-date CARE Court data, and most provided data through October or November. A handful only provided data that ended in August.

CARE Court began rolling out in California in October 2023 as a court-based treatment program for people with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. People enter it through a petition, which can be filed by their family members, first responders or mental health clinicians. Almost all of the agreements are voluntary, and even court-ordered treatment plans can’t force compliance. 
“You know what it’s like? It’s like the Wizard of Oz,” Rebekah Cooke said earlier this year, when her 36-old daughter was enrolled in CARE Court while living in a Marin County homeless encampment. “You go through all this and you think there’s hope at the end. And when you get to the end, you realize it’s all smoke and mirrors. And there’s really nothing at the end.”
CARE Court’s efforts to move her daughter indoors failed for eight months. Her daughter finally got housing that worked for her after leaving CARE Court. 
How CARE Court functions varies greatly by location, and depends on how many and what kind of beds a county has available, and how it allocates housing resources.
“The most common unmet need for CARE participants was securing and maintaining
permanent housing,” according to the most recent detailed state data on the program — more than a year old — which found 28% of people receiving CARE Court services were unhoused for at least part of the time they were in the program.

CARE Court has helped people in San Mateo County get mental health treatment, and moved some into housing, which is “fantastic,” said Ally Hoppis, clinical services manager for the county’s Behavioral Health and Recovery Services division. But, at least in her community, housing is not the main service CARE Court offers. 
San Mateo County only has 15 beds prioritized for CARE Court participants. As of October, the county had received 81 CARE Court petitions. Most people in CARE Court who need housing still have to go through the regular routes of getting it. Sometimes, the county puts people up in a motel for a month or longer because there is no other option, an expensive solution.
“Is (CARE Court) fixing our homelessness problem for the seriously mentally ill? No, it’s not,” Hoppis said. 
Nor is it making a noticeable dent on the streets of Los Angeles County, said John Maceri, chief executive of The People Concern, one of the county’s largest social service providers. His organization has referred about 10 people to CARE Court — either people who are living on the street, or people who live in interim housing but are struggling and need more help. Only four of those people were enrolled.
“The reality has been that some of the folks that we have referred have not been accepted into CARE Court,” Maceri said, “and the few that have, we haven’t seen the results in terms of the promise of support that was there, or that we thought would be there.”
The court can dismiss a CARE Court petition for a variety of reasons, including the person not meeting the strict eligibility criteria (participants must be diagnosed with schizophrenia or a similar psychotic disorder).
Housing is an “extremely important” part of CARE Court, and the program’s ability to offer it in some cases makes it different from other mental health interventions, said Corrin Buchanan, undersecretary for the California Health and Human Services Agency, which oversees the program. 
CARE Court doesn’t come with specific funds for housing, a concern counties raised early on, but the state has provided more than $1 billion for Behavioral Health Bridge Housing – temporary homes for people with mental health needs. State law requires CARE Court participants be “prioritized” for that housing, but it’s not exclusively for them. 
Starting Jan. 1, Medi-Cal will cover temporary rent support that could also help CARE Court participants, Buchanan said.
“I think there’s a lot of hope that we’ll continue to be able to make sure that this is a meaningful part of what can be made available,” Buchanan said. 
Though it’s hardly a widespread solution to homelessness, CARE Court has succeeded in helping some individuals get off the street. 
When outreach workers found him last winter, J.M. was sleeping on blankets under an awning in Oakland’s Jack London Square, with no tent to protect him from the elements. A foot injury had left him unable to walk, and he wore multiple pairs of pants and socks in an attempt to compress the limb and alleviate his symptoms.
CalMatters is using J.M.’s initials to protect his privacy.

A year later, J.M. lives at a hotel in downtown Oakland that was converted into temporary housing with mental health services. J.M. received medical care for his foot, and now regularly walks the half mile from his room to the Jack London Square waterfront, where he enjoys the sea air and waves lapping against the dock. 
He feels better about himself, J.M. said, and he’s making plans for his future. He’s looking into finding work as a janitor. He wants to quit smoking cigarettes and get his GED diploma.
“Mentally and physically, I feel good,” he said.
Matching people to the right housing: A difficult puzzle 
CARE Court participants can enter into a voluntary CARE agreement or a court-ordered CARE plan, both of which, according to state law, “may” include behavioral health care, medications, a housing plan and other supportive services on an as-needed basis.
But in a state where affordable housing is in short supply, the housing part can be difficult. Behavioral Health Bridge Housing – the only housing required to be set aside for CARE Court – isn’t always a good fit for those clients. 
In San Mateo County, that money funds 15 beds on one floor of a new behavioral health facility in Redwood City. The rooms are clean and private, but the campus is remote, said Brian Fraser, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, who represents CARE Court participants. It’s in a wooded area four miles from downtown and only one city bus stops there twice a day.
For clients who can’t get a bed there, need something more central, or aren’t comfortable with the institutional feel, most of the other options are shelters where they’d have to share rooms, Fraser said. But if someone’s mental health struggles are severe enough to land them in CARE Court, chances are slim that they’d do well in a room with strangers, he said.
“There are times where there is no option for certain clients,” Fraser said. “And it’s frustrating.”
Monterey County’s 55 Behavioral Health Bridge Housing apartments have served “very few if any” people in CARE Court, as CARE Court participants tend to need more services than bridge housing can provide, said Melanie Rhodes, the county’s behavioral health director.
In other counties, no bridge housing is available. Santa Cruz County’s first project using those state funds isn’t set to open until next year.
In Marin County, Shaylee Koontz spent almost the entire eight months she was enrolled in CARE Court either sleeping at a homeless encampment in a park in Fairfax, or in the hospital. Though she and the county have differing views on how her time in the program ended, and whether it was ultimately successful, two facts are clear: the interventions CARE Court offered failed multiple times, and she remained outside for months. 
Koontz entered into CARE Court last December, after her mother, Cooke, filed a petition on her behalf. Koontz said CARE Court workers used to stop by her encampment and check on her periodically. They’d offer her small things, such as rides to the food bank, she said. 
“They were helpful to a degree,” Koontz said. “And then it was hard to get a hold of them after a while…They kind of stopped taking my phone calls.”
While Koontz was in CARE Court, the county referred her to residential mental health crisis and substance use treatment programs three times, said Todd Schirmer, director of the county’s Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. She never lasted longer than three days in any of the programs. 
It appears the very mental health symptoms that qualified Koontz for CARE Court in the first place also made it hard for her to succeed there. During one stay, the treatment center said she failed to follow the rules. Another time, it appears they asked her to leave following an unspecified “incident.” 
“We recognize that recovery is not always a straight line and that periods of progress and setback are a normal part of healing,” Schirmer said in an email. “Our system is designed to stay connected during these moments, adjust supports as needed, and continue offering options that reflect each person’s goals, preferences, and needs.”
Koontz left CARE Court in August. Koontz and her mother said she was kicked out, while the county said she left voluntarily. She was referred to another county program.

Shortly after, as the city planned to clear her encampment and displace her and her friends, Koontz decided she’d had enough. She was drinking too much, she said, and wanted to get sober and move indoors. She got a motel room for the night, and then she moved into a rehab facility. 
Now, Koontz is living in a women’s sober living house, and doing well. She’s no longer drinking, she recently finished writing a fantasy screenplay, and she plans to start taking college classes for a film degree next year.
“I do feel good,” Koontz said. “I feel much better.” 
A golden ticket to housing in Alameda County
On the other side of the bay, Alameda County had, as of August, moved 38 CARE Court participants into temporary or permanent housing out of 41 petitions it received for people who were homeless.
Alameda County has 200 interim beds, 40 beds in board-and-care homes and six medical respite beds for CARE Court clients and others with mental health needs, plus additional money to help people with rent in private-market units. If nothing is immediately available, the county can put CARE Court clients up temporarily in a motel. 
In Alameda County, people accepted into CARE Court essentially get a golden ticket that allows them to jump the housing line, said Stephanie Regular, an attorney with the county public defender’s office, which represents CARE Court participants. Without CARE Court, people wait an average of six months to get into Behavioral Health Bridge Housing, according to the county. The longest wait was a year and a half.
“We can go out to clients and say, ‘We can offer you housing,’” Regular said. “That’s huge to these clients, and life-changing, and a reason for them to want to participate.”
But as is common when working with high-needs homeless clients, just because someone moves into a room, doesn’t mean they stay there. Eddie’s Place, a converted hotel in Oakland, offers transitional housing for up to two years with private rooms and bathrooms, meals, nurses, and other social services to people struggling with their mental health or substance use. The property has about 30 beds funded by the state money that prioritizes CARE Court clients.
So far, only about six people have moved into Eddie’s Place through CARE Court. None of them are still there, said Meg O’Neill, director of transitional housing programs for Cardea Health, which runs the facility. 
CARE Court clients tend to do well there for a few weeks, but then their medical needs, substance use or mental health symptoms become too acute even for the nurses and social services Eddie’s Place offers, and they end up back in the hospital, she said. Or, they choose to leave and go back to the street. In some cases, O’Neill doesn’t know where they went.
“What’s been hard there is just seeing folks come to us and then not stay,” O’Neill said. “I didn’t really anticipate that, but in hindsight, it does make sense.”
Why aren’t more homeless Californians accessing CARE Court?
In Los Angeles County, most people who started the CARE Court process already had housing. As of October, fewer than a quarter of the 629 petitions filed there were for people who were homeless. 
That could partly be because, at least initially, most CARE Court petitions have been filed by family members, and people who still have strong family connections may be less likely to wind up on the street. 
In many cases, CARE Court participants aren’t technically homeless, but they would likely end up on the street without the program’s intervention, said Martin Jones, Jr., who oversees CARE Court programs for Los Angeles County. As of October, 54 CARE Court participants in his county had moved into interim housing.
“I would say that, yes, the majority of our folks have not been unhoused,” he said, “however, their current living situation, especially with their families, is very fragile.”

That was the case for C.M., a CARE Court participant in Alameda County. She asked to be referred to using her initials over fears that being associated with schizophrenia would hurt her chances of getting a job.
The 55-year-old experiences bouts of hearing voices and other delusions when she’s under extreme stress, and she lost her job because of an episode in 2022. After that, she received disability payments and drove for Lyft, but it wasn’t enough to pay the rent for her San Leandro apartment. Then, she said, her Lyft app started glitching, cutting off that income. Soon she spiraled back into psychosis, and the city’s mental health crisis team started showing up at her home. After one of those visits, an EMT filed a CARE Court petition. 
Now, she has her own room in a large Victorian house in West Oakland, where a nonprofit provides mental health services. She’s planning on going back to school next month for construction management. 
“I initially was all suspicious of CARE Court,” C.M. said. “But I really couldn’t have gotten any luckier, given the circumstances. I was about to be homeless. They made sure I didn’t spend one day on the streets.”

In the Central Valley’s Stanislaus County, CARE Court is mostly serving unhoused people. Of the 102 petitions the county received as of the end of October, 60% were for people who were homeless. Almost 70% of the CARE agreements filed were for homeless participants. 
It’s hard to know for sure, but that may be because when CARE Court launched, the county focused on teaching first responders and homeless outreach workers about the program and getting them on board, said Behavioral Health Director Ruben Imperial.
“We’ve had real intentional effort around the homeless population,” he said.
When first responders and outreach workers weren’t filing petitions because the process was too complicated and time consuming, Imperial’s department made a change: Now, those workers can refer homeless clients to the county, which will file the CARE Court petition on their behalf.
Back in Alameda County earlier this month, Farrell got the call she’d been waiting for. Her brother’s CARE Court caseworker found him just half a mile from where she’d been searching. He was hospitalized on a temporary mental health hold. But Farrell knew he could be out of the hospital, and back on the street, at any time. 
She hopes this will be what it takes to get her brother out of CARE Court and into a conservatorship that forces him into treatment. But at his last CARE Court hearing, to which her brother didn’t show up, the county said they’re still trying to convince him to accept help.
“OK, fine,” Farrell said in an interview later. “But we’ve been doing this process for almost a year. So when do we take it up a step?”

Los líderes de San Diego piden a California que tome medidas más enérgicas para abordar la actual crisis ambiental causada por las aguas residuales y la contaminación industrial que fluyen del río Tijuana.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Dado que las aguas residuales del río Tijuana han contaminado barrios del sur del condado de San Diego, el Gobierno federal ha prometido destinar 667 millones de dólares a su limpieza.
Ahora, los legisladores locales están pidiendo a California que intensifique la lucha contra la contaminación transfronteriza, y uno de ellos ha presentado esta semana un proyecto de ley para revisar las normas de calidad del aire en relación con los gases nocivos procedentes del río.
La senadora estatal Catherine Blakespear celebró una audiencia conjunta este jueves en San Diego del Comité de Calidad Ambiental del Senado y el Comité de Seguridad Ambiental y Materiales Tóxicos de la Asamblea para explorar cómo el estado puede ayudar a resolver el problema.
 “California ha sido durante mucho tiempo un líder nacional en gestión ambiental y formulación de políticas”, declaró Blakespear en la audiencia. “Pero lo que está sucediendo en el Valle del Río Tijuana es un desastre ambiental internacional que socava todo lo que California representa”.
 La audiencia en el Instituto Scripps de Oceanografía en La Jolla convocó a científicos y líderes cívicos para discutir cómo la infraestructura fallida, los desechos industriales y décadas de negligencia crearon el desastre ambiental y qué se necesita para solucionarlo.
 “Debido a su carácter internacional, sabemos que el gobierno federal debe tomar la iniciativa”, dijo Blakespear. “Aun así, los gobiernos estatales y locales pueden hacer mucho”.
Tras décadas de estancamiento, la acción contra la contaminación del río Tijuana se está acelerando. La Agencia de Protección Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA) anunció el lunes un nuevo acuerdo con México para planificar la infraestructura de aguas residuales que permita el crecimiento poblacional futuro de Tijuana.
 El miércoles, el senador estatal Steve Padilla presentó un proyecto de ley para actualizar las normas estatales sobre el sulfuro de hidrógeno, un gas nocivo con olor a huevo podrido producido por las aguas residuales del río. Los residentes de la zona se quejan de dolores de cabeza, náuseas y otras molestias cuando el sulfuro de hidrógeno alcanza altas concentraciones. El proyecto de ley exigiría a la Junta de Recursos del Aire de California revisar la norma, vigente desde hace medio siglo, y ajustarla si fuera necesario.
Los legisladores estatales también buscan mejorar las condiciones de los salvavidas y otros trabajadores expuestos a la contaminación, y responsabilizar a las empresas estadounidenses por su papel en la contaminación del río. Las autoridades del condado realizarán un amplio estudio de salud para medir los efectos de la contaminación del río Tijuana y están elaborando planes para eliminar un foco de contaminación en Imperial Beach. 
 Contaminación crónica y continua
Los derrames de aguas residuales en el sur del condado de San Diego se volvieron comunes a principios de la década de 2000, enfermando a bañistas y surfistas en las playas locales. Posteriormente, las antiguas plantas de tratamiento de aguas residuales fallaron, vertiendo cientos de millones de galones de aguas residuales sin tratar al océano. El año pasado, investigadores de Scripps descubrieron que el río está dañando a las comunidades cercanas al liberar sustancias químicas en el aire, como el gas de sulfuro de hidrógeno, que huele a huevos podridos.
 “Las aguas residuales que fluyen hacia la costa del condado de San Diego están envenenando nuestro aire y agua, dañando la salud pública, cerrando playas y matando la vida marina”, dijo Blakespear.
Las autoridades de San Diego han presionado con éxito para obtener inversión federal para modernizar las antiguas plantas de tratamiento de aguas residuales. También implementaron análisis de calidad del agua más rápidos y encuestaron a los residentes para entender los problemas de salud que enfrentan.
 Paula Stigler Granados, profesora de salud pública en la Universidad Estatal de San Diego, dijo que los estudios de personas que viven cerca del río Tijuana encontraron “cosas más aterradoras”: el 45% experimentó problemas de salud, el 63% dijo que la contaminación interrumpió su trabajo o escuela y el 94% de los encuestados informó tener olores a aguas residuales en el hogar.
 “Los niños se despiertan enfermos en mitad de la noche”, dijo. “Se trata de una exposición continua y crónica, no de un evento puntual”.

 Las muestras de agua revelaron productos químicos industriales, metanfetamina, fentanilo, pesticidas restringidos, productos farmacéuticos y compuestos de azufre que causan mal olor, dijo.
 “Esto es absolutamente una emergencia de salud pública”, dijo Stigler Granados. “Creo que es la mayor crisis ambiental que tenemos en el país en este momento”.
 Ese sentido de urgencia no es universal. El año pasado, el gobernador Gavin Newsom rechazó las solicitudes de las autoridades de San Diego para declarar el estado de emergencia por el problema de la contaminación fronteriza, argumentando que “no habría significado nada”.
En los últimos dos años, el senador estatal Steve Padilla ha presentado proyectos de ley para financiar mejoras en el tratamiento de aguas negras, limitar la construcción de vertederos en el Valle del Río Tijuana y exigir a las empresas californianas que reporten las descargas de residuos que afectan la calidad del agua en el estado. Sin embargo, estos proyectos de ley fracasaron. Padilla afirmó que el problema se ignora en esta zona fronteriza, con su población de bajos ingresos y clase trabajadora.
 “Esta es una de las crisis ambientales más singulares y agudas de toda Norteamérica”, afirmó Padilla. “Se le subestima simplemente por el lugar donde ocurre”. 
 Soluciones para el río Tijuana
 Este año, Estados Unidos reparó la deteriorada Planta Internacional de Tratamiento de Aguas Residuales de South Bay y amplió su capacidad de 25 millones a 35 millones de galones de aguas residuales al día. En abril, México reparó su planta de Punta Bandera, cerca de la frontera, lo que redujo los flujos de aguas residuales al océano.
 Pero la costa de Imperial Beach ha permanecido cerrada durante tres años, y los residentes aún se quejan de dolores de cabeza, náuseas, irritación ocular y problemas respiratorios causados por la contaminación atmosférica. Este problema se agrava en un punto conocido como el punto crítico de Saturn Blvd. en Imperial Beach, donde las alcantarillas de control de inundaciones convierten el agua contaminada con aguas residuales en espuma, esparciendo contaminantes al aire.
 “Cuando el agua está contaminada, se puede cerrar la playa”, dijo Kim Prather, química atmosférica de Scripps, quien identificó las toxinas en el aire. “Pero no se puede prohibir a la gente respirar”.
 Los miembros de la comunidad se sienten olvidados por los líderes estatales mientras enfrentan la contaminación crónica del aire y años de playas cerradas debido a las aguas residuales contaminadas del río Tijuana, dijo Serge Dedina, director ejecutivo de la organización ambiental WildCoast y ex alcalde de Imperial Beach.
 “Lo que dicen es ‘¿cómo es que California no se preocupa por nosotros?’”, dijo Dedina.
 Mientras las autoridades federales planean ampliaciones a la Planta de Tratamiento de Aguas Residuales de South Bay International que aumentarán su capacidad a 50 millones de galones por día, los líderes locales y estatales tienen su propio plan de acción.
 Una de las principales prioridades de Aguirre es eliminar las alcantarillas en el punto crítico de Saturn Blvd. que causan contaminación del aire.
 “Eso es algo que está al alcance de la mano y que no necesitamos que el gobierno federal solucione”, dijo Aguirre.
 Espera obtener fondos para ese proyecto de la Proposición 4, el bono ambiental estatal que los votantes aprobaron a principios de este año. Este programa destina 50 millones de dólares a la limpieza de vías fluviales degradadas , como el río Tijuana y el río Nuevo, que desembocan en el Mar de Saltón.
 El condado también está planeando un estudio de salud que incluiría mediciones fisiológicas para determinar los efectos de la contaminación del río Tijuana en la salud.
 “Estamos trabajando en cómo tomar datos médicos reales y sólidos y hacer un seguimiento de un grupo de personas que viven en este entorno, para poder comprender qué sucede en sus cuerpos”, dijo Aguirre. “¿Qué les sucede a los niños y a las personas mayores? ¿Qué hay en su torrente sanguíneo?”
 El condado de San Diego ha distribuido alrededor de 10,000 purificadores de aire domésticos a los hogares cercanos al río Tijuana, pero Aguirre quiere proporcionar dispositivos a los 40,000 hogares de la zona afectada.
 Dedina dijo que su organización está retirando neumáticos de desecho que se exportan a México y regresan al Valle del Río Tijuana.
 “Mi lección aquí es que debemos detener los sedimentos, los neumáticos, la basura, los desechos tóxicos, las aguas residuales”, dijo.
 Además de su proyecto de ley para actualizar las normas de sulfuro de hidrógeno, Padilla afirmó que está explorando una legislación para regular la contaminación generada por las empresas californianas que operan a través de maquiladoras en México. Quiere colaborar con México para presionarlos y que, básicamente, tomen medidas drásticas contra las empresas estadounidenses que tienen licencia para operar aquí en California.
 Blakespear dijo que quiere proteger a los socorristas y otros trabajadores públicos expuestos a la contaminación.
 Ya sea que la solución sea crear estándares ambientales para empresas internacionales o financiar infraestructura costosa, los legisladores reconocen que la naturaleza binacional del problema hace que sea difícil de resolver.
 “La complejidad de que se trate de un asunto internacional y federal ha aumentado las dificultades sobre quién debería actuar”, afirmó Blakespear.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/112125_Paloma-Aguirre_AH_CM_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

In November the California Public Employees Retirement System announced it invested $60 billion in “climate solutions,” toward a goal of $100 billion by 2030. While the announcement highlighted several deals, the pension’s overall strategy remains shrouded in secrecy.
As the largest public pension in the U.S., what CalPERS does has major impact. Yet it does not disclose a complete list of its climate-focused investments, nor the criteria it used to select them. 
When asked how CalPERS defines climate investments, its staff points to a “taxonomy of mitigation, transition and adaptation” — meaning investments that reduce carbon emissions, support cleaner technologies for polluting businesses and help communities adapt to climate impacts.
This taxonomy captures the right themes but is a woefully sparse definition for a pension that prides itself on climate leadership. 
Climate finance around the world faces credibility challenges. Research has found climate dollars going to everything from airports to ice cream shops. 
CalPERS can and should do better. The Sierra Club and the California Common Good coalition have asked CalPERS to be more transparent and adopt science-based principles to guide its climate investment strategy. 
That became more important after research revealed CalPERS’ climate plan included $3.56 billion invested in fossil fuel companies, as well as in airlines, plastics manufacturers and tech companies.

CalPERS’ climate plan aims to not only reduce carbon emissions through its portfolio, but to reduce the risk that climate change poses to the pension fund. 
Risk reduction should be front of mind, as studies show pension funds are particularly vulnerable to the wide-ranging economic impact of climate change and could face declines in investment return of up to 50% by 2040. That would be a massive shock to all pensions working to deliver safe, secure retirements for beneficiaries.
What remains unclear is how CalPERS’ investments in polluting companies actually address climate risk. 
CalPERS has defended its fossil fuel outlay by emphasizing the investments are “small,” and “a green asset is a green asset.” That doesn’t cut it. The investments lack what is called “additionality” — they’re not new investments, and they don’t unlock resources for decarbonization. 
Simply put, holding investments in fossil fuel companies does not protect workers’ savings from the systemic risk of climate change.
A climate plan that counts anything with a whiff of “green” as a climate investment does not represent a commitment to allocating capital where it’s needed to scale clean energy solutions and stabilize markets. Every dollar invested in polluting companies — that isn’t being leveraged to drive change — is a dollar that could have been invested in reducing emissions and protecting communities. 
Fossil fuel investments do not belong in CalPERS’ climate solutions portfolio. 
By keeping its criteria for climate solution investments vague, CalPERS may think it is preserving flexibility to develop a cutting-edge strategy. But it is missing the opportunity to show how public money can be invested to proactively protect workers’ livelihoods, retirement savings and communities. 
CalPERS’ climate plan counts progress in billions of dollars, but it doesn’t measure the things that matter most, such as the amount of emissions reduced, communities served and clean energy deployed. 
System-level risks require system-level solutions. For a fund of CalPERS’ size and influence, that means using its leverage to mitigate the risks of climate change that threaten the economy and beneficiaries’ pensions. 
CalPERS can start by adopting science-based principles that set clear exclusions on what does — and does not — constitute climate investments, and by clearly defining strategies for mitigation, adaptation and transition. 
CalPERS should be applauded for identifying that climate change poses a clear risk to its beneficiaries’ savings and the entire economy. Many pensions have yet to follow suit. 
But it has yet to articulate a bold enough vision to effectively mitigate those risks.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/030424-Carbon-Capture-LV_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-18 08:57:25.566536

Two bills that would radically alter how development occurs in Florida appear to be the work of a timber company that owns 11,000 acres in St. Johns County.During the holidays you see ribbons and bows everywhere you look. You find them on the packages under the tree and at the gift wrap counter. Dealers even stick big bows on top of new cars. But the biggest gift of all is working its way through the Florida Legislature right now, complete with a great big bow on top.
I’m talking about a couple of bills, SB 354 and HB 299, that would grant big landowners the power to tie up in knots anyone who might object to their ginormous development plans.
No more fighting a wealthy landowner in a packed public hearing, hoping to persuade your elected representatives to vote no. These bills would give an automatic green light to some big, bad projects, as long as they check a few boxes on a form.

“This is a real estate development bill unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” investigative reporter Jason Garcia said on his “Seeking Rents” podcast.
The bills call these big developments “Blue Ribbon” projects. The term implies they would win an award for excellence, like a prize pig at the county fair.
Instead, I think these two bills should win the award for the boldest, most brazen ripoff of the public in the 2026 session. The big landowners would be the ones resembling Porky and Babe, stuffing their snouts in the trough with no one to rein them in.
Gil Smart via Vote Water
“If these bills go through, they totally rob the public of their right to have a say in their community,’ said Gil Smart, executive director of the anti-pollution group Vote Water.
The bills would limit local governments to just 60 days to determine whether a proposed project meets the bills’ vague criteria. If a city or county can’t meet that deadline, the project is automatically approved, and that light stays green for 50 years.
Most dangerous of all, the bills say these projects can be approved by local government administrators, not by the elected officials.
Kim Dinkins via 1000 Friends
“It’s a way to keep the public completely out of the planning process,” said Kim Dinkins, policy and planning director of the smart-growth group 1000 Friends of Florida.
You can see why developers want to cut the public out. They view the public the way the villains in “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?” viewed those groovy teens driving the Mystery Machine.
They would’ve gotten away with it if it weren’t for that meddling public!
The meddling public
Over and over, developers have persuaded the Legislature to take away the public’s ability to object to bad projects.
Just two years ago, the Legislature passed — and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law — a bill to rob the public of the power to hold a voter-led referendum on their local land-use plans.
Yet, all over Florida, people have continued loudly objecting to developments that would ruin their slice of paradise. They have repeatedly stood up for their existing zoning rules and comprehensive plans against big-money builders.
For instance, the Sarasota Audubon Society defeated the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, when it attempted to build 170 homes on a low-lying 50-acre ranch next to an Audubon bird sanctuary. Audubon folks bested the homebuilder three times.
In Manatee County, an effort by politically powerful developer Pat Neal to build a 440-home subdivision on 217 acres of land in a flood zone ran into so much opposition from the neighbors that he got a unanimous “no!” vote by the county commissioners.
And near Orlando, a group called Save Orange County managed to beat back an attempt by a Texas company to build an 1,800-home development with the ridiculous name of “Sustanee.”
In each case, the developer was trying to change the property’s classification to something that would allow their development to proceed. In each case, public hearings by the local government allowed neighbors to raise serious objections that persuaded the elected officials to say no.
The more resistance the public puts up, the more the developers try to snatch away their ability to object.
Just look at what happened last year with Senate Bill 180, which handcuffed local governments so they can’t change anything to improve safety after what we learned from our multiple hurricanes in 2023.
The developers wanted to be able to build the exact same thing in the exact same place, no matter how risky. Now 20 or so local governments are suing to overturn that law.
Fourteen years after then-Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature dismantled our growth management system, Floridians are figuring out that this put the developers in the driver’s seat and they’re driving the state into a ditch.
To block the spread of sprawl, some counties have passed rules that say certain regions must remain rural, period. Last month, the Florida Attorney General’s Office — apparently channeling the build-and-die crowd — claimed that the rural boundaries in Seminole and Orange counties violate private property rights and would likely be found unconstitutional.
The Orlando Sentinel, in reporting on this ridiculous AG opinion, noted, “Seminole’s rural boundary was approved by voters in 2004 and its backers have prevailed in challenges in both state and federal courts.” In other words, our esteemed AG appears to be D-U-M-B.
The fact that developers persuaded the Florida attorney general to make a fool of himself should show you how much influence they have. And now you know how desperate they are to pass this new law to cut out the public.
Full of holes
Florida has been described as a sunny place for shady people. Why that’s not our official state slogan, I don’t know.
But bear that in mind when I tell you that the one part of these two pro-developer bills that sounds attractive is as full of holes as a block of Swiss cheese.
The bills say any landowner who wants to get these development favors must set aside 60% of their property as a “reserve area.” The sponsors have been promoting this as if we’re going to get a lot of free parkland. In fact, I’ve seen it referred to in some publications as a “land conservation bill.”
But it’s not.
The language in the “reserve area” part of the bill is as loose as the wobbly wheels on an old shopping cart. It doesn’t require the landowner to keep that 60% in one contiguous area. It could be scattered here and there across the whole expanse.
Even worse, it doesn’t require keeping the land in its natural state. You could build a power station, a pickleball court, or a retention pond and call it “a reserve area” and you’d be in compliance.
Heck, put in an 18-hole golf course for your big development and call it a “reserve area.” You’ve got to reserve a tee time, right?
Who would come up with such a misleading mess of a bill? Well, dear reader, follow the ribbon of connections.
Bulldoze the whole thing
The sponsors of these bills are clearly looking to boost their own industry, not serve the public.
Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
SB 354 is sponsored by Sen. Stan McClain, R-Ocala, who also happens to be — SURPRISE! — a homebuilder in Marion County. In fact, his legislative website says he’s executive officer of the Marion County Building Industry Association.
“These bills are about the Florida we leave behind,” he told FloridaPolitics.com. “They secure meaningful land conservation at no cost to taxpayers, while giving our state a responsible way to plan for future growth.”
This is what’s technically known as “a load of hooey.” To McClain, the responsible way to plan for future growth is to say, “Let the developers do whatever they want.”
McClain is an old hand at promoting bills designed to boost his bottom line. Last year he pushed a bill that would have made it easier for developers to pave over every rural parcel in the state. Fortunately, it died in committee.
Rep. Lauren Melo via her campaign website
The companion bill to McClain’s, HB 299, is sponsored by Rep. Lauren Melo, R-Naples, a real estate broker. Last week, her bill had its first subcommittee hearing, and trust me when I tell you that Melo displayed the kind of hard-charging real estate salesmanshipthat Alec Baldwin praised in “Glengarry Glen Ross.”
During the Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee hearing, she called her bill “the innovative path that Florida needs.” She also sneered that critics of the bill are just “knee-jerk obstructionists.”
The “obstructionists” included not only a lobbyist for Audubon of Florida but also someone from the Florida Association of Counties. The two of them poked more holes in her arguments than a Krispy Kreme employee prepping a couple dozen honey-glazed.
Dean Black via Florida House
They were not alone in pointing out problems. Members of Melo’s own party found flaws. Jacksonville’s Rep. Dean Black, for instance, said he was troubled by the fact that the “reserve” section doesn’t require the landowner to “preserve” anything.
“You could bulldoze the whole thing and cover it with solar panels and call it ‘conservation,’” Black said.
But then a curious thing happened. Instead of voting the bill down as fatally flawed, most of the people on the subcommittee voted to approve it. They even said they looked forward to seeing Melo “fix” those little quibbles before her bill reaches the House floor for a vote.
It’s sort of like your kindergarten teacher noting that you still haven’t learned how to count to 10, but she’s letting you move up to the first grade anyway. Hey, you’ll probably pick up those math skills somewhere before you collect your high school diploma, right?
Unravel the wrapping
The big question, of course, is who’s really pushing this.
Unfortunately, unlike your great aunt’s pet labradoodle, the bill doesn’t come with a collar showing the identity of its owner. But we can make a guess or two.
To begin with, there aren’t too many entities that own more than 10,000 acres of land in Florida. That narrows the list down from 23 million Florida residents to a few hundred.
According to Garcia’s “Seeking Rents” podcast, one little known company has hired more than a dozen lobbyists to promote these bills. The company, started in 2022, is called “Big Lands Transect Collaborative LLC,” and it’s based in Dallas.
Despite its deep-in-the-heart-of-Texas origin, the company has a Jacksonville address. Turns out that address is shared by another big landowner: First Coast Land and Timber LLC.
In 2018, First Coast Land and Timber “completed $40 million worth of land deals to acquire about 11,000 acres of property in southern St. Johns County,” the St. Augustine Record reported. “It’s unclear what the immediate plans are for the property, but that part of the county is being rapidly developed, especially for new homes.”
First Coast is owned by a New York City company that manages hedge funds, Ruane Cunniff, according to the Jacksonville Daily Record.
Hedge funds are notorious for seeking big profits, whether they’re investing in condominiums or mobile home parks. They are not known for their conservation work. But maybe this one’s different.
Another company that’s located at that same Jacksonville address, Jax-Palatka Farms LLC, recently donated $100,000 to the Friends of Wilton Simpson PAC.
It’s nice to see these companies devoting themselves to the democratic process. I’m sure that handing over wads of cash to the state agriculture commissioner has absolutely nothing to do with them trying to smooth their path toward development (nudge nudge, wink wink).
I called and sent emails to various lobbyists, corporate agents, and others who might be able to unveil what these companies have planned.
Alas, no one responded, so I was unable to find out why our fine legislators seem so eager to tie the fate of our state to the wishes of people from Texas and New York.
I am hopeful, though, that the fancy gift wrap holding these bills together will come unraveled before legislators pass them into law. Otherwise, I know a lot of folks all over the state who’ll be fit to be tied.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/St_-Johns-County-forest-trail-via-St.-Johns-County.jpg,,,2025-12-18 01:06:56.886525

It saved me from depression,Sophia Martin,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/18/dont-dis-makeup-it-saved-me-from-depression/,"Makeup for me and many other young women is a tool to build confidence, creativity and self-expression, giving us more control.","I started struggling with acne when I was 14. My bad skin really lowered my self-esteem. Because I was so young, I did not understand what was wrong with my skin. I needed something to feel better about myself. 
When I was 15, my older sister bought me makeup — cheap, beginner-friendly products from brands like e.l.f and ColourPop. That gift was the beginning of my makeup journey. 
Makeup for me and many other young women is a tool to build confidence, creativity and self-expression. Nearly 74% of women who were polled for a YouGov study reported wearing makeup, and 49% of the women surveyed said makeup boosted confidence.  For teenagers struggling with acne, as I was, makeup can provide a sense of control over how we present ourselves.



I spent hours experimenting with different foundations and concealers. I used eyeshadow so heavily that it sometimes made me look like I had a black eye, and my eyeliner was often so messy that I ended up looking like a metal rock star. Some products made my skin break out, others clashed with my skin tone, and many of my early attempts were complete failures.
But each misstep taught me more about what worked on my face. Over time, I discovered how to use products the right way. My friend Haileigh helped by reminding me that makeup was not about hiding my flaws; it was about highlighting the best features.
However, there is a deeper side to makeup, and it’s the psychological benefits of it and how real those benefits are to people. “Use of makeup may contribute …  to a lower prevalence of mild depression,” said researchers in a 2023 study of 2,400 Brazilian women.

Makeup does not just change how others see us; it changes how we see ourselves. It may seem to others as if I am wearing makeup to impress people, especially men. But I am wearing it for me — to feel happy, not to tear my ego apart because of my skin.
Critics argue that makeup is superficial and that young people should learn to accept their natural appearance. But according to the American Academy of Dermatology,  acne affects up to 50 million Americans. Acne has significant impacts on mental health, including depression and social anxiety, according to research. A study of 3,775 18-year-olds found that “girls and boys with acne had significantly more depressive symptoms, lower self-attitude, more feelings of uselessness, fewer feelings of pride, lower self-worth, and lower body satisfaction than those without acne.”  
Makeup does not replace self-love; it is a coping tool that can help people navigate the social pressures of adolescence and adulthood. In my case, makeup allowed me to experiment, fail and succeed in a space that felt safe. It became a form of self-care, a ritual that made me feel in control when so much about adolescence felt overwhelming. It also inspired me to learn more about skin care, health and personal wellness, which has had lasting benefits beyond the mirror. 
If there is a takeaway from my story, it is this: Confidence does not always come from going all natural, and self-esteem is not a one-size-fits-all journey. For me, it was the e.l.f. foundation and concealer and ColourPop’s Nude Mood eyeshadow palette from my sister that unlocked my love for makeup and the confidence it brings. 
We should stop dismissing makeup as pointless and unnecessary. We should start recognizing its potential to build self-esteem in teens, especially when they are fighting battles that are not visible to the naked eye.
If I wasn’t so vocal about my struggles with acne, then people would never know why I use makeup. They might assume I just do it for fun. It is indeed fun to wake up every morning and slap on a full face of makeup, but it also makes me feel great. Do I wish I had clear skin? Absolutely, but my bad skin helped me find what I love. Makeup is my best friend.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)OpenWorks CEO Will Holman said people who use his Greenmount West nonprofit to get their businesses off the ground often struggle with knowing where to start, what resources are available and deciding where to launch their budding businesses.
“We have people all the time asking us questions … ‘Where is so-and-so? What agency do I go to for this?’” Holman said Wednesday. “Access to information is unequally distributed.”
That’s why Holman was happy to learn that a new state website could help would-be entrepreneurs looking for opportunities in underserved areas with those beginning questions. so his nonprofit can help with the more challenging aspects of starting a business.
The Maryland Community Business Compass website, unveiled Wednesday by Gov. Wes Moore (D), aims to help smaller and local businesses with market and population data, while also connecting them to various state grants that could assist in start-up costs.

“These billion-dollar corporations … they have all these analytics and all this data that helps to give them information as to what they should do,” Moore said. “For too many of our small’business owners, especially the ones who are in the highest-need communities and the most-neglected communities — they just have to guess. They have to figure it out.”
The dashboard currently has a focus on recruiting child care services and fresh food retailers to underserved areas, though other businesses could utilize the information provided as well.
“No more guesswork, no more figuring it out,” Moore said. “Let’s make sure we level the playing field for all of us to be successful.”
In addition, the Moore administration announced $10 million in grants for new child care facilities and fresh food retailers to start up in communities that need them.
Of that funding, $8 million comes from the Child Care Capital Support Revolving Loan fund to boost those services in underserved areas, according to Commerce Secretary Harry Coker Jr.
“Child care gives working families more freedom, more flexibility and more opportunities.” Coker said. “Priority is given to providers in underserved or rural communities, providers in low-income, high-poverty areas and to providers that serve young children and children with special needs. That’s where these funds have the most impact.”
Meanwhile, $2 million of the announced funding Wednesday will be available for local grocers to bring fresh food into their communities as part of the newly launched NourishedMD Grant program.
“Through this program, we’re supporting the development, the stabilization and the expansion of small businesses that provide fresh food in areas where residents have limited or no access to nutritious food options,” Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day said. “These businesses included grocery or corner stores, farm stands, food co-ops, farmers markets and even eligible delivery retailers.”
Holman said that those grant funds, as well as resources provided by the new data dashboard, will help OpenWorks get more local businesses up and running.
“Success is not a straight line,” he said during the event. “Success is definitely not a straight line if you’re a woman. If you’re Black. If you’re queer or if you’re broke. We are here to provide the resources to the least among us. To build the businesses that no one can ever take away from them.”

Free.,"Trump claims economic turnaround, after blasting Dems’ affordability focus",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claims-economic-turnaround-after-blasting-dems-affordability-focus,,"WASHINGTON — As Americans continue to face rising prices ahead of year-end holidays, President Donald Trump blamed inflation and health care costs on his predecessor during a prime-time speech Wednesday in which he also claimed to have fixed the issues.Trump “inherited a mess” and has turned the United States into the “envy of the entire globe” by imposing an immigration crackdown, tariffs and tax breaks, he said. “Over the past 11 months, we have brought more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history. There's never been anything like it, and I think most would agree I was elected in a landslide,” Trump said.Standing before a backdrop of Christmas decorations, Trump also promised $1,776 checks would arrive for members of the United States military by Christmas.And he continued to blame Democrats for health care costs that are projected to skyrocket next month when tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans expire.Nearly a year into his second term, Trump remains fixated on blaming former President Joe Biden even as his own approval ratings sink, according to numerous recent polls.A plaque below Biden’s photo in Trump’s newly installed “Presidential Walk of Fame” display reads “Sleepy Joe Biden,” according to reports from journalists present at the White House Wednesday.“When I took office, inflation was the worst in 48 years, and some would say in the history of our country, which caused prices to be higher than ever before, making life unaffordable for millions and millions of Americans. This happened during a Democrat administration, and it's when we first began hearing the word ‘affordability,’” Trump said.In recent weeks, Trump has said “affordability” is a “hoax.”Yet the bulk of Trump’s somewhat hastily scheduled address — the White House announced it Tuesday — focused on lowering costs for housing, electricity and health care.Trump announced he will send a $1,776 “warrior dividend” to every U.S. servicemember. The amount is in honor of the year of the country’s  founding, Trump said. Checks are “already on the way,” he said.That could add up to as much as $2.6 billion, according to a White House estimate Wednesday night that 1.45 million service members would receive the payment.Health care costsHe also touted trumprx.gov, where he said Americans can find “unprecedented price reductions” on prescription drugs starting in January.“These big price cuts will greatly reduce the cost of health care,” Trump said.He boosted a Republican plan on Capitol Hill to fund individual health savings accounts, or HSAs, in annual amounts of $1,000 to $1,500 depending on age and poverty level. An HSA is not health insurance.“I want the money to go directly to the people so you can buy your own health care. You'll get much better health care at a much lower price,” Trump said.Four House Republicans defected Wednesday to sign a Democrat-led petition to bypass Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and force a floor vote in January on extending health insurance premium subsidies for people who buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.'My favorite word'Trump spent several minutes addressing the economy, stating that prices on groceries and fuel are coming down. Both claims are false, according to government data.“I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down fast,” Trump said.The latest consumer price index for September showed gasoline prices rose 4.1% over the past 12 months, and “was the largest factor in the all items monthly increase,” increasing 1.5% over the previous month.Food prices rose faster than overall inflation in recent months, according to the government’s latest data. Food prices in August were 3.2% higher than a year ago, according to the data.Still, Trump claimed an economic turnaround that he credited to his international trade policy.“Much of this success has been accomplished by tariffs — my favorite word ‘tariffs’ — which for many decades have been used successfully by other countries against us, but not anymore,” he said.The U.S. collected nearly $195 billion in customs duties in fiscal year 2025, up from $77 last fiscal year, according to the U.S. Treasury’s monthly statement. The U.S. ended fiscal year 2025 with a deficit reaching nearly $1.8 trillion, or roughly 6% of the domestic economy’s gross domestic product.Trump unilaterally imposed a global 10% tariff on all foreign goods in April, plus higher tariffs on many major trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on whether Trump’s emergency tariffs are legal.Americans have lost faith in Trump’s ability to handle the economy, according to an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll published Wednesday.Trump received a 36% approval rating on his economic strategy, the lowest rating over the past six years that the survey has asked voters the question.A Fox News poll released Nov. 19 found 76% of respondents saw the economy negatively. Of all voters polled, 41% approved and 58% disapproved of Trump’s performance. That’s down from the conservative news network’s poll of Biden’s approval ratings during the same point in his presidency, which the network says was 44%.Mum on VenezuelaThe president did not spend much time addressing his military campaign off the coast of Venezuela, despite declaring just 24 hours beforehand that the U.S. had formed a “blockade” in the Caribbean Sea.Trump posted on his own social media platform Truth Social Tuesday night that Venezuela is “completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.”The campaign, which has become top of mind for many lawmakers on Capitol Hill, is about preventing drug smuggling to the U.S., Trump and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly said.Democratic lawmakers are pressing the Trump administration to release unedited footage of a Sept. 2 strike that killed two shipwrecked individuals who were clinging to what was left of a boat after an initial strike.",,,,2025-12-17 23:00:15.409619

The Montana Supreme Court said a conservation group that successfully challenged a practice of adding a few homes to a subdivision at a time to skirt state water laws should receive its attorneys fees for doing so.
In the unanimous opinion, Justice Beth Baker said that Broadwater County District Court Judge Michael McMahon had made a mistake by misinterpreting part of state statutes that required groups to prove a state agency or other group possessed something that Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and seven individuals wanted.
“Despite finding every factor in favor of an award, the district court nonetheless denied fees after concluding that the defendants did not ‘possess’ anything Upper Missouri wanted,” the court said. “Our case law does not require that a defendant possess a tangible object for the tangible parameters to weigh in the plaintiffs’ favor.”
In this case, the Montana Supreme Court said that the group of plaintiffs didn’t need to prove that the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, along with Broadwater County and 71 Ranch LP, possessed something that Upper Missouri Waterkeeper should have been given. Instead, the majority said that group of plaintiffs did the only thing they could: Take the state, county and developer to court.
The group not only successfully proved that Broadwater County had “bent over backwards” to allow the subdivisions to skirt water law, but also demonstrated that after the court ruling, the state DNRC changed its policy to comply with the ruling.
The court said Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and the residents had proven every item they could, and McMahon’s ruling rested on a narrow interpretation, rather than a more broad scope, as the court has set out for attorneys’ fees. Furthermore, the justices said that Montana law requires courts to consider the resources of each of the litigants.
In this case, the court said that Waterkeeper and the residents had a small number of resources to leverage and only had one remedy in law, whereas county government, the state DNRC and even the large 71 Ranch LP., had considerably more resources to wage a legal battle.
“The court found that Upper Missouri ‘certainly has even fewer resources in comparison to the combined power of a state agency, county government, and an alleged powerful land owner,” the court opinion said.
While the court sent the case back to McMahon to determine reasonable attorney’s fees, the court decision on the issue of water, subdivisions and an exemption was a pivotal case.
The Waterkeeper and the residents of Broadwater County had challenged the county, which granted the subdivision permits by approving the total planned houses in segments. McMahon and the Montana Supreme Court determined that the county and the developer, 71 Ranch LP, had done so in order to avoid review and possibly having to acquire more water rights, likely an expensive and time-consuming process.
The plan called for subdividing 442 acres on the east side of Canyon Ferry Reservoir called the “Horse Creek Hills Subdivision.” It proposed four phases, which would subdivide the lots into 39 residential lots, two commercials and open space, and those phases would be served by their own exempt well, septic and stormwater system.
“The court found ‘no basis in law for DNRC to treat the four phases of 71 Ranch’s subdivision project separately, a conclusion which is absolutely clear from statute, administrative rule, Montana Supreme Court precedent and even DNRC’s letter in this matter,’” the court affirmed. “The District Court reasoned that without Upper Missouri’s declaratory judgment action, DNRC would have continued to misapply the term ‘combined appropriation.’”
  Concurring opinion, recusal 

Even though the Supreme Court weighed in unanimously, Justices Katherine Bidegaray and Laurie McKinnon offered a concurring opinion, while agreeing with the majority. Chief Justice Cory Swanson did not participate in the deliberations. He was the Broadwater County Attorney, which was part of the litigation.
Originally, Waterkeeper had appealed McMahon’s decision to deny attorneys’ fees based on three different legal standards. One of those, known as the “private attorney general doctrine,” says that plaintiffs who successfully challenge rights guaranteed by the constitution should be entitled to attorneys’ fees, if the state’s elected attorney general does not vindicate those rights.
The majority of the court said that it would not consider the private attorney general considerations because the plaintiffs had already won on the other argument. However, Bidegaray and McKinnon both said future litigation may be helped by giving some guidance on whether the challenge implicated constitutional matters.
Both concurring justices said the case raised constitutional issues, including the protection of water, a clean and healthful environment, as well as the residents’ ability to participate in government decisions.
“Addressing the Private Attorney General Doctrine claim would underscore the importance of these rights and the critical role citizens play in checking governmental overreach and ensuring responsible stewardship of Montana’s environmental resources. The clarification is not merely academic but provides meaningful guidance to lower courts and litigants about when the (doctrine) appropriately applies,” the concurring opinion said.
The plaintiffs cheered the ruling, saying it was important for many groups that often litigate cases in order to protect Montana’s land and rights.
“Public interest fee recovery is crucial for enforcing civil rights and helping marginalized groups access justice, ensuring legal aid for important issues like environmental protection,” said Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper. “Without the ability to recover fees after successfully defending the public interest, the high cost of litigation creates a chilling effect, discouraging citizens from standing up for their rights, and gives government and wealthy special interests a perverse incentive to continue harmful behavior, knowing it’s costly and difficult for ordinary Montanans to push back.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MaxPixel.net-Pipe-Faucet-Water-3863039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 21:59:21.763849

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley took the stand on the third day of the high profile trial of  Judge Hannah Dugan, who is accused of obstructing federal immigration agents and hiding the man they came to the Milwaukee County Courthouse to arrest. 
Ashley was asked about an email he wrote on April 4 to his fellow judges, following a string of courthouse arrests by immigration officers. The chief judge, like many of his colleagues, was disturbed by the arrests, and feared that they would disrupt the courthouse’s business and erode the public’s trust that the courthouse was a safe place. 
Ashley wrote that ICE arrests could likely be prohibited inside courtrooms but that “I’m not sure we have the authority to intervene with what happens in the public hallway.”
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
As the judges were discussing a plan for responding to the ICE presence at the courthouse, Ashley offered a training presentation — which Dugan was unable to attend  — that highlighted in part that immigration enforcement could happen in the public hallways, but not against certain groups of people such as victims of crimes. 
While questioning Ashley, prosecutors showed the jury an email Dugan sent in response to the training which said that “optimally” a policy guiding how court staff should respond to the presence of immigration officers would be desirable. Less than an hour later, Ashley attached a draft policy to an email, and sent it off to Dugan and other judges. Ashley testified that he wanted as much feedback on the policy as possible, including from the sheriff’s office, the district attorney and other “system partners.” He also reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to get their input, agreeing with prosecutors who said Ashley “wanted to get it right.” 
Although the policy had been drafted, it had not been officially instituted. The policy was non-binding on April 18 when agents arrived outside Dugan’s courtroom, and did not explicitly state that ICE could not make arrests in the public hallway, Ashley acknowledged on the stand. 
Part of the draft  policy advised court staff to contact their immediate supervisors about the presence of ICE, and said Ashley should be among those notified. Dugan’s defense attorneys argued in prior days of testimony that Dugan was following the draft policy when she went into the hallway outside her courtroom to confirm that the plain-clothes agents there had a a non-judicial, administrative warrant and to tell them to go check in with the chief judge. The draft policy stated that all court staff were expected to comply with its guidance, and advised staff that administrative  warrants do not compel staff to comply with requests from ICE agents. 
Ashley testified that he was at home when the agents were sent to his office by Dugan. He recalled getting a call from Brian Barkow, chief deputy of the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, advising him that ICE was in the building to arrest someone. After calling the deputy administrator, Ashley confirmed that agents were there. However, Ashley did not direct them to be brought to his office, the chief judge testified. Texts Ashley sent to Dugan telling her to call him went unanswered. She later replied that she had left the court to attend Good Friday church services. 
“I was concerned about what might’ve happened,” said Ashley, who then sent out another email notifying the judges about the ICE activity at the courthouse. He mentioned in the email that “all the agent’s actions were consistent with the draft policy.” 
Judges, courthouse staff upset by ICE presence
Prosecutors have accused Dugan of having “strongly held views” about ICE arrests at the courthouse. Wednesday’s testimony demonstrated that judges and courthouse staff were struggling with the arrival of ICE at the courthouse and trying to formulate a response.
On April 6, in the wake of the first arrests, Ashley issued a press release stating that ICE operating around the courthouse “can deter individuals, particularly immigrants and marginalized communities, from attending court hearings, seeking legal assistance, or reporting crimes,” and that “this undermines the fundamental right to access the courts and seek legal remedies.” This could lead to a lack of trust in the judicial system which could foster “a reluctance to engage with law enforcement, legal representation, and the courts, ultimately hindering the administration of justice.”

Ashley read the press release on the stand, his voice booming through the federal courtroom. It stated  that “allowing ICE agents to operate within courthouse complexes has the potential to significantly damage the integrity of the court system,” and that “it undermines the principles of justice, fairness, and equality before the law, and ultimately jeopardizes the rights of individuals seeking to navigate the legal process. Courts remain safe havens for all individuals, free from the threats of immigration enforcement.”
The chief judge confirmed on the stand that he continued to hold these beliefs. During cross examination, defense attorneys showed a version of the draft policy, highlighting that it was based on a policy created by San Francisco, California. Ashley testified to editing the draft policy by removing a sentence stating that ICE agents are allowed to arrest people in the public areas of a courthouse, which appeared in the original policy from California. 
Melissa Buss, a Milwaukee County assistant district attorney who was assigned to Dugan’s court, testified Wednesday that she saw Dugan motion to attorney Mercedes de la Rosa — who was representing Flores-Ruiz — to “come here” as she stood by the jury door leading to the non-public hallway. Buss said it was unusual that Dugan appeared to be “directing” de la Rosa, and that the judge seemed “frustrated” whereas de la Rosa seemed “frazzled or confused.” Buss said that she wasn’t aware that Dugan had called Flores-Ruiz’s case early, despite audio recordings showing that Dugan spoke into a microphone and called the man’s case loudly, and set a date for him to re-appear via Zoom. 
Clerk calls ICE agent ‘fascist’
Prosecutors also called Alan Freed Jr., a deputy clerk in Dugan’s court. Freed recalled hearing from public defenders that ICE was in the hallways, saying that he was “upset and a little outraged.” Freed walked back into the courtroom to tell Dugan that there were “ICE guys in the hallway,” which was captured on courtroom audio. Freed also said that Dugan told him not to call the chief judge. Later, when Freed checked back in the hall, he saw agents walking towards the chief judge’s office after being directed there by Dugan. As one of the agents walked past Freed testified that he called the agent a “fascist.” 
Freed was grilled by prosecutors about who said what in the audio recordings, but he testified that he couldn’t recall some of the events of April 18. He’d sat through thousands of cases, including many in Dugan’s court, and had never seen a similar chain of events play out. Freed said it is not unusual for cases to be called off the record as Flores-Ruiz’s was, echoing Buss who said judges can call cases at random and that this was not unusual as prosecutors argued. 
Hasty exit out a side door
De la Rosa also testified that she was concerned about the news that ICE was in the building when she arrived at the courthouse. She’d only been a public defender in Milwaukee since March 2025, not long before ICE began arresting people inside the building. When Flores-Ruiz arrived, she was nervous to get him in and out of the building as quickly as possible to avoid contact with ICE. She asked for the pretrial hearing to be called off the record, and described herself as visibly anxious and even “obnoxious.” 
After Dugan was finished calling her case, de la Rosa recalled Dugan motioning for her and Flores-Ruiz to come by the jury door. She’d had judges lead her and clients out of side doors before, but only in particular circumstances, such as to avoid emotional victims, she said. “I kind of remember being scared or freaked out,” she testified, adding that she was stressed about the agents, and was bouncing back and forth between two languages to translate what was happening to Flores-Ruiz. “My brain was spinning,” she said. When the jury door opened into the hallway, de la Rosa testified, Dugan took a couple of steps in and directed her and her client straight down the hall towards the door that led to the public hallway.

De la Rosa testified that she was never directed to go to the staircase in that hall, which led to a different floor, and didn’t even know that it existed. Her case had been called before attorney Walter Piel, who arrived early to court with his client. “I was a little frustrated that I wasn’t called first,” Piel testified, but added that he didn’t think that was unusual. When de la Rosa got outside, after unknowingly riding the elevator down with a plain-clothes ICE agent, she heard someone call Flores-Ruiz’s name. Flores-Ruiz ran, and agents arrested him down the street after a brief foot pursuit. 
The young defense attorney recalled being grilled about the incident by the FBI multiple times in interviews which stretched four to six hours in total. De la Rosa testified Wednesday that when Dugan allowed her to use the non-public hallway, she interpreted it as a “mentoring moment” because she was a new attorney unsure how to handle this unique situation. 
Joan Butz, a court reporter in Dugan’s courtroom, testified that she  was irritated when she heard that ICE had returned. “That pisses me off,” she remembered telling one of the other staff. Butz was captured on audio talking with Dugan about “down the stairs,” in a  conversation that wasn’t cleanly recorded. Butz testified that she offered to show de la Rosa the exit near the jury box, saying she just wanted to be helpful. Butz admitted, however, that she believed the correct exit would have been the staircase, and that the wrong exit would have been into the hallway where the agents were waiting. 
Prosecutors rested their case Wednesday, allowing the court day to conclude almost two hours earlier than usual. On Thursday, defense attorneys are expected to call several more witnesses.

Mike Dunleavy’s administration is proposing to divert money from a program intended to compensate North Slope communities for the side effects of oil and gas drilling on federal land near them. 
As Dunleavy prepares to unveil a long-term fiscal plan, the state is proposing to use at least some of that money across Alaska instead.
“Definitely a big deal,” said Alexei Painter, director of the Legislative Finance Division, which analyzes the budget on behalf of legislators.
The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Impact Mitigation Grant Program sends millions of dollars from the federal government to North Slope communities each year. 
It’s funded through revenue generated by oil production on federal land in the North Slope, and it is expected to grow significantly in coming years as more oil is produced from projects like Willow, which is located in the vast petroleum reserve between Utqiagvik and the Prudhoe Bay oil field.
The Willow project alone, for example, is expected to generate $3.1 billion for the grant program between 2029 and 2053, a boon for the borough’s 10,583 residents.
But in documents published recently, the Department of Revenue has reclassified money for the program as “unrestricted,” meaning it could be spent in a variety of ways.
During a Wednesday meeting of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. board of trustees, CEO Deven Mitchell told the board that he had just heard “that there’s been a federal law change” that could see more money end up in the Permanent Fund.
Mitchell couldn’t recall where he had read about that change, but it appears in the state’s newly published revenue forecast, which covers the fiscal year that starts July 1.
In several footnotes, the Department of Revenue describes a shift in policy. Currently, revenue from the leasing of federal land in the petroleum reserve is deposited in “a special revenue fund” dedicated to a particular purpose.
That changes with the new fiscal year, when “these payments will be divided between unrestricted revenue (74.5%), the Permanent Fund (25%) and Public School Trust Fund (0.5%).”
That would mean money from NPR-A would end up in the state’s general-purpose accounts, usable for services statewide or the Permanent Fund dividend.
Last year, the department wrote, “The federal government dictates that shared NPR-A revenue must be used for specific purposes, and therefore it is considered restricted revenue in this forecast.”
This year, that sentence doesn’t appear.
Comparing the two forecasts shows the difference. Last year, the department labeled NPR-A revenue as “restricted,” or locked in to a particular purpose. In the new fall forecast, it’s “unrestricted,” or available for general use.
While only $9.6 million in NPR-A revenue is expected in the next fiscal year, the state forecasts that amount will rise significantly after the end of the decade — to more than $200 million per year by 2033. 
Speaking to reporters last week, an official with the Office of Management and Budget said the Alaska Department of Law was evaluating how changes to federal law in the Big Beautiful Bill Act will change the distribution of revenue to the state and local communities.
That act, passed with the enthusiastic endorsement of Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump, calls for the state to receive 70% of revenue from oil and gas leases on federal land in the National Petroleum Reserve, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Cook Inlet, starting in fiscal year 2034. 
The Department of Revenue concluded that clause will ultimately have little effect.
“Since all current and forecasted production in the NPR-A is located on leases issued before 2025, only a small portion of revenue within the current forecast period is expected to receive the 70% share,” the department wrote in its new forecast.
More important for the short term, the Act contains a clause stating that “for each of fiscal years 2025 through 2033, 50 percent (of federal-land oil revenue) shall be paid to the State of Alaska.”
Previous federal law contained a 50-50 split but also contained a clause stating that “in the allocation of such funds, the State shall give priority to use by subdivisions of the State most directly or severely impacted by development of oil and gas leased under this Act.”
That priority doesn’t appear in the Big Beautiful Bill. 
As a result, the Alaska Department of Law is determining whether the state may choose to keep that money for direct uses instead of sending it to communities, the OMB official said.
As a precondition for the interview, reporters agreed to allow the official to speak on background and not be quoted directly. 
The Alaska Department of Law did not respond to an emailed inquiry about the effort, nor did staff for any of Alaska’s three members of Congress, who were instrumental in adding that language to the Big Beautiful Bill Act.
The North Slope Borough was unable to comment before deadline Wednesday. Officials from VOICE of the Arctic Inupiat, an organization that has acted as a local booster for oil production, also did not return a message seeking comment.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Microsoft and Constellation Energy’s effort to restart the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island to power artificial intelligence is a poster child for the Trump administration’s agenda, U.S. Energy Secretary Christopher Wright said Wednesday.
“It’s delivering on two of our large promises,” he said after touring the 50-year-old power station in Dauphin County.
One, Wright said, is to reduce the cost of electricity as energy-intensive data centers drive up demand and prices.
The other is to win the race in AI, an endeavor with far-reaching economic, scientific and national security implications, he told workers readying the plant — rebranded as the Crane Clean Energy Center. It’s slated to begin generating power again in 2027.
Since his inauguration in January, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders directing the Energy Department to end support for wind and solar generation and clear the way for new nuclear development. 
“We want to keep existing plants open. We want to open … plants that were prematurely closed. We are expediting the building of new plants,” Wright said.
But environmentalists warn that energy prices will continue to increase as renewable energy projects in the pipeline face delays to connect to the region’s electricity grid or are canceled outright.
PJM Interconnection, which manages the wholesale electricity market and grid in Pennsylvania and 12 other states, announced Wednesday that its most recent capacity auction fell short of securing enough generating capacity to meet its 20% reserve for peak demands in 2027-2028.

That was despite prices maxing out at a cap established in a settlement with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania after an auction last year resulted in record capacity prices. 
PJM said in a statement the auction result doesn’t mean that it will be unable to meet peak demands. The grid will have a 15% reserve and other factors could result in the margin being larger. 
“But this auction leaves no doubt that data centers’ demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply, and the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself,” the agency’s incoming CEO Stu Bresler said.
Environmentalists, consumer advocates and state regulators have called on PJM to adopt new market rules that insulate consumers from costs driven by the needs of data centers, such as building new power plants and transmission lines. 
“As we approach the holiday season, families should be spending their hard-earned dollars on family meals and presents for each other, not forking more money over to the utility companies and Big Tech’s power needs,” Sierra Club Senior Advisor Jessi Eidbo said.
She noted that the most recent residual capacity auction is the last covered by the Shapiro administration’s price cap settlement.
PJM’s independent market monitor, which serves as a watchdog for PJM consumers, has also asked federal regulators to adopt rules to prevent data centers and other large electricity users from connecting to the grid without an established capacity to meet their needs. To allow otherwise would put retail ratepayers on the hook for new power plants and transmission lines, the monitor argued in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

Three Mile Island was mothballed in a move that Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez said was a mistake.
The plant was the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979 – among the nation’s worst nuclear energy disasters – that permanently disabled one of its two reactors. The remaining unit restarted several years after the accident and remained in operation until Constellation decided it was no longer profitable in 2019.
Last year, the Baltimore-headquartered company announced it would restart the Unit 1 reactor in a $1.6 billion deal with Microsoft, which agreed to purchase the plant’s entire 835 megawatt output to power its data centers.
The Department of Energy last month announced it had closed a $1 billion loan for Constellation, which Dominguez said would reduce the cost of borrowing for the project. He said the company would reinvest the savings in upgrades for the plant.
“What we’re seeing right now is a renewed interest across the country in nuclear, understanding that the first and most important thing we need to do is bring back to life assets that we mistakenly closed,” Dominguez said.
Microsoft’s Vice President of Energy Bobby Hollis said Three Mile Island was a unique opportunity for the company as it positioned itself as a leader in AI. 
“We’re seeing lots within the energy sector recognize what needs to be happening now, which is add energy capacity to the grid, find the opportunities that are not the typical opportunities,” Hollis said, adding that Three Mile Island and other recently closed nuclear plants will bring carbon-free electricity to market faster than technology still under development.

This year, Palisades Nuclear Generating Station in Michigan became the first in the nation to be restarted. The owner of the Duane Arnold Nuclear Power Plant in Iowa is also exploring potential deals with tech companies to restart that plant.
Asked about the proposed rules for new data center and large load connections in PJM, Wright said the Department of Energy is working to respond to the dynamics of the new energy economy.
“Sadly, we’ve had three decades of very little demand growth for electricity. It’s been a world more of stasis, and now we’re in a world of rapid growth,” Wright said, noting that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and FERC are implementing reforms to speed the addition of new sources.
The use of AI and automation will also help regulators and operators like PJM optimize resources to best meet demand, he said. But the federal government is also pushing PJM and other operators to prioritize projects that are most likely to come to fruition.
Dominguez said the rules proposed by the independent market monitor are unworkable. To build a nuclear power plant or a natural gas-fired plant from scratch would take the best part of a decade. 
“So if you want to tell the folks in our data economy that they can’t put AI to work until we get new power plants operating … and wait five, six, seven years … the AI race is going to be over,” he added.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6064-scaled-e1766021369251-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-12-17 20:56:51.233776

Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., is seen at the U.S. Capitol Feb. 25, 2025. (Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)For a while, Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse says he’s been hearing a little voice in the back of his head telling him it might be time to step aside.
On Wednesday, he announced he’d decided to follow that impulse and would not run for reelection next year in the 4th Congressional District in central Washington.
“I came into Congress thinking that I’d probably spend 10 years. I just came to the conclusion and made the decision,” he said. “It’s not been an overnight decision.”
“I just want to make clear that I’ve got a year to go on my term, and I’m going to work very hard to fulfill my responsibilities and serve my constituents,” he added.
It has been a rough and tumble year for Congress, marked by a record-long government shutdown during which the House never met. And for Newhouse, it’s not been easy navigating the turbulence created when he voted to impeach Donald Trump in 2021.
But the 70-year-old congressman insisted Wednesday that those factors didn’t drive his decision.
“Absolutely not,” he said. “A lot of people may disagree with some of the positions, some of the votes I’ve taken, but most people respect others who stand for something and who vote their conscience and can justify the positions they take. It’s not been a detriment or a negative thing.”
Newhouse, of Sunnyside, has held the seat since 2015. Before that, he served in the Washington House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009. Then, for four years, he was director of the state Department of Agriculture under then-Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat. Newhouse’s family operates an 850-acre farm.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He has balanced his conservative politics with pragmatism, making him accessible to Democratic House members especially on agriculture, farm labor and immigration policies, all critical to his district.
“Dan has always brought a principled commitment to public service. I’m grateful to call him a colleague and friend all these years,” U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, posted on X. DelBene served with Newhouse in the Gregoire administration when she led the state Department of Revenue.
U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, a leading voice for House progressives, said Newhouse showed courage in voting to impeach Trump. She said she “greatly appreciated his leadership to provide a roadmap to citizenship for farmworkers” and his assistance in getting Seattle’s  Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP, national recognition.
“He will be missed in Congress, and I wish him and his family the best in retirement,” she said.
Trump-aligned challengers 
In 2021, Newhouse became a target of the MAGA movement when he joined nine other House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He is one of two among that group who is still serving in Congress.
Since then, Trump has fought to get him out of office. Newhouse fended off six Republican challengers in the 2022 primary en route to winning a fifth term in the solidly Republican district. That same year, Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, another Washington Republican who voted for impeachment, was unseated after losing in the primary to Joe Kent.
Things got tougher for Newhouse in 2024. He faced two Trump-backed opponents in the primary and squared off with one of them, Jerrod Sessler, in the general election. Trump, in a social media post backing Sessler, called Newhouse a “weak and pathetic” Republican “who voted to, for no reason, Impeach me.” 
Newhouse overcame the attacks and narrowly won reelection. His victory was likely owed to support from Democratic voters.
In 2026, he was facing a rematch with Sessler, and potentially Tiffany Smiley, the other GOP candidate in 2024. Smiley, who lost a run against Patty Murray for her U.S. Senate seat in 2022, is known for her work as a veterans advocate.
Potential for a packed primary
Sessler, of Prosser, a Navy veteran and businessman, confirmed Wednesday he is running next year and said he again enjoys the support of President Trump, along with members of the House Freedom Caucus. The state Republican Party endorsed him in 2024 as well.
Newhouse’s early notice that he’s not running sets the stage for a wide-open primary next August.
Republican state Sen. Matt Boehnke of Kennewick said Wednesday he’s seriously exploring a run. Boehnke is in his first term in the Senate after serving four years in the House and three years on the Kennewick City Council. He is up for reelection in 2026. 
Yakima County Commissioner Amanda McKinney, a Republican, is eyeing the seat. “I’m humbled by the encouragement I’ve received since Rep. Newhouse’s announcement and look forward to sharing news with you all in the coming days,” she said in a statement.
Republican Wesley Meier, of Richland, has registered his campaign with the Federal Election Commission.
At least one Democrat is mounting a bid for the 4th District seat next year: John Duresky, a retired Air Force officer who also worked at the Hanford nuclear cleanup site.
Washington’s 4th Congressional District stretches through the middle of the state from the Canadian border to Oregon. It includes the agriculture-heavy Yakima Valley, the Yakama Indian Reservation, and the Tri-Cities.
The last Democrat to win a U.S. House seat in the district was former Gov. Jay Inslee. He won in 1992, but lost reelection after one term to Doc Hastings, a Republican, who held the seat until retiring in 2015. 
Newhouse doesn’t have a favorite yet for his successor. 
“I haven’t made any decisions about who I may or may not be supporting in the race,” he told reporters. “Let’s see who expresses interest, who gets in the race, and we’ll just play it from there.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dan-newhouse-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 20:56:51.233776

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Utahns are back to buying groceries with help from federal food aid after the government shutdown put those payments on hold in November. But the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is still in the spotlight, with big changes already taking effect and more that could follow.  
New SNAP work requirements began in November for those ages 55 to 64 and for parents whose children are older than 14. The changes, part of the sweeping budget legislation known as the “Big, Beautiful Bill” enacted by Congress this summer, also cut off aid for refugees and many other immigrants who were previously eligible. 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has indicated more changes could come, floating the prospect of requiring all participants to reapply for the benefits and saying that “the SNAP program is rife with fraud,” although experts have said eligibility fraud is not a big problem. Nationwide, about 42 million people are enrolled in the program. 
‘Hopeless’: Utahns say shutdown’s pause on food stamp funding carries a steep cost

Anti-hunger advocates in Utah say those comments could have a tangible impact far from Washington, D.C., making people hesitant to apply for the program even if they qualify.
“There’s just so much uncertainty, and so that makes people reluctant to apply,” said Gina Cornia, executive director of Utahns Against Hunger. 
The Utah Department of Workforce Services, which administers SNAP, has been working with recipients to nail down whether they meet the new work requirements or qualify for exemptions, Cornia said. Even so, she anticipates many people will drop out of the program because they lack the means or the ability to get in touch with the agency and navigate a new system. 
Cornia noted SNAP recipients in Utah and beyond have tried to use their payment cards at the grocery store, only to find out their accounts were hacked and the money stolen. 
“Was there funding in the Big Beautiful Bill to prevent that kind of fraud? No, there was not,” Cornia said.

The government shutdown in October and November illuminated the financial fallout for Utahns who were told they’d be cut off from federal food aid for a time. Before the shutdown ended on Nov. 12 and the month’s SNAP payments came through, some Utahns turned to community food pantries and stretched their budgets to make ends meet. 
“Once that government closure hit, yeah — we just saw some really, really frightening numbers immediately,” said Ginette Bott, president of the Utah Food Bank, which serves hundreds of food pantries throughout the state.  
The number of households helped through that network in November rose 36% percent from a year earlier, even before Thanksgiving, Bott said in a recent interview. Some small food pantries had to limit how many times people could come by, she added.  
Traffic to the food bank’s website and a page showing where people can find help in their communities also shot up during the government closure, when federal workers were furloughed and SNAP was paused, Bott said.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Supreme Court has refused Attorney General Liz Murrill’s request to return a convicted killer to death row, though it doesn’t necessarily derail her plans to challenge a U.S. Supreme Court precedent that declared executing minors was unconstitutional.
The defendant in question, Dale Dwayne Craig, was just days away from turning 18 when he killed an LSU student in September 1992. A jury convicted Craig in 1994 and sentenced him to death. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that administering the death penalty to defendants under 18 violated the 8th and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
In August, Murrill filed a motion with the 19th Judicial District Court to reinstate Craig’s death sentence. She wrote that her motion was “for preservation purposes only” so that evidence from the Craig case would be retained for use in her challenge.
“While we’re disappointed the Louisiana Supreme Court didn’t weigh in on this important case, we’ll continue to work to ensure that the worst of the worst criminals in our State are brought to justice,” Murrill said Tuesday in a statement after the justices made their ruling public.
The denial of Murrill’s request was unanimous, with Associate Justice John Guidry recusing himself from the case.
Craig was a week shy of his 18th birthday when he murdered Kipp Gullet, an 18-year-old LSU freshman who was taken at gunpoint from a campus dorm parking lot and shot multiple times at a secluded construction site. Three accomplices were also convicted in Gullet’s death and received sentences ranging from 20 years to life in prison. 
In May 2023, East Baton Rouge Parish Judge Eboni Johnson Rose granted Craig parole eligibility, citing his record of good behavior and role as a prison mentor at Louisiana State Penitentiary.
Murrill’s office challenged Jones’ action, arguing before the Louisiana Supreme Court in August that Craig’s heinous crime warrants the ultimate punishment. 
The attorney general has not indicated what her next steps will be in her challenge of the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. It resulted in Craig and about 70 other minor defendants across the country having their death sentences commuted. Justices ruled that executing Christopher Simmons of Missouri for a murder he committed at age 17 would be “cruel and usual punishment.” 
Louisiana resumed executions earlier this year after a 15-year hiatus during which the state was unable to secure the drugs needed for lethal executions. 
Jessie Hoffman, 46, was put to death March 18, becoming the first person in the state executed using nitrogen gas.
Hoffman was 18 when he kidnapped, raped and murdered 28-year-old Mary “Molly” Elliot, who he abducted from a New Orleans parking deck and then took to rural St. Tammany Parish where he assaulted and killed her.
More than 50 people await execution on Louisiana’s death row.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)After a year of trimming its finances to try to stave off job cuts, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) still faces a nearly $14 million budget deficit under its latest financial plan approved by the agency’s board of directors.
RIPTA’s board Thursday voted 7-1 to submit the bus agency’s $158.9 million spending plan to Gov. Dan McKee, with the hope either he or state lawmakers will find a way to plug the hole by the time fiscal year 2027 begins in July 2026.
“I think we’re headed in a good direction,” Christopher Durand, the agency’s CEO, told Rhode Island Current after the meeting. 
Durand acknowledged the deficit, but said it’s better than initial projections. When crafting its last budget recommendation, the agency had forecast a $39.8 million deficit for fiscal 2027. 
The narrower gap is mostly due to the General Assembly providing the agency a $15 million infusion through a 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax. It also upped the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account.
The budget also assumes savings in cutting 51 vacant positions.
RIPTA’s fiscal 2027 plan assumes a slight revenue bump from plans to increase the bus fare, which has been $2 per trip since 2010. McKee has told the agency to look at increasing  fares in return for a $3 million plug for its most recent deficit.
Even those recent state actions were not enough to stop the agency from enacting sweeping service reductions impacting 46 of its 67 routes. Durand told the board that some routes have started to see service return, mostly in southern Rhode Island.
Advocates mourn the upcoming loss of bus service across R.I.

But the agency’s budget does not assume service will fully return to where it was before the cuts.
The agency’s budget proposal assumes a little more than $12.7 million in revenue from passenger fares in fiscal 2027 — a nearly $1.2 million increase from what RIPTA projects it will receive by the time the current fiscal year wraps up at the end of June.
Raising fares requires an official study by RIPTA, which Durand told Rhode Island Current should be complete by the spring. He said the plan is to raise fares by the time the next fiscal year begins in July.
Transit advocates who attended the meeting made it clear they want fares to remain the same, especially as most service reductions remain in place.
“It’s known that fare hikes often lead to no gain in revenue because people stop riding buses,” Randall Rose of the Kennedy Plaza Resistance Coalition told the board.
RIPTA board Chairman Peter Alviti Jr., who also heads the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, commended the agency for being able to reduce its deficit and said he felt confident that the state would fill the remaining gap.
“You’ve made considerable headway,” he said.
Normand Benoit, the lone vote against the budget submission, was skeptical that McKee would remain committed to filling the deficit after declining to do so last year, leaving RIPTA with an initial shortfall of $32.6 million.
“If it goes in again with a deficit, we’re going to get hit with the same thing I heard over and over again from the General Assembly which was if the governor didn’t put it in his budget, then why should we?” he said.
McKee’s office did not respond to request for comment.
Benoit instead suggested that RIPTA’s board support a tax on Rhode Island’s highest earners to fill the agency’s remaining budget gap. It’s a move that he admitted he wouldn’t have supported in the past.
That elicited a smirk from board member Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO who has long advocated for raising the state’s top marginal individual income tax rate from 5.99% to 8.99% on income above approximately $625,000.
Companion bills to enact the so-called millionaires tax failed to make it through committee this year.
Senate President Valarie Lawson and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone both told the Boston Globe earlier in the month they would support such a proposal to tax the rich should the legislation be filed again during the 2026 session.
“There’s no other solution for us,” Benoit said. “I think it’s going to pass this [next] year — it behooves us to be pushing for this thing.”
Vice chairman James Lombardi was opposed to joining in on the potential resolution.
“The more money we tax, the more money we spend,” he said. “There’s got to be other cuts that we can make or the state can make to fully fund us.”

Colorado-based Blue Spruce, which has an office in Pinedale, was awarded a $6 million Energy Matching Funds grant from the state in 2024. The project is expected to cost about $737 million, according to state documents.
The BLM’s approval advances the company’s plans to construct a helium and natural gas processing plant, drill up to nine production wells, access roads and federal rights-of-way and use “acid-gas” injection to “permanently sequester excess carbon in federal pore space deep underground,” according to the agency.
At full capacity, the production field and processing plant would produce about 2.3 million cubic feet of liquid helium per day — about 10% or more of the world’s helium supply, according to testimony provided to the ISC. That rivals ExxonMobil’s neighboring Shute Creek gas plant, which is estimated to provide nearly 20% of the world’s helium supply.
The facility would also produce natural gas and permanently store “up to” 4.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, which “would otherwise be emitted” by the operation, according to the company’s testimony. That’s roughly equivalent to the carbon dioxide emitted by about 4.9 million small cars, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Permanently sequestering the greenhouse gas qualifies for a federal tax credit, according to the company.

The operation will contribute an estimated $1.7 billion in taxes over the 40-year life of the project, according to testimony provided to the state.
The approximately two-year construction project is expected to begin in May, with an initial workforce of 209 workers, with only about 10 local hires, according to the Industrial Siting Council. It will support about 45 permanent jobs.
The council’s role was to determine whether the project would “pose a threat of serious injury to the environment or to the social and economic condition or inhabitants or expected inhabitants in the affected area,” according to the state agency. 
Among concerns raised were potential impacts on crucial winter range for mule deer and known big-game migration corridors that are not yet enshrined in Wyoming’s protection of migration corridors.
“We wanted to make sure that we raised those issues with the BLM and with the Industrial Siting Council, and make sure that they were considering what kind of mitigation could be done to not disturb wildlife at critical times of year,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Wildlife Program Manager Meghan Riley told WyoFile.
The council did impose several stipulations to ensure compliance with existing state wildlife and habitat regulations, according to the agency.
Though Riley had barely reviewed the council’s order when she spoke with WyoFile, she said Blue Spruce did give the impression that it was attentive to such concerns.
“They were definitely responsive to things that the state raised,” Riley said.
The council also plays a unique role in administering “impact assistance payments” to local governments — essentially a mechanism to fast-track sales tax from large construction operations back to counties and municipalities, while adding extra from the state’s portion of revenues. The intention is to help local governments cope with an influx of workers and demands on local resources from large construction projects.
The agency determined it would distribute between $14 million and $15 million in impact assistance payments to local governments.

Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Wednesday that President Donald Trump needs to consult with Congress before further escalating the United States’ military campaign against Venezuela, which as of this week, has killed more than 90 people.
Scott’s comments came as the Vermont Air National Guard was “actively deploying” on Wednesday, according to a guard spokesperson. 
Late last week, defense industry blog The War Zone reported that Vermont’s 158th Fighter Wing and its F-35A fighter jets were slated to head to the Caribbean as part of Operation Southern Spear, a development later referenced by U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.
The president has ordered the U.S. military to ramp up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the administration has blamed for an influx of migrants to the United States. That pressure has coincided with military preparations in the region. 
“We’ll see whether it’s just saber rattling — and I’m hopeful that we’re not actually going to war with anyone,” Scott told reporters about Trump’s actions. “But if we are going to war, then that’s something that the president should share with Congress.”
On Tuesday, Trump ordered a blockade of all “sanctioned oil tankers” traveling to the South American country. The U.S. has carried out 20 deadly strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats near Latin America in recent months, actions that critics have widely panned as illegal under international law.
The U.S. Senate passed a bill Wednesday that could compel the Pentagon to turn over footage of recent strikes. The measure, which passed with bipartisan support, was included in a larger annual defense spending package. The legislation cleared the House with similar bipartisan support last week.
All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation voted against the legislation.
In statements, Welch and Democratic Rep. Becca Balint said their opposition stemmed from the amount of money appropriated in the legislation for defense spending, which is about $900 billion. Welch, Balint and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have all condemned Trump’s military buildup near Venezuela in recent weeks and the recent boat strikes.

Green Mountain Boys or New England Patriots?
Many details about the reported deployment of Vermonters to the Caribbean remained unclear Wednesday, fueling questions about aircraft activity at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, which serves as a guard base. 
A Boeing 767 bearing the logo of the New England Patriots was spotted at the airport Wednesday morning, bound for Puerto Rico, according to public flight tracker information — the reported destination of the Vermont Guard. 
The unusual appearance of a New England Patriots plane in Burlington caught the attention of Clayton Trutor, a Burlington resident, who said in an email Wednesday that he saw a plane bearing the Patriots logo land at the Burlington airport around 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. He did not see who or what boarded the plane. 
The New England Patriots use two planes, operated by charter service Omni Air International, and the aircrafts are sometimes used for other charter flights. Earlier this year, a Patriots plane flew to and from the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay. The plane left several hours later for Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso. 
A flight did leave Burlington bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico — where Vermont’s Air National Guard is reportedly deploying — at 10:47 a.m. Wednesday, according to the flight tracker website FlightAware. That flight involved a Boeing 767 operated by Omni. The airline and plane model match planes used by the New England Patriots. 
Webcam footage from the Burlington airport runway showed a plane taking off around that time that appeared to match the New England Patriots jet. Omni and the New England Patriots did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon.
Joseph Brooks, the spokesperson for the Vermont guard, did not respond to questions about whether the charter plane was used to transport troops. 
“Members of the 158th Fighter Wing in the Vermont Air National Guard are actively deploying personnel and equipment following a federal mobilization under Title 10 authority,” he wrote in an email. “This action places select Airmen and assets in a federal status, directing them to support a national mission as a part of the United States Air Force active component.”
Brooks declined to provide specifics about the deployment citing operation security concerns. 
A spokesperson for the Burlington airport did not return requests for comment, and Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, said the governor’s office had no knowledge of the flight. Scott told reporters Wednesday that he had little new information to share about the Vermont National Guard’s deployment to the Caribbean.
Limited public information about Vermont Air National Guard deployments is not unusual, said state Rep. Michael Morgan, R-Milton, who retired in 2017 from the Vermont Air National Guard as a colonel. He also served as the vice commander of the 158th Fighter Wing.
Morgan, who was deployed while serving in the guard, said he had no knowledge of whether the 158th Fighter Wing used a charter plane to fly to Puerto Rico on Wednesday. But he said the practice would not be wholly unusual, pointing to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, or CRAF, which allows the military through contracts to utilize aircrafts from certain U.S. airlines.

In the lawsuit, the tribe and two Native American voters alleged Chouteau County’s at-large voting system unlawfully diluted the voting strength of Native voters and denied them representation on the county commission for more than a decade.
A settlement approved this week by the U.S. District Court of Montana ensures the tribal nation’s reservation will be part of the county’s District 1, which will elect a representative to the Board of County Commissioners through a single-member district election, the ACLU of Montana said Wednesday in a news release.
In a statement from the ACLU, Chippewa Cree Tribe Chairman Harlan Gopher Baker praised Chouteau County for doing the right thing in giving the tribe a chance to elect a representative to the board.
“It has been more than a decade since we have had a Native voice in county politics,” Gopher Baker said. “We look forward to being a part of this conversation.”
Plaintiff and voter Tanya Schmockel, of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, said the outcome means tribal voters will be heard.
“This case was about our community finally having a representative and a voice like other voters in the county,” Schmockel said in a statement. “I am excited about finally having the chance to have our voices heard and our concerns addressed.”
The complaint had said Montana law requires at-large elections unless a court orders otherwise, and the county met the conditions for vote dilution under the Voting Rights Act.
It had a minority group sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; a minority group that was politically cohesive; and a majority vote that usually defeated the minority’s preferred candidate, the lawsuit said.
The county overlaps with roughly one third of the reservation, the lawsuit said.
It said in the county, 25.8% of the population is Native American (“alone or in combination”), as is 20.71% of the voting-age population, but the plaintiffs didn’t know of any Native American elected to the board for at least a decade.
A proposed consent decree said the first election to be held under the order will be in June 2026. It said the defendants will “timely publicize” the new method of election in public buildings and local media and send publication to the tribe for distribution on the reservation.
“Only eligible voters residing in Commissioner single-member District 1 will be allowed to vote for Board of County Commissioner candidates running in that district,” the decree said.
(The decree also said the other two members will be elected either at large or via two single-member districts.)
The lawsuit said the tribe had raised the issue with Chouteau County earlier, but the county did not respond to follow-up communications from the tribe after a meeting.
The lawsuit also said Chouteau County generally did not consult with the tribe on any policy matters.
Wednesday, Chouteau County Attorney Stephen Gannon said a statement about the settlement would be forthcoming from the county.
However, Gannon also said Chouteau County officials fully intend to maintain open and proactive communication with the tribe going forward.
“The county is willing to work with the tribe and have open communication — as open as possible,” Gannon said.
As an example of working together in the past, he said, officials from the tribe, Chouteau County, and neighboring Hill County have cooperated to help ensure reservation residents register to vote with the right county since both counties overlap the reservation.
The news release from the ACLU said cooperation is important.
“Most of Chouteau County’s Native population lives on or near the Rocky Boy’s Reservation, and many critical local issues — such as infrastructure, road maintenance, and emergency services — require coordination between the county and Tribal governments,” the news release said
To deal with those issues fairly, elections need to be just, said plaintiff and voter Ken Morsette of the Chippewa Cree Tribe.
“In order for our county to include all of us, we needed a fair election system,” Morsette said in a statement. “With the new district, we have a chance for our voters to elect a commissioner who understands Native issues. This is a huge step forward for our Tribe.”
In addition to the ACLU of Montana, the Native American Rights Fund and American Civil Liberties Union Foundation Voting Rights Project represent the plaintiffs in this case.



Statements from legal groups
“This settlement and the district that it creates is a huge improvement for the entire county,” said NARF staff attorney Samantha Blencke. “Having a representative board allows the county commissioners to better address the concerns of all their constituents. We congratulate the county for doing the right thing and the Native voters and Chippewa Cree Tribe who insisted that they, rightfully, have a seat at the table.”
“With this settlement, Native voters of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation finally have a fair opportunity to elect a representative to the Chouteau County’s Board of Commissioners,” said Akilah Deernose, executive director of the ACLU of Montana. “Indigenous voters in Montanan should not need to go to court to secure the same rights and privileges as non-Native voters. Until then, the ACLU of Montana will continue to fight for every Montanan’s constitutional and statutory rights.”
“For too long, Native voters in Chouteau County were shut out of meaningful representation,” said Theresa Lee, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Voting Rights Project. “County commissioners shape policies that affect daily life, including budget decision-making, supervising public service departments, and so much more. This agreement acknowledges what our clients have always known: every voter deserves an equal opportunity to shape the government that serves them.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3527-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-17 19:57:38.069530

The 2025 Annual Statistical Report covers state fiscal year 2025, which ended on June 30. 
Prior to 2022, the state did not regularly list assaults or injuries in its annual reports. That year, it released data on those metrics going back to 2018.
State says six inmates injured in fights at prison in Springfield

In 2025, assaults on staff across the state’s five prison campuses increased to 142, which was 95 more than the prior year. 
Twenty-two of the assaults for 2025 caused serious injuries, a number twice as high as the previous year. Just over half the assaults involved throwing or spitting substances at officers.
There were 447 inmate-on-inmate fights in men’s facilities in 2025, which is 171 more than the prior year. Of the fiscal year 2025 fights, 49 caused serious injuries to inmates.
Fights between women in the state’s female correctional facility in Pierre, meanwhile, fell to 52, down from 60 the year before.
Fiscal year 2025 began in July of 2024 with two days of fighting at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, which houses male prisoners. The state said at the time that six inmates were injured, although some prisoners claimed that figure was low.
The statistical report also reports that staff used force to subdue inmates 518 times during the 2025 fiscal year, and used pepper spray on 189 of those occasions. In 2024, staff used force on inmates 264 times.

(Photo by Bob Nichols/USDA)A study from Michigan State University found that when domestic farm employment declines by 10%, food prices of labor-intensive crops increase by around 3%.
Specialty crop growers with the advocacy campaign Grow it Here said in a webinar Wednesday that wage increases with temporary visa programs and an overall decline in the availability of immigrant labor has impacted their ability to produce food and compete with foreign producers. 
Lisa Tate, a citrus and avocado producer in southern California, said labor shortage problems aren’t always immediately felt in the food system but have long-term effects on a farmers’ ability to stay in the industry.
“Labor shortages may not cause immediate food shortages or higher prices, but they quietly weaken our resilience of our food system by increasing our reliance on foreign imports,” Tate said. “Addressing agricultural labor challenges isn’t just about getting through one harvest, it’s about protecting the long-term foundations of America’s food supply.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the study, more than half of surveyed farmers said in 2021 that they were experiencing some sort of labor shortage. On average, farmers reported an inability to hire 21% of the labor they needed for normal operating conditions. 
The Michigan State University study developed an equilibrium displacement model, a formula that is often used for policy analysis, to relate domestic farm labor markets to labor-intensive agricultural output markets. From here, researcher Zach Rutledge said he was able to derive an expression that related changes in food prices to changes in employment. 
Rutledge, speaking at the webinar Wednesday, said the findings “indicate that moderate reductions in farm employment could raise consumer food costs by billions of dollars.” 
According to the study, labor-intensive specialty crops generate roughly $115 billion in product value annually, meaning a 2.94% increase due to labor shortages would equate an increase in food prices of nearly $3.4 billion.
The study showed a decline in the Mexican immigrant populations in the U.S., which Rutledge said represents the origin of the majority of foreign-born agricultural workers. He also said agricultural workers are now more likely to settle in one area, rather than migrate to areas where the work is needed, which can add to labor shortages. 
Growers on the call said the result is that they cannot find enough workers to get through harvest season without significant loss, or additional costs to pay for overtime work. 
Brandon Raso, a blueberry farmer in New Jersey, said he needs about 600-700 laborers to harvest his 650 acres of blueberries. This past season, he was only able to hire around 200 workers, which led an estimated 2.5 million pounds of blueberries falling to the ground before they could be harvested. 
The result of these shortages, according to Raso, is a “huge exodus in multi-generational farms” and farms that have to downsize as a result of mounting costs and labor shortages. 
Brandon Batten, a tobacco and row crop farmer in North Carolina, said when labor isn’t there, the “quality goes down, yields go down, and costs continue to go up” because the work still has to be done. 
Growers on the call noted the climbing costs of the H-2A visa program, which grants temporary visas for agricultural workers. According to data compiled by the National Council of Agricultural Employees, the average national hourly wage for H-2A employees increased from slightly more than $11 in 2011, to more than $18 in 2025, though the rate is different in each state. 
In October, the U.S. Department of Labor issued an interim final rule to modify the methodology that determines the hourly wages under the program. Growers on the call said the new rule has helped lower labor costs, but Batten said he and other producers are “cautiously optimistic” on the long-term effects. 
Tate said improvements to the temporary visa program help, but won’t be enough to make the U.S. competitive with foreign food producers who have consistently cheaper labor.
The specialty crop farmers also said they have noticed behavioral changes in immigrant labor populations due to immigration policies and enforcement from the Trump administration. 
Tate said enforcement, protests and concerns about safety has led to some “culture change” in her region.
“I think that’s really sad, because we should really be valuing the people who are harvesting our crops and taking care of our food and getting it to us,” Tate said. “They shouldn’t be scared to be in their own communities.”

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)Half the people released from prison in South Dakota return within three years, according to the state Department of Corrections’ newly released 2025 annual report — the highest recidivism rate in at least the last eight years.
Among Native Americans released from prison, 59% return within three years — the highest of any race. Native Americans comprise 39% of inmates in the state prison system — 35% among men and 61% among women. The recidivism rate among Native American women is 66%.
Department officials shared the statistics and annual report with members of the Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force at its Wednesday meeting in Pierre. The recidivism rate is seven points higher than last year.


The task force, made up of lawmakers, government officials and nonprofit leaders, is considering ways to reduce the state’s recidivism rate by expanding prison-based rehabilitation and helping released inmates transition back into their communities. The group was created earlier this year as lawmakers approved construction of a $650 million men’s prison in Sioux Falls, and it’s focusing on behavioral health, educational, faith-based and Native American-themed programs. 
The group approved several recommendations at its meeting, including an endorsement of a faith-based seminary program.
Task force member Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, said he hopes for “transformational offerings” to inmates.
“If we don’t see lives changed, then I don’t know what we’re doing here,” Hughes said. “We’re just managing statistics and personal failures.”
‘We’re not appropriately supporting the Indigenous population’
Task force member Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, said the increase in recidivism, especially among Native Americans, will “further strain an already strained system.”
“It’s indicative of the fact that we’re not appropriately supporting the Indigenous population,” Wittman said. “We’re already overincarcerating Indigenous people in South Dakota, and then we’re seeing them return at a much higher rate.”
Lawmaker predicts broad support for rehab and recidivism reforms in wake of prison vote

The task force approved 11 immediate recommendations for the Department of Corrections. The list includes bringing back evening volunteers in prisons, designating the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate parole program as a “flagship model” in the state, and establishing volunteer roundtables to give feedback on department policy and programs.
The recommendations are “small wins or barriers that can be removed,” Wittman said, while the task force continues to work on more complex issues.
Wittman is most excited about a recommendation that the department hire a tribal cultural liaison to coordinate ceremonies, tribal contacts and volunteer access to the state’s prisons. The position should be piloted for six months, the task force recommended.
“The fact that the DOC is willing to establish an individual whose sole focus is going to be better programming for its Indigenous population is huge,” Wittman said. “They’ll hopefully identify where Indigenous programming will be most effective.”
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, the task force chairman, confirmed with recently appointed Corrections Secretary Nick Lamb that the department would look into the recommendations and report back which could be viable options.
New corrections secretary lauds faith-based program
The prison seminary program endorsed by the task force was created by Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain while he served as warden of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Cain resigned from his role in Louisiana in 2015 amid investigations of his business dealings.

The program operates in 26 states and partners with accredited, four-year Christian seminary programs to teach inmates. They can earn a seminary degree through the program, often with graduates serving as ministers in prison systems.
Lamb helped implement the program in the Illinois prison system. Within months of its launch, Lamb said, he saw fewer assaults between inmates and against staff.
“Whatever your religious beliefs are, whatever you think, this program works,” Lamb said. “It worked everywhere they tried.”
Cain spoke to lawmakers in October about the program, ahead of the task force’s first meeting in Sioux Falls. He said the state would need a nonprofit to run it. The task force voted on Wednesday to encourage South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration to authorize the program.
Rhoden said in a Wednesday news release that he “accepted” the recommendation. The news release did not say who would operate the program, but said it would be privately supported, requiring neither Department of Corrections nor inmate funding.

“Bringing this seminary program to our state will restore hope, build character, and strengthen our correctional system from the inside out,” Rhoden said in the news release.
Jon Ozmint, the former director of South Carolina prisons, also presented to the task force in October. He said the recidivism rate for state inmates in the faith-based seminary Cain created is around 2% in South Carolina. 
Wittman said after Wednesday’s meeting that she has “reservations” about the seminary program.
“I don’t necessarily support Burl Cain-style programming in South Dakota prisons because rehabilitation needs to be voluntary, secular and grounded in evidence,” Wittman said.
Despite those concerns, she voted in favor of implementing the program.
“I voted yes because, despite my reservations, I know how limited current programs are,” Wittman said, “and something is better than nothing.”

Santiago/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown intensified across Washington in the late summer and early fall, new data indicates. 
Between July 29 and Oct. 15, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 950 people in Washington. The pace of arrests during those two-and-a-half months far surpasses increases earlier in the year. From Inauguration Day in January to the end of July, arrests totaled just over 1,000. 
And as detainments have increased, the share of those with criminal records has dropped. This despite federal authorities claiming that they’re targeting immigrants with violent criminal histories.
Just over 31% of those arrested in Washington between the end of July and mid-October had criminal convictions. Roughly another 17% had pending criminal charges. That’s compared to about 40% and 18%, respectively, in the rest of the year. 
Washington Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, this month cited the case of a Clark County man who was mauled by a dog during his arrest by ICE as an example of how federal immigration authorities are “terrorizing everyone,” whether they have a criminal record or not.
“This should shock the conscience of every one of us,” she said in a statement. “I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.”
But even having a criminal history still doesn’t justify allegedly abusing people’s rights, said Vanessa Torres Hernandez, the integrated policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington chapter. 
President Donald Trump’s campaign has more than doubled deportation arrests compared to last year under President Joe Biden. Nearly 2,000 people in Washington have been arrested since Trump retook office, compared to about 800 over the same period last year. In September alone, federal immigration authorities arrested over 350 in Washington. 
Brenda Rodriguez López, executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said the data “affirms what our communities have experienced for months.”
“This represents nearly 2,000 families who have had a loved one taken away from them; 2,000 communities who have suddenly lost a neighbor, a coworker, a friend; 2,000 people who have had to face brutal conditions while in detention and the possibility of permanent separation due to deportation,” she said in a statement.
The spike in arrests in Washington mirrors national trends. The Trump administration has ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts in major American cities, but has yet to specifically target Seattle, despite officials frequently mentioning Washington’s biggest city as on their radar.
The arrest figures come from the Deportation Data Project out of the University of California, Berkeley, where researchers received the information via Freedom of Information Act requests. 
It provides a rare statistical look into the Trump administration’s deportation program here and across the nation. 
But it’s not comprehensive. For one, it only includes ICE administrative arrests, excluding Customs and Border Protection. And, in some cases, no state is listed for individual arrest records. So the arrest figures for Washington are likely an undercount. They also don’t account for the rest of October and November.
While previous datasets have included more complete information on each arrestee’s country of origin, the latest stats are lacking on that front. 
The jump in enforcement followed Congress earmarking $170 billion to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda in the Republican-backed “big, beautiful bill” in July. Federal officials are now using some of the money to buy a half-dozen Boeing planes for deportation flights, instead of relying on chartered jets, according to The Washington Post.
Local advocacy group La Resistencia has seen the increase in arrests as it monitors deportation flights in and out of Boeing Field in Seattle, to either be deported, transferred or held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. This month, the organization is seeing three or four flights per week, compared to one a week last year, said Josefina Mora-Cheung, organizing director.
“The movement of people and the targeting of people is at an unprecedented level that La Resistencia has not seen since we were founded 11 years ago,” Mora-Cheung said. 
The increased arrests have stirred worries of overcrowding at the Tacoma detention center. As of Nov. 28, the 1,575-bed facility was holding just over 1,300 people, according to Detention Reports.

In a letter Tuesday, many of the Democrats in Washington’s congressional delegation urged the acting ICE director to release those held at the detention center who don’t pose a public safety threat due to concerns over deteriorating conditions from crowding there.
The state fought for years in court with the facility’s operator, The GEO Group, to inspect it. Despite a recent appeals court ruling in the state’s favor, inspectors still haven’t been able to get in, according to the state Department of Health.
The detention center has a history of allegations of mistreatment, abuse and neglect of detainees. A green card holder from the Philippines, Greggy Sorio, had to have a toe amputated due to medical issues he experienced while being held there.
The question of how to further protect immigrants in Washington is expected to be a major topic of discussion when the Legislature meets starting next month for a 60-day legislative session.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 19:01:33.285535

Don Bacon, R-Neb., on Wednesday to oversee elections in the state’s most populous county.
Danielle Jensen of the Elkhorn area will succeed Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse, effective Jan. 10. Jensen has been with Bacon since he first joined Congress in 2017. 
She previously served as a public and legislative affairs officer for the former Nebraska Energy Office. Jensen will hold the role through at least the end of 2027, the end of Kruse’s four-year term.
Jensen said Wednesday she was grateful to Pillen and his team for their trust. She thanked Bacon and Bacon’s chief of staff, Mark Dreiling, for their endorsements of her and their work together serving Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.
“I am truly honored and look forward to serving the voters of Douglas County,” Jensen said in a statement. “I would like to thank Brian Kruse for his years of service and will continue his work of integrity and transparency.”
Jensen earned a bachelor’s degree in broadcasting from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.

Per Nebraska law, the governor must appoint election commissioners for counties with populations greater than 100,000 people, currently Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy Counties. The person must be someone of “good moral character and integrity and capacity,” per state law. The commissioner then appoints a chief deputy commissioner of a different political party.
Then-Gov. Pete Ricketts first appointed Kruse to the post in 2016. Kruse is returning to be the general manager of a funeral home. His last day is Jan. 9.
In the 2024 presidential election, 75% of the 368,000 registered voters in Douglas County participated.
Pillen, in a statement, said Jensen’s varied background, which includes more than 20 years of experience in government affairs and political fundraising, will serve her well.
“She is a hard worker and has garnered the admiration of those with whom she has worked,” Pillen said. “Danielle will lead the election office with integrity and will make sure all elections in Douglas County are conducted with transparency and accuracy.”
Bacon, who has said he will not seek reelection in 2026, said Jensen has played a major role in his office’s success through her leadership, professionalism and dedication to Nebraska. He said Pillen made an “excellent choice” and thanked Kruse for his service. 
“I am confident she will continue serving Nebraskans with integrity while protecting our fair, accurate and impartial elections,” Bacon said in a statement.
Dreiling, Bacon’s chief of staff, said he’s known Jensen for more than 20 years and has appreciated her “long record of dedicated service.”
“Danielle has been a trusted colleague, close friend and mentor to many members of our staff, past and present, and our team is stronger because of her dedication,” Dreiling said in a statement.

(Photo courtesy of Cornell College)As Cornell College students reel from recent news of cuts to certain academic programs and positions, the college’s president said he understands their feelings while also knowing that Cornell, like the liberal arts education that fuels it, must evolve.
Cornell College, a private institution located in Mount Vernon, announced to the campus community Nov. 21 that more than 10 academic programs will end after a review of student interest and enrollment. Impacted areas of study include classical studies, French and Francophone studies, German studies, religion, and bachelor’s of music in the general, performance and K-12 tracks.
Some students said they are unsure of their future with the college, as it feels like the education, community and values they found there are disappearing. Others are organizing around their concerns and seeking to increase their visibility on campus.
President Jonathan Brand said the nearly 172-year-old university is always trying to rethink and revise itself in order to respond to the wants and needs of those it serves and be well-positioned for the future. However, the college is also operating at a $2 million budget deficit that Brand said will be gone within three years.

“We’re always looking at our programming, always,” Brand said. “We have to — have to pay attention to how the environment is changing, have to pay attention to what our students are telling us and what their families are telling us that they’re looking for in a college experience.”
In addition to the academic programs, eight faculty teaching positions are being eliminated, with those impacted retaining a year of salary and benefits “if they choose to remain in that role,” Cornell College Senior Director of Marketing and Interactive Media Jen Visser said in an email. Brand said there were also a number of staff impacted by reorganization at the college, many of whom took other roles in the institution. Four staff members in total are leaving.
Students impacted by the program changes will receive individual teach-out plans, the university previously stated.
Cuts hit students hard
Aslan Baker, a history and studio art major in his second year at Cornell, heard rumors of coming cuts before they were announced from his advisor. The advisor said Baker may notice some upset or on-edge faculty due to planned layoffs, but they believed they were safe. They weren’t.
Baker said he didn’t believe it at first, as the history department and others that saw cuts aren’t large and eliminated faculty have specialized knowledge.
“I just didn’t think they would do it, because it seems crazy to me — especially cutting religion and languages…,” Baker said. “That seems like the basis of the whole liberal arts model to me.”
Anya Wendt, a second-year art major at Cornell, said she came to the college specifically for its liberal arts education. She and other students also prefer the college’s block schedule where students take one course at a time, each lasting 18 days.
Cornell College junior and sociology major Nick Alderman said he and other students concerned about these changes don’t want to lose the four pillars that make a Cornell College education a “really compelling package” — the block plan, small class sizes, liberal arts faculty and the fact that faculty teach the courses themselves.
“I’m just really disappointed in the higher boards … I feel like they don’t see what they’re doing to the college, and they’re so stuck on their idea that this was the right thing to do that they’re not seeing all the negative effects,” Wendt said.
Brand said the college is “committed” to the block system and the idea of being a “relationship-driven institution,” but he challenged the belief that Cornell is doing away with a liberal arts education. No one discipline can claim ownership of the liberal arts, he said, and the topics and areas of study under its umbrella have “been changing for a millennium now.”
Reorganizing for a sustainable future
Conversations eventually leading to these actions began in June, Brand said, starting with a small group of faculty and members of the college’s board of trustees before holding sessions for all faculty and staff.
One proposal from faculty was to take alternative measures to discontinuing programs in efforts to save money, like having faculty take a pay cut or spreading monetary cuts across all programs equally, but Brand said it wouldn’t work out. The college has taken similar steps when cutting in the past, he said, but “what ends up happening afterwards is” certain departments, faculty and staff say they need more resources to complete their work and the cuts themselves don’t end up being balanced.
“It’s an attractive approach,” Brand said. “It’s just not always a strategic approach.”
The faculty council developed the criteria for determining which programs should be reduced or eliminated, Brand said, and “modestly revised” by Interim Provost Kathryn Kauper. That criteria included demonstrated student interest, cost of operation, contributions to overall curriculum and others.
Cornell is in “good” financial standing, Brand said, with its endowment growing and enrollment staying steady for now. While it is the middle of the fiscal year, Brand said the college is currently projecting a $2 million budget deficit. He said he doesn’t yet know how much money will come from the cuts in order to fill that gap, but the institution has “taken a lot of strong steps in that direction.”
“By the end of three years from now, we will have a balanced budget,” Brand said.
Students not stepping down
“Confusion” and “chaos” spread across campus after the news came out, Wendt said, “especially with the lack of transparency behind everything.” Baker said students are upset but don’t know what to do about it.
After the “mixed” reaction from campus following the announcement, Brand said both he and Kauper have met with students, faculty and staff to discuss the cuts. Kauper also met with the college’s Student Senate to answer their questions.
Some Cornell College students have organized in response to all that has happened this past semester, creating a coalition, petition and online publication aimed at documenting and speaking out against program and position cuts announced by the college administration.
Alderman and senior sociology major Hannah Koenighain criticized the student senate meeting, saying their biggest questions weren’t answered, if they got to be asked at all. Koenighain said she and other students have already written to the administration and board of trustees to express their frustration with the cuts and the process to make them, which they plan to continue.
The group wants to increase their “visibility on campus,” she said.
“It sounds like our next step is direct action,” Koenighain said.
Even though the history major at Cornell College will remain available for students, Baker said he’s not planning on sticking around to finish it out. He said he feels like history “doesn’t really have a future here” with faculty he was close to having to leave and the idea that hits to certain programs will “trickle down” to other areas of the college.
Wendt is more on the fence of whether she’ll transfer to another school or not, as she said she’s made friends here, she knows the campus and doesn’t want to abandon the college’s block plan. However, Colorado College has both the block plan and a Russian program she could major in, rather than pursue a minor.
“I feel like there’s going to be a big wave of just people wanting to transfer and just silently abandoning this place after all this,” Baker said.

Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George's) is leaving the legislature. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) is resigning from the legislature to take a senior role with the University of Maryland.
Lewis’ departure was announced by a colleague on the floor during Tuesday’s special session where the House elected Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) as its new speaker. Lewis and the university confirmed his departure in separate press releases Wednesday.
“This was not a decision I made lightly,” Lewis said in an emailed statement. “Serving my home, the people, and communities of Legislative District 24 and Prince George’s County has been the honor of my life.”
Lewis’ resignation is effective Jan. 5 — a little more than a week before the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 legislative session. He’ll take over as the University of Maryland’s director of government relations, replacing Ross Stern, who is retiring at the end of the year after 25 years at the institution.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lewis’ announcement is just the latest in a string of House leadership changes sparked by former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) Dec. 4 announcement that she was stepping down, effective immediately. That began a scramble for her seat among House leadership that was quickly won by Peña-Melnyk, opening her seat as chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee.
Since then, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) has resigned to focus on her bid for Howard County executive, and Lewis has announced his departure. Other changes are expected in the coming weeks as Peña-Melnyk appoints her own leadership team.




Lewis spent the last nine years in the House.




Lewis was appointed to the House in February 2017 to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Michale Vaughn for unspecified health reasons. Vaughn was later indicted for bribery and conspiracy and convicted in federal court.
He has been a member of the House Appropriations Committee since 2021. Since 2023, he served as the vice chair of that committee’s Capital Budget Subcommittee. He was named House Majority Whip in 2023.

The vote comes just before the start of 2026, when several major events – including the FIFA World Cup, America250 and the NFL draft – promise to draw “record-breaking numbers of visitors” to the state, noted Zakary Pyzik, senior director of public affairs for the Pennsylvania Restaurant & Lodging Association. 
Listen to the audio recap: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/17epHB1286web.mp3
 
Bill sponsor Rep. Regina Young’s district includes the Philadelphia International Airport, in addition to an adjacent section of Delaware County. 
“This is bigger than 2026, but the time really is now,” said Young, a Democrat who introduced a similar proposal during the last legislative session as well. 
Young and Pyzik spoke during a press conference Wednesday along with state Rep. Tarik Khan (D-Philadelphia) and Philadelphia City Councilwoman Nina Amad before the House took up the measure for third and final consideration. It now goes to the Senate, which reconvenes on Jan. 6. 
The bill calls for hospitality personnel to undergo training biannually thorough programs – including free, online options – approved by the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency in consultation with statewide organizations representing the hospitality, travel and tourism industries. Motels, hotels and short-term rental operators would have to keep records certifying the training and produce them upon request by the state Department of Labor & Industry or local licensing or law enforcement authorities. 
Third-party platforms such as Airbnb wouldn’t need to maintain training certifications from users. The onus would be on operators using the sites to advertise and facilitate reservations. However, the booking platform would have to keep a record of users’ training confirmations (e.g., emails).

If HB1286 becomes law, workers and employers can initially present proof of training completed within the prior year to meet its requirements.
Violators would face a fine of $100 for a first offense, $250 for a second within 90 days and $500 daily for third and subsequent infractions. Ultimately, they could lose their operating license. At least half the restitution collected will go toward PCCD grants, according to the proposal.

(iStock/Getty Images)The South Dakota Department of Health is warning the public about a potential measles exposure at the Rapid City Regional Airport. 
The notification came as the agency’s website lists three new measles cases in the state since November.
The new cases are the state’s first since June, and they raise the number of confirmed measles infections this year in South Dakota to 15.
At the Rapid City airport, the potential exposure was caused by a Butte County resident with a confirmed measles infection, the Health Department said. The potential exposure occurred from 10:45 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. Mountain time on Dec. 10.
“We are sharing this information to help individuals who may have been exposed take steps to protect their health,” said State Epidemiologist Joshua Clayton in a news release Wednesday. 
‘I question it myself’: South Dakota vaccination rates fall amid mistrust and misinformation

Anyone who was at the airport during the exposure window should watch for symptoms for 21 days, the Health Department said. People who are not immune to measles should contact their health care provider to discuss protective options.
Measles symptoms appear in two stages. In the first, the infected person may have a runny nose, cough and a slight fever. The eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light while the fever consistently rises each day. 
The second stage begins on the third to seventh day of symptoms and consists of a temperature of 103-105 degrees Fahrenheit, and a red blotchy rash lasting for four to seven days. The rash usually begins on the face and spreads down to the trunk and out to the arms and legs.
Clayton stressed the importance of immunization, saying “any South Dakotan who lacks immunity from vaccination or past infection can get the MMR vaccine to prevent measles infection and its complications.”
“MMR” is a reference to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is typically administered at 12-15 months of age. The second dose of MMR is administered at 4-6 years of age. 
“The vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles infection, and two MMR doses usually produce lifelong immunity,” the Health Department said.
The kindergarten measles vaccination rate in South Dakota has tumbled from 97% to 90% in the past 10 years. Health officials blame disinformation about vaccine safety, which has contributed to a rise in parents claiming religious exemptions to avoid mandatory school immunizations. 
Thirteen of the 15 people infected by measles in South Dakota this year were unvaccinated, according to the state’s online dashboard. The vaccination status of the other two infected people is unknown.
Measles was considered eliminated in the United States 25 years ago, but infections have surged as vaccination rates have fallen in some states. There have been 1,958 confirmed measles cases in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
South Dakota’s 15 cases include eight adults and seven children. There have been eight cases in Lincoln County, three in Butte County, and two apiece in Meade and Pennington counties. Ten of the people were exposed during international travel, two during domestic travel outside South Dakota and three through close contact with an infected person.

House Join[...]","President Donald Trump poses with members of Montana's federal delegation after signing H.J.Res. 104, rolling back a BLM rule which prohibited future coal leasing in eastern Montana. President Donald Trump signed a resolution sponsored by Montana’s federal delegation overturning Biden-era restrictions on coal extraction across most of eastern Montanan, helping the state’s stated goals of bolstering its mining and energy sectors.
But the move happens even as demand for coal continues to drop and production in Montana decreases.
House Joint Resolution 104, carried by the state’s eastern congressman, Rep. Troy Downing, and cosponsored by Rep. Ryan Zinke, passed both chambers on near-partisan lines, with a single Republican representative joining all Democrats in opposition.
Montana’s U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy sponsored an identical Senate Joint Resolution 61.
“Now more than ever, America needs affordable, reliable energy to fuel our new golden age,” Downing said in a statement. “With the signing of my bill to permanently roll back burdensome restrictions on coal leasing for the nation’s largest deposit, we aren’t just meeting the demands of today, we’re ensuring that we can power our country’s future. We are also making sure that subsequent administrations cannot undo the good work of the current one, safeguarding American energy independence.
The new law is one of several bills the president signed Thursday rescinding resource management plans on tens of millions of acres of public land in Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming and Alaska.
In Montana, the legislation overturns a rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management in 2024 that covered the state’s portion of the Powder River Basin, the nation’s largest coal-producing area.
“The approved RMP Amendment makes unavailable 1,745,040 acres of BLM administered coal from further consideration for leasing in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a proxy for climate change. The BLM would not accept new coal lease applications,” the decision said, setting out timelines to phase out coal production in the region.
Montana’s leaders had opposed the decision, saying that it would eliminate crucial revenue from coal taxes, which fund public schools and infrastructure, as well as stifle the national energy industry.
Last year Montana and Wyoming sued the federal government over the move to end coal leasing, and earlier this year, Gov. Greg Gianforte sent a letter to the Trump administration urging the federal government to maximize the availability of federal coal in Montana.
In a statement last week, he praised Trump and the state’s delegation for acting to “defend coal-based power and strengthen our nation’s energy security.”
The governor said that the move opens up nearly $4 billion in coal tax revenue for Montana.
 Supply versus demand

However, amid the backdrop of the state and federal government’s push for increasing coal mining and coal-based power, the demand for coal is declining.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. coal production to drop from 610 million tons in 2022 to 450 million tons in 2040, and Western U.S. production to drop from 335 million tons to 224 million tons over the same period.
Since 2002, two of Montana’s largest coal mines have decreased production by roughly a third.
In October, the federal government rejected a bid on a new coal lease offered for 167 million tons from Montana’s Powder River Basin.
For what was the largest Montana coal lease sale in more than a decade, the sole bid, from Navajo Transitional Energy Company, was for just $186,000, fractions of a penny per ton and below BLM-estimates as a fair market value.
The BLM postponed a subsequent sale in Wyoming due to the low demand.
In addition to highlight the shifting demand away from fossil fuels, conservation groups decried the move as reversing environmental protections and said it side-stepped input from local stakeholders and the scientific community.
“Americans deserve public lands that protect clean air and water, support wildlife and preserve the freedom of future generations to explore,” Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement. “Instead, the president and Congress have muzzled voices in local communities and tossed aside science-based management plans that would deliver a balanced approach to managing our public lands. And meanwhile, even as the Congress seeks ways to permit development projects faster and better, they have thrown years of permits into question with this action. The public deserves better.”
But Republicans in Congress, and in Montana, are happy with their win.
“Now, thanks to the hard work of our Montana delegation, Biden’s rule is repealed and Montana energy is back,” Daines said in a statement, calling the Biden plan an “anti-coal rule.”
“Together, we are delivering the America First, commonsense policies Montanans voted for to achieve American energy dominance, create jobs, and make energy affordable, accessible, and reliable again,” Sheehy said. “I’ll continue working alongside President Trump and the Montana delegation to unleash Montana’s resource economy, protect Montana jobs, and bring prosperity to rural Montana communities.”
Zinke said the legislation will “lower energy costs by unlocking Montana’s vast natural resources and brings security to the jobs of the hardworking men and women who mine in Montana.”
“This is another success in the fight to make energy more affordable and protect the families who depend on it,” his statement said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/G77nYVkWgAAXcCZ-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 19:01:33.285535

(Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, alleged Wednesday that the Minnesota Department of Human Services paid state money to a defendant in the Feeding Our Future case through the assisted living program while they were awaiting trial.
Robbins, who chairs the House fraud prevention committee and is running for governor, alleged during the public hearing Wednesday that the Department of Human Services gave taxpayer dollars to a Feeding Our Future defendant as late as October — while he was awaiting his federal trial — through the state’s assisted living program. Robbins declined to name the defendant and said her researcher used public records to identify the payments.
After Robbins’ presentation, DHS Inspector General James Clark didn’t corroborate her allegations.
An assisted living facility provides sleeping accommodations and customized living services to one or more adults. The services can include assisting people with daily living tasks, like bathing and feeding, nursing tasks and medication management. People pay a fee to live in assisted living facilities, and Medicaid-eligible residents can get help paying for customized living services through state Medicaid waivers, which the Department of Human Services is responsible for overseeing.
“It is outrageous that the department is still allowing a Feeding Our Future fraudster who has been charged to still get state money of any kind,” Robbins told committee members during a presentation of her findings.
Robbins’ presentation was the first public allegation of fraud in the state’s assisted living program.
The Department of Health, which licenses assisted living facilities, on Wednesday told the fraud prevention committee that Minnesota has about 2,300 licensees for assisted living services, of which the majority house five or fewer residents. MDH said the amount of licensees increases 4% to 5% annually.
Robbins presented an anonymized diagram of a network of six people receiving state payments, including the Feeding Our Future defendant, and four real estate brokers, one of whom she said helped the Feeding Our Future defendant buy multiple properties and is now the single largest buying agent for single-family homes to be used as assisted living homes. Robbins alleged the people in the network have been tied — through Feeding Our Future — or could be tied to fraudulent activity.
The Republican-led fraud prevention committee created a whistleblower portal in the spring, where Robbins said DHS staff have shared information. Robbins said that she has yet to share detailed information with DHS on what she says are hundreds of whistleblower reports alleging fraud, despite a letter from DHS asking for more information.
“There is no trust, as you might understand,” Robbins said. “This fraud has been perpetuated on your watch, and the whistleblowers who reach out to us within the department are terrified.”
After the committee hearing, Clark told reporters that, like Robbins, the agency has been investigating connections between possibly fraudulent providers, but is not familiar with a case where a Feeding Our Future defendant is still receiving payments. Clark — who previously worked in the Attorney General Office’s Medicaid fraud division — emphasized that DHS can suspend payments, unlike the U.S. Attorney or the Office of the Legislative Auditor.
“It’s my understanding… that for every single Feeding Our Future defendant who has been indicted, we scrub our records to see if they have ties to Department of Human Services billing and we investigate and we stop payments. So if there is evidence that there are Feeding Our Future defendants out there who are still billing the state, please let me know,” Clark said.
This isn’t the first instance of Feeding Our Future defendants allegedly being tied to fraud in other government programs. In 2023, the Reformer reported that in the past dozen years, DHS has had contracts with about 30 businesses connected to 26 people charged in Feeding Our Future.
The Feeding Our Future scandal led prosecutors to uncover fraud in autism centers. Court documents show that DHS paused payments in June to an autism center, Hennepin Autism, for its alleged connection to Feeding Our Future in addition to pausing payments to another business co-owned by the same person.
Rep. Dave Pinto, DFL-St. Paul, in a statement criticized Robbins for prioritizing “political theater” and presenting her allegations during the hearing rather than reporting it to state investigators.
“If chair Robbins has in fact uncovered legitimate concerns of fraud – a claim for which there is no evidence – then her top priority should have been to get them investigated and, if warranted, get payments stopped,” Pinto said in a statement. “Her deliberate choice instead to prioritize political theater – and let the funds keep flowing – is another example of her choosing to put her partisan political ambitions above those of Minnesota taxpayers.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0788-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-17 19:01:33.285535

(Photo from senate.gov)The Senate approved federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina on Wednesday as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, following passage by the House last week.
In a vote Wednesday, a broad bipartisan coalition of senators approved the bill in a 77-20 vote, following a 312-112 vote in the House last Wednesday. The bill now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk, where he can now deliver on a pledge for recognition that he made during his campaign stops in North Carolina in both 2020 and 2024.
The Lumbee are set to become the largest federally recognized tribe east of the Mississippi River with more than 55,000 enrolled members and only the second with full federal recognition based in North Carolina after the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
While North Carolina recognized the Lumbee in 1885, Congress declined to grant recognition for nearly 140 years, with more than 40 bills that would have recognized the tribe failing in the House or Senate. A 1956 act passed during the Termination Era prohibited the Lumbee from receiving any of the rights and benefits associated with recognition, which is now set to be overturned by the 2025 bill.
Lumbee recognition has long been a controversial issue among recognized Native American tribes, with more than 100 opposing the passage of the Lumbee Fairness Act and about 235 supporting it.
Speaking before a hearing of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs last month, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Principal Chief Michell Hicks called into question the historical and genealogical claims of the Lumbee, arguing that the tribe at first claimed to be Cherokee in the early 20th century before taking on their present identity.

Lumbee historians say the tribe came to be after survivors of conflicts with European settlers from several different tribes, including the Algonquian, Iroquoian, and Siouan peoples, made the wetlands surrounding North Carolina’s Lumber River their new home. Among the historical moments the tribe celebrates is a 1958 standoff with the Ku Klux Klan in Robeson County, in which hundreds of Lumbee chased a mob of 50 Klansmen out of the town and thwarted a white supremacist rally.
At the congressional hearing, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a longtime backer of Lumbee recognition, said the close-knit community, historical presence, and vibrant cultural traditions of the tribe speak for themselves.
“I invite anyone with doubts to visit Robeson County, Hoke County, or Scotland County, go to the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, founded by and for the Lumbee people,” Tillis said at the hearing. “You’ll see the rich Lumbee culture, their deep roots in North Carolina, and their extraordinary contributions to our state and our nation.”
Tillis, who led the Lumbee Fairness Act this year alongside North Carolina Republicans Sen. Ted Budd, Rep. David Rouzer, and Rep. Mark Harris, celebrated the bill’s passage in a statement Wednesday.
“President Trump traveled to Robeson County and pledged to get federal recognition done. He kept that promise and showed extraordinary leadership,” he said. “With the Senate passage of the NDAA, the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina will now achieve full federal recognition and access to every federal benefit they have earned and deserve.”
Praise for the passage of the recognition bill came from both sides of the aisle in North Carolina. Attorney General Jeff Jackson, who sponsored a previous version of the bill when serving in Congress, joined in the celebration in a statement on social media.
“The Lumbee Tribe has finally been officially recognized by Congress and they’re set to receive the full federal benefits that come with that recognition. This is a milestone more than a century in the making,” Jackson said. “I thank the bipartisan coalition that got this over the finish line.”
In a video posted shortly after the vote Wednesday, Lumbee Chairman John Lowery praised the bill’s passage.
“God is good, and without him, we would not have achieved what we have today,” he said. “I can proudly say that I am the last chairman that’s had to come to D.C., fighting, pushing, and advocating for our full federal recognition.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lowery-Hearing-1024x576.png,,,2025-12-17 19:01:33.285535

For 90 years, Yankee Magazine has been telling stories of and about New England. And for more than half of the  magazine’s life, Mel Allen has been Yankee’s foremost storyteller. Allen wrote his first stories for Yankee in 1977, then held various editorial roles before becoming Yankee’s fifth editor in 2006. He retired as editor earlier this year after 48 years with the magazine, which is based in Dublin, NH. 
I first got to know Mel Allen in the 1980s, when I began writing for Yankee. I had never had an editor quite like him. He didn’t just assign stories. He coached, shaped, cajoled and encouraged me and countless other New England writers to do our best work. He even came to Vermont with his two sons to go backcountry skiing with me. They loved it, (he, not so much) and a friendship was kindled. 
Allen has taught magazine writing and creative nonfiction for the past 25 years at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and teaches in the MFA program at Bay Path University. In 2018, Mel Allen was inducted into the Folio Magazine Hall of Fame for editorial excellence.
Mel Allen, 79, recently published a book of essays, Here in New England: Unforgettable Stories of People, Places, and Memories That Connect Us All. The stories take us along on his journey to meet the last horse-and-buggy egg delivery man; the tragic search for a lost boy in Maine; to a town in Maine that refused to die; to meet Stephen King, the “King of Horror”; and to the son of an undocumented Mexican immigrant who graduated at the top of his class at Bowdoin College and worked to bring his mother back home to Arizona where he was raised. 
Allen is sometimes a participant observer in his stories, as immortalized by Stephen King. “I may be the only writer who not only helped King round up pigs for the market when they escaped, but who also ended up as a character named Mel Allen from the Portland Sunday Telegram in ‘The Dead Zone,'” Allen writes in his book.
Allen believes in the power of stories to build bridges. These “are stories that transcend the current climate of disunity. That’s why I believe these stories can connect us,” Allen told The Vermont Conversation. He said that there a “sense of place in New England that I don’t know exists anywhere else.”
I asked Allen what makes a good story. “You want to keep turning the page,” he said. “You want to know what’s going to happen to this person. You want to care about the person.”
With journalism in a state of upheaval, I asked Allen what his advice is to young journalists. “You are drawn to tell stories because of something in you. It’s not something that somebody puts on your shoulders and says, Now I want you to go out and to tell those stories,” he said. “If you’re called to do that, you follow that calling.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Florida Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia previewed legislation Wednesday meant to increase spending accountability and transparency for local government officials, with penalties for noncompliance including fines and removal from office.
Ingoglia has been crisscrossing the state for months with his FAFO (Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight) team, auditing spending by some of the state’s largest counties and municipalities. To date they have reviewed spending by 11 local governments and say that they have found more than $1.86 billion in alleged wasteful and excessive spending.
Ingoglia has been clear that part of the effort is to show taxpayers that extensive wasteful spending is taking place. His assertion of such excesses, he believes, should quell arguments by local government officials that a proposed reduction in property taxes for homestead properties will harm essential local services.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he wants to put a measure on the statewide ballot next November that would eliminate of substantially reduce property taxes on homestead properties but has yet to release his own proposal(s). He has, however, ridiculed the proposals on the issue already moving their way through the Florida House as “milquetoast.”
Ingoglia introduced his proposal during a press conference in Tampa that featured state Rep. Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, who said she will sponsor them in the Florida House during the 2026 session.
“Over the last five years, we have seen property taxes increase by nearly 50%, and this at a time when Florida’s families are being asked to tighten their belts,” she said. “To be direct, tax dollars have become a drug for local governments. And, like any addiction, as long as the supply is unlimited, the behavior will not change.”
The provisions in the legislation
The proposals discussed on Wednesday that will be sponsored by Miller in the House and Sen. Nick DiCeglie, R-Indian Rocks Beach, would include:

Codifying FAFO into statute to increase accountability and transparency in local government and make this effort a long-term permanent initiative. “Protecting taxpayers should not have an expiration date, and neither should FAFO,” Ingoglia declared.
Grant government employees, contractors, subcontractors, and taxpayers whistleblower protections when reporting waste, fraud, and abuse of local tax dollars.
Allow the Department of Financial Services to pursue financial penalties from local governments if they do not respond to inquiries in a “timely manner,” including the withholding of state funds until they comply. That office would have the power to issue subpoenas (as Ingoglia’s office did this summer with officials in Orange County).
Require local governments to upload all of their contracts into a centralized state financial system.
Require local governments to submit annual financial efficiency reports to include information such as cash on hand and how much goes to investment accounts and nonprofit organizations, and to list salaries of every local government employee.
Codify that the Florida CFO can recommend to the governor and state Cabinet removal of any elected official found to have committed financial abuse, malfeasance, or misfeasance.

Miller said that whenever the conversation about cutting back on excessive government spending takes place, she has been “immediately bombarded by naysayers and their supporters with arguments as to why it is impossible. It’s just astounding.”
Ingoglia spent considerable time during the news conference ridiculing local government officials “and their leftist big-budget apologists” who have questioned the methodology of his team’s audits.
‘Fictitious’ claims?
Last week in Palm Beach County, Ingoglia claimed his team of auditors identified $344 million in “excessive, wasteful spending” in the most recent fiscal year — the highest amount across the 11 local governments his agency has reviewed this year.
That received strong pushback from Palm Beach County Administrator Joe Abruzzo, who called the claims “fictitious,” and sent Ingoglia a public records request asking for detailed information about how the calculations were made, according to Stet News.
Local government officials have repeatedly questioned what the CFO is identifying as being “wasteful” and “excessive” in their spending practices. Ingoglia has promised those governments that detailed audits identifying that spending are coming, but they have yet to be released.
“Will there be specific instances outlining line items in the budget that they are spending? Yes, but that is why this information and this piece of legislation is vital, because it allows us to get more information quicker than we would have before,” he said.
Among the local governments Ingolia’s team has audited to date, Tampa, the state’s third largest municipality, hasn’t been one of them. But Ingoglia said if he is elected next year and then re-elected in 2030, he’ll eventually get to every local government that draws taxpayer funds.
“Whether it is a city, a county, a taxing jurisdiction, a school board, a board that has its own millage rate, its own taxing authority, that will not escape my grasp over the next nine years,” he said. “I’m going to be looking at everything.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-7-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 19:01:33.285535
,DC,2025-12-17 23:16:28+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration policy blocked that limited congressional visits to ICE facilities,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-policy-blocked-limited-congressional-visits-ice-facilities,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge Wednesday blocked a policy from the Department of Homeland Security, finding that it violated an appropriations law that allows members of Congress to make unannounced oversight visits to federal facilities that detain immigrants.Judge Jia Cobb rejected the Trump administration's argument that the new policy doesn’t prevent members of Congress from entering a DHS facility that detains immigrants. “The notice requirement as implemented by ICE officials does just that: it stops visiting Members of Congress from entering a facility unless they have provided seven days of advance notice,” she wrote in her opinion.The stay on the DHS policy from Cobb is temporary, while the case proceeds.This year, DHS created the new policy to require lawmakers to give the agency seven days’ notice, plus approval from an agency official, before visiting a facility where immigrants are detained. In July, 12 members of Congress sued, arguing that DHS overreached its authority in creating the policy and that it violated a 2019 appropriations law, referred to as Section 527.“The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that Section 527 funds are being used to implement a seven-day notice requirement for Members of Congress seeking to enter ICE detention facilities, and that the notice requirement is contrary to law and in excess of DHS’s statutory authority,” Cobb wrote.As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration crackdown, the number of immigrants held in detention has ballooned. One of the few tools Democrats have, as the minority party, is oversight of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.  The suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia charged that the Trump administration overreached its authority in creating the policy.Those Democrats who sued include: Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.In a statement, lawmakers praised the decision. “It reinforces the rule of law and reminds the administration that oversight is not optional,” they said. “Real-time, on-the-ground visits to immigration detention facilities help prevent abuses and ensure transparency. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress—and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly.”Democrats created the policy that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced at DHS facilities that detain immigrants, including ICE field offices, after the first Trump administration’s practice of separating children from their parents at the southern border in 2018.At that time, Democrats were unable to conduct interviews with separated immigrant families and often denied entry into DHS facilities, so lawmakers included the provision in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations law.The provision was later expanded to include all immigrants detained at DHS facilities, not just children, and allowed for unannounced visits by members and the inclusion of congressional staff to enter with their members during oversight visits.",,,,2025-12-17 19:01:33.285535

(Photo courtesy Department of General Services),"An architectural rendering of the planned new Maryland Supreme Court on Rowe Boulevard. (Photo courtesy Department of General Services)The Board of Public Works approved a $147 million contract Wednesday to replace the current “inadequate” Maryland Courts of Appeal Building with a new six-story, environmentally efficient building on Rowe Boulevard in Annapolis, just north of the current District Court.
The contract was awarded to Bethesda-based Coakley & Williams Construction, which is expected to start work in a couple of weeks. Construction is expected to take three years, according to a statement from the Maryland Department of General Services.
The new building will replace the Courts of Appeal Building, which opened in 1972 and has not only outlived its usefulness but faces numerous structural problems. Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Fader called the new building a “generational investment” that will demonstrate the importance of justice in Maryland.
But Fader, speaking to the board, had less lofty goals, too.
“It is my hope that the heat will work in the winter, and only in the winter, that less water will fall from the ceilings, that the power will be more reliable and we’ll have significantly less mold,” Fader said.

Besides having heat that works and ceilings that don’t leak, the new building will have a courtroom for the Maryland Supreme Court and three courtrooms for the Appellate Court of Maryland, the state’s intermediate appeals court, as well as office space and chambers for judges on both courts.
The 217,000-square-foot building will have space for boards and judicial committees that cannot be accommodated in the current courts building, as well as space for a law library and a Maryland law history  museum, said Gov. Wes Moore (D), of the three members of the Board of Public Works. While the building will be technologically state-of-the-art, it will also include design elements from the last Supreme Court, which was built in 1903 in the shadow of the State House.
The all-electric building will have a low carbon footprint, since it will not rely on fossil fuels for heating or cooling. General Services Secretary Atif Chaudhry told the board the building is expected to earn LEED Silver status for its energy efficiency.
Chaudhry and board members all touted the fact that Coakley & Williams has committed to beating aggressive goals for minority business participation i the [roject — just over 40% for minority business enterprises and just over 10% for veteran-owned businesses. At those levels, Chaudhry noted, minority-certified businesses would get $59 million of the project and veteran-owned subcontractors would get $14.8 million.
“This is a once-in-a-generation investment in the future of Maryland’s storied judicial system,” Chaudhry said in a prepared statement. “This project reflects our commitment to delivering a modern, sustainable facility built to serve Marylanders for decades to come.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-17-at-2.38.38 PM-1024x471.jpeg,,,2025-12-18 03:59:42.716237
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-17 23:13:56+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Beacon Hill’s new rules are good. They should follow them.,Jonathan Cohn and Scotia Hille,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/beacon-hills-new-rules-are-good-they-should-follow-them/,Everyday people--and not just advocates deep in the trenches--are seeing that things need to change.,"THIS SUMMER, the Massachusetts Legislature did something that surprised everyone. And, no, we aren’t talking about passing a budget on time. The House and Senate agreed to a set of joint rules for the first time since 2019, including a number of transparency reforms that activists had fought for for years.  
The Massachusetts Legislature has often been ranked as the least transparent in the country, and the opening of this session created a fertile opportunity to change that. Last year, we saw a chaotic end of session that left many key bills on the table, competitive legislative primaries waged over voters’ desire for a more small “d” democratic Democratic Legislature, and a blowout victory for Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s ballot question on auditing the Legislature. Everyday people–and not just advocates deep in the trenches–were seeing that things needed to change.  
This followed years of organizing on the ground to educate people about why a lack of transparency has been a roadblock to progress on the issues we care about. When too few people hold all decision-making power, everything slows down. When policymaking happens behind closed doors, well-funded corporate lobbyists can push their way in, but regular people, especially those most directly impacted, are shut out and left in the dark. And when we can’t see how our elected officials vote, we are not able to hold them accountable.  
Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka kicked off 2025 with a welcome New Year’s resolution: creating a more transparent, efficient, and democratic legislative process. The new rules that emerged contained some major victories:  

Committee votes are now public, so constituents can know whether or not their elected representatives are fighting for the issues they ran on.  


Every bill now has a public bill summary, so constituents don’t need to be experts in the Massachusetts General Laws to know what bills mean.  


Committees now have to provide 10 days’ notice for hearings, so everyday people can more easily make time in their busy schedule to make their voice heard.  


And committees face earlier reporting deadlines, so an end-of-session bottleneck will be less likely to happen (we hope).  

Winning these reforms was step one. The real question now is whether the Legislature is following them.  
Beacon Hill Tracker, a new citizen-created dashboard, paints a very mixed picture. The new site tracks whether committees are following these new rules: publishing committee votes, posting bill summaries, providing sufficient meeting notice, and adhering to reporting deadlines. 
For the 8,868 bills analyzed as of this writing, committees broke at least one of these new rules for a slim majority of them (50.9 percent, or 4,513 bills). A mere 725 bills showed no violations. For the rest, it’s too soon to tell.  
The most common rules violation was breaking the 10-day notice for hearings (3,318), followed by not posting votes (2,643), and then missed deadlines (2,294). Committees have been much better about posting bill summaries (only 599 violations).  
From an earlier manual analysis of Beacon Hill’s adherence to the new rules, we found striking inconsistencies between committees on not just whether they followed them but how: committee votes could appear in any of at least five different places. Constituents shouldn’t have to go down a rabbit hole to know what their legislators are doing.  
We have already seen the benefit of the new rules. Last month, when the House Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee advanced a dirty energy bill written by corporate lobbyists, an open committee vote allowed activists to spring into action. Constituents had a clear sense of where legislators on the committee stood and could reach out accordingly. 
The non-unanimity of the vote indicated to activists that all was not lost, and that there were real concerns with the bill among rank-and-file legislators. The bill has since been put on pause, and will likely be fully rewritten, a win for the climate and for democracy.  
With 2025 coming to a close, some of the new rules will be no longer relevant to the second year of the legislative session (hearings have already occurred, and deadlines have already passed). But if legislators are looking for a New Year’s resolution for 2026, here’s a good one: follow your own rules.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New requirements Congress enacted earlier this year will mean more than 55,000 New Mexicans starting Jan. 1 will have to prove they worked or received training or education for 80 hours a month in order to receive federal food assistance. 
The state Health Care Authority on Wednesday issued details about the new requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which apply to adults ages 18 to 64, an increase from the previous age limit of 55.
The age increase constituted just one of numerous changes to the work requirements enacted via the budget bill President Donald Trump signed in July. The bill also increased the number of non-disabled people now subject to new work requirements, and lowered the age of qualifying dependents from 18 to 14 for parents and caregivers. 
New Mexico agency seeks funds to bring down SNAP error rate — but not too quickly

Those who don’t meet the requirements will be limited to three months’ worth of SNAP benefits over the next three years. 
The law also made it harder for states to qualify for exemptions to the work requirements. Before the bill went into effect, the United States Department of Agriculture exempted all New Mexico residents from work requirements, except for those in Bernalillo, Santa Fe, Doña Ana and Los Alamos, based on a range of criteria relating to job availability. 
Under the new law, only residents in Luna County remain exempt, based on the county’s unemployment rate of at least 10%, along with some New Mexico pueblos with high unemployment rates. All Native Americans are also exempt from the new requirements, according to the state HCA.
Because of the changes, the HCA estimated 55,570 New Mexicans will now be subject to the requirements. New Mexico has approximately 460,000 SNAP recipients statewide, or roughly 21% of the population, which is the highest rate of SNAP reliance nationwide.
The Trump administration pushed for the new requirements, it said, to reduce dependency on SNAP. 
Five things to know about federal food assistance cuts before the special session

Marco Alarid White, an attorney with the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, predicted Wednesday that the new requirements will actually make it harder for SNAP recipients to find jobs or receive training that makes them less reliant on the federal program. 
“Access to SNAP itself is the thing that most leads to gainful employment,” he told Source New Mexico. “It’s access to SNAP that ensures that people are able to be fed and well, and the access to SNAP itself that will increase opportunity for especially these vulnerable groups we’re talking about.”
He pointed to a 2021 study by the United States Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, that reported “no evidence” exists that able-bodied people who lost SNAP due to work requirements subsequently increased their earnings or annual income. 
The new requirements will also impose huge new administrative costs on the state, Alarid White said, to ensure new or renewing applicants comply with the requirements.
The HCA does have additional funds for the program, following a special legislative session in October during which lawmakers approved more than $160 million in state funds to replace federal cuts to health care and SNAP. The funds included $1.5 million to the HCA to expand job and education training to help New Mexicans meet the requirements and continue to receive SNAP. 
Alarid White said Wednesday he is awaiting more information on how that funding will be disbursed. Marina Piña, an HCA spokesperson, did not immediately respond to Source’s request for more information on the funding.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-stamps-sign.jpg,,,2025-12-17 19:01:33.285535

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Investigators are widening their search as the hunt for the man believed responsible for the Brown University mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine others enters its fifth day.


Report a tip
Anyone with information regarding the Brown University shooting can submit an anonymous tip by phone to the FBI at 1 (800) 225-5324 or the Providence Police Department at (401) 272-3121. 
Information, including photo and video evidence, can also be submitted online via the FBI website. 
The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward to anyone with information that leads to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible. 


Providence Police on Wednesday released new images of a second person who was walking through the East Side neighborhood at the same time as the suspected shooter on Saturday, along with a map of a focus area stretching 10 blocks south of the Barus and Holley engineering building where the fatal shooting occurred.

Officials are again calling upon the public for help in identifying the second person, shown wearing a dark jacket with a tan sweatshirt underneath, hood pulled up, and carrying a tan bag, believed to have been close to the 5-foot-8 man with a stocky build previously identified as the main “person of interest” in the shooting.
“Videos don’t speak,” Col. Oscar Perez, Providence Police chief, said during a press conference Wednesday afternoon. “I wish the video could speak, and then I’d have the answers I need.”
Perez declined to answer whether the second person was connected to the person of interest. 
Nearly 100 hours have passed since the fatal shooting at the campus engineering building at 4 p.m. Saturday. More than 200 tips, including photo and video evidence from property security systems and vehicle dash cameras, have poured in as local, state, and federal investigators searched for physical evidence in the surrounding neighborhood.
“This is a very intensive investigation,” Perez said. “It’s going to take public assistance. It’s going to take 21st century policing involving technology, but it’s also going to take good old fashioned police work, which is knocking on doors, going through yards.”
Perez said later, “A person is going to get caught. We’re not going to stop until they do.”
The area of focus has expanded beyond the intersection of Ives and Pitman streets, where the gunman was last detected on video footage after the crime, stretching south into Fox Point, almost reaching the Washington Bridge, according to the new map.
“We want to make sure we don’t miss anything,” Perez said.

Expanding circles
Concentric circles growing outward is standard practice for investigations, and Perez said the team is ready to follow tips and leads across and beyond state lines, too.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha offered new insight into officials’ decision to keep key details of the investigation under wraps, including videos from inside the building that show students fleeing after the gunman opened fire with what officials have said was a 9 millimeter gun. They have not confirmed whether the weapon has been found.
“These are not facts that advance the investigation,” Neronha said of the video recorded inside Barus and Holley showing students fleeing. “As we interview witnesses, we don’t want them to learn facts from these press conferences. We’re being careful about the facts that we are sharing for that reason.”
The collaboration of nine federal agencies and state and local investigators appears somewhat disjointed, with the FBI releasing videos and images separately from Providence police on Tuesday. Yet officials presented a united front, stressing teamwork and partnership, including with Brown University.
University officials faced more questions from reporters Wednesday about the lack of camera footage in the part of the academic building where the shooting took place at the end of a review session for an economics final. University Provost Francis Doyle in response said that all evidence had been turned over to law enforcement, while noting that it would be “counterproductive” to reveal the locations of the university’s 1,200 camera security system.
The vacuum of information and images has left the capital city on edge and fueled speculation and misinformation on social media. Brown in a statement Tuesday night warned about harmful doxxing activity toward at least one member of the university.
“Accusations, speculation and conspiracies we’re seeing on social media and in some news reports are irresponsible, harmful, and in some cases dangerous for the safety of individuals in our community” the university said. “It is not unusual as a safety measure to take steps to protect an individual’s safety when this kind of activity happens, including in regard to their online presence.
Mayor Brett Smiley cautioned against AI-generated images being circulated online. Officials have created an online repository of verified photos and videos of the suspect, the second person, and the map area, available on the city website.
No additional updates are expected until Thursday when another briefing is scheduled for 4 p.m., Smiley said.



Patient update 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said that another student was discharged earlier Wednesday from Rhode Island Hospital, leaving six still hospitalized. One student was upgraded from critical condition to critical but stable, hospital spokesperson Kelly Brennan confirmed. The other five are listed in stable condition.
“The parents that I spoke with today all reported that their kids are improving so this is a happy announcement,” Smiley said.
Officials have not released the names of the injured students, but one of the hospitalized students is named as the beneficiary of a GoFundMe fundraiser created two days ago and verified by the online platform’s Trust & Safety team on Wednesday. Over $66,000 had been raised to support the recovery of Jacob Spears, 18, of Evans, Georgia.
Spears, a graduate of Evans High School and the only student from his class to attend an Ivy League school, said in an interview with CBS News that he had been shot in the back but managed to run out of the classroom. He said his grandfather was at the hospital with him. Spears told CBS that the study session he had attended in the Barus and Holley engineering building had ended and that students were standing up to leave when the shooting started. 
GoFundMe created a centralized hub housing all verified GoFundMe fundraisers related to the shooting.

Jim Pillen with Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz on Dec 17, 2025, in Lincoln. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska stepped Wednesday toward becoming the first state in the country to start its implementation of new federal work requirements for Medicaid health insurance recipients beginning May 1 of the new year. 
Gov. Jim Pillen, joined on Zoom by Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz and in person by state health officials, rolled out the state’s plans for the new federal requirement as a “hand up and not a hand out.” 
“We’re not here to take everybody to the curb … [but] making sure we get every able-bodied Nebraskan to be part of our community,” Pillen said.
State health officials said the new requirements apply to work-eligible adults in the Medicaid expansion population aged 19 to 64. Those Medicaid recipients will be required to work at least 80 hours a month or be enrolled in school at least half-time to receive or keep health coverage. 
Steve Corsi, Director of Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human services, said people will begin receive notice of the new requirements by Jan. 1, and the agency is working on details on how it will track work status.
Nebraska voters opted into Medicaid expansion in 2018, and the expansion was implemented in 2020. Thus far, 40 states and Washington, D.C., have opted into the expansion allowed under former President Barack Obama’s 2010 overhaul of health insurance, the Affordable Care Act.
The new work requirements come from Trump’s tax and spending bill that passed Congress this year, the bill President Donald Trump calls “big and beautiful.” New requirements for Medicaid and other social safety net programs are meant to offset the cost of Trump’s domestic agenda, which includes increased spending on immigration enforcement, funding for the “Golden Dome” missile defense program, cementing tax cuts that primarily benefit high earners and adding temporary tax breaks for workers earning less.

Some Congressional Republicans have said the requirements would eliminate what they describe as “waste, fraud and abuse” in the system by requiring more verification of people’s eligibility for the benefits. 
Nebraska health care advocates who opposed the work requirements called it a mistake for the state to implement the changes first. Nebraska Appleseed Health Care Access Program Director Sarah Maresh said, “thousands of people who are eligible for the program [will] unnecessarily lose coverage.” 
“We know a vast majority of Nebraskans subject to these requirements work or meet an exemption to work requirements, but rushing to implement work requirements will cause them to lose coverage anyway,” Maresh said. 
When asked how many people are expected to lose Medicaid due to the new work requirement, Pillen said the state expects about 30,000 people to be “lifted up” or moved onto work-related health insurance and off of the federal and state Medicaid program. 
The governor also said it wouldn’t cost the state more to monitor and enforce the requirements. Pillen and Dr. Oz framed the requirements as a way to “prevent generational poverty in Nebraska.” 
Edison McDonald, executive director of National Disability Action, an advocacy and policy group based in Hickman, said, “Nebraska’s Medicaid system is not prepared,” and any claim that the changes will be implemented smoothly is “not credible.” 
“Nebraska should fix access and capacity problems before layering on policies that will push vulnerable people off care,” McDonald said. 
About 360,000 Nebraskans were enrolled in Medicaid by the end of 2024. Half were children, and 16% were blind, disabled or elderly, according to the 2024 Annual Medicaid Report.

,DC,2025-12-17 22:56:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House members tussle over Trump moves to restrict temporary status for immigrants,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-members-tussle-over-trump-moves-restrict-temporary-status-immigrants,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on a Judiciary Committee panel during a Wednesday hearing defended the Trump administration’s move to end temporary protections for immigrants who hail from countries deemed too dangerous to return. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California, the chair of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, slammed former President Joe Biden for “abusing” Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and other humanitarian programs. The federal government grants TPS when a national’s home country is too dangerous to return to, such as after a major natural disaster, ongoing violence or political instability. The status allows immigrants to have legal status and work authorization for up to 18 months before needing to renew the status, which requires a background check. It is not a pathway to citizenship.  Under the Biden administration, the program expanded to include 1.2 million immigrants. Republicans largely opposed that expansion, and have noted that groups that gain TPS status are rarely removed from the program.“Along the way TPS became permanent protected status,” McClintock said.Since being confirmed by the Senate earlier this year, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has moved to end legal status for 1 million TPS recipients hailing from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela. The top Democrat on the panel, Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, said the move to end TPS for those 9 countries “will lead to people’s death.”  “When TPS is terminated, we are forcing people to return to real and imminent harm,” Jayapal said. “I’m sad to see us go down this path, but I can't say I'm surprised.”There are multiple lawsuits from immigration advocacy groups challenging the Trump administration’s termination of TPS.Union leader says crackdown harms workersDemocrats on the panel said reducing TPS was part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.Rep. Deborah Ross, Democrat of North Carolina, said construction sites in her area have been targets of immigration raids, even though workers on the sites have TPS.She asked the witness tapped by Democrats, Jimmy Williams, president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, about the effects of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown at construction sites.Williams said those TPS workers are leaving the industry and that immigration enforcement at construction sites can put workers in danger.“You can't work safely when you're worried about being targeted for removal,” he said. “The truth is people just won't show up to work.”Williams defended TPS as one of the few legal forms that immigrants have in order to have work authorization. He said that TPS falls short because it doesn’t give a pathway to citizenship and creates a limbo for recipients. “I believe that this body's inability to act over the course of the last 40 years on immigration reform is what has led us to this point,” Williams said of the current state of TPS.Call to narrow programOne of the witnesses invited by Republicans, James Rogers, senior counsel of the America First Legal Foundation, argued that TPS is too broad, and that entire countries should not be designated. Instead, the designation should be limited to a specific location that is affected, he said. America First Legal Foundation is a litigation organization founded by Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser who is the main architect of the president’s immigration crackdown. Missouri GOP Rep. Bob Onder asked Rogers how much vetting is conducted for immigrants in the TPS program. Rogers said it was “impossible” to vet TPS recipients. However, in order to be approved for the status, a background check must be completed and with each renewal, the individual with TPS has to be revetted. Another witness tapped by Republicans, Larry Celaschi, a councilman for the Borough of Charleroi, Pennsylvania, said in 2022 his town experienced an increased population of TPS recipients from Haiti and that the sudden population change strained local resources. “Our borough absorbed an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 migrants in a very short period of time,” he said, adding that the population was previously 4,000. Vetting questionedOver its four years, the Biden administration expanded TPS from roughly 400,000 recipients to over 1.2 million TPS people. Separately, the Biden administration used several humanitarian parole programs to grant temporary legal status for nearly 750,000 immigrants hailing from Afghanistan, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela and Ukraine. Republicans have long criticized the Biden administration’s expanded use of not only TPS, but other humanitarian programs to handle one of the largest influxes of migrants at the southern border in decades. Last month’s shooting near the White House that left one National Guard member dead and another wounded inflamed the debate because the suspect is an Afghan national who had been granted asylum. Since the shooting, GOP officials have increasingly made the accusation that immigrants who came to the U.S. under the Biden administration had little to no screening. Republicans on the panel, including Arizona’s Andy Biggs, argued immigrants admitted to the country under Biden were not vetted and allowed into the U.S. illegally, despite being given legal status.“It’s just B.S. to say ‘everybody’s fully vetted,’"" Biggs said. “We don’t know.”",,,,2025-12-17 17:58:54.525961

(Photo by Getty Images)Maryland joined 15 states and Washington, D.C., to sue the Trump administration for withholding billions in federal funds that are supposed to help states build out their electric vehicle infrastructure.
The suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court of Washington in Seattle, says the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration are sitting on funds that were approved by Congress in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law under former President Joe Biden (D).
It’s the second suit by essentially the same group of states, who sued in May over the administration’s refusal to release $5 billion in funding appropriated under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The court in June issued issued a preliminary injunction against the government’s attempts to hold that money.
The new suit targets two programs that the state say the federal departments have indefinitely put on hold wihtout providing a justification — the $1.8 billion Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program, which was supposed to be funded with 10% of the $5 billion in the NEVI program.
“The Trump administration has unlawfully frozen millions of dollars to build charging stations in communities and along travel corridors throughout Maryland. These projects provide an important source of employment and improve our air quality,” Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) said in a statement Wednesday. “We’re suing to unlock this funding and protect Maryland’s clean energy future.”
A representative with the Department of Transportation did not immediately respond for comment Wednesday.
The funding delays stem from an executive order President Donald Trump signed on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. The order, called “Unleashing American Energy,” sought to “eliminate the electric vehicle mandate.” It directed all agencies to “review their processes, policies, and programs for issuing grants, loans, contracts, or any other financial disbursements of such appropriated funds for consistency with the law,” according to the suit. “In short, the President directed agencies to withhold congressionally appropriated NEVI and CFI funds as a tool to terminate programs the President dislikes.”
Tuesday’s suit says Maryland was awarded $56 million to support the deployment of community and corridor charging for vehicles. Brown said those funds were to be used to install 91 new electric vehicle charging stations, repair 44 broken charging ports and build truck charging depots along the Interstate 81 and Interstate 78 freight corridors.
States signed on to the lawsuit filed in May and on Tuesday include Maryland, Washington, D.C., Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh said Wednesday he plans to introduce legislation allowing carbon sequestration pipelines and other utility infrastructure more ability to deviate from their state-approved route in an effort to address concerns about eminent domain.
Klimesh said at the Westside Conservative Club he knows “we’ve had some some issues and some disagreements up there” about how to tackle the issue of eminent domain, but said “I think this is the year we fix that.”
The use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects — namely, the Summit Carbon Solutions project — was one of the most high-profile issues during the 2025 legislative session. The Iowa Senate voted to send a bill to Gov. Kim Reynolds in May after a group of 12 GOP senators had signed a letter stating they would not vote on budget measures until the eminent domain proposal was debated. Reynolds vetoed the legislation in June, saying it “combines valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.
Klimesh on Wednesday pointed to a failed amendment proposed by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, as a path forward. Specifically, he highlighted a provision allowing companies to seek voluntary easements for their project outside of the IUC-approved corridor instead of using eminent domain.
“I think the fix is simply allowing that corridor to be widened, and allowing the utility companies or constructors of infrastructure to find willing landowners, that want to participate, that want to enter into those easement agreements,” Klimesh said. “So I’m working on a bill myself that I’ll introduce the first week that will widen that corridor to 10 miles on either side of the notice corridor.”
He said Iowa is “unique” compared to other states by not allowing utilities and companies more deviation from the corridor approved by the state. His proposal would address this issue, he said, allowing projects to move forward without putting Iowans’ property rights at risk.
“I think, at the end of the day, that allows me to exercise my property rights, by denying access to my property, it allows my neighbor to exercise their property rights by entering into a voluntary easement,” he said.

What was in the 2025 bill
The bill vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds was made up of multiple measures initially passed by the Iowa House, including changes to the definition of a common carrier, setting new requirements for the Iowa Utilities Commission and expanding who can intervene in IUC proceedings, as well as increasing insurance requirements to cover any damages to property and reimburse landowners for increases in premiums related to pipelines.

Another attendee at the event, Lori Stiles, alleged Senate Republican leadership chose to remove certain people from their committees and chair positions “who maybe are ones that didn’t vote the way you did on the eminent domain bill.”
“How does that make Iowa (look) like a republic?” Stiles said. “Because it kind of looks like an oligarchy, or at least a good old boys’ club at this point to me.”
Klimesh answered that “loyalty” played an important role in the Iowa Senate Republican caucus.
“I would say one of the, one of the foundational pillars of the success of the Iowa Senate Republicans has been loyalty,” Klimesh said. “Loyalty to the caucus, loyalty to each other. We made some tough decisions, we’ve moved to Iowa in a lot of great directions, and that required that loyalty. And when we don’t have that loyalty, makes all of our jobs that much more difficult.”
Much of the controversy that took place in the Senate due to the 2025 eminent domain bill came from intra-party conflicts, with all but one Democrat voting “yes” alongside 13 Republicans to reach the final 27-22 vote on the legislation.
One of the Republican senators who voted in support of last year’s legislation, Sen. Doug Campbell, R-Mason City, was not listed as serving on any committees in the 2026 legislative session, according to a Senate Republican release from earlier in December. Klimesh told reporters Wednesday said the questioner did not specify who they were referring to when commenting on committee and leadership assignments, saying again “loyalty” was his answer.

The fine was handed down by the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission in response to a complaint by the utility company Eversource, which accused Gillett and her staff of “stonewalling” the company’s request for records about the authority’s internal procedures and handling of cases involving regulated utilities.  
A hearing officer assigned to the dispute had previously recommended a $1,000 fine against Gillett, however that amount was increased to $2,500 on Wednesday after several commissioners raised concerns about state agencies failing to comply with the Freedom of Information Act.
Gillett, who resigned from her position in October, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
The dispute over the records request was part of a long-running feud between Gillett and Connecticut’s two largest utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating. Earlier this year, the companies filed a lawsuit accusing Gillett of circumventing her fellow commissioners and exerting unilateral control over the authority.
Shortly before that lawsuit was filed, Eversource filed a records request with PURA seeking copies of any directives circulated by Gillett or her staff, including any emails instructing her fellow commissioners to get permission from Gillett’s office before seeking assistance from other authority staffers. The request was handled directly by Scott Muska, PURA’s general counsel. 
While Muska released hundreds of documents in response to Eversource’s request, no emails regarding the alleged directive were among them. In their original complaint with the FOI Commission filed in December 2024, Eversource’s attorneys said that they had reason to believe such an email existed, but that PURA was deliberately withholding its release to cover up the fact that Gillett had issued the directive. 
PURA did eventually release copies of that email — which was written by Gillett’s chief of staff — to The Hartford Courant in September. Two days later, Gillett announced her resignation.
“This organization was rotten inside and the way they helped to hide it was by cheating through FOIA,” said Thomas Murphy, an attorney representing Eversource.
Assistant Attorney General James Zimmer, who represented PURA before the FOI Commission, argued unsuccessfully for the commissioners to reject the report by hearing officer Danielle McGee, which had concluded that Gillett was ultimately responsible for complying with the records request as leader of the authority. 
“There’s no evidence that she was involved beyond maybe tasking Scott Muska to directly handle the search,” Zimmer said. 
Zimmer also objected to the report’s mention of the release of emails to The Hartford Courant — which came after the FOI Commission’s hearing on the matter — as well as judicial findings that Gillett has set up an auto-delete function on her personal cell phone, which he argued was irrelevant to the case at hand.
While the commissioners debated excluding those references, they ultimately decided against doing so before voting unanimously to adopt the report and a $2,500 fine. One commissioner, Judy Ganswindt, said she also considered levying a fine against Muska before deciding not to press the matter.

The hearing will need to happen before Christmas Eve, according to a Wednesday order by Judge Nina Wang of the U.S. District Court of Colorado.
During the proceeding, the government must present evidence that Vizguerra “presents a flight risk or danger to the community, such that continued detention is justified,” Wang’s order said.

Vizguerra, who gained national attention when she took sanctuary in a Denver church to prevent deportation during the first Trump administration, was arrested in March outside her workplace.
She immediately filed a lawsuit against the federal government, claiming that her arrest and detention is unconstitutional retaliation for her protected speech immigration policy and the Trump administration. When she was arrested, an agent allegedly told her “We finally got you,” and a social media post from ICE announced the arrest of someone with a “high profile status.”
In September, her lawyers claimed her lengthy detention is illegal based on precedent. She has been held at the private GEO contract facility for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Wang wrote in her order that Vizguerra’s detention — which she determined was discretionary and not mandatory by the government because the 12-year old removal order in her case is so old — will end at some point, but it could be months or years from now because of her case. Vizguerra meets a majority of the standards courts are supposed to consider for an immigrant’s prolonged detention, including the length of time, likelihood of future detention, which party is delaying case progress and the conditions of the detention facility.
“Her continued detention requires a constitutionally adequate bond hearing before an immigration judge in order to comport with due process,” Wang wrote. “Moreover, the Court has already concluded that her detention presents exceptional circumstances with unique constitutional concerns, resembles criminal incarceration, and has become unreasonably prolonged.”
Wang also weighed in on the other pending issues in Vizguerra’s case. Though she declined to address the merits of her First Amendment claims until after the bond hearing, Wang appeared to agree that ICE targeted Vizguerra in her arrest and lengthy detention.
“Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez’s substantial First Amendment allegations, taken to their logical conclusion, suggest that ICE did not act as an impartial decisionmaker in determining that she was subject to continued detention under (statute)  and may have been motivated by a punitive purpose,” she wrote.
Vizguerra has lived in the United States since 1997, when she entered from Mexico without authorization. She received a reinstated removal order in 2013 but avoided deportation through sanctuary in churches and stays granted by the government until February 2024.
The government contends that the 2013 order is valid, but Vizguerra and her lawyers argue it is deficient because of a process error. Wang’s order declined to weigh in directly on Vizguerra’s claims regarding the validity of the removal order, ruling that they are the purview of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/17/brownfield-remediation-redevelopment-grants-ct/,CT awarded $28.2 million in grants to help clean up 16 contaminated properties in several municipalities across the state.,"Hundreds of blighted properties in Connecticut remain abandoned, unable to be used due to lingering pollution and contamination. As the properties languish, economic development officials have made rehabbing these sites a chief area of focus in recent years, announcing millions in funding to support redevelopment. 
That trend continued on Wednesday, as the state announced some $28.2 million in grants to help clean up 16 contaminated properties in several municipalities across the state. In all, the projects will help remediate more than 200 acres of land. 
“By cleaning up blighted and vacant properties, we can put this land back into productive use in smart ways that support the growth of businesses and new jobs, and also to build new housing, which is significantly needed,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a press release announcing the latest round of funding. “Through the remediation of these properties, we are creating new opportunities to revitalize neighborhoods and transform otherwise unusable lots into new spaces where businesses can thrive and residents can live.”
The municipalities targeted in the remediation include: Hartford, West Hartford, Killingly, Torrington, Watertown, Newtown, Bridgeport and Greenwich, among others. The grant money comes from the Department of Economic and Community Development’s Brownfield Remediation and Development Program. The state anticipates that the money will help “leverage more than $354 million in private investment” and support the creation of more than 800 housing units. 
“Our investments in these dormant, polluted sites are critical to helping communities capitalize on opportunities for reinvention,” DECD Commissioner Dan O’Keefe said in the release.  
Officials argue that the state’s ongoing remediation efforts will help create new economic opportunities in communities across Connecticut. And as the state deals with an ongoing affordable housing shortage, property remediation is being viewed as a key way to increase housing stock when more units are desperately needed.
Breathing new life into old properties
Brownfields, defined by the state as “an abandoned or underutilized site where redevelopment, reuse or expansion has not occurred due to the presence or potential presence of pollution” have been a significant area of focus in recent years. Connecticut has dedicated millions to cleaning up these properties, clearing the way for them to be redeveloped and reopened for new uses.  
Housing in particular has been a priority. The latest round of state grants will facilitate millions in redevelopment and remediation work supporting housing projects in areas like Shelton, Enfield, and Greenwich. 
In West Hartford, which is receiving the largest single award at $6 million, the money will be used to redevelop the former West Hartford UConn campus, using the roughly 34-acre property to construct “28 townhomes, 93 rental units, 87 assisted living units, and commercial spaces.” The plan for the property received zoning approval earlier this year. 
Speaking to a crowd gathered at the University of Saint Joseph in West Hartford on Wednesday morning, state officials emphasized that the state’s remediation efforts will help build off of other housing efforts, including last month’s passage of H.B. 8002, a controversial housing bill that supporters hope will enable the development of more affordable housing in the state. 
“This Brownfield program dovetails incredibly well with the new housing bill that has been passed,” said Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz. “We have said in that bill, communities, take a look see what derelict properties there are out there, and build housing. This is funding to make that happen.” 
Jim Rivers, executive director of the Northeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, agreed, noting that the brownfield support will help municipalities to start clearing sites and preparing them for future economic development projects. 
The grants, he said, “really start that process to give more certainty to developers, to bring forward that investment that you want from the private sector.” 
Helping long-awaited projects get started
The state grants will also help start projects that have long been wanted by local officials, finally giving them enough money to get off the ground. 
In Ashford and Willington, for example, $200,000 in new state grants will help local officials with an assessment of the Cadlerock property, a 340-acre mass that straddles the town lines. The property has been a source of frustration for years as local officials have tried to figure out how to remediate the site.
“Our goal is to return this property to productive use,” said Ashford First Selectwoman Cathryn Silver-Smith.  
The latest round of remediation grants arrives months after significant changes to how the state regulates the cleanup process. In the spring, state legislators approved an overhaul to the Transfer Act, the state’s framework for how to clean up contaminated sites. Next year the state will officially adopt “release-based cleanup regulations,” a framework intended to streamline the process of brownfield remediation, making it easier for properties to be rehabilitated and redeveloped for new use. 
Including the latest round of grants announced on Wednesday, the state has issued some $198 million in brownfield remediation grants, covering some 186 properties, according to DECD deputy commissioner Matthew Pugliese. The next round of  applications for the grant program will open in January.
As the remediation work continues, state leaders say the effort is having an impact that will ultimately boost the state’s economy. “We’ve done 2,400 acres of brownfields over the last seven years,”  Lamont said as the Wednesday event came to a close. “We’ve really liberated a lot of land that would otherwise just not be productive.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2777-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 17:58:54.525961

“Every time I see a picture or something, I'm like, holy — I can't believe it,” said senior Jack Worobel.

The University of Vermont men’s rugby team romped the University of Chicago last weekend, 71-5, to win its first-ever national championship. It’s the second time, notably, that a UVM sports team has won a national-level title in the past year.
Rugby is not a varsity sport at UVM — such as soccer or basketball — which means the school’s men’s and women’s teams play outside of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, or NCAA. The men’s team plays in National Collegiate Rugby’s Division II, which has more than 100 teams in different regional conferences across the country.
The team’s win Sunday capped an undefeated season that also saw it dispatch rivals in earlier rounds of the Division II tournament by double-digit margins.
“It really hasn’t even set in yet, still. Every time I see a picture or something, I’m like, holy — I can’t believe it,” said Jack Worobel, a senior mechanical engineering major at UVM who plays in the No. 4, or “lock,” position. “It’s awesome.”
In UVM’s rugby league, 15 players are on the field for each team at a time. Players advance the ball by running or kicking it but aren’t allowed to pass the ball forward. Points come primarily through “tries,” which are worth five points each and scored by bringing the ball into the opponent’s in-goal area and touching it to the ground.
Worobel credited UVM’s win to strong bonds that he said he and his teammates have built up over the past four years. A number of the players, including himself, have been on the team every year since they were first-year students, he said.
UVM has had a men’s rugby team since 1970, according to a school press release.

“We all do anything for each other. Anyone would do a favor for anyone else on this team — I think that’s where the win comes (from),” Worobel said Wednesday. “It’s not from the skill or the talents. Really, it’s what’s off the field.”
The rugby team’s win comes about a year after UVM’s men’s soccer team — which competes at the highest level of collegiate athletics — won the NCAA Division I championship last December. UVM has also won six NCAA championships in skiing, with the most recent coming in 2012.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and three Minnesota-based law firms sued federal immigration authorities Wednesday, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and their leaders are routinely violating the constitutional rights of the people protesting their actions.
The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE in recent weeks as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community, as part of a targeted operation ordered by the Trump administration. 
Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer. 
“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference Wednesday. 
The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.
The lawsuit argues that arresting or retaliating against people who are protesting ICE violates the First Amendment; that detaining protesters violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans from arrest without probable cause; and that immigration officials unlawfully conspired to violate protesters’ and observers’ rights.
Alicia Granse, staff attorney with the ACLU, said the legal team plans to request a temporary restraining order, which would require ICE to discontinue unlawful practices immediately.
The other five named plaintiffs are: 

Linden Hills residents John Biestman and Janet Lee, a married couple in their late 60s who followed an ICE vehicle after a Dec. 7 raid at Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Mary in Richfield. According to the complaint, ICE agents boxed in the couple’s car, pointed guns at them and threatened to arrest them. 
31-year-old Minneapolis resident Lucia Webb, who followed two ICE vehicles to the park-and-ride outside the Whipple Building on Dec. 3. Officers boxed her in, surrounded the car and threatened to arrest her, according to the lawsuit.
35-year-old Minneapolis resident Alan Crenshaw, who on Dec. 9 observed and filmed ICE arresting a U.S. citizen. According to the lawsuit, as officers were leaving, one agent leaned out of a car window to pepper spray Crenshaw. 
43-year-old Fridley resident Abdikadir Abdi Noor, a Somali-American citizen who was pulled over and later arrested by ICE outside of Karmel Mall in Minneapolis on Dec. 15. 

The complaint provides a thorough accounting of ICE’s retaliatory actions against observers and protesters, including some details that have not been previously reported. 
Agents appear to be using law enforcement databases to scan license plates and retrieve observers’ home addresses, the lawsuit alleges. In at least one case, as an observer followed an ICE vehicle, the officer drove directly to her home. 
“This threat and intimidation tactic is straight out of organized crime and has an obvious chilling effect on observers’ and protesters’ exercise of their First Amendment rights,” the lawsuit states.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NN251118_0137-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 17:58:54.525961

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is considering privatizing four of its behavioral health facilities.
The state agency issued a request for proposals on Friday, seeking providers to serve as certified behavioral health clinics in certain areas of the state, taking over from state-run facilities.
But there is some concern over the jobs of state employees who currently work at the state-run clinics and expanding the state’s behavioral health clinic model while struggling to fully fund what currently exists, one provider said. 
“The (request for proposal) is an initial fact-finding step to understand what options exist and whether a private operator could enhance technology, modernize facilities and support long-term workforce needs,” according to a news release. 
The request for proposal is focused on Oklahoma’s four state-run Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, or CCBHCs, in Lawton, McAlester, Norman and Fort Supply, according to an agency spokesperson. The award is for the right to operate a CCBHC in the specific area. 
CCBHCs are federally certified clinics that provide mental health and substance abuse treatment to all, regardless of ability to pay, and offer 24/7 crisis response and care, according to the Mental Health Department. 
“ODMHSAS is exploring whether partnering with a private provider on the department’s CCBHCs could improve technology, expand workforce capacity, and provide more consistent service delivery statewide. No decisions have been made,” said Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson for the Mental Health Department, in a statement.
The request for proposal also includes Logan and Oklahoma counties, which are being “re-opened due to greater demand and population size” which will allow the state agency to  “expand services and meet the demand,” Chaverri said. 
The bidders that win the contracts “shall interview all willing incumbent staff during the designated overlap period and document all interview outcomes upon request,” according to the terms of the request for proposal. They are also required to use existing state-run facilities. 
Joy Sloan is the president of the Alliance of Mental Health Providers of Oklahoma, a coalition of eight certified community behavioral health centers throughout the state, and CEO of Green Country, a CCBHC in Muskogee. 
“They’re just trying to get the state-operated centers out of business and privatize those CCBHCs,” she said. 
Current certified behavioral health clinics will most likely bid to expand their service areas and take over the state-run facilities, she said.
Sloan said her concern is that the current CCBHC model already isn’t properly funded. She and other CCBHC leaders in May said the state has failed to pay for some services that have already been provided, with the total in the millions of dollars. 
Sloan said she can also see how current employees at the state-run CCBHCs could be concerned about job security if the state agency decides to privatize the facilities. 
The Mental Health Department will accept proposals through Jan. 17.
The state agency, amid financial distress this year, has been in the process of reviewing hundreds of contracts. Various reports, including from the State Auditor and Inspector and the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency, have found a pattern of overspending at the Mental Health Department. 
Officials previously said the number of contracts that have not been renewed or cancelled, or the total dollars saved from this process, would not be disclosed until the review was complete.

Trump administration attacks on offshore wind have frozen progress on a number of East Coast projects, including one near Ocean City that had all its permits in hand before the Interior Department started trying to pull them back. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal judge has declined to issue an injunction that would have protected US Wind from what it says are Trump administration attempts to kill its planned wind farm off Ocean City, for which it already has permits.
U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher in Baltimore noted in her decision — handed down Tuesday — that US Wind technically could move forward with constructing its wind farm off of Delmarva.
Even though President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has announced its intention to reevaluate the crucial Construction and Operations Plan (COP) approval issued to US Wind during the waning days of President Joe Biden’s (D) administration, it has not actually revoked the permit, Gallagher wrote in her ruling.
In a previous decision, Gallagher preliminarily rejected a request from the Trump administration to remand the permit back to the U.S. Department of the Interior for reconsideration. Gallagher ruled that the government needed to present more information in order for her to make a ruling. But she allowed the department to carry on with any “internal review” of the permit, as desired.
During a hearing in Baltimore last week, US Wind officials stated that they had paused work on an important — and costly — facility design report, because of the Trump administration’s pronouncements about revoking the permit. They have argued that the loss of the permit poses an existential threat to the project — and possibly to the entire company.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a prepared statement, US Wind Vice President of External Affairs Nancy Sopko said Wednesday that the company “remains confident in the validity of all permits issued for our project, and we will continue to vigorously defend them in court.”
Gallagher called the company’s decision to press pause on the project understandable, but argued that US Wind made that choice on its own — not because it would face legal liability if it proceeded.
“No law would impose civil or criminal liability on US Wind if it continued to develop the project,” Gallagher wrote. “It simply has made a business decision not to do so in light of the political headwinds it perceives.”
Gallagher ruled that the government has not issued a final decision about the COP. So, she could not grant an injunction to US Wind, stopping the government from taking the action.
US Wind must “wait to see” whether the Interior Department “makes some decision that has some legal consequence,” Gallagher wrote. At that time, she wrote, US Wind could challenge that decision in court.
In court, US Wind’s attorneys pointed to the government’s court filings, arguing that the agency has made its intentions clear.
In particular, they highlighted a declaration from Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Interior Department. Suess stated that the Biden administration’s approval of the permit “was not properly informed by a complete understanding of the impacts from the project.” The federal government has specifically cited the project’s potential impacts to commercial fisheries and search and rescue operations in the region.
But Gallagher said even though Suess’s declaration “suggests that the analysis underlying the COP approval was flawed,” it doesn’t come to a final determination.
“Rather, it states an intent to further examine that question,” Gallagher wrote.
“US Wind has understandably inferred from the Suess Declaration (and the multitude of indications from this Administration of its hostility to wind energy projects generally) that BOEM has already decided that it will revoke the COP,” Gallagher wrote. “But no such decision has yet been made final.”

(Diana Cervantes for Source NM)The New Mexico Environment Department and Office of the State Engineer on Wednesday announced nearly $26 million in grant funding for seven projects across the state to research and implement treatment of brackish water.
Brackish water is often found deep underground and is too salty to drink or to water many crops. New Mexico is estimated to have more than 1 trillion gallons of water underground, according to the state environment department. In early 2024, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham unveiled a 50-year water action plan amid projections that the state’s water supplies will decrease by as much as 25% in the coming decades.
State officials said the nearly $26 million in grants aligns with the governor’s plans. The grants will fund projects in New Mexico’s largest cities and some of its smallest communities and will focus on developing the technology to introduce new water supplies into the state’s portfolio as well as growing local economies.
“New Mexico doesn’t have to choose between water security and economic growth,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. 
The grants announced Wednesday are:

$11.7 million for the village of Cuba for a “first-of-its-kind zero-waste desalination facility” expected to generate 518,000 gallons of drinkable water per day. Desalination refers to a treatment process that removes salty brine from brackish water — state leaders said officials at the cuba plant plan to use that brine in fertilizer as a way to generate revenue for the tiny community
$6 million for the Pueblo of Laguna  for a feasibility study on brackish water resources
$3 million for the Arrowhead Center at New Mexico State University for a “Brine Valorization Accelerator Hub” that will extract valuable materials, such as lithium, from brine waste and explore ways to sell those materials 
$1.83 million for the Alamo Navajo School Board in Socorro County for a small-scale brackish water treatment plant
$1.58 million for the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology for “advanced membrane research” to reduce brine waste
$1.41 million for the city of Anthony=for an environmental analysis and testing for a brackish water pilot program that will offer recommendations for statewide brackish water treatment
$400,000 for the University of New Mexico for a statewide evaluation of economic and environmental tradeoffs for using brackish water

Jonas Armstrong, director of NMED’s Water Protection Division, told Source NM that the grants mark an exciting step forward for New Mexico’s small and rural communities. Not only will they hopefully find innovative ways to bolster their local water supplies, he said, but they’ll explore how to bring in revenue by extracting valuable materials from brine that would otherwise go to waste.
“For us water people, we have an inverse perspective of folks in extractive industries who think ‘Oh, I can get this lithium out and the water’s the byproduct,’” Armstrong said. “We’re excited because we’re getting clean water, and lithium is the byproduct.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Release-21-Edited-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 17:58:54.525961

Moore, who has served since 2019 as MO HealthNet’s pharmacy director, succeeds Todd Richardson, the former Missouri House speaker who resigned from his role in October after seven years in the job.
Moore’s appointment comes as MO HealthNet and the state’s social services department prepare to implement Medicaid eligibility changes passed by Congress in July as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill. Work requirements and twice-yearly eligibility recertifications beginning in 2027 could cause 130,000 of the 1.25 million Missourians currently on Medicaid to lose coverage, according to one Princeton University estimate.
Gov. Mike Kehoe and Jess Bax, director of the department, praised Moore’s experience in the press release and emphasized a need for MO HealthNet’s sustainability.

“With his experience and proven leadership,” Kehoe said, “we are confident he will strengthen access, improve outcomes and ensure the program’s long-term sustainability.”
Bax said Moore’s policy expertise and “leadership across state and federal partners” will “strengthen healthcare access statewide while better serving our most vulnerable populations.”
The new federal requirements are expected to come with over $900 billion in cuts to Medicaid nationwide over the next decade. Missouri could lose 14% of its federal Medicaid funding, somewhere between $11 and $18 billion over 10 years, according to KFF.
As pharmacy director, Moore’s responsibilities included developing policies for drug reimbursement and criteria for doctors to approve medications for prior authorization. 
Moore’s tenure as pharmacy director has seen state efforts to provide alternatives to opioids in pain management, the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of GLP-1 therapies in obesity care. In October, Moore presented at the annual meeting of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Nexus on the potential for GLP-1s to reduce heart attacks, surgeries and emergency room visits in the long term. 
He has also served on Missouri’s Psychotropic Medication Advisory Committee, which advises the department on the use of these medications for youth in foster care.
Moore said he is “honored to serve Missouri in this role.”
“I look forward to working with our dedicated team, partners and stakeholders,” he said, “to strengthen access to care, ensure fiscal stewardship and improve health outcomes for Missourians who rely on the state’s Medicaid program.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stethoscope-chart-e1760996942664-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 17:58:54.525961

“I brought this case because they came in this jurisdiction and broke the law,” Willis said. “And they didn’t only break the law here, they broke it in other places.”
The case, which Willis brought in 2023, included a number of alleged acts in furtherance of a conspiracy, including a plot to send false electoral votes to Washington claiming Trump had won in Georgia in 2020 when he lost, the breach of elections systems in Coffee County and an intimidation campaign designed to pressure Ruby Freeman, a Fulton County election worker, to falsely claim she had witnessed election tampering.
“How dare somebody threaten them?” Willis said to members of the Senate Special Committee on Investigations. “And how dare you all not take that to be important? Is it not important because it was an older, Black female? It ought to be important to everybody. That’s who you all are here to protect, those that cannot protect themselves, and I’m willing to stand on the line, so y’all can keep threatening me, keep bringing me into the committees, keep auditing me, and I’m going to keep doing my job with excellence.”
Willis was removed from the historic case in 2024 amid allegations of a conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired for the case. A Fulton County judge officially dismissed the case last month after a special prosecutor said trying Trump while he was president was unlikely to happen and pursuing charges against the other defendants was not in the county’s interest.
The case could leave Fulton County taxpayers on the hook for millions in attorney’s fees and other litigation costs.

During Wednesday’s hearing, Cumming Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal attempted to press Willis for answers on Wade’s professional experience, compensation and a trip that records show he made to Washington in April 2022.
“We know that there was coordination between Mr. Wade, a representative of the DA’s office and the White House,” Dolezal told reporters after the hearing. “We know that they communicated both in person and via telephone communication. We know they had an eight hour phone call with the White House on the very same day that (former U.S. Attorney General) Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith the special prosecutor. We don’t know why.”
Dolezal is vice chair of the committee but presided over the hearing because Chairman Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican, was recovering from a medical procedure.
In many cases during the three hours of testimony, Willis said she did not remember many of the details Dolezal asked her about in his questioning.
Dolezal also sought to produce evidence that Willis had planned to indict Trump before she took office in early 2021.
A combative Willis said she didn’t begin looking into prosecuting the then-former president until evidence he had committed crimes came to light in the form of the phone call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump instructed him to “find” enough missing votes to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia in Trump’s favor.
“That’s really an ignorant question,” Willis said. “And if you understand what the word ignorant means, it means the lack of knowledge. If you recall the facts, I was already district attorney when this all came to light, so it’s factually impossible.”
Former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes speaks to reporters. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Speaking after the meeting, Willis’ attorney, former Democratic Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, called the hearing and the investigation into Willis a partisan witch hunt. Most of the GOP members of the committee – including Dolezal – are running for higher office next year, and Barnes pointed to political advertisements on their behalf touting their commitment to go after Willis.
“It’s very apparent that all of what they’re trying to do is raise money, you know, ‘(I) hit on Fani, and send me $100 because I’ll hit on her again,’ and I can run for statewide office on some type of un-supported conspiracy theory that a bunch of folks got together (and overthrew) the election in Georgia,” Barnes said to reporters after the hearing.
Dolezal rejected Barnes’ and Willis’ characterization and called the initial investigation into Trump and the other defendants the real witch hunt.
The hearing was long-awaited. Willis had resisted previous attempts to appear before the committee.

Dolezal said the committee will consider a number of factors that could guide recommendations for crafting legislation, including the use of state funds, open records laws and the composition of grand juries in Georgia. Lawmakers will return to Atlanta for the 2026 legislative session in January.
“We will come back,” he said. “Chairman Cowsert obviously will take everything under advisement.”
“There’s a lot to unpack here,” he added.

Using one-time money to limit property tax increases has become common in Montpelier, but property taxes have still risen more than 40% on average over the last five years.

Gov. Phil Scott’s administration wants to use $75 million to dampen next year’s projected 12% average property tax increase.
The funds — unused and rolled over from this year’s state budget — could cut the average projected spike by more than a third. 
“We have a large education funding challenge, which is the governor’s top priority this year,” Adam Greshin, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Finance and Management, told lawmakers in the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday.

Buying down property taxes — which pay for public education in Vermont — has become the norm in Montpelier in recent years. Just last year, lawmakers and Gov. Scott allocated more than $100 million to keep the average property tax bill nearly flat. Even with the annual cash injections, average education property taxes have risen more than 40% across the state in the last five years, according to the Vermont Tax Department
Critics of spending one-time money warn the practice only delays confronting the problems at hand, like the ever-growing costs of education and health insurance, preventing structural changes.  
About half of next year’s projected 12% average property tax increase comes from an expected jump in school spending, though districts are still in the process of formulating their budgets for the 2026-27 school year. 
The other half of the looming spike is the result of last year’s buydown — the use of one-time money that leaves the state in a relative fiscal hole this year. 
At his weekly press conference Wednesday, Scott called the $75 million proposal “just step one,” though he would not say specifically how his team might propose limiting property tax increases further. 
Scott’s proposal will require legislative approval. Lawmakers return to Montpelier in the beginning of January. 
How lawmakers will handle the expected property tax increase likely depends on the fate of Act 73, the law passed last year that sets in motion generational change to how education in Vermont is governed and funded. The biggest changes proposed in the legislation depend on lawmakers creating new, consolidated school districts this coming legislative session, a daunting task with an uncertain fate. 
Scott, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, and Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, all of whom supported Act 73, have said in recent weeks that lawmakers must follow through with the education reforms initiated by the new law. 
Whether they all agree on putting one-time money toward property taxes isn’t yet clear.
In a statement Wednesday, Krowinski said a property tax buydown “carries real risk.”
“I have deep concerns that without structural changes, we’re simply putting a Band-Aid on a much larger problem and setting ourselves up for greater pain down the road,” she added. “I am committed to finding ways to lower the tax burden for Vermonters this year, but I believe it must be a part of a broader, long-term strategy that helps provide our students with a quality education at a cost Vermonters can afford.”
Baruth declined to comment on the administration’s buydown plan, saying he hadn’t yet had time to review it.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Gov. Kevin Stitt has appointed a third leader of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services in as many months.
Stitt on Wednesday appointed Oklahoma Tax Commissioner Mark Wood to be the director of OMES, an agency that serves as the backbone of state government resources. Longtime Internal Revenue Service official Dan LaFortune will replace Wood at the state Tax Commission.
Oklahoma Chief Operating Officer David Ostrowe is no longer listed on the OMES website as one of the agency’s administrators, but he still holds his COO role in the governor’s Cabinet. Ostrowe was appointed to lead OMES on Sept. 26 when former state COO and OMES director Rick Rose resigned.
Ostrowe will continue as state COO, and Wood will report to him, OMES spokesperson Christa Helfrey said.

All state agencies, including OMES “roll into the state COO,” Ostrowe wrote in a message to Oklahoma Voice.
“Mark is an extremely capable leader with years of tax, finance and government process experience,” he wrote.
The governor’s appointment order issued Wednesday states Wood is stepping into Rose’s former director position, not replacing Ostrowe.
Wood had served as a tax commissioner since 2021. He worked 37 years in public accounting at Arthur Andersen LLP and Ernst & Young LLP.
“I’m thankful for the opportunity to have served with the dedicated team at the Oklahoma Tax Commission,” Wood said in a statement. “As I step into this role at OMES, I’m honored to continue serving Oklahoma by helping strengthen government at its core.”
LaFortune spent nearly 31 years at the IRS where he served as a program manager, team manager and internal revenue agent. He led large corporate and flow-through entity audits in Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Louisiana as the program manager within the IRS Large Business and International Division, according to the governor’s announcement.
“Recruiting top talent to the Oklahoma Tax Commission is essential to strengthening our state’s tax policy and driving meaningful reform,” Stitt said in a statement. “The appointment of Dan LaFortune brings proven public-sector expertise that will help guide the OTC’s work and ensure Oklahoma remains competitive, transparent, and accountable to taxpayers.”

StebbinsA federal judge has deemed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s move to revoke the Line 5 oil pipeline’s easement to operate within the Great Lakes unenforceable, determining that the move is barred by federal law.
Judge Robert Jonker of the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan’s Southern Division issued an order Wednesday siding with Canadian pipeline company Enbridge in their case against Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources.
In his opinion, Jonker pointed to the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, concurring with Enbridge’s assertion that the law preempts states from placing safety regulations on interstate pipelines. He also pointed to arguments from the government of the United States and Canada arguing that the state’s effort to shut down the pipeline violates a 1977 treaty between the two nations concerning the flow of oil and natural gas through pipelines across borders. 
Consequently, Jonker granted Enbridge’s request for summary judgment, barring the state from enforcing the order terminating the pipeline’s easement to operate in the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet. 
“Pipeline safety generally, and protection of the Straits of Mackinac, are critical interests to be sure,” Jonker wrote in his opinion. “But when it comes to Line 5, they are the responsibility of the United States and Michigan lacks the power to interfere.”
09917672711
Line 5 has long been a point of concern for tribal nations and environmental advocates within the Great Lakes, as Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel each pledged to shut down the pipeline as part of their 2018 campaign. 
The 645-mile-long pipeline, which runs from northwestern Wisconsin to Sarnia, Ontario includes a four-mile-long segment, where a set of dual pipelines operates on the lakebed of the Straits of Mackinac.
Opponents of the pipeline point to a 2010 incident, where Enbridge’s Line 6B ruptured, spilling hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo river. Enbridge has also reported gaps in the protective coating in the segment running through the straits. These segments have also been damaged by anchor strikes, prompting the state to declare the region a “No Anchor” zone.
In a statement to the Michigan Advance on Wednesday, Enbridge Spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company welcomes the ruling, arguing that state officials pursued a shutdown of the pipeline due to “unsupported” claims about its safety.
“Any dispute over its continued operation must be resolved through the 1977 Transit Treaty’s dispute resolution process, which Canada has already invoked,” Duffy said. “Today’s ruling makes clear that efforts by Michigan officials to permanently shut down Line 5 would interfere with U.S. foreign affairs – authority vested exclusively in the federal government.”

A spokesperson for Whitmer referred Michigan Advance to the Department of Attorney General, which is representing the governor and DNR Director Scott Bowen in the case.
Danny Wimmer, the attorney general’s press secretary, said they are consulting with the governor’s office and the DNR to review the opinion and determine their next steps, which could include an appeal of the ruling. 
“From our own preliminary review, it appears this opinion is wrongly decided on the law and an affront to Michigan’s sovereign interests in managing the use and occupation of its submerged lands,” Wimmer said. 
A separate case led by Nessel which aims to invalidate the pipeline’s easement remains pending in state court.
Attorneys for Whitmer and Bowen have also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh whether the state is immune from legal action in the case, after two previous courts determined the matter fell within exceptions to sovereign immunity.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DSC_0383-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 17:01:57.603254

What wasn’t immediately clear by the end of the inaugural meeting Wednesday was what exactly the General Assembly would — or could — do about it.
The state needs to find “equitable and fair ways to tax,” Rep. Jeff Zenger (R-Forsyth) said. Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) remarked that “we feel like we’re being taxed to death.” And Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Cabarrus) recalled a neighbor whose tax bill had recently doubled in one year.
Lawmakers have introduced a slew of bills this year adjusting and expanding already-established relief programs, focused on homeowners who are seniors or people with disabilities. But all of those measures have failed to pass both chambers and will have to wait until 2026.
The legislature’s power on the issue is limited — county governments set property tax rates, not the state — but multiple Republicans signaled Wednesday that they were interested in finding ways to slash regulations that some lawmakers say drive up costs of building and developing new homes. That includes compliance, zoning approval, building codes and other standards.
“I think if we address the regulatory cost in this industry and have an honest assessment … on what role we play, we get a double payoff on this,” said Campbell.
Property tax relief has become a priority for many conservatives and Republicans as lawmakers search for ways to drive down costs of living, while also stuck in a standoff between the House and Senate over whether to again lower the state’s income tax rate. 
Some Democrats, however, are wary of tax cuts — income or property — that they fear could leave state and local governments without funding for key services. 
“We might completely underfund the things that we find important,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake), a former county commissioner. “Our public schools … for my other-side colleagues, vouchers. I want us to be cognizant of the quality of life we’re building.”
One possible pain point for those seeking to lower property tax rates: the cost of law enforcement. 
The N.C. League of Municipalities, which represents the interests of cities and towns, hasn’t taken a stance on the legislature’s property tax discussions because of the lack of specific legislation. 
But the group has circulated materials showing that public safety makes up a significant chunk of local governments’ budgets — upwards of 40% — and that spending on public safety has kept pace or exceeded growth in those governments’ budgets.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Housing-condos-townhomes-ClaytonHenkel-1024x596.jpg,,,2025-12-17 17:01:57.603254

The commonwealth will soon have a new leader at the Pennsylvania State Police after Col. Christopher Paris leaves for a new position with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Paris’ last day as commissioner will be Jan. 2, 2026, marking the end of a 26-year career with the state police. He was nominated by Gov. Josh Shapiro on Jan. 19, 2023, and unanimously confirmed by the state Senate almost two months later.

“I would like to thank Gov. Shapiro for the confidence he placed in me to serve in this role during his Administration,” said Paris in a statement. “It has been an honor to lead the dedicated men and women of the Pennsylvania State Police, and I am proud of the work we’ve done together. Serving the people of Pennsylvania in this capacity has been one of the greatest privileges of my career.”
During Paris’ tenure, the agency received enough funding for 12 cadet classes, with 550 cadets graduating and joining the ranks of the state police. The latest state budget boosted the law enforcement agency’s $1.5 billion budget by $69.3 million, enough to fund three additional classes. 
An accompanying release reports, without citation, that violent crime decreased statewide by 12%, homicides fell by 34% and fatal gun violence went down by 42% while Paris was commissioner. There are 1,279 municipalities without police departments in the commonwealth that rely solely on troopers for their law enforcement needs.
“Col. Paris has served the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with the utmost integrity and distinction for 26 years, leading one of the largest police agencies in the nation while strengthening accountability and improving public trust. Col. Paris has overseen some of the most difficult investigations, cases, manhunts, and events — and his leadership has helped ensure the Pennsylvania State Police remains the finest law enforcement agency in the nation. I am grateful for his service,” said Shapiro.

The agency’s deputy commissioner of operations, Lt. Col. George Bivens will become acting commissioner on Dec. 31, 2025. 
“Lieutenant Colonel Bivens is a seasoned, respected leader with decades of experience who will step in and lead the State Police with steadiness and resolve, ensuring the agency does not miss a beat,” Shapiro said.
Bivens joined the state police in 1985, leading the 2014 manhunt for convicted murderer Eric Frein and overseeing the search for convicted murderer Danelo Cavalcante, who escaped from the Chester County jail in 2023.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
When state leaders debate remedies for homelessness in Vermont, the people most impacted by their decisions are not often in the room.
Enter: Morgan Brown. He voiced the needs of Vermonters experiencing housing insecurity, including himself. Surrounded by people paid to roam the Statehouse halls – lobbyists and journalists wearing suits and well-manicured haircuts – Brown became a fixture in the capitol in the 2000s, recalled former Times Argus and Rutland Herald reporter Daniel Barlow.

“There was Morgan, you know, showing up at the Statehouse every day while being homeless and advocating for people who often had less than he did,” said Barlow. 
Brown died in the early hours of Tuesday, Dec. 16, after a monthslong battle with colon cancer, according to friends and relatives. He was 70. 
Those who knew him well recounted a tireless advocate and prolific poet who preached compassion and empathy for Vermonters living on the margins.
“I think sometimes in the housing world we get very focused on the units,” said Rick DeAngelis, who worked at housing and homelessness organizations in central Vermont before retiring as director of Good Samaritan Haven last year. Brown understood the need to boost the supply of homes and shelter space, DeAngelis said, but he often shared another message.

“[Brown] reminded us again and again that it’s about the human connection between people, and people taking care of each other,” DeAngelis said.
Brown came to Vermont decades ago after spending his childhood in Massachusetts, he recalled in an interview with VTDigger this spring. It took him many years to find a stable place to land. Brown stayed for a time at Another Way, a Montpelier community center for unhoused Vermonters and psychiatric survivors, and cycled through a variety of living situations before moving into a subsidized apartment in the city about 15 years ago. 
His writing reflected his struggles with housing instability. In a 2006 poem entitled “homeless sneakers,” he wrote: “…those foul / footwear are in much / better shape, than the person / who will be barely / surviving inside them.” The remedy – for the shoes, and the person – would be “…an abode / of their own.”
Beyond advocating at the Statehouse or at City Hall, Brown made a point of bringing good cheer to his neighbors. He penned frequent – and frequently humorous – posts on Montpelier’s Front Porch Forum. Around Christmastime two years ago, he donned a Santa suit and visited local homeless encampments.
“He just wanted people to feel belonging that he did not feel while he was living outside,” said Brenda Siegel, director of End Homelessness Vermont and a friend of Brown’s.
Brown increasingly accepted care from others as his condition deteriorated this year. In the final post he made on his blog, Green Mountain Meandering Missives, about a month ago, Brown noted the many ways neighbors had come to his aid: friends delivered him donuts and eggs; others brought him compression socks to help with the swelling in his legs and feet. 
His beloved cat, Miss “Cleo” Cleopatra, was a constant source of comfort. He often referred to her as “Nurse Cleo.”

“When asked about his days, his family always received two pieces of news: What Cleo was up to, and what he was trying to do to make the community a better place,” wrote Justin Brown, Morgan’s son, in an email. 
Brown emphasized to his blog readers that he was at peace with his prognosis. During his final day in hospice care this week, Siegel read Brown many of his own poems. 
Brown is survived by his two children, Justin Brown and Alex Grey, his granddaughter Kirana, and his siblings, Alison Lawson and Jeff Hackett. His cat, Cleo, is currently at the Central Vermont Humane Society while Brown’s family and friends, along with shelter staff, attempt to find her an appropriate home, according to Justin.
Brown’s life will be honored as part of a broader vigil at the Statehouse for unhoused people who have died in the past year on Dec. 22 at 4:15 p.m. Friends and family are also planning a separate memorial but have not yet set a date.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The search committee for the next University of Louisiana at Lafayette president will conduct its work over just six weeks. 
Such a short timeline for a search is unusual, particularly for a research university like ULL, but has become commonplace in Louisiana higher education. The process to hire a new president at LSU, which has the same top research designation as ULL, took three months. 
Interim ULL President Ramesh Kolluru is expected to apply for the job and has strong local and political support for the position. 
The 21-person ULL presidential search committee features political figures and people with close ties to Gov. Jeff Landry. Only nine members get to cast a vote on the recommendation for the next president. They include the eight people on the UL System Board of Supervisors and UL Faculty Senate President Leah Orr. 
Among the non-voting members are Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein, state Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, and state Reps. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, and Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas.  
The other committee members serving in advisory roles are UL System President Rick Gallot, ULL Foundation board members Georges Antoun and Ryan Furby, ULL Staff Senate President Kimberly Billeaudeau, ULL alumnus and former NFL quarterback Jake Delhomme, Student Government President Onyeka Nwaezeapu, Acadian Ambulance executive Allyson Pharr and Lafayette physician Dr. Kip Schumacher. 
The committee will meet Jan. 14 and reconvene Feb. 19 to select semifinalists. On-campus interviews with the semifinalists will take place Feb. 23-24, after which finalists will be advanced to the Board of Supervisors, who will hire a president Feb. 27.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries the following day, Thanksgiving. U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, underwent surgery for critical injuries and remains hospitalized.Prosecutors charged the suspected shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was living in Washington state, with first-degree murder, among other charges. On the day of the shooting, the Trump administration filed an emergency motion to stay Cobb’s order that found Trump’s guard deployment to the district was illegal.Trump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after declaring a “crime emergency.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-17 17:01:57.603254
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-17 20:56:40+00:00,Mississippi Today,Auditor: Half of state education money should go toward raising teacher pay,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/17/state-auditor-teacher-pay-raise/,State Auditor Shad White says Mississippi teachers are paid less now than they were during the Great Recession. Teacher pay will likely be a hot topic during the 2026 legislative session.,"Mississippi teachers are among the lowest paid in the country. State Auditor Shad White wants state lawmakers to change that next year. 
In a report released Wednesday, White re-ups a request he made last year: The Mississippi Legislature should dedicate half of the state’s K-12 education budget to raising teacher salaries. 
Shad White discusses his family, career, and education at Sandersville City Hall on Feb. 6, 2025.
The report underscores that the low pay, an average of $53,704, is unsustainable — something Mississippi teachers have been stressing for years. The average teacher starting salary, $42,492 in Mississippi, is No. 40 in the nation, according to the National Education Association.
In 2022, state lawmakers passed the last meaningful teacher pay raise, an average annual increase of $5,140. But health insurance premium increases and inflation almost immediately started chipping away at the extra pay.
Even when adjusted for cost of living, Mississippi educators are the third-lowest paid in the country, nearly $9,000 less than the national average, according to the auditor’s report. And when their salaries are adjusted for inflation, White’s office says Mississippi teachers are paid less today than they were during the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009. 
White, who is weighing a run for governor, has no power over policy or appropriations as auditor. Still, last year he proposed requiring half of education spending go toward teacher salaries.
White has consistently focused on education spending since he took office in 2018, particularly taking aim at money spent on administration and outside of the classroom. By redirecting those funds to the classroom and mandating that 50% of the state’s K-12 budget goes toward teacher salaries, White’s office says the state could fund a teacher pay raise of at least $8,000. 
Teachers recently told Mississippi Today that they have to keep second jobs and cut corners financially to make ends meet. 
“I think all of us have the same attitude: We love our job but feel we are not making enough compared to other professional occupations,” Carrie Bartlett, a longtime teacher in Long Beach, said in a previous interview. 
And as the state’s public school system continues to bask in national recognition for its academic gains, teachers say they deserve better pay now more than ever. 
“Policymakers have touted the ‘Mississippi Miracle,’” said Kelly Riley, executive director of the Mississippi Professional Educators, in a previous interview. “I want to be clear: It wasn’t a miracle. It was the result of incredibly hard work by our educators and our students.
“If you want to use and tout the results of our students and educators … you should also want to recognize and support those educators with competitive, professional compensation.”
In a survey conducted by Riley’s organization, educators say low pay is driving thousands of vacant teaching positions throughout the state.Those vacancies have consequences on student learning, such as bigger classrooms and less individualized teaching. 
Experts have urged lawmakers in hearings over recent months to address state teacher shortages by raising their pay during the 2026 legislative session to attract quality teachers and incentivize them to stay.
House Speaker Jason White has indicated that education will be the headline issue of the legislative session that kicks off in January, and state leaders including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann say they’re interested in boosting teacher pay. 
However, it’s likely the House will include all of its education policy, including school choice measures, in an omnibus bill next session, which would entangle educator salary increases with controversial legislation that many public school teachers don’t support. A previous report from the auditor’s office this year similarly drew attention to substandard pay for assistant teachers, who are among the lowest paid professionals in Mississippi.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10104148/3X0A2500-2.jpg,,,2025-12-17 15:58:20.221548

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Rural parts of western and northeast Maine have had almost no economic gains since 2001, according to a new report looking at economic trends in the state.
Meanwhile, the Portland metropolitan area has seen steady and substantial growth for more than the past two decades, according to data compiled by the left-leaning Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Pointing to the way this trend has grown over several decades, the nonpartisan research and policy organization argues that the way the state and federal governments responded to recent economic downturns have driven that disparity. 
Between 2001 and 2023, the per-capita gross domestic product in the Portland area grew by nearly 40%. During that same period, growth in western and northeastern Maine remained essentially flat, the report says. 
The report compares the regional response to two major economic events in that time period: the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Many rural communities saw a slow recovery from the 2008 recession because of certain policy decisions made at the time, including cuts to public services. In contrast, the report found that stronger public investments by the state and federal governments after the pandemic helped stabilize and strengthen rural economies.
However, the report makes clear that the economic disparity between the rural and urban parts of the state did not have to happen, nor continue. 
Take, for example, unemployment rates throughout the state. In 2024, the Portland metro area had an average unemployment rate of 2.6%, compared to 4.5% in northeastern Maine. According to policy analyst James Myall, that difference could be improved if policies were put in place to lower the barriers rural Mainers face when finding work, such as limited child care, health challenges and seasonally limited opportunities. 
Beyond that, the report laid out a series of actions lawmakers could take to support economic opportunities statewide, including expanding access to child care and elder care to increase labor force participation and modernizing unemployment insurance for part-time and seasonal workers.

The increase of 46 cases in one week, including dozens more in South Carolina alone, raises concerns for holiday travelers.
Cases have now reached 803 in Texas, 182 in Arizona, 142 in South Carolina, 122 in Utah, and 100 in New Mexico this year.
South Carolina’s measles outbreak shows chilling effect of vaccine misinformation

West Texas has been the epicenter this year, but recently South Carolina has seen measles “spread quickly in unvaccinated households” in the Spartanburg County area, and 168 people were quarantined as of Dec. 16, according to the state health department.
The state urged employers to accommodate people with quarantine orders to help avoid more spread, warning that the disease is highly contagious for days before a person is aware of being sick.
Towns with low vaccination rates along the Arizona/Utah border also have seen recent outbreaks.
By July, national case numbers had already surpassed a 2019 outbreak, bringing this year’s caseload to the largest in 33 years. The last time there were more cases was 1992, when there were 2,126, according to the CDC report.
The continued outbreak, reflecting a worldwide increase in the disease but also a rise in vaccine hesitancy that has been encouraged at times by U.S. Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatens the hard-won measles eradication declared in 2000 for the United States.
The status has already been taken away from Canada, where the Pan American Health Organization found an outbreak lasting 12 months invalidated the “eradicated” status, and the United States faces an assessment next year. The CDC maintained in November that it was still possible to eliminate measles in the U.S. by ensuring every child has two doses of vaccine, but vaccination rates have been falling further away from the 95% minimum rate that limits spread.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Even as cases have risen this year, the CDC has communicated less about the highly contagious disease on social media, according to Johns Hopkins University research published this month.
The agency posted 10 times on social media this year between January and August, compared with an average of 46 times in the previous four years, according to the report, despite a rising number of cases.
Ruth Lynfield, Minnesota state epidemiologist, said vaccine hesitancy may not be the whole story of low vaccination rates, in a video interview published Dec. 16 by Contagion, an infectious disease news service. Minnesota has 26 measles cases this year, down from 70 last year.
“Overall, there is vaccine confidence. Ninety-two percent of our kids [nationally] are vaccinated against measles. However, in particular communities, that number can be quite low,” Lynfield said. “One of the reasons is not that people may be vaccine hesitant, but they have other priorities.”
Physicians can counteract some of the low rates by gaining trust and listening to concerns, she said, and also just by making things simpler with reminders and easy choices.
“One thing we can do is ensure that we can make it as simple and convenient as possible for parents and families to bring kids in to get vaccinated,” she said.

Troy Waymaster, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, is pressing House and Senate members to closely examine expenditures by state universities in the Kansas Board of Regents system for possible wasteful spending. In this image from 2024, Waymaster speaks during an appropriations committee meeting in Topeka. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Rep. Troy Waymaster says a preliminary review of state university spending in Kansas exposed a curious $99,000 expenditure for an economic development program in Colorado.
“Which I have to say is questionable,” said Waymaster, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. “We have a Main Street program in Kansas, so why aren’t these dollars being utilized in Kansas?”
A joint House and Senate budget committee Wednesday examined documentation on dozens of expenditures during fiscal year 2024 that were red-flagged as possible misappropriations. The roster included $37,485 for a Kansas State University subscription to Grammarly, $8,350 to Kansas Golf and Turf for a cart to provide tours of K-State’s aerospace campus, $40,000 spent by Pittsburg State University for consulting by former U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner, and billing by Wichita State University for limousine services.
Rep. Kristey Williams, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on Government Oversight, said she was puzzled by expenditures of $65,250 for a jazz performance and $40,000 for “Jesus Christ Superstar.” But it was a Wichita State line item connected to a tanning salon that left her perplexed enough to seek an explanation from Blake Flanders, president of the Kansas Board of Regents.
“This one just popped out — Caribbean Sun Tanning. Do you know what that is?” Williams said. “It has a description, but it’s not particularly helpful. Very curious.”
“Well, I would image it’s to tan,” Flanders replied. “It may have been some kind of vendor. I would just have to take a deeper dive.”
It’s possible the tanning salon was part of a four-week training program for small businesses that relied on federal funding originally allocated to the city of Wichita.
Flanders, who answered the Legislature’s request for details on expenditures with information provided by the six state universities, said the public higher education system was prepared to conduct a thorough analysis of past spending. The work so far by the Board of Regents stemmed from a spreadsheet of questionable spending generated by staff working for Rep. Blake Carpenter, R-Derby, and Waymaster.
Information on university spending during 2024-2025 released during the committee meeting at the Capitol wasn’t uniformly presented. While Emporia State University, Pittsburg State and K-State linked specific dollar amounts and background details to specific expenditures, there were no dollar figures in summaries shared by Fort Hays State University, the University of Kansas and Wichita State.
Waymaster said he expected multiple House committees to dig deeper into past expenditures by the universities during the 2026 session starting in January. He said the legislative oversight effort would venture into numerous state agencies, but the most poignant items uncovered so far had to do with the state universities.
“The main objective is to see whether or not these carry through from year to year,” Waymaster said. “Or, were these just one-time expenditures that happened to happen in 2024 and they’re done.”
Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, said the list of university expenditures drawing legislative scrutiny could have involved state tax dollars as well as federal appropriations, tuition and fees or endowment funds. She said some spending highlighted in the preliminary review of budget records was tied to routine operating costs, including electricity purchased from Evergy and telephone service from Verizon Wireless.
“It seems that some of these are mandatory expenses that are going to be incurred by the universities,” Pettey said. “I applaud your office and others for digging down into it, but … I’m not sure what we’re digging for.”
“What we’re digging for is just cost savings,” Waymaster said. “This money is already out the door. We really can’t pull it back.”
Williams said the Legislature’s objective went deeper: “The reason we’re going through these is to also look for waste, because most of these dollars are taxpayer dollars. That’s an accountability process that’s beneficial to all. As I go through here, there are so many questions.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PA020924-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-17 15:58:20.221548

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)CLEARWATER — GOP gubernatorial candidate Paul Renner is proud of his conservative record while serving in office and says Republican voters should compare it to Byron Donalds’ over the past nine years, “apples to apples.”
The former Florida House speaker is trailing Donalds significantly in early public opinion polls regarding the 2026 Republican gubernatorial primary, in part because President Donald Trump endorsed the U.S. representative from Naples in February.
Speaking at the Tampa Bay Trump Republican Club meeting at Mugs Sports Bar & Grill in Clearwater Tuesday night, Renner was asked directly by a member of the audience to provide evidence that voters should ignore Trump and support Renner in next August’s GOP primary election.
“You can compare my leadership experience to anyone in the race or thinking about getting into the race. Byron and I got in office at the same time,” he said. “He ran against me for speaker back in 2016 when he was in the state House. What has he done in the nine or 10 years he’s been in office? You can look at what I’ve done in the nine or 10 years that I’ve been in office. It’s an apples-to-apples comparison, and you can ask … at the end of the day, who do you trust more to handle whatever comes our way?”
Renner boasted earlier in the speech about his tenure as speaker between 2022 and 2024, particularly the robust package of bills passed during the 2023 legislative session on immigration, abortion, and unions, among other initiatives aggressively pushed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, fresh off his 19-point re-election victory and in advance of his subsequent run for president.
“We did all of this legislative reform and called it the most conservative and consequential two years we had in Florida history,” Renner said.
He added that his legislative record in Tallahassee should be compared to what Donalds has accomplished in his five years in Congress and went on to extoll his proposals as a candidate on affordability and property taxes — proposals he said aren’t being offered by any other candidate in the GOP race for governor.
Voting record
He also took aim at Donalds’ voting record in Congress.
“Our system is broken; people are too busy running for the next office or getting on TV and not solving the problems. And it’s one thing to talk about repealing Obamacare, or doing something on illegal immigration, but if you haven’t done it, how can you can come into this state, or if you haven’t shown up to take votes in Congress, how can you interview for a position of senior pastor when you don’t show up to church?” he asked.
Renner’s criticism of Donalds’ voting record echoes some of the comments made by DeSantis in February, when the governor said the congressman “just hasn’t been part of any of the victories that we’ve had here over the left over these last few years.”
When it comes to missed votes in Congress from the Florida delegation, Donalds has ranked fourth worst among the state’s 28 members, according to GovTrack.us.
In Donalds’ first term in Congress (2021-2023), he missed 3.2% of all votes, placing him 63rd among all members in the U.S. House. Former Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy was tops in Florida members of Congress in missed votes at 8.3%. Republicans Daniel Webster came second with 7.6% and Bill Posey third with 5.5% missed votes.
During Donalds’ second term (2023-2025), he missed 7.2% of all votes, placing him 47th among all members in the U.S. House. The Florida members of Congress with the highest percentage of missed votes in that term were led by Republican Anna Paulina Luna at 16% (Part of her absences were due to having problems before and after a pregnancy that led to her doctor prohibiting her from traveling), and Republicans Mike Waltz at 10.3% and Greg Steube at 10.2%.
Speaking of Luna, Renner referenced the Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep.’s discharge position to force a vote on congressional stock trading ban.
“Why is that so hard to do, and why don’t we have enough Republicans — including my opponent — who have not signed on to stop making money while you’re in office from inside information that only you are aware of, as a congressman?” he said.
“That is not okay, and so we’re going to make sure we put that to rest. We don’t have that, thankfully, in Tallahassee, but we cannot have people who care more about themselves coming in to lead our state. We need people that are putting other people first, put Florida first, and that’s what I’ll do when I’m governor.”
Donalds fires back
The Donalds campaign sent the Phoenix a statement when asked to respond to Renner’s comments.
“Byron Donalds is the only candidate who has voted with President Trump to provide record tax relief for families and seniors, shut down the border, deport criminal illegals, protect our national security, and Make America Great Again,” said Ryan Smith, chief strategist for the campaign. “Byron Donalds will be Florida’s next governor because he is the proven conservative fighter endorsed by President Trump. Anyone running against him is an anti-Trump RINO and will get crushed in the Republican primary.”
Talking about his stance on crime, the former Broward County prosecutor touted 2023 legislation that expanded the state’s death penalty to include suspects who rape children younger than 12 years old. That law will likely be challenged, as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that sentencing a defendant to death for any crime other than homicide or crimes against the state is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.
Regarding the death penalty, Renner noted that some of the individuals who have been executed this year in the state of Florida had been on death row for nearly four decades, which he said was unacceptable.
“I am sick and tired of seeing the family members grow old and die and never see justice,” he said.
“When I’m governor, we’re going to shorten that under Marsy’s law. That should be no more — and I hope less that this — but no more than five years for capital felonies and two years for non-capital felony. Make your case. Make your arguments. Stop playing games, and once that happens, we’re going to execute you as you should be. Don’t touch our kids. Don’t kill our men and women or you will be put to death in the state of Florida.”
(According to Marsy’s Law, all state-level appeals and collateral attacks on any judgment must be complete within two years of the date of appeal in non-capital cases and within five years from the date of appeal in capital cases, unless a court enters an order with specific findings as to why the court was unable to comply with this provision and the circumstances causing the delay).
Speaking about illegal immigration, Renner said immigration “should be like adopting into a family.”
Although immigration was controversial when Italians and Irish immigrated to America, they were able to assimilate into the country  because “they were Christian. They shared our western values,” Renner said.
Now, he asserted, there are “Islamists who refuse to assimilate and have no intention of assimilating. And what they want is to get to point of dominance and force us to assimilate to them.”
He went on to applaud Gov. DeSantis for his executive order last week declaring the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) “as the terrorist organizations that they are.”
CAIR-Florida filed a lawsuit in federal court against DeSantis Monday for issuing that executive order, claiming that it is unconstitutional.
Renner worked closely with DeSantis during his tenure as House speaker to enact their shared agenda during the 2023 and 2024 legislative sessions, and he travelled to frigid Iowa in January 2024 to campaign for the governor just ahead of the presidential caucus that year. Despite that support, DeSantis has been dismissive of his candidacy, saying in September, “I’m not supporting Paul Renner,” adding that it was “ill-advised” that he entered the race.
DeSantis has yet to back any Republican in the contest to succeed him next year.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-6-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 15:58:20.221548

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)FRANKFORT — Kentucky has received a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for voter registration data, including sensitive information such as driver’s license and Social Security numbers, but so far has supplied only publicly available information, says the state’s top election official.
In a recent interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams said the DOJ requested “the entirety of the voter file, including personal identifying information, driver’s license and social security number.”
Adams’ office “thought we had an obligation to respond,” he continued. After review, his office concluded that the DOJ would be entitled under the law to a voter information file that candidates often request to build information to contact voters before an election. The file includes information like party affiliation, street address, birth year and more. 
Adams said that his office did not give driver’s licenses or Social Security numbers to the DOJ. 
He added that his office and the DOJ have “been going back and forth a little bit on what the law says.” Adams said both election and privacy laws figure into the determination.
“We’ve not really figured out exactly where that line is of what all they’re entitled to,” Adams said. “What’s not in dispute is they’re entitled to the vast majority of information — people’s names, addresses, birthdays — and we’ve given them all of that.”

Many state officials “are in the same boat of trying to figure out what exactly they need to do their job and what our obligations are legally,” Adams added. 
“I certainly don’t want to create legal exposure for myself or my staff. I don’t want to break a data breach law,” Adams said. “I don’t want to break a privacy law. There are state laws or federal laws way beyond the elections that we’re trying to understand to make sure that we comply.”
Saying the requests are about ensuring election integrity, the Trump administration has issued similar requests to other states and later given the data to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
DOJ officials began asking states for voter information data earlier this year. The DOJ has since shared voter roll information with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to search for noncitizens. Homeland Security is building out a powerful citizenship verification program, and touting it as a way to ensure election integrity. 
The DOJ has sued at least 18 states so far seeking access to voter registration lists with sensitive personal information. 
A DOJ spokesperson told the Lantern that the department is entitled to access to the voter rolls in their entirety under federal laws, such as the National Voter Registration Act, Help America Vote Act, the Civil Rights Act, and more “to ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections.” The spokesperson added that the data from states would be “screened for ineligible voter entries.”
In a statement to the Lantern, Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the DOJ said the department’s civil rights division “has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.” 
 “Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Dhillon said. 
Joshua A. Douglas, an election law expert and University of Kentucky professor, told the Lantern in an email the DOJ’s request “is very rare” but the first Trump administration also attempted to collect sensitive data via the U.S. Census. 
“The key point for people to know here is that the federal government does not administer elections. The U.S. Constitution says that states determine the ‘times, places and manner’ of running federal elections, and that Congress can make or alter those rules,” Douglas said. “There is no provision that gives the president (or, by extension, the DOJ) any authority to determine election rules. Also, the states, not the DOJ, has the expertise in their voter rolls.” 
Douglas also countered the DOJ claim that the request for data is to make elections more secure.
“Elections are already very secure,” he said. “A DOJ request for state voter rolls will not make them any more secure.” 
Adams, who is currently servinghis second term as Kentucky’s secretary of state, has focused on election integrity and removing ineligible voters, such as those who are deceased, from the state’s voter registration list. 
While he thinks the issue will be litigated in other states, Adams was not sure if it would go to court in Kentucky. 
“I certainly don’t think that we’re targeted here. We’ve done a great job getting our rolls cleaned up,” Adams said. “I think we have the best story in America to tell about taking dirty rolls and getting them clean. But this is not being seen through a state-by-state prism. It’s a national thing.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/241105ElectionDay142-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 15:58:20.221548

(Photo: Screenshot) It’s unusual for the North Carolina Board of Elections to order a redo of an election. But Wednesday, they did it twice: once in a mayor’s race where one candidate now leads by a single vote, and again for a small Hertford County town where 7 of the 25 people who cast ballots weren’t eligible. 
The State Board of Elections ordered new elections in the races for Morehead City mayor and for Harrellsville mayor and town council in Hertford County. 
In the Morehead City mayor’s race, challenger Lee Stiles leads incumbent Jerry Jones by one vote. One of Jones’ lawyers, Christopher Stock, told the board that two men who planned to vote for the incumbent were improperly turned away when they should have been offered provisional ballots. 
“The fail-safe process we have in the state was not used,” he said. 
Another of Jones’ lawyers, Phil Thomas, requested the board permit those two voters to cast ballots now. 
“It addresses only the immediate harm,” Thomas said. “It restores the election result to what it would have been. It avoids rerunning the entire election.”
A new election would be an alternative option, Thomas said. 
But board members said the law won’t allow the two voters to cast ballots after the fact. 
“Poll workers were not correctly trained,” said Board member Siobhan Millen. “We don’t know how many people were turned away.”
Stiles asked the board to declare him the winner, but added “I don’t mind going out and beating Mr. Jones again.”
Stiles’ lawyer, Hart Miles, asked for a new election.
Board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV agreed that a new election is the proper solution. “We can’t simply offer two ballots to the people who presented themselves,” he said. 
Ordering new elections is rare, Eggers said. And the Morehead City mayor’s race is proof that every vote matters. “A single vote absolutely is important.”
In the Hertford County case, no one signed up to run for Harrellsville mayor, but voters could write in candidate names. 
Three people signed up to run for five seats on the Harrellsville town council. Voters could also write in names for those seats.
The Hertford County Board of Elections didn’t certify the Harrellsville results because of “irregularities affecting the integrity and accuracy of the election.”
All 25 people who voted did so in person on Election Day. They were not asked to sign “authorization to vote” forms, a Hertford elections board document says. Poll workers did not follow procedures for verifying voter eligibility, the document says, and only eighteen of the 25 people who voted in the Harrellsville elections were actually eligible. 
The State Board voted to rerun the entire election in March. 
“Hopefully, the precinct workers will know how to properly process voters and give them correct ballots,” Eggers said.

Another 15 races were decided by one vote, the organization said in a press release.

Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) speaks at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. Dec. 17, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan AdvanceMichigan House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) accused Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel of multiple ethics violations regarding alleged conflicts of interest in two cases that her office investigated — and suggested that impeachment proceedings could be considered for Nessel. 
“I would say that it certainly could be on the table for certain. We’re not gonna rule such a thing out,” DeBoyer said in a press conference Tuesday in reference to impeachment. 
DeBoyer claimed that Nessel’s “lack of participation” in committee hearings demonstrated a lack of transparency. 
However, in an emailed response to Michigan Advance, Nessel’s office refuted that assertion.
“The Department of Attorney General offered to make the relevant Division Chiefs, each experienced prosecutors with direct knowledge of the investigations in question, available to appear before the Committee,” the Department of Attorney General statement read. “The Committee declined to speak with these prosecutors, preferring instead to present conclusions from their own staff, based on their selective review of documents drawn from the complete production provided by our office earlier this year.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
There are two issues in question — one involving alleged insurance fraud by Traci Kornak, a lawyer and former treasurer of the Michigan Democratic Party who also served on Nessel’s transition team, and another involving alleged campaign finance violations by Bipartisan Solutions, a nonprofit organization that raised money for Fair & Equal Michigan, a ballot initiative for which Nessel’s wife volunteered. 
DeBoyer said in a press conference, “Based on the facts that we have, based on the information that we can provide to all of you, there’s definitely, at minimum been a clear ethics violation by Attorney General Dana Nessel, in fact, twice on two cases that specifically involve individuals that she has a close personal relationship with.”
“Through our committee hearings and meticulous reporting, it is clear that the Attorney General did not act appropriately within her role with these two issues,” he added in a press release after an Oversight Committee hearing on Tuesday on documents subpoenaed from the Attorney General’s office.
But Nessel’s office again denied any wrongdoing, stating that isolation walls — which prevent the Attorney General from influencing decisions in a case where there is a conflict of interest — were put up in both the Kornak investigation and in the Fair & Equal Michigan matter, which was a question of collecting online ballot petition signatures. In the Bipartisan Solutions investigation, which was a separate issue two years later, her office deemed it unnecessary to create an isolation wall, as neither Nessel nor her wife were associated with that group.
Staff attorneys, in the oversight hearing, presented a series of screenshots that appeared to suggest that Nessel may have broken the isolation walls. 
Michigan House Oversight Committee pursues subpoenas against multiple state departments

For example, email records from December 2022 show that Nessel was in contact with Kornak during the investigation into her alleged fraud. 
“The Attorney General never influenced these investigative or prosecutorial efforts over which isolation walls were in place and at no point did the Attorney General violate any standard of professional conduct prescribed for prosecutors or attorneys,” the statement from Nessel’s office said. “None of the selective communications exhibited during [Tuesday’s] committee meeting showed otherwise.”
Nessel’s office said “areas of confusion created by the committee” included conflating the closing of a file, which it termed “an administrative function of little consequence,” and the actual conclusion of an investigation. The statement also added that isolation walls do not prohibit individuals from communication, only that those communications must align with the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct. 
According to the documents presented to the Oversight Committee, the isolation walls excluded Nessel from accessing files and documents related to that particular matter and instructed staff not to discuss the matter in front of Nessel or take information from her on it. 
DeBoyer reiterated at the press conference that Nessel had been uncooperative with the committee. 
“They [the Attorney General’s office] followed up with an email that said, ‘Well, if it’s on the topics of Tracy Kornak matter, Bipartisan Solutions, Fair and Equal Michigan, she’s not going to come and testify because she has nothing to add to that discussion because she had nothing to do with those cases and had no involvement’,” he said. “Now I would argue, put a hard pause right there. That is an untrue statement. And that can be demonstrated by the evidence we presented today in committee.”
“What we saw from emails that were provided is that a conflict of interest was immediately established and should have been identified. It’s not an interpretation,” DeBoyer’s press release continued. 
“The Attorney General and the State agency under her leadership has been generously cooperative with the demands of the House Oversight Committee and refutes their contention that her conduct has been contemptuous,” Nessel’s office said. 
These allegations were announced one day before the House Judiciary Committee voted to pass three bills, including one authored by DeBoyer, that would limit the state Attorney General’s powers, especially in county-level circuit courts.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3565-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 14:58:12.751901

Jason Crow called for the public release of unedited video footage of a U.S. strike in September on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, saying he saw “no justification” for a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to boat wreckage.
“I believe this was an unlawful second strike,” Crow told reporters Wednesday after the U.S. House Armed Services Committee reviewed unedited footage of the strike. “I saw no justification for why a second strike needed to be taken, and I think it was a violation of the law.”
Crow and U.S. Rep. Jeff Crank, a Colorado Springs Republican, serve on the committee. After seeing the full video of the strike, Crank said in a statement he has “full faith that they were carried out in accordance with the law.”

A report by The Washington Post revealed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave verbal orders to kill everyone on the boat during the Sept. 2 operation. The U.S. Senate and House Armed Services committees opened inquiries into the legality of the strikes earlier this month, and some Democrats and legal experts have said the killings could constitute a war crime.
Crow, an Aurora Democrat who is an Army combat veteran, “vehemently” disagrees with the decision to launch a second strike. He said the remaining “obviously stranded” survivors “were not capable of threatening our service members.”
Crow said he’s seen “no rationale” why the Trump administration cannot release the video. He said it’s important for the public to see the video and “make their own determination.” 
“Much like the Epstein files, that I’ve been calling for the release for many, many months, why don’t we just release the video and people can see for themselves?” Crow said. “It really speaks volumes, which is why it’s important that the cover-up of this administration should stop.”
A group of Democrats in Congress with military and intelligence experience, including Crow, in November said in a video that members of the military and intelligence community can and must refuse illegal orders from the Trump administration. The Department of Defense is investigating U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly for his involvement, and the FBI has requested interviews with others in the video, including Crow.
President Donald Trump said in posts on Truth Social that their words were seditious and punishable by death. He also shared a post calling for them to be hanged.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire House Republicans failed to override a string of vetoes by Gov. Kelly Ayotte Wednesday, after a muted session that previewed disagreements within the party heading into 2026.
In vote after vote, the House fell short of the two-thirds requirement to override Ayotte’s vetoes. They failed to push through bills to allow separation of bathrooms by biological sex, ease the process of removing books from schools, and mandate the viewing of fetal development videos in school health classes. 
For Republicans, the day was a challenge from the beginning; holding just 55% of the seats in the House, they needed significant Democratic support to succeed in any one override. But the day also provided litmus tests for House Republicans at a time when President Donald Trump and national conservative advocates have taken forceful stances against transgender rights, and Ayotte, a Republican, has carved a more moderate path.
The fight is not over. Many of the hot-button bills, like those centered on school book removals  and gender bathroom separation, are returning in some form in 2026. And Republicans say the vetoes will not stop them from advocating for the legislation on the campaign trail next year. 
But for all the controversy tailing the legislation outside of the State House, little of it was evident on the House floor Wednesday. The chamber held debates on a handful of bills, but decided to plow through most of them without debate. 
The most extensive discussion surrounded transgender access to bathrooms. House Bill 148 would allow businesses and other entities to separate locker rooms, bathrooms, and sports teams by biological sex, and would allow similar separation in jails, juvenile detention centers, mental health hospitals, or “like facilities.” 
Rep. Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican, said the bill was intended to protect cisgender women and girls against potential sexual assault. 
There is no statistical evidence of that risk; a February UCLA study found no difference in safety and privacy violations in gender inclusive and gender non-inclusive bathrooms, while a Harvard review of survey data found transgender youth face a larger risk of sexual assault when required to use bathrooms that don’t correspond to their gender identity. 
Kofalt noted the bill does not mandate businesses and organizations to separate their facilities by biological sex, but argued the bill is necessary to give them legal cover if they want to. 
“Our current law is one-sided,” he said. “Our current law does nothing to accommodate the physical and psychological safety of women and girls.” 
Democrats argued the bill is “clearly meant to target the transgender population” and would allow businesses to interrogate customers over their biological sex, violating privacy. 
In a speech, Rep. Alice Wade, a Dover Democrat who is transgender, announced she would be reading a list of transgender people who were targeted and killed or died by suicide in the past year. Several Republican representatives groaned. 
After about four minutes of the list, two representatives attempted to prevent Wade from continuing. Deputy Speaker Steven Smith ruled against both attempts. “I know that I have stood at the well and said many things that people wished I wasn’t saying,” he said. “That doesn’t negate my right to say it.” The House later formally voted to allow Wade to continue. 
“If my words can’t get through to you, I hope their names stick with you every time these bills come up,” Wade said. “For transgender people, this damage is not theoretical. Our identities are not masks we can put on and take off. This is our lives.”
The House voted, 188-165, to override the veto, with 53.3% voting to do so, short of the required two-thirds. 
Another debated bill, House Bill 667 would have required public school health classes to include a video or animation of a fetus.  
The sponsor of that bill, Rep. John Sellers, a Bristol Republican, said in a speech that showing the development of a fetus would allow teenagers to make better health decisions later in life by avoiding substances like alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. 
“We all want to support women by empowering them with knowledge to enhance their reproductive decisions,” Sellers said. “That’s what this video would do.”
But Rep. Muriel Hall, a Bow Democrat, raised concerns that the video might not be scientifically accurate and that the video favored by Sellers had an anti-abortion bias. “That is not an appropriate role for the state to be mandating such requirements,” Hall said. 
The House failed to override Ayotte’s veto, 159-190. 
Some bills highlighted broader disagreement between Ayotte and conservatives over how to rein in local property taxes. 
House Bill 319 would have exempted school districts offering half-day kindergarten from the requirement to provide transportation for those kindergarteners. Rep Keith Ammon, a New Boston Republican, said the bill was designed to eliminate an “unfunded mandate” and give school districts more local control over transportation. In her veto message, Ayotte said the bill would “place an undue burden on working families.” The House voted, 182-173, to override the veto, winning just 51.3% of the vote. 
Republicans also attempted to override Ayotte’s veto of House Bill 475, which would have required that when towns adopt “default budgets” — budgets that exist as fallbacks when voters reject the select board’s preferred budget at town meeting — any positions that have sat vacant for one year will be automatically eliminated. 
Rep. Diane Pauer, a Brookline Republican, said the goal of the bill was “eliminating avoidable taxation.” But Democratic Rep. Jim Maggiore, of North Hampton, said the bill would put a “stranglehold on hiring” in towns because it would prevent police and fire departments from keeping positions open amid statewide workforce challenges. The override vote was 178-175. 
A couple of bills were less controversial Wednesday. The House voted, 347-1, to uphold Ayotte’s veto of House Bill 115, which would have created a continuing resolution to keep the state government funded back in June. And just 28 lawmakers voted to override the veto of House Bill 781, which would have created an alternative, less strict version of Ayotte’s preferred “bell-to-bell” public school cell phone ban, which passed in June. 
Meanwhile, the House sidestepped debate entirely over a number of bills. Without discussion, the body voted, 183-167, or 52.3%, to override the veto of House Bill 324, which would have public schools adopt a process to allow parents to remove books deemed obscene; 177-174 on House Bill 356, the bill to allow partisan school board elections; 176-175 on House Bill 358, the bill to simplify applications for religious exemptions to school vaccine requirements; 181-170, or 51.6%, on House Bill 446, the bill to require parents to opt-in to non academic surveys like the Youth Risk Behavior Survey; 150-201 on House Bill 613, which would have allowed towns to choose to not provide accessible voting machines in local elections if they were not requested by a voter at least 60 days before the election. 
As they emerged over the summer, Ayotte’s vetoes angered some in the conservative wing of the party. On Wednesday, Ammon said he understood the governor’s motives even if he didn’t agree.
“She’s a little more cautious than I would have been, but I understand that she’s more aware of her political calculations than I am,” he said.
Ammon said his conservative constituents have advocated action around allowing gender separated bathrooms, and said the issues would return to the Legislature no matter what. 
One bill filed for next year, Senate Bill 434, would require a formal complaint process about material deemed harmful to minors in public school; another, House Bill 1447, would allow businesses to separate bathrooms by biological sex and would require state entities to do so. 
“It’s a bit of a cultural battle happening,” Ammon said. “And I think the other side started it.” 
House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson, of Exeter, welcomed the votes Wednesday to sustain the vetoes, but similarly noted that the debates will return soon. “We’ll continue to fight for our values and our positions,” she said in an interview.
Still, Simpson predicted that the “culture war” issues would not be top of mind for voters in 2026. 
“We feel very strongly that Granite Staters are concerned about the cost of living,” she said. “And we will continue to work hard to lower costs for Granite Staters.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/New-Hampshire-House-Dec.-17-1024x639.jpg,,,2025-12-17 14:58:12.751901

The two complaints — one by three families against Connecticut Children’s and the other by seven families against Yale New Haven — were filed with Connecticut’s Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, the state entity that handles discrimination complaints.
The families allege that the hospitals violated Connecticut anti-discrimination laws by withholding medically necessary treatment to transgender patients, according to copies of the complaints obtained by The Connecticut Mirror. 
“The hospitals stopped providing care to these patients because they are transgender, while they continue to provide the same treatments to patients who are not,” Hannah Hussey, an attorney with GLAD Law who is representing the patients, said during an interview with CT Mirror.
GLAD Law has no affiliation with GLAAD, the nonprofit LGBTQ advocacy organization.
Monica Buchanan, a spokesperson for Connecticut Children’s, did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. 
Robert Hutchison, a spokesperson for Yale New Haven Health, said the decision to end medication treatment for transgender youth “was not made lightly.
“We worked closely with patients and their families to offer transitional support as the medication treatment component of the pediatric gender-affirming care program wound down, and our providers continue to provide mental health and other health care services to these patients in a compassionate care environment,” Hutchison stated in emailed comments.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration took aim at providers of pediatric gender-affirming care.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at withholding federal funding from institutions, including medical schools and hospitals, that provide gender-affirming care to kids. The directive also sought to restrict coverage of those services from federally-run insurance programs, like Medicaid. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order the following month.
In July, the Department of Justice issued more than 20 subpoenas to providers of youth gender-affirming care across the country in connection with investigations related to “healthcare fraud, false statements, and more.”
Despite the threats from the federal administration, as of July 2025, “no federal law or policy prohibited medical care for transgender minors” nor required the hospitals “to terminate medically necessary healthcare services for transgender patients,” according to the complaints. 
A ‘severe disruption’
The families in the complaints reported that the termination of medication treatment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy, caused severe disruption to critical medical care. 
One family who lost access to care at Connecticut Children’s had moved to Connecticut from another state primarily to secure ongoing treatment for their transgender daughter, according to a complaint. Another parent whose daughter was treated at Yale searched unsuccessfully for another in-state provider and ultimately had to drive nine hours for an out-of-state appointment. 
All individuals in the complaints are identified by pseudonyms to protect the privacy of children “who have been diagnosed with a stigmatized medical condition.”
At the same time, the complaints allege, the hospitals haven’t terminated puberty blockers and hormone therapy for children who are not transgender, but may need them to treat other diagnoses. 
In the complaints filed on Tuesday, the attorneys for the families allege that the hospitals’ termination of services violate Connecticut anti-discrimination laws, including legislation signed by Gov. Ned Lamont in 2025 that “prohibits licensed health care facilities from discriminating in the provision of health care services because of sex and gender identity or expression.”
In August, Attorney General William Tong filed a lawsuit along with officials from 16 other states against the Trump administration, accusing it of intimidating providers of youth gender-affirming care. At the time, Tong strongly criticized the hospitals for suspending medication treatment.
“I have expressed to them not just my disappointment, but the state’s profound disappointment, in their actions. And the state’s position is that the actions they have taken are wrong,” Tong said during a press conference at the time, though he added that the facilities are “between a rock and a hard place.”
In response to the August lawsuit, the Department of Justice has “filed a motion to dismiss, challenging the states’ standing, among other grounds,” Elizabeth Benton, a spokesperson for Tong’s office confirmed. The state’s opposition motion is due Dec. 22, and the DOJ will then have the opportunity to reply. 
Yale and Connecticut Children’s are not alone in their decision to end medication treatment. In the months following the Trump administration’s actions, a growing number of hospitals and hospital systems have stopped or restricted care.
But, Hussey, the GLAD Law attorney representing the complainants, said not all hospitals have made the same decision.
Boston Children’s Hospital, for example, received one of the subpoenas from the federal government issued to more than 20 providers of youth gender-affirming care, and challenged it in court. In September, a federal judge ruled in the hospital’s favor.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TRANS-CLINIC-0723-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 14:58:12.751901

The Minards were charged with multiple felonies in 2023 including conducting a criminal enterprise, for their role in allegedly misappropriating funds from three non-profit organizations and two political action committees tied to former Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield. 
According to a notice from the Michigan Department of Attorney General, Judge James Jamo of the 30th Circuit Court in Ingham County sentenced the Minards to a 6-month delayed sentence and 36 months of probation, alongside requirements to provide full restitution of funds they owe to the Michigan Department of Treasury.
Each defendant accepted a plea bargain with Robert Minard pleading guilty to one count of larceny by false pretenses – $20,000 or more but less than $50,000, as well as one count of filing a false tax return. The charges were related to the theft of funds from Working Together for a Better Michigan, a political action committee and the candidates that the committee was supposed to be assisting.
Anné Minard pled guilty to one count of embezzlement and one count of filing a false tax return. 
As a condition of their plea agreements, both Minards have agreed to offer truthful testimony in future hearings.
Chatfield, who alongside his wife Stephanie Chatfield, is facing charges of running a criminal enterprise and embezzling money from his nonprofit and organizing funds, is slated for trial next fall.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday rolled out his final two-year budget proposal before a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees, pitching a plan built on what he called Virginia’s strong fiscal footing while using the moment to cement his administration’s legacy as he prepares to leave office next month.
The $72 billion general fund proposal — part of a $212 billion total spending plan — covers the biennium running from July 1, 2026, through June 30, 2028. It includes pay raises for teachers, state employees and local public workers, tax relief for individuals and businesses, major increases in Medicaid spending, and a $50 million investment to overhaul Virginia’s child welfare system, one of Youngkin’s final policy priorities.
The proposal also marks the last major policy statement from a governor who is constitutionally barred from serving a second consecutive term and who leaves office Jan. 17, handing the reins to Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat who attended Wednesday’s presentation.
“Once again, we come together to discuss Virginia’s financial strength, and how to best be good stewards of the enormous resources,” Youngkin said, describing the budget as the culmination of four years of economic growth, tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. “My friends, we have done all of that, and so much more, together.”
Youngkin framed the proposal as both a reflection of his administration’s record and a bridge to the next one, emphasizing that revenue forecasts were intentionally conservative and designed to leave flexibility for Spanberger and lawmakers who will take office amid unified Democratic control of state government.
“This leaves a meaningful upside for the next administration,” Youngkin said.
The budget is built on a revenue forecast projecting 3.5% compounded annual growth — roughly 3% after accounting for tax policy changes — far below the average 8% annual growth Virginia experienced during Youngkin’s term.
The administration estimates that revenues continued to grow by 5.2% during the first five months of fiscal year 2025, producing another surplus even as some analysts had predicted economic fallout from federal policy changes.
“Despite the predictions for financial calamity … financial calamity has not happened,” Youngkin said.
Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings told committee members that recent revenue trends helped give the administration confidence in proposing a cautious but workable budget. 
“Through the first five months of 2025, we’ve had a strong performance, up 5.2%, year over year,” he said, noting that growth has been driven largely by individual income tax collections. 
Revenues so far are nearly $500 million higher than projected, he said, and payroll withholding — which he described as the best indicator of workforce health — is up 5.9% year to date. 
“Federal actions have not had the impact that everybody has been calling for for a year now,” Cummings added, pointing to the concentration of Virginia’s federal workforce in national defense, security and intelligence roles. 
 Pay raises and education funding

One of the largest line items in the proposal is roughly $1 billion for compensation actions, including for state employees, teachers, school support staff, sheriff’s deputies, state police and other state-supported local employees.
The plan calls for a 2% one-time bonus in the current fiscal year, followed by 2% salary increases in fiscal years 2027 and 2028.
Youngkin said the raises reflect an effort to stabilize Virginia’s workforce, particularly in education, where the administration has made recruitment and retention a central focus.
Teacher vacancies, Youngkin said, have declined by more than 35% during his term, an improvement he attributed to higher pay, licensing reforms and changes such as cellphone-free classrooms.
The budget includes an additional $544 million in general fund support for K-12 education over the next biennium, bringing total state investment to a record $22.8 billion.
Much of that increase is driven by the state’s biennial recalibration of its school funding formula, which updates staffing and cost assumptions. A senior administration official told reporters during a briefing Tuesday evening those mandatory adjustments, along with Medicaid growth, crowded out room for larger increases in other areas.
Youngkin pointed to improvements in student attendance as evidence that previous investments are paying off.
“Students are also doing better because they’re in school in the first place,” he said, referring back to the pandemic-era move to virtual learning that ended early in his term. “Virginia now leads the nation in reducing chronic absenteeism.”
The administration announced earlier this year that Virginia was recognized by Attendance Works for progress in reducing absenteeism, though there is no universally accepted national ranking of states on the issue.
The budget also redirects $137.6 million in unused Virginia Preschool Initiative funds to expand child care subsidies, creating an estimated 6,745 new slots annually for children from birth to age 5 in fiscal years 2027 and 2028.
For school construction, the proposal adds nearly $300 million in additional state support, bringing total authorized funding for the biennium to $519 million.
Higher education would receive a $434 million increase in general fund support over two years, totaling $7.8 billion. The proposal includes additional funding for financial aid and expanded health sciences programs, including nursing and medical education.
 Medicaid, SNAP and mandatory spending

The largest growth area in the budget is Medicaid, where costs are projected to rise sharply due to enrollment, utilization and health care inflation.
Youngkin’s proposal increases Medicaid funding by $2.6 billion over the biennium, bringing general fund support to $17 billion and total program funding to $59 billion. That represents a $10.7 billion increase compared with the budget adopted just two years ago.
“To address the rising cost of health care and secure the future sustainability of this critical program, we also introduce responsible cost controls,” Youngkin said, citing efforts to root out waste, fraud and abuse.
The budget also includes $3.6 million to reduce errors in the administration of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, with a goal of bringing Virginia’s error rate below 6%. The current rate is 11%, Youngkin noted, which is in line with the national average.
“I don’t believe Virginia is average in anything,” Youngkin said. “There is no reason why Virginia can’t get there as well.”
One notable exception to the budget’s overall spending constraints is a $50 million increase to fund a sweeping overhaul of Virginia’s child welfare system, a priority Youngkin has elevated during his final year in office.
The funding would raise base pay for Child Protective Services social workers, establish a centralized intake system and create statewide performance standards with enhanced oversight of local departments.
The initiative is aimed at addressing inconsistencies across local agencies and a system in which more than three-quarters of children assessed as high risk or very high risk do not receive in-home services.
 Tax relief, but no car tax plan

The governor’s proposal includes $730 million in tax relief, including provisions that conform state tax law more closely with federal rules. Those measures include making permanent the increased standard deduction and the refundability of the earned income tax credit, along with phased-in exemptions for tips, overtime pay and car loan interest.
“It’s their money, not the government’s,” Youngkin said. “There is no need for any new taxes.”
Notably absent from the plan is a proposal to eliminate the car tax, which Youngkin has previously called “the most hated tax” in America. Administration officials reportedly said the scale of mandatory spending obligations left little room for such a change.
The budget also proposes changing Virginia’s corporate tax sourcing rules from cost-of-performance to market-based sourcing, which would tax companies based on where their customers are located.
Youngkin’s plan includes nearly $2 billion in new capital authorizations and maintenance funding, using a mix of cash and debt. About $890 million would come from the general fund, with $1.1 billion in new debt issued under Virginia’s AAA bond rating.
The funding would allow the state to resume construction projects at public universities that were paused earlier this year amid concerns about federal policy uncertainty.
“Our AAA bond rating was reaffirmed,” Youngkin said, pointing to Virginia’s strong credit position.
 Warning to Democrats 

With Democrats set to control the governorship and both chambers of the General Assembly next year, Youngkin used his remarks to issue pointed warnings about policy changes he believes could undermine Virginia’s economic growth.
“My cautionary message is to stay with the program, and don’t pass anti-business legislation,” he said.
Youngkin urged lawmakers not to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing carbon emissions from power plants. Virginia withdrew from the program during his term after a legal and political fight, a move deemed unlawful by a Floyd County Circuit Court judge last year.
“RGGI only drives up utility bills and drives up the cost of living for Virginians,” Youngkin said, arguing that rejoining would impose millions of dollars in additional electricity costs.
He also warned against weakening Virginia’s right-to-work law, which prohibits requiring union membership as a condition of employment.
“Pro-business policies attract jobs,” he said. “Anti-business policies chase jobs and opportunities away.”
Spanberger, who will inherit Youngkin’s proposed budget, said in a statement following the governor’s presentation that Virginians expect leaders to focus on affordability, jobs and schools.
“The biennial budget is a critical opportunity to deliver on those priorities and position Virginia for success in the years to come,” Spanberger said. “As the next governor of Virginia, I look forward to working with the General Assembly to lower costs for Virginia families, invest in Virginia’s public schools, and protect access to critical healthcare services.”
Under Virginia’s budget process, the incoming legislature will amend Youngkin’s proposal during the session that begins Jan. 14. Spanberger will then sign the final budget, which is expected to differ substantially from the outgoing governor’s plan as Democrats reshape spending to reflect their priorities.
Even so, Youngkin said he believes he is leaving Virginia on solid financial ground.
“Our revenues are strong,” he said. “And Virginia is roaring — and she needs to stay that way.”

The Assembly of State Legislative Leaders, which includes more than 40 lawmakers from 30 states, unanimously approved a 449-word declaration on the importance of states’ ability to legislate independently. 
The document, released on Tuesday at the bipartisan group’s inaugural meeting in Columbus, Ohio, noted that the U.S. Constitution did not create the states, “but rather the states created the Constitution, ratifying a framework in which we would both govern collectively and independently.” 
Federalism is a foundational constitutional concept outlining the sharing of power between states and the federal government. 
The lawmakers’ declaration says federal agency rules, congressional legislation and executive orders must respect the constitutional division of powers and allow states to pass a diverse array of legislation.
The document says adherence to federalism is the key to “restore the balance between the federal government and state legislatures, ensure collaboration that respects state roles and limits unnecessary federal intrusion into state sovereignty.”
It opposes federal preemption of state laws except when “a direct conflict with the Constitution arises or the issue cannot be effectively addressed at the state level.” 
The newly formed group underscores growing tension between the federal government and states. 
Last week, for example, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to override state laws regulating artificial intelligence. State lawmakers of both parties said they will continue to file legislation on the issue and push back on the president’s effort. 
The National Conference of State Legislatures, which represents state legislatures and legislative staff across the country, helped organize the new group. NCSL in September wrote to federal leaders, citing bipartisan concern about recent federal actions that the group said attempted to undermine the authority of state governments. It opposed a Trump administration review of state laws believed to be overly burdensome for businesses.
This week in Ohio, state lawmakers discussed a variety of issues related to federalism, including Medicaid, education and land management, according to NCSL. Ohio Republican state House Speaker Matt Huffman was elected as presiding officer of the new assembly, with Hawaii Democratic state Senate President Ron Kouchi elected as recording secretary.
“We have accomplished the first of what I hope is a long list of future declarations from state legislative leaders,” Huffman said in a statement. “This meeting was a first of its kind, and I’m hopeful we will continue these conversations across the nation.”
Kouchi characterized the meeting as “a good beginning.”
“I am pleased the top state legislative leaders from both parties were able to come together and have a candid, practical conversation about how we can better preserve and strengthen the role of the states within our constitutional framework,” he said in the statement.

(Courtesy of BorderPlex Digital Assets)Attorneys with the nonprofit New Mexico Environmental Law Center recently called upon state officials to give the public more time to weigh in on Project Jupiter, the massive data center campus slated for Doña Ana County.
Developers behind the project previously filed two applications for air quality permits with the New Mexico Environment Department which, if approved, would let them emit more greenhouse gases than Albuquerque and Las Cruces combined. The applications requested the ability to build natural gas generating stations with a combined 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM’s entire system.
Environmental advocates and critics said the permit applications were structured in a manner that would let the natural gas generating stations pollute “99.9%” of what’s legally allowed before triggering a state mandate that requires more arduous monitoring. 
Once officials at the New Mexico Environment Department determine that the applications are “administratively complete,” the clock for public participation begins. Members of the public have 30 days from that moment to write to the department to express interest in the permits and receive the department’s analysis of the applications.
Attorneys with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, which is currently suing elected members of the Doña Ana County Commission for allegedly voting on an incomplete application when they approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds for the project in September, demanded that the state environment department extend the clock and broadly distribute the materials in both English and Spanish.
The organization’s’s list of demands to NMED includes: 

Extending the 30-day comment period by another 30 days
Holding a public hearing no earlier than 90 days after NMED makes its analyses of the permits available to the public
Making the applications publicly accessible in English and SpanishHolding any public hearings in Santa Teresa

“Given the fact that the initial phases of Project Jupiter appear to have been intentionally rushed and shrouded in secrecy in order to avoid public scrutiny, NMED must ensure the impacted community is able to access all relevant documents, engage in the public process, and be provided a meaningful opportunity to represent the interests of their community,” Kacey Hovden, a staff attorney for NMELC, said in a Tuesday statement. 
A spokesperson for the environment department in an email to Source NM acknowledged receipt of NMELC’s demands and noted that the application review process is ongoing.
“The New Mexico Environment Department appreciates the New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s input,” he wrote on Wednesday. “The department is still reviewing the applications and therefore can’t yet make a determination regarding the requested additional requirements. However, state law allows for a public hearing for any permit of significant public interest and requires public notices to be published in English and Spanish.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Project-Jupiter-rendering.png,,,2025-12-17 13:58:12.486619

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)It’s been nearly two decades since Ruby Welch was released from prison, but she’s “still not free,” she said, because financial and emotional burdens remain.
After serving seven years on a drug charge, Welch left prison with a $15,000 restitution that she’s still paying off. Until her ledger is cleared, the Hot Springs native will remain on parole, which requires her to submit notification about out-of-state trips. 
 

Second in a series on Arkansas’ crowded prisons
 

“I call ‘em my slave papers,” she said. “Before I can go to anybody else’s plantation, I got to let them know that I’m leaving the plantation in Arkansas.”
Since her release, Welch has become a resource for incarcerated individuals through her organization F.E.L.O.N. — Formerly Incarcerated Empowered Leaders Overcoming Negative Stigmas. She’s also worked on criminal justice legislation. 
Despite trying to move forward, Welch said she still feels like the “property of the state of Arkansas” because fees keep her tied to the prison system.
“I call it ‘pimping my pain for their profit’ because I served my time, I did my time, I did exactly what the state of Arkansas required of me and some, and still you’re holding me hostage, at least in fear of being a hostage again,” she said. 
Failure to pay fines and fees can result in more time behind bars, and Welch said there have been instances when she chose to pay fines over rent.
“I packed up all my stuff, put it in storage and I went to a homeless shelter so I could pay my fines and fees,” she said. “That ought not to be. People shouldn’t have to live in that type of trauma on a daily basis.”
Welch’s experience exemplifies how expenses that accumulate inside and outside prison can keep formerly incarcerated people who may struggle to find employment stuck in the carceral system for years.

Court-imposed fees, fines and restitution are not part of the Arkansas Department of Corrections’ budget, according to Chief of Communications Rand Champion, who said in an email that former inmates can be required to serve the remainder of their time without a new sentence if fines and fees aren’t paid in a timely manner.
Officers do have discretion to delay a supervision fee for those on community supervision, Champion said. The $35 monthly fee, which hasn’t increased since 2011, could be split into two separate payments, for example.
“The Department has routinely worked with individuals to reduce and/or waive supervision fees if a financial hardship exists, and at times it is possible to convert those into community service work hours,” he said. 
Staff also assists with “suitable employment or career education,” Champion said. 
“Most offices maintain lists of employers in the field that are felon-friendly, and there are platforms such as Good Grid that can also help with employment,” he said.
People who are incarcerated can incur charges for court proceedings, restitution, parole and a variety of services. In Arkansas, they pay a $3 co-pay per sick call, 6 cents per minute for phone calls and $5 for a 30-minute video call. Adults on work release are charged a $22 daily room and board fee.
There’s also a range of prices for commissary products, which are set and approved by the Board of Corrections. Prestamped envelopes are sold at cost, while healthy food items and over-the-counter health aids are sold at 40% above cost, including state and local taxes, according to the corrections department’s commissary policy. All remaining items are sold at 50% above cost. 


 

Commissary prices differ between locations. At the Cummins Unit’s main canteen, for example, prices range from 1 cent for postage to $151.90 for an MP3 player, according to data provided by the corrections department. The difference in taxes brings that same device’s total to $154 at the North Central Unit’s main canteen. Some items are available at no cost, including certain types of candy and snacks. 
The North Central Unit near Calico Rock houses about 800 inmates. Established in 1902, Cummins Unit near Grady is the state’s oldest and largest in terms of population, housing around 1,950 inmates, Champion said. The Ouachita River Correctional Unit in Malvern is the largest in terms of square feet and houses around 1,920 inmates, he said. 
Arkansas has 22 units, including six Work Release Units and the newly opened Dr. Mary L. Parker-Reed Women’s Health Unit, Champion said. There are also five Community Correction Centers.
Family costs
Inmates can purchase writing supplies from the commissary to stay in touch with loved ones. In-person visitation is another option, if families can afford it. Almost all of the state’s prisons are located in eastern or central Arkansas, eight of them in communities around Pine Bluff, which means money for gas and child care, and lost wages for taking a day off work. 
Purchasing items and services behind bars also depends on whether family members can afford to place money on inmates’ accounts, Arkansas Justice Reform Coalition Executive Director Sarah Moore said. 
“We’ve seen families forgo paying their rents, cutting back on groceries, not being able to afford other obligations they have in their budget because they’re putting hundreds of dollars on the jail commissary,” Moore said.

The carceral system is “very extractive” because it’s structured to “profit off of very vulnerable and very poor Arkansans,” Moore said. It starts with cash bail, which can leave those who are “impoverished and too poor to buy their freedom” behind bars for long periods of time, she said. 
“They’re not convicted, they’re facing charges, but they deserve their liberty, they deserve to be back with their families,” Moore said. “They deserve to be able to maintain their jobs and their housing and those familial ties, which really get ripped apart whenever they’re stuck in prolonged detention, which is very common in our state.”
As a nonprofit working to end mass incarceration, AJRC educates the public about the cost of the current system and the return on that investment, she said.
“We are finding we don’t like that, so our organization ultimately wants to create systems of care, and we really want to obliterate and abolish and end all of those that create harm in our communities and across the state,” Moore said. 
Taxpayer costs
That return on investment is part of the ongoing debate over construction of a proposed prison in Franklin County that’s expected to cost around $825 million, according to preliminary estimates. Once the prison is built, there will be additional operational costs.
The average cost per day per inmate in fiscal year 2025 was $74.46, according to an annual report the corrections department is required to submit to the Arkansas Legislative Council. The average cost per day per bed was $75.41. Both represent a roughly $4 increase from the previous year.

Meanwhile, the total direct and indirect cost for the fiscal year that ended June 30 was $452.9 million. That represents an increase of $35.4 million from last year and $92.8 million from a decade ago. 
Significant changes that affected these costs include an increase in the total inmate population as the corrections board “endeavored to provide additional capacity to ease the burden of overcrowding on county jails,” according to the report. 
Between July 1, 2024, and June 5, 2025, the corrections department reimbursed county jails more than $27.7 million for housing prison inmates, according to an annual report. 
Of the increased total direct and indirect costs, 39% was attributable to increased personnel costs of salary, personal services matching and overtime, 24% came from increased medical costs and 6% from increased overhead costs.

After reviewing the annual report at its Nov. 18 meeting, Chairman Benny Magness told the corrections board that costs per day will continue to increase as the department opens up smaller units to increase bed capacity. 
“You’re going to have a certain amount of administration at every unit, and it’s just going to go up,” Magness said. 
In addition to expanding prison capacity to alleviate overcrowding in county jails, officials anticipate more space will be needed as a result of the Protect Arkansas Act, a 2023 bill that, among other things, ended parole for the state’s most violent offenders and required others to serve more of their sentences. 
Arkansas’ inmate population is expected to increase from around 20,000 today to 25,000 in 2035, according to an analysis by consulting firm CGL. The state will need an additional 1,500 to 2,000 beds through 2040 once the Protect Act is fully implemented, according to the study.

Welch has tried to improve the state’s prison system through legislation, including Act 566 of 2019, which among other things, requires correctional facilities to provide necessary hygiene products. 
When Welch was incarcerated, she said inmates had to buy extra feminine hygiene products if they needed more than their allotment, and they could be disciplined for sharing products with other inmates. Disciplinary action came if inmates were trafficking and trading items for illegal activities, such as drugs and gambling debts, Champion said.
Welch also worked on a provision in the Protect Act that suspends fines for 120 days following a defendant’s release from custody. However, Welch said she’s heard feedback from people who were once incarcerated that the grace period is not always applied. 
“It’s all about money. It’s not about restoring, rehabilitation, and that’s what we need to make it about,” she said.

Proponents of harsher sentencing and expanded prison capacity have argued they’re needed for public safety. While Moore supports making communities safer, she said it’s important to look at data to make better decisions about how taxpayer money is used to achieve that goal. 
“We talk oftentimes like we’re resource poor, but we have all the resources we need. We just really have to make better decisions about where we’re spending our funding, where we’re putting staffing,” she said. “The things that we’re saying that we care about we really have to invest in.” 
The current system is punitive, Moore said, and accountability needs to be looked at in a different way. As an example, she pointed to how people can rack up debt by missing a court date, but officials don’t send meeting reminders like a doctor’s office does to remind patients of a medical appointment. 
Moore said the system is also disenfranchising and keeping a certain part of the population from participating in society in a way that could help push Arkansas forward.
“It’s all intertwined…we say our recidivism is too high, I hear people saying they don’t like where we’re at on violent crime, but we keep pursuing the same methods,” she said. “And so if we keep doing that, we’re going to get the same outcomes. It’s definitely time that we approach things in a different way.”

Redding Consortium meets to render redistricting recommendation.
After a three-hour meeting marked by intense debate and a brief racist “Zoom bomb” interruption, Delaware’s Redding Consortium for Educational Equity voted Tuesday night to launch a full investigation into creating one unified school district for nearly all public school students in New Castle County north of the C&D Canal — a move that could redraw decades of educational history.
By a vote of 19–2, with three abstentions and one vacancy, the consortium agreed to conduct a two-month study into consolidating the Brandywine, Christina, Colonial, and Red Clay Consolidated school districts into a single system. If implemented, that restructuring would, for the first time since 1978, place all Wilmington students under one district — undoing the decades-old divisions that dispersed city schools into suburban jurisdictions.
Breaking decades of fragmentation
The Redding Consortium, created in 2019 by unanimous vote of the General Assembly, was tasked with addressing decades of racial and socioeconomic inequities in Wilmington’s public schools. Its decision to advance the “Northern New Castle County Consolidated School District” marks the most ambitious step yet to simplify Delaware’s fragmented education system.
Today, roughly 11,000 Wilmington students navigate a patchwork of four traditional districts, about 40 public schools, and 18 governing bodies. The average high school bus ride from central Wilmington lasts 30–45 minutes. As of 2024, consortium data show these students were 71% Black, 58% from lower-income households, and 24% living with disabilities. Fewer than 1 in 5 students are proficient in English, and only 1 in 10 meet math benchmarks.
Independent researchers from American Institutes for Research (AIR) found that Wilmington’s divided system “diminishes access to support services,” creating a “fragmented experience for students and families” and perpetuating racially identifiable, high-poverty schools.
Inside the vote
Tuesday’s meeting at Delaware Tech’s Wilmington campus stretched for hours, drawing around 50 live audience and almost 500 online participants. About midway through, the session was disrupted as an online intruder took advantage of an open online microphone and shouted racial slurs. Attendees and virtual participants regrouped after the incident and spent significant time discussing the personal reactions to that behavior and the harm of such language before resuming deliberations.
Deliberation took the form of each consortium member sharing their initial thoughts, prior to the formal vote.  Several members voiced preference for the so-called “River Plan”, which would extend the boundaries of Brandywine and Red Clay into the city, absorbing the students currently assigned to Colonial or Christina.  They cited the belief that this would be less disruptive to the districts and provide a more stable environment, while meeting the consortium mandate of “no more than two school districts with jurisdiction over the city schools and students.”  Approximately half of the members making initial comments favored the Northern New Castle County plan, with a single district combining Brandywine, Red Clay, Colonial and Christina.
When the dust settled, the final roll call saw near-unanimous agreement among consortium members — though not without caveats. The only “no” votes came from Brandywine Superintendent Lisa Lawson and Christina Superintendent Deirdra Joyner. Both questioned whether consolidation would genuinely improve outcomes for Wilmington students.
Lawson said she has not seen “data-driven reasons to believe any changes will actually help Wilmington students,” while Joyner cautioned, “We can’t legislate our way to proficiency.” Both echoed concerns from Brandywine constituents who spoke out at a raucous town hall earlier this month, where more than 1,000 residents either attended or tuned in virtually.
Other prominent members abstained, including Delaware State Education Association President Stephanie Ingram, State Sen. Eric Buckson, and Latin American Community Center CEO Maria Matos, who lost her virtual connection but had previously expressed support.
Still, a wide range of leaders — from Wilmington Mayor John Carney to Red Clay Superintendent Dorrell Green and Colonial Superintendent Jeffrey Menzer — backed the motion despite initial misgivings.
A full roster of votes included YES votes from Co-Chairs Sen. Elizabeth “Tizzy” Lockman and former Lt. Gov. Matt Denn, as well as leading advocates like Raye Jones Avery of the Wilmington Center for Educational Equity, Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha, Joseph Jones of New Castle County Vo-Tech, Christopher Curry of Ezion Fair Baptist Church, and City Council President Ernest “Trippi” Congo.
Debate, costs, and next steps
The consortium’s vote initiates, but does not finalize, change. The recommendation is nonbinding and kicks off a two-month study period to explore cost, operations, and governance. Members must address 13 stipulations including fiscal impacts, community engagement, and leadership structure.
A draft plan is expected in early February 2026, followed by public hearings in each of the four current districts, including at least two in Wilmington. If the timeline holds, the Redding Consortium hopes to deliver the final plan to the State Board of Education by late February.
Once approved by the State Board, the proposal would move to the Delaware General Assembly, where the Controller General’s Office would conduct a fiscal review. Lawmakers aim to vote by June 30, 2026. Even with full legislative approval, implementation could take years — possibly into the next decade — as planning, staffing, and financial systems adjust.
Preliminary cost projections from AIR estimate the transition could increase annual expenditures by roughly $18 million, or about 1.4% of the current $1.3 billion combined budget for the four districts. Much of that increase would come from raising educator salaries in Christina’s city schools to match their suburban counterparts.
Diverging visions and philosophies
The meeting underscored competing philosophies about education reform in Wilmington.
Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha, who gave the final speech before the vote, said a transformation this large is necessary to confront entrenched inequities.
Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha

“This system is broken,” he said. “We live in a world with no rules, where we blame our children, their families, and their communities — but never, ever question the quality of their schools. Where so many of our children aren’t being taught, they’re just tolerated.”

Raye Jones Avery, representing the Wilmington Center for Education Equity and Public Policy, argued that the one-district model provides the strongest foundation for change:

“When parents are given the choice of geographic proximity or higher-quality learning environments, they’ll choose the higher-quality environments without fail.”

Joseph Jones, superintendent of New Castle County Vo-Tech, cautioned against seeing consolidation as a cure-all.

“If that is the end point, it will fail. We have to do more for our students — the investment has to occur.”

Former Lt. Gov. Matt Denn
Two veteran statewide leaders, Carney and Denn, expressed mixed feelings. Carney admitted he initially saw the countywide option as his least favorite, warning, “I don’t think it has a chance in the General Assembly.” Denn suggested a smaller-scale merger between Red Clay and Brandywine would have faced fewer political hurdles, noting:

“There are children who are dependent on us getting something done now… Why take the risk, when there’s another model that accomplishes what we want?”

Long road to reform
Even as optimism built in the room, many acknowledged that consolidation alone cannot fix deeper social issues. Sen. Lockman tempered expectations before the vote:

Sen. Elizabeth “Tizzy” Lockman, Co-chair of Redding Consortium
“Schools can’t do this work by themselves. Any implementation we pursue must be paired with serious state investment.”

The Redding Consortium’s vote represents not just a procedural milestone, but the latest chapter in a decades-long struggle for educational equity in Wilmington. From the 1978 desegregation orders that broke up the original Wilmington School District to the failed 2016 redistricting plan, generations of commissions have sought — and failed — to unify the system.
Whether this attempt succeeds depends on Delaware’s political will. But for its champions, Tuesday’s vote signals a long-awaited moment of clarity.  Dr. LaRetha Odumosu, Director of Wilmington’s Office of Educational Advocacy, said “Our students should not and cannot afford to be the victims of systems that do not serve them.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Redding-Consortium-Dec-16-Meeting-1024x371.jpg,,,2025-12-17 12:58:41.724059

Board records show Lizette Ngamalue of Johnston was awarded an Iowa nursing license in March 2020 and worked for three years as a licensed practical nurse until the board discovered the educational credentials she had submitted as part of her license application were fraudulent.
According to the board, one of the nursing schools Ngamalue claimed to have attended, the National School of Nursing and Allied Health, was among several alleged diploma mills investigated for fraud as part of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Operation Nightingale.
According to the board, in 2021 Ngamalue applied for a license in Florida using a degree from a different program called Siena Education Center, which was another program investigated by the DOJ for issuing fraudulent nursing degrees.
In July 2023, Ngamalue agreed to surrender her Iowa nursing license.
In May 2025, Ngamalue applied for a new Iowa nurse’s license based on a verified degree received from Mercy College of Health Sciences. The board alleges that at its Oct. 9, 2025, hearing on Ngamalue’s license application, Ngamalue said she was unaware of the fraudulent nature of her initial degrees and asserted she was unsure of the dates she had attended either Siena or the National School of Nursing and Allied Health, as she had “blocked out” that time period.
The board recently agreed to award Ngamalue a registered nurse’s license to practice in Iowa, subject to two years of probation and monitoring.
In its written decision, the board applauded Ngamalue for returning to school and obtaining a legitimate degree but also expressed concern that she “was not forthcoming about her previous education and failed to answer basic questions about the two schools where she fraudulently obtained credits, which made the board question her sincerity.”
More nursing board actions
Other individuals whose disciplinary cases were recently acted upon by the Iowa Board of Nursing include:
Julie Thornton of Council Bluffs – The board has denied Thornton’s application for reinstatement of her license. Board records show Thornton, formerly Julie Espenhover, was originally issued a registered nurse’s license in 2004. In 2018, she entered into an agreement with the Iowa Nurse Assistance Program that required her to abstain from all mood-altering substances, including alcohol. The board alleges Thornton failed to abstain from alcohol while under contract with the program and in 2020, she surrendered her license. In March 2025, she applied for reinstatement. In denying the application, the board said Thornton had not provided sufficient evidence to show the basis for her 2020 license surrender no longer exists.
Renee Nesbitt of Urbandale – The board has agreed to reinstate Nesbitt’s license, which was surrendered in April 2024. Board records show Nesbitt was issued a nursing license in May 2009, and that in 2017, she entered into an agreement with the Iowa Nurse Assistance Program, then moved to Michigan where she entered into an “alternative discipline program.” In February 2020, her Michigan license was suspended for failure to comply with the alternative discipline program and Nesbitt moved back to Iowa where she resumed practice and entered into another contract with the Iowa Nurse Assistance Program and agreed to abstain from alcohol.
In 2022, Nesbitt allegedly admitted violating the terms of her INAP contract and her Iowa license was placed on probation. In August 2023, Nesbitt allegedly tested positive for alcohol use and in April 2024, she agreed to surrender her license. In April 2025, she applied for reinstatement.
In agreeing to reinstate her license, the board indicated Nesbitt had successfully addressed her alcohol-use issues and that it was in the public’s interest for her license to be reinstated subject to two years of probation, chemical screening and monitoring.
Elvis Kasi of New London – The board has placed the Kasi’s license as a registered nurse on probation to resolve charges that he failing to assess, accurately document, evaluate, or report the status of a patient or client, and that he failed to properly safeguard or secure medications. The board alleges that while working as a nurse in Mt. Pleasant between February 2023 and November 2024, Kasi “had incidents of substandard medication management” that resulted in his being fired.
According to the board, Kasi allegedly was found to have “medication in his assigned employment locker,” and was also found to have removed from his employer’s medication supply unspecified drugs that were intended for a patient, although records indicated the drugs were never administered, thrown away or returned to the supply. As part of his two-year probationary period, Kasi will be required to submit to any substance abuse evaluation that might be recommended by his case manager, and complete 30 hours of educational training of medication management.
Osarenoma Ogbeide – Board records indicate Ogbeide has voluntarily surrendered her license after being charged by the board with fraud in procuring an Iowa nurse’s license. Board records indicate that in October 2019, Ogbeide received licenses to practice in both Texas and Iowa, based in part on a nursing degree received from Ideal Professional Institute in Florida, which was not authorized to provide online education.
It was later determined Ogbeide did not live in Florida while “attending” Ideal Professional Institute and that her courses were delivered online. The board alleges that after an FBI investigation concluded the institute had issued fraudulent nursing degrees, it was determined Ogbeide had never completed the required program hours and clinical training necessary to obtain a nursing degree.
Tara Lynn Yotter-Wadding of Albert Lea, Minn. – The board placed Yotter-Wadding’s nursing license on probation for three years after charging her with having a nursing license that was revoked, suspended or otherwise sanctioned in another jurisdiction. The board alleges that Yotter-Wadding — also identified in board records as Tara Lynn Yotting-Wadding — applied for an Iowa license renewal in May 2025, which was approved. The board alleges it later learned that in 2024, Minnesota’s licensing board had referred Yotter-Wadding to a professional health program due to a substance abuse disorder and that Yotter-Wadding was later “unsatisfactorily discharged” from that program.
Corinne Elizabeth Kach, formerly of Sioux City – The board has charged Kach with performing nursing services beyond the authorized scope of practice and with failing to respond to or comply with a board investigation or subpoena. According to the board, Kach is a licensed practical nurse who currently lives in Michigan but lived and worked in Sioux City when the alleged violations took place. No other information about the nature of the violations has been made public by the board.
Board records indicate the charges against Kach were formally approved in July 2025 but were only made public last week. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Jan. 15, 2026.
Lauren Jane Nahnsen of Johnston – The board issued Nahnsen a warning for violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of a patient or client. The board alleges that while Nahnsen worked for Wexford Health Services at the Douglas County Department of Corrections in Nebraska, Nahnsen attempted to use her employer’s computer system to access a coworker’s prescription drug information, using 13 variations of birthdates, in a failed effort to obtain the information. Nahnsen was fired for her actions, according to the board. In resolving the matter with a warning, the board notified Nahnsen she could be subject to further discipline should she continue to engage in similar conduct.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BON-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-12-17 12:58:41.724059

Liz Brown, left, and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita. (Photos by Whitney Downard and Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A state senator wants to keep pressing her professional misconduct complaint against Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita after the commission that reviews such allegations decided not to take action in the case.
Rokita’s office released a letter from the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission about the grievance — filed in May by Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne — after she told the Indiana Capital Chronicle last week that the case remained pending.
Brown submitted the complaint after Rokita said in a radio interview that she used her position as Senate Judiciary Committee chair to block an immigration enforcement bill last session because she has an “illegal alien” in her family. 
Brown called that claim “blatantly false” and argued Rokita violated rules against lawyers making false statements.

The Disciplinary Commission, however, reviewed a response submitted by Rokita’s attorneys and “voted to close the matter,” the letter said. It was dated Nov. 14 and signed by commission Executive Director Adrienne Meiring.
Brown told the Capital Chronicle this week that she has filed an appeal of that decision. She declined further comment.
Rokita’s lawyers argued in his response that Brown’s grievance was “meritless on its face” and was filed in retaliation for statements protected under First Amendment free speech rights. 
“Senator Brown violated the First Amendment by retaliating with an arm of the government, and the Commission violated the First Amendment by giving effect to her retaliation,” the response said. “The Commission should have recognized the political, retaliatory nature of her grievance — as well as its substantive failure to raise a substantial question of misconduct and its affront to the freedom of speech — and dismissed the grievance without demanding a response from General Rokita.”
Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathryn Dolan said someone filing a grievance may ask the Disciplinary Commission to reconsider its decision. But Dolan said she could not provide any details about a grievance that does not result in the commission seeking disciplinary action.
Ongoing conflict
The dispute between Rokita and Brown continues on the legislative front, as the attorney general’s office last week criticized Senate Bill 76, authored by Brown, as an “inadequate response” to prevent businesses from hiring people who are in the country illegally. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 6-2 to advance the bill to the full Senate, which could take up the proposal in January.
Rokita and Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Banks have repeatedly criticized Brown on social media over the bill she blocked in her committee last session.
They also are backing Darren Vogt, who works on Banks’ Senate staff and is a Northwest Allen County Schools board member, in a GOP primary challenge to Brown’s 2026 reelection bid.
The Supreme Court justices issued a reprimand in 2023 against Rokita over comments he made during a Fox News interview about Indianapolis physician Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who performed an abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio.
The justices voted in October to dismiss separate misconduct allegations against Rokita stemming from his defiant response to that reprimand decision.

(File photo/Source NM)New Mexico’s rates for violent and property crimes have fallen since a 20-year high in 2018, but still remain above the national standard, according to a new state report.
The report, which analysts with the state’s Legislative Finance Committee recently presented to lawmakers, found that the crime rate has not “substantively” fallen despite $380 million of state spending aimed at staffing and information-sharing since fiscal year 2021.
Arrests nationwide have fallen to historic lows, report finds

 
In 2024, the report said New Mexico had a rate of 0.94 homicides per 100,000 people, more than twice the national rate. It also found New Mexico had outsized rates of aggravated assault, rape and burglary. The rates remain high despite an increase in sworn law enforcement officers across the state. Analysts told lawmakers that is likely a result of departments not dispatching their officers in an efficient manner.
“While more officers matters, it also matters how they’re being deployed,” Stephanie Joyce, LFC program evaluator, told lawmakers last week. “Are they being deployed to places where the most crime is happening during the time the most crime is happening?”
She said that half of the state’s law enforcement agencies who responded to an LFC survey said they don’t use “real-time crime data” to inform how they dispatch officers.
Tracking crime statistics is often difficult because it relies in large part on police departments to publish that data. Analysts expressed concern that “roughly half” of police forces in New Mexico lacked recent data relating to crime or clearance rates, which refers to how often a department solves and closes a case.
Legislative analysts recommended that lawmakers consider introducing legislation that would tie grant funding for local police departments to reporting timely and accurate crime data. They also recommended amending state law to charge the state Administrative Office of the Courts with creating and maintaining a data-sharing network for law enforcement agencies. Analysts also recommended that the state Department of Public Safety maintain a list of police departments that have not reported their data. 
The upcoming 30-day legislative session, which begins Jan. 20, is meant for budgetary matters. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office recently confirmed that she will put public safety on her agenda for the session, though, meaning lawmakers can sponsor new bills on the matter. 
LFC officials told lawmakers that “victim/witness uncooperative” is the most common reason listed in felony case dismissals. District attorneys are required by state law to inform victims of court proceedings, but the new report found that the automated system responsible for triggering those notifications has been offline for more than a year and there is no standardized process for DA’s offices to track whether those notifications have been issued.
“Roughly half of felony cases end in dismissal and about one-third of people were responsible for two-thirds of felony cases in a five-year period,” Joyce told lawmakers. “Together, all those indicators point toward a system that is not working in a coordinated and targeted way to ensure accountability for crimes.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230802_085211-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-17 11:58:41.041111

Credit: Related DigitalA multibillion dollar data center planned for Saline Township has taken a major hit to its funding, with a prime financial backer reportedly pulling out of the project. 
According to a report from the Financial Times, Blue Owl Capital – tech giant Oracle’s largest data center partner – will not provide $10 billion in funding to support the project, leaving it on uncertain financial footing. 
Asset management company Blackstone Inc. has reportedly held talks about financing the project, but has not signed a deal.
“Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl . . . Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,” Oracle told the Financial Times. 
As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?

Blue Owl reportedly raised concerns that the deal was less attractive than previous ventures with Oracle, alongside concerns in delays with the project. 
Residents of Saline Township have shown clear opposition to the project, with members of the township board voting 4-1 against rezoning 575 acres of farmland to house the project, prompting the landowner and Oracle’s development partner Related Digital to take legal action, accusing the township of exclusionary zoning. The board has since voted 4-1 to settle the case. 
“If an idea’s so great, AI is so great, so beneficial to our community, you don’t have to sue your way in,”  Kathryn Haushalter, a Saline Township resident who lives near the project site told attendees at a rally against data centers on Tuesday.
Over the weekend Haushalter filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit between the Saline Township Board and the owners and developers of the site, arguing the township board violated the Open Meetings Act by voting to settle the lawsuit in closed session and by not holding another meeting on the consent judgement, which was signed by two of the board’s five members.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Related-Digital-Rendering-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 11:58:41.041111

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, one of two Republicans representing Washington state in Congress, will not run for reelection next year.
“Serving the Fourth District of Washington has been the honor of my life, and this decision comes with no reservations or remorse, only gratitude for the tremendous opportunity to have represented my home state in Congress,” he said in a statement Wednesday morning.
Newhouse, 70, of Sunnyside, was first elected to Congress in 2014. Before that, he served in the Washington House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009. Then, for four years, he was director of the state Department of Agriculture under then-Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat. Newhouse’s family operates an 850-acre farm.
He was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. And he is one of two among that group who is still serving in Congress.
The 4th Congressional District has been represented by Republicans since the early 1990s.
In 2026, Newhouse was facing a potential rematch with Jerrod Sessler, a businessman whom Trump endorsed in his challenge against Newhouse in 2024. In that election cycle, Republican contender Tiffany Smiley also ran in the primary. Smiley, who lost a run against Patty Murray for her U.S. Senate seat in 2022, has not held elected office and is known for her work as a veterans advocate.
At least one Democrat is mounting a bid for the 4th District seat next year: John Duresky, a retired Air Force officer who also worked at the Hanford nuclear cleanup site.
The last Democrat to win a U.S. House seat in the 4th was former Gov. Jay Inslee. He won in 1992, but lost reelection after one term to Doc Hastings, a Republican, who held the seat until retiring in 2015. 
The 4th Congressional District in central Washington stretches from the Canadian border to the Oregon state line. It includes the agriculture-heavy Yakima Valley, the Yakama Indian Reservation, and the Tri-Cities.
Newhouse’s announcement comes midway through his sixth term, one he said he was looking forward to because he would be in the House majority. With Republicans also in charge in the Senate and a GOP president, he foresaw his party “accomplishing good things for the country.”
Sessler, of Prosser, is a Navy veteran and founded a company called HomeTask, a website that connects customers to local home service providers. 
Newhouse’s early notice that he’s not running creates the potential for a Republican-packed primary next August, similar to 2022 when six Republicans, including Sessler, ran against Newhouse because of his impeachment vote. That year, Sessler lost in the primary.

In a news release published on Wednesday, McCarron said he planned “to accept a new career opportunity in football.”
“My football position will require the same 100% focus, commitment, and attention that I was prepared to give to the office of lieutenant governor, so it is time to end my campaign,” the statement said.

McCarron announced his candidacy in October, using culture war language and referring to assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in a video on YouTube.
He said at the time that it was time for a new cadre of politicians, newcomers and outside candidates, to take the lead and enter political office.
The first-time political candidate entered a GOP field that included Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen and Alabama Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate, and was trailing both men in fundraising. As of Nov. 30, McCarron had raised just under $106,000 for the race, compared to Allen’s $844,000 and Pate’s $438,000.
Other Republican candidates for the office include Patrick Bishop, a deputy with the Cullman County Sheriff’s Department; former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth. Current Alabama Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth is term-limited and is not seeking election to another office next year.
Alabama Daily News reported in October that McCarron had never voted in an election and only registered to vote three days before his campaign announcement.
McCarron said in his statement Wednesday he still believed it was time new faces to enter state politics.
“I have a deep desire to help create an even better Alabama for Tripp, Cash, and Cruz, our three sons that Katherine and I love so much, so I may return to the political playing field once my career on the football field has truly run its course,” the statement said.
The lieutenant governor presides over the Alabama Senate and is next in line to be governor should there be a vacancy. The Alabama lieutenant governor has some appointments and can vote in the event of tie votes in the Senate but is otherwise powerless.
McCarron played for the University of Alabama from 2009 to 2013 and won two national championships. He also played in the N.F.L. for nine seasons and lives in Mobile with his family.

Ron DeSantis, CFO Blaise Ingoglia, and Ag Commissioner Wilton Simpson at a Cabinet meeting on Sep. 30, 2025. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet on Wednesday approved more than $2 million in immigration enforcement money for local agencies seeking AI language translators, pepper spray, GPS trackers, handcuffs, bonuses, and more.
The $2.4 million greenlit to 10 law enforcement agencies means Florida has now approved roughly $21 million of the original $250 million diverted by the Legislature in February to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
DeSantis and the Cabinet members, who make up the newly created State Board of Immigration Enforcement, approved the money unanimously.
The board is part of a broader Florida crackdown on undocumented immigration. In February, the GOP-dominated Legislature approved a sweeping measure demanding all counties partner with ICE, creating state-level penalties for entering Florida without proper documentation, and removing in-state tuition for undocumented college students.
The Florida law came right as President Donald Trump took office, ordering mass deportations and setting aside mass sums of money for states to set up migrant detention centers. Florida was the first state to do so with “Alligator Alcatraz,” a sprawling, controversial facility in the heart of the Everglades.
Where is the money going?
The largest lump of the $2.4 million will go to the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, which requested the most money ($738,451) for the widest-ranging variety of immigration-related activity. 
After the Florida Highway Patrol, the South Florida county is responsible for the most encounters with suspected undocumented immigrants and the most non-citizens arrested on federal immigration charges, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s immigration dashboard.
Martin County’s breakdown includes:
$2,546 for 30 handcuffs and 30 leg irons; $13,153 for tactical goggles, ballistic helmets, and bulletproof vests; $1,639 for 10 canisters of high-volume pepper spray; $271,103 for a rapid DNA testing machine; $136,736 for license plate readers; $185,029 for tasers; and $859 for Bluetooth rechargeable shooting ear protectors.
The next highest grant is for Volusia County Corrections, totaling $505,789. The asks include $68,400 for detention beds, $22,400 to train 40 officers under the 287(g) program, $43,000 in bonuses for correctional officers, $183,760 for six detection screening systems to check migrants for “contraband,” $182,500 for a full-body security scanning system to check migrants for contraband, fevers, and health problems, $1,400 for 72 uniforms, and $4,100 for 50 mattresses.
GPS trackers, AI translators, and biometric scans
The remaining requests came from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, the Madison Police Department, the Fruitland Park Police Department, the City of Port Richey Police Department, the town of Havana, the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office, the town of Welaka Police Department, and the Nassau County Sheriff’s Office.
The majority of the money is for license plate readers, overtime, or bonuses for law enforcement or correctional officers. Fruitland Park received $22,300 for GPS trackers. According to the submitted request, the department plans to deploy the trackers against “a suspect vehicle … allowing officers to safely monitor vehicles suspected of transporting unauthorized aliens.”
Havana received $93,687 for body-worn cameras, $90,088 for tasers, and $6,201 for nine universal AI language translators. These translators will “facilitate effective communication with non-English [speaking] individuals during stops and immigration focused activities.”
Putnam County received $17,378 for six laptops; $5,793 for handcuffs, leg cuffs, and chains; $69,384 for 21 Rapid ID devices, and $2,557 for one “Rapid ID two finger biometric device accompanied by a DNA barcode.”
These would be used to determine “accurate biometric identification of detainees.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9809-1024x815.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 11:58:41.041111

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A second stretch of the east end of the Turner Turnpike is preparing to see its speed limit raised.
The expansion of the stretch between Bristow and Kellyville to six lanes is expected to be completed in the spring of 2026, weather permitting, said Lisa Shearer-Salim, an OTA spokesperson.
OTA is expected to increase the speed limit to 80 mph, said Joe Echelle, OTA executive director. 
The current work zone speed limit is 65 mph, Salim said.
It will be the second section of the Turner Turnpike to see a speed limit raised to 80.
The section between Kellyville and Sapulpa is already 80 mph after widening was completed during a previous turnpike expansion project known as Driving Forward, Salim said.
Its successor, dubbed ACCESS, is underway and includes making the entire turnpike six lanes along with numerous other projects.
The six-laning of the Turner Turnpike, which stretches between Tulsa and Oklahoma City, is expected to be completed in 2037, Echelle said.
As officials make safety improvements along the turnpikes, such as cashless toll collection and pavement rehabilitation, speed limits have been raised, Echelle said.
“Over the course of the last six years, we’ve been raising speed limits as we have been making these safety improvements,” Echelle said.
Opened in 1953, the Turner Turnpike is 86 miles long.
Unveiled in 2022, the 15-year ACCESS program had an initial price tag of $5 billion. But in 2024, officials said inflation caused that price to rise to $8.2 billion.
Echelle said that a number of contracts awarded have come in significantly under the engineer’s estimate. If that practice continues, the price tag is not expected to increase, he said.
“Now, unless we add something, the $8.2 billion will capture everything,” Echelle said. “There is always the possibility for that to change. The bidding environment is good for us to be able to get more work done for cheaper money.
Joshua Lee, chief estimator for Edmond-based Duit Construction Co., said inflation on raw materials has slowed and the supply chain has leveled out.
He said Oklahoma Department of Transportation contacts have been stagnant or canceled due to the recent federal government shutdown.
“The contractor base is very eager to go to work,” said Lee, who is president of the Association of Oklahoma General Contractors.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A McPherson County lawsuit filed by a Kansas business owner challenges “unconstitutionally vague” enforcement operations leading to seizure of cash and hemp-derived products at direction of the state’s attorney general and director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.
KBI director Tony Mattivi and Attorney General Kris Kobach said in October law enforcement officers raided CBD and vape shops to serve more than a dozen search warrants on businesses suspected of not complying with state drug law.
In a statement, Mattivi said targeted stores were “nothing but weed dealers” and the state must “enforce our controlled-substance laws when we have these substances causing bad effects on Kansas kids.”
Barry Grissom and Jake Miller, of a law firm based in Kansas City, Missouri, responded Monday by seeking on behalf of Mike Ballinger, owner of the McPherson CBD store Hanging Leaf, a court injunction to stop comparable raids and to compel return of seized property.
“The pleadings speak for themselves,” said Grissom, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Kansas and advocate for legalizing marijuana sales and consumption in Kansas.
Both Mattivi and Kobach, in their official capacity, were named in the filing requesting injunctive relief from “recent enforcement actions involving hemp products legally permitted under Kansas law.”
On Oct. 1, Mattivi and Kobach disclosed their statewide “marijuana enforcement operation” focused on vape shops and CBD dispensaries. This law enforcement effort resulted in execution of  at least 15 search warrants across Kansas.
The lawsuit said authorities seized $7,000 in inventory as well as cash from Hanging Leaf. A portion of cash taken into custody at Hanging Leaf was property of an unrelated business operated by the plaintiff, the suit said.
Attorneys for the plaintiff said Kansas law permitted hemp products with no more than 0.3% Delta-9 THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. The plaintiff alleged KBI testing with gas chromatography was capable of detecting “only the presence of THC and cannot determine the origin” of the substance. The suit says the KBI testing regimen improperly resulted in seizure of compliant goods.
In addition, the plaintiff asserted unconstitutional vagueness of Kansas law fostered “arbitrary enforcement that chills protected business activities.” The filing requested raids to be forbidden until the state adopted legal protection for products under 0.3% hemp derived from Delta-9 THC.
“Because of the overly broad and wide-ranging nature of the search warrants issued as part of the operation, and of Kansas law itself, store owners have had varying amounts of legal products seized with no recourse to recover the products or the potential profits from those products,” the lawsuit said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010153-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-17 11:58:41.041111
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-17 16:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Being creative represents a form of freedom’ for those behind bars,Mina Corpuz and Debbie Skipper,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/17/being-creative-represents-a-form-of-freedom-for-those-behind-bars/,"In a book “Intersections: Seeking Self at Parchman Prison,” Sally Lott McLellan wrote about how her art class and volunteer work was a journey of self-discovery for her students and herself.","In the harsh and colorless confines of the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, nine men hunkered down over an array of vibrant hues and used pencils, crayons, kindergarten scissors, cloth and milk jugs to create masks and a headdress, pencil drawings and wall hangings, shell necklaces and Gullah dolls. 
Michael Orrell, one of the incarcerated men, in a diary chronicling his art journey, thanked his “big sisters,” instructor Sally Lott McLellan and Kathy Neff of Oxford, a master quilter who joined the class in 2023 to assist with the sewing project.
“They are a God-send, in such a forsaken place due to stigmatization toward prisoners,” Orrell wrote.
“I am a prisoner, but I am free!”
McLellan, who used her art therapy skills as the class instructor, gained an entree into this world through the Mississippi Prison Writes Initiative. She and Neff led creative arts class workshops in Unit 30 and Unit 29 from November 2021 until June 2024. 
In a book “Intersections: Seeking Self at Parchman Prison,” published in November by VOX Press, McLellan wrote about how the class and volunteer work was a journey of self-discovery for her students and herself.
“I hope readers will understand the humanity found in volunteerism, the feel of stepping outside of oneself to share time with those who don’t get the attention or interest that those in the free world do. I believe incarcerated people need to be heard, to be acknowledged as fellow human beings,” she wrote in an email. 
“… A little bit of encouragement can go a long way for those who are deprived of it. And one’s gift to the incarcerated doesn’t have to be masterpiece work. It can be simple and still be very rewarding.” 
Studies have found that creative arts can support rehabilitation and better behavior during incarceration. Rehabilitation Through the Arts, which provides visual art, writing, theater, dance and music programs at 10 prisons in New York and one in California, reports that less than 3% of its participants return to prison compared to 60% of people nationwide within three years of release. 
Seeing her students as individuals

McLellan’s book is among several Vox Press has published over a decade, including four collections of writing by those incarcerated at Parchman. 
She has a bachelor’s degree from Millsaps College and qualified for a master’s degree program in art therapy at Mississippi University for Women, studying art and psychology. 
But instead of graduate school, at the age of 50 with her youngest child no longer at home, she joined AmeriCorps and moved to northwest Montana where she spent two years at a tribal college as a community service team leader. 
McLellan said she kept journals after each prison art class she taught, and she realized that it was how she processed “the joys and the accomplishments, the setbacks, the intense emotions, and the glitches within the system.”
She began to learn about  the incarcerated men as individuals, rather than seeing them as a collective. They can be easy to ignore, McLellan said, but  they have parents, children and grandchildren.
“They have to learn to survive in a place that robs them of their individuality,” she said.
She noticed how students in her classes learned skills, including listening and taking direction. Lively conversation came from a positive group setting, McLellan said. 
In the book, McLellan wrote about several of her students, most by first name or nicknames, but she singles out two by full name: Michael Orrell and Randy Jackson. 
Orrell, 57, was in the Mississippi Prison Writes Initiative writing class of the nonprofit organization’s executive director, Louis Bourgeois. McLellan said Orrell “doggedly pursued” the concept of an art class. 
Jackson, 52, another former creative writing student, “said from the beginning that he couldn’t produce anything more than stick figures but was willing to explore,” McLellan wrote. 
McLellan wrote that she never asked her students what landed them at Parchman but Jackson volunteered his history and what motivated him.
Jackson, serving life for murder from Madison County since 1999, “is devoted to his family,” she wrote, but won’t let them visit him because he doesn’t want them “to see him in prison surroundings.” Instead, he speaks with them by phone and Zoom only. 
Jackson completed his GED, became a GED tutor and took college courses provided by Mississippi Delta Community College as well as vocational training in auto mechanics and Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration,. He was active in the prison ministry programming and is in the book club provided by the Mississippi Humanities Council. 
McLellan said she learned a little about Jackon’s life before prison in an essay he wrote for the book club. 
In 1982 when he was 9 years old, a car driven by a white man ran Jackson over while he was walking home  from school. He said “the accident almost took my little life away.”
But by the age 13 he was having sex with an older woman, drinking and smoking marijuana.
By 14, even though he was still active in church, Jackson sold marijuana, was arrested and suspended from school for a year and then started selling cocaine. 
Jackson dropped out of school at 18. But by the time he was 21, he had purchased some land, had a mobile home, a tractor and two trucks for hauling logs. At 25, he was a father of four children.
What changed his life, McLellan wrote, is losing everything. In 1997, Jackson shot someone who assaulted him and received a life sentence. 
In his book club essay, he wrote: ‘My Message to Young Adults, I hope this will enlighten you all to stay away from  trouble and be much better than I was, and not make the same mistakes I have made … Because if God (can) change me from a troubled man I know God can and will change you . . . just believe, have faith, and never give up on your dreams.’” 
Using photographs McLellan had taken from an old cemetery for the students to draw from, Jackson said drawing the tombstone “caused him to think of the life he’d taken.”
‘How they chose to see themselves’
She remembers feeling “a dance of delight” in her head the first time a student said art class felt like therapy. McLellan said she’s gathered materials and come up with ideas to help those in her class relax and feel comfortable.
“Being creative represents a form of freedom,” she said. “One can be unbound and fearless. Happy, even.”
Orrell, who is serving 40 years from Monroe County for aggravated assault and sexual battery, wrote in the book about first being inspired to do art by tops from Coca-Cola plastic bottles and other circular containers he found.
Today he has over 60 different tops that have survived many shakedowns, Orrell wrote in “My Art Journey,” which McLellan includes in her book. 
“These circular objects from the  garbage are the backbone of my colored circle art,” he says. 
“I never dreamed my art would even exist much less be a conversation piece in the homes of others. …  I couldn’t have done it alone. My art has come into existence through hard work and focus. Those two things are just part of it when it’s your passion. In addition, my success came into real-time because of others who believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself.”
Incarcerated men in a Creative Arts Class at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman created masks, depicting perhaps how the students imagined themselves Credit: VOX Press
Using milk jugs cut in half, the class made masks. 
“What developed from that, what grew from all those gaudy and shiny things and those milk jugs was something miraculous,” McLellan wrote. “The students created self-portraits. Maybe they didn’t even recognize that was happening, but I could see it  clearly. … they were creating who they wanted to be, how they chose to see themselves.” 
One student known by the nickname “Twitch,” who is part Native American, wanted to make an Apache ceremonial headdress that required many feathers. McLellan saw how hard the man worked on the mask and fulfilled a personal desire to honor his ancestors. 
In spring 2022, with a grant from the Mississippi  Arts Commission, the group presented a show “Pictures from Parchman . . . We Are Here”. Many of the artworks were sold through an internet auction and the proceeds went to charities of the students’ choice or to their canteen account. 
Another project was tied to slavery.
Parchman’s Creative Arts Class created fabric Yaya dolls of Native American design and Gullah dolls of South Carolinian origin. Credit: VOX Press
They created necklaces with shells as the centerpiece, adorned with beads and natural elements as a way to honor “the sacred practice of creating beauty from gifts of nature as done by indigenous people,” McLellan wrote. Those necklaces were strung on a branch they called “Our Branch of Love and Peace.” 
To continue the arts of indigenous people, they made Yaya and Gullah dolls. Yaya dolls originate from Native American culture, while Gullah dolls are examples of the traditional West African dolls made by enslaved people in South Carolina. 
Wall hangings came next. She said the creative arts are liberating and allow the self to emerge, often subtly, because incarcerated people are not always quick to go into self-exploration. Instead, that kind of exploration can lead to a dark place. 
“What wasn’t subtle was how proud they felt with their finished works and even more so when the works were seen by a larger audience than our classes,” McLellan said. “It gave them pride and confidence.”“Intersections: Seeking Self at Parchman” is available www.voxpress.org, on Amazon and at selected bookstores.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/01132045/Cover-1.jpg,,,2025-12-17 11:58:41.041111

Sheffield’s transition initiative announced Tuesday that Todd Bettison has been reappointed as the city’s police chief, noting that Bettison had overseen a 50% reduction in nonfatal shootings between 2022 and 2024, while carjackings have fallen 71% since 2015. 
“There’s nothing more important to the community and me as mayor than improving public safety,” Sheffield said in a statement. “It’s rare to have a Chief of Police who has the respect of their peers, the loyalty of the rank and file, and the hearts and trust of the people.

Bettison worked for the Detroit Police Department for 27 years, and was the second-highest-ranking member of the department when he retired to accept a role as deputy mayor in 2022. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan appointed him as interim chief in October 2024 and then recommended he take on the role full-time in February of this year, which city council then approved.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — One thing the Gamecocks women’s basketball coach and a former prosecutor have in common is a deep knowledge of true crime.
Dawn Staley professed her love of the genre to former Sen. Dick Harpootlian in Columbia on Tuesday, as the two discussed Harpootlian’s newly released book, “Dig Me A Grave.”
The 225-page book tells the tale of Donald “Pee Wee” Gaskins, a serial killer who confessed to killing at least 13 people during the 1970s, and Harpootlian’s story as the prosecutor who sent Gaskins to death row.
“It’s a true story, but it feels very much like a Hollywood movie,” Staley, the University of South Carolina’s three-time national championship coach, told a room of about 200 people during the 40-minute conversation.
Gaskins first received a death sentence in 1976, but a U.S. Supreme Court decision led the state courts to overturn it and instead give him life in prison.
Gaskins received nine more life sentences, one from a jury and eight from a judge following his confession.
Prosecutor who sent SC serial killer to death row tells his story in upcoming book

He might have lived out his days in prison if he hadn’t agreed to kill death row inmate Rudolph Tyner as part of a murder-for-hire plot by the son of the couple Tyner killed. Instead, Gaskins ended up back in court, with Harpootlian as his prosecutor.
Gaskins was executed in 1991.
Harpootlian, who later became a defense attorney, didn’t want the book to feel salacious in recounting the gory details of Gaskins’ killings, which he based on autopsy reports, Gaskins’ confessions, witness accounts and crime scene evidence.
At the same time, he wanted people to understand the horror Gaskins inflicted on the Florence County town of Prospect during the 1970s, he said.
Harpootlian and his co-writer, journalist and author Shaun Assael, went back and forth on how much to include, especially from the autopsy report describing the damage Gaskins did to 2-year-old Robin Dempsey while beating her to death.
In the end, they decided to use those details, Harpootlian said.
“That’s sensationalism,” Harpootlian said. “It’s also, I think, necessary to really describe the evil that we’re trying to describe.”
Also at odds in the book was Harpootlian’s own opinion about the death penalty.

When Harpootlian was first assigned the case as a prosecutor in the 5th Circuit solicitor’s office, which oversees Richland and Kershaw counties, he grappled with sending a man to the electric chair.
Harpootlian opposed the death penalty as a young man, but years of seeing the worst people had to offer during his years trying criminal cases wore on him.
In Gaskins’ case, Harpootlian saw the decision as one of self-defense, since Gaskins proved prison walls wouldn’t stop him from killing.
“If not Pee Wee, who?” Harpootlian said.
The title of the book, which mirrors a moment when Gaskins tells a friend to start digging graves, could also seem to reflect that idea, Staley said.
“Did it have anything to do with digging you a grave for your stance on the death penalty?” Staley asked of the title.
“Wow,” the former state Democratic Party chairman responded to laughter from the audience, before adding that it wasn’t his intention, though perhaps it was a subconscious influence.
For friends, Harpootlian’s telling of Gaskins’ story was a long time coming, former Gov. Jim Hodges told the audience in introducing Harpootlian and Staley.
“We are all thrilled,” Hodges said. “Many of us heard Dick tell stories of Pee Wee Gaskins over the years — a really fascinating case for those of us who are old enough to remember that.”
Among those old enough to remember were Diane Welch, who drove to Columbia from her home in Elgin on Tuesday out of curiosity about Harpootlian’s side of the story.
As a young newspaper reporter for The Weekly Observer in the 1980s, Welch often drove between her hometown of Hemingway, a town of about 500 in Williamsburg County, and Lake City in Florence County, where the paper’s printer was located.

Between the two was Prospect, Gaskins’ hometown and the site of a mass grave where investigators dug up multiple victims’ bodies. Although Gaskins was in prison during the early 1980s, cruising down the empty highways alone in the early morning still gave Welch the creeps, she said.
She followed the story, which dominated the headlines at the time, and even read the book Gaskins dictated to a writer during his time in prison, which gave gruesome details and made claims to killings investigators never confirmed.
(“Final Truth” was published in January 1992, four months after Gaskins’ execution.)
“It was a long time ago, but it was big news,” said Welch, who started reading her preordered copy of the book as soon as the event ended.
Although the book was just released Tuesday, Staley was already asking for a sequel.
“We want more,” Staley said.
Harpootlian hinted that he might have other stories to tell in his future, possibly including that of Alex Murdaugh.
Murdaugh was convicted in 2023 of killing his wife and son two years prior. The case caught the attention of millions of people, with Harpootlian on the other side of the courtroom as Murdaugh’s defense attorney.
As for a sequel on Gaskins, Harpootlian ruled nothing out. Not everything made the final cut, since Harpootlian and Assael probably had around 600 pages of material, he said.
“Will there be a market for that? We’ll see,” Harpootlian said. “We’ll see what the market is for this (book). It looks pretty good so far.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5774-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 10:58:39.751982

One passed away from cancer two years ago. Another is currently battling a terminal illness. The third is incarcerated in a facility 80 miles away, with an infection she fears could one day kill her, though it is highly curable. Steelman prays her friend — “one of the few I’ve got left alive” — will be released from prison, but worries her homecoming will be bittersweet. 
“I’ll probably have to take care of her, and watch her suffer, too,” Steelman said.
Her friend, Colleen, who asked that her name be changed due to a fear of retaliation from within the state’s prison system, is incarcerated at Delta Correctional Facility, a women’s prison in Greenwood. Medical records show that the 56-year old woman has chronic hepatitis C — an infection that can cure more than 95% of infections with an eight- to 12-week course of medication — but she has not received the treatment. She was diagnosed nearly two years ago. 
Medical staff told Colleen that her condition is not severe enough to warrant treatment, she said to Mississippi Today. Delaying treatment runs counter to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms, making the infection difficult to detect and hampering opportunities for early precautions to prevent its spread. The disease progresses slowly and about 1 in 4 people will spontaneously clear the infection without treatment, providing little incentive for prisons to administer treatment — which can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a single course — to patients when they are first diagnosed.
But left untreated, hepatitis C can wreak havoc on the immune system, yellowing skin and the whites of eyes from jaundice, bringing blood vessels that resemble a spider’s web to the surface of the skin and causing joint pain that renders some people immobile. Its long-term health consequences, such as liver failure and cancer, are life-threatening.
“It’s curable, but if you don’t offer treatment, for many people, it’s a death sentence,” said Lara Strick, a clinical associate professor at the University of Washington who also oversees the hepatitis C program in Washington’s state prison system.
Colleen is one of hundreds of people incarcerated in Mississippi diagnosed with hepatitis C who have not received treatment. A Mississippi Today report published earlier this year showed that only a fraction of over 800 people with documented hepatitis C diagnoses — less than 6% — received treatment between January and March of this year. 
Corrections Chairwoman Rep. Becky Currie, who has spent the past year pushing for reforms to health care in Mississippi prisons, previously called the proliferance of untreated hepatitis C in carceral facilities “a public health crisis.”

At Delta Correctional Facility, there were 72 people with documented diagnoses of a total population of about 450 people — or 1 in 6 people — during that three-month period, according to public records. Across the entire state prison system, only 48 people received treatment out of about 19,000 people incarcerated by the state.
And in private, officials have sometimes cited a much higher caseload than public records show — as many as 5,000 prisoners and staff living with hepatitis C. Records from early 2025 show 845 people living with the disease, suggesting that documents may reveal only a sliver of a more widespread hepatitis C problem in Mississippi’s prisons. 
The Mississippi Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for comment for this article. But spokesperson Kate Head previously told Mississippi Today that the company the agency contracts for medical services “is responsible for providing appropriate medical treatment to inmates with all medical conditions, including Hep C.” 
Kansas-based VitalCore Health Strategies, LLC, the company that holds a three-year, $357 million contract to provide medical care to Mississippi prisoners, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Colleen said she does not know when, or if, her condition will merit treatment. 
“I just don’t want it to be too late,” she said. “I don’t want to die in here.” 
Left in the dark
Steelman and Colleen became fast friends when they were just 19. They spent their days smoking marijuana and riding around town together, according to Steelman, a routine that came to a halt when she graduated from a radiography technology program and moved to Jackson to work at a hospital. Colleen stayed in Starkville, and the friends lost touch. 
The women reconnected in their 30s when Steelman moved home. In the years leading up to Colleen’s prison sentence, they were inseparable. 
“She’s one of those people when you see her, it’s like you were with her yesterday,” said Steelman. “It’s not like it’s been a couple years or something.” 
But their time together was cut short. Colleen went to prison in 2023 after receiving a 20-year prison sentence for selling drugs. About four months into her sentence, she was diagnosed with hepatitis C. 
Hepatitis C abounds in state prisons in the United States, where its prevalence is about nine times greater than the general population. This is due in part to the fact that risk factors for the infection, like injecting drugs, are the same as those that make people more likely to face incarceration, Dr. Anne Spaulding, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who studies hepatitis C in prisons, previously told Mississippi Today.

Colleen said she does not know how much damage the infection has caused to her liver. Medical staff do not share information about the disease’s progression, she said, leaving her largely in the dark about her condition. She receives “chronic care” check-ups every three months. 
In a year, she lost over a fifth of her body weight — a dramatic decline documented in her medical records — falling to 120 pounds in July. Colleen said her weight loss has continued since the summer.
“What are they going to do when I get down to 98?” she asked.
Weight loss is a possible symptom of hepatitis C, but it can be caused by a number of other factors. The only way to determine if a symptom like significant weight loss is connected to hepatitis C is to treat the infection, Strick said. 
The Department of Corrections’ hepatitis management policy obtained by Mississippi Today says it will provide treatment for people with hepatitis C diagnoses “when indicated.” But the Mississippi Department of Corrections has repeatedly declined to share information about how it determines which cases are worthy of treatment.
The limited information medical staff have shared with Colleen’s condition may be due in part to physicians’ own limitations on assessing the disease’s progression. 
It is difficult for doctors to determine the degree of damage hepatitis C has caused to a patient’s liver based on laboratory results until the disease is advanced, which is one reason it is best practice to treat the infection immediately, Strick said. By the time the test results clearly show liver scarring, the disease can have a higher risk of progressing to liver cancer or failure. 
“At that point, the harm is already done,” Strick said.
With little information about her own health, Colleen said she relies on Steelman, who has worked to obtain a copy of her medical records, researched her condition and contacted lawmakers to tell Colleen’s story in the hopes they might enact policy to help her. 
“She’s like my sister,” Colleen said. “Since I’ve been in here, she’s been my voice out there.” 
A ‘missed opportunity’
Colleen said the burden the infection has had on her mental health has been significant. 
“It makes me feel depressed,” she said. “Because, I mean, if I was at home, I could be treated.”
Untreated illness can also have severe mental health consequences for patients, Strick said, spurring “mental anguish” tied to not knowing what is causing one’s symptoms.
Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain said medical care is an important aspect of ensuring stability for people incarcerated in state prisons at a Sept. 24 legislative budget hearing.

“We have to doctor all the people that’s sick,” he said. “We stay on top of them about it because it’s also a stability thing for prison. If inmates are not seeing the doctor, then they’re complaining and griping and they’re upset and their families are, too. So it destabilizes us.” 
But Mississippi Today’s Behind Bars, Beyond Care series has uncovered alleged recurring instances of denied health care in Mississippi prisons, such as an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. 
Incarcerated people also have a constitutional right to health care under the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits “cruel and unusual punishment.” But in Mississippi, prisoners have fought for years for access to the highly effective antiviral medication — a “miraculous” treatment, in Strick’s words — for hepatitis C. 
Not treating illnesses also has consequences after incarceration, spurring more instability for patients when they come home, experts said. 
Dr. Shira Shavit, a clinical professor of family and community medicine at the University of California in San Francisco and the executive director of the Transitions Clinic Network, said failure to treat patients for diseases like hepatitis C while they are in prison is a “missed opportunity” that can help infectious disease spread and undermine a successful reentry process. 
“If people are sick or have medical issues that haven’t been addressed, it really upends their ability to successfully reintegrate into the community,” she said. 
And not treating a highly contagious infection leads to further spread of the disease inside and outside of the prison. At least 95% of people incarcerated in state prisons will one day be released. 
“From a public health perspective, what we don’t want is diseases that may be concentrated with the incarcerated population spilling out into the general population as people come home,” State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney said in a presentation to the state Legislature on prison health care in January. 
‘You lose your humanity’
Steelman misses Colleen, who she has not seen in over two years. It’s hard to be so far away from one another, but she said she believes Colleen should be held accountable for what she did. 
“I know it’s wrong. And I had no problem — of course I didn’t want it — but I had no problem with them arresting her and sending her to the pen, because it was against the law, she knew it was and she did it.”
But just as Colleen should be held accountable for her actions, Steelman said she believes Mississippi must uphold its constitutional responsibility to provide Colleen with medical care. 
Watching Colleen suffer — physically and mentally — from the dearth of care she has received has been heartbreaking, Steelman said. It has changed her perspective on law enforcement and the prison system, in spite of her background growing up in a law enforcement family and her deep patriotism. 
“I don’t see what I used to see,” Steelman said. “And I don’t like feeling that way … I did not know that they knew people were suffering. And they didn’t care.”
Steelman has one son and five grandsons. Ever since they were little, she said, she taught them to own up to their mistakes and bear the consequences of their actions. Colleen’s experience in the prison system — which Steelman sees as devoid of grace or forgiveness — has changed that. 
“I don’t tell them that no more,” Steelman said. “Because I know if they go (to prison) and they need even basic medical care, they’ll never get it. Cause you lose your humanity. The whole state, everybody in it, doesn’t even see you as a human being anymore.”
Even with Colleen far away, Steelman thinks of her often.

She stores a dozen porcelain heirloom “Gone with the Wind” dolls in a closet in her bedroom. They are one of the few possessions Colleen has lugged from house to house — “and trust me … she didn’t stay nowhere long,” Steelman said — to remember her mother, who also suffered from severe liver scarring.
Two years ago, Colleen asked Steelman to sell the dolls and put the money from the sale into her commissary account so she could afford to make phone calls to her family and friends. 
“I just couldn’t sell those dolls. I just couldn’t do it,” said Steelman, who said she knew how much they meant to Colleen.
Steelman, who lives on a limited income, said she sent Colleen $200 — her grocery money — and went to the food bank. 
“When she gets out of prison, I’m going to be there with her doll collection,” she said. 
But Steelman anticipates that day could come with more sorrow. 
Colleen “will be the only long-time friend I have left,” she said. “And I’ll probably have to take care of her and watch her suffer, too. And that’s not right. And then, here she is. Could be fixed. It’s not cancer, it’s something that could be healed.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/12121622/3X0A4763_2.jpg,,,2025-12-17 10:58:39.751982

(Photo by Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Department of Health failed to ensure workers at some nursing homes underwent background checks needed to ensure they did not have criminal records that disqualified them from the job, according to the federal inspector general.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services inspector general found that more than a quarter of the staff screened at 12 New Jersey nursing homes began working before they had a background check, never had one, or could not be shown to have one.
“These deficiencies and potential deficiencies occurred because New Jersey’s sampling of employees during its nursing home recertification surveys did not provide adequate coverage. Also, nursing homes did not have sufficient procedures to ensure that background checks were properly conducted for all staff members,” a new inspector general’s report says. “This put residents at risk of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or mistreatment.”
Though federal law does not explicitly require nursing home workers to undergo criminal background checks, it bars nursing homes from employing individuals convicted of or disciplined for abusing residents.
The audit examined how 12 nursing homes conducted background checks of their employees in 2022. The probe examined checks for 10 workers at each nursing home. The audit notes that the chosen nursing homes are not representative of the industry statewide.
Nine nursing homes allowed 17 individuals to begin working before their background checks were completed, and four nursing homes did not conduct any background checks for six employees, the audit found. Another nursing home did not provide any documentation detailing background checks to federal authorities.
None of the employees missing background checks had histories that would have disqualified them, state officials said in a response to federal investigators.
The inspector general said New Jersey’s auditing process for nursing home workers was insufficient. The state surveyed five workers hired over the past four months at overseen sites to check their backgrounds and licensure.
Those processes have improved since. The state Department of Health told the inspector general it began screening all workers hired since its last inspection at a given site in June 2023 and would increase educational outreach to nursing homes in a further bid to boost compliance.
Acting New Jersey Health Commissioner Jeffrey Brown in a letter said the department did not have the authority to run criminal background checks on its own.
“If the NJDOH had authority to run background checks through the state police and FBI, NJDOH would have full compliance, and currently, NJDOH does not have that authority,” he said.
A report issued last week by acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh found different deficiencies at two South Jersey nursing homes, including an alleged $100 million-plus Medicaid scheme and chronic understaffing that led to widespread neglect, thousands of calls to police, two sexual assaults, and a death.
The findings followed reports in December 2024 and March 2023 that found other deficiencies at New Jersey nursing homes.
“Vulnerable people suffered unnecessarily because the owners decided to put the money in their pockets instead of paying for the staff to care for them,” Walsh said in a statement last week.

Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) speaks at a press conference condemning funding cancellations by House Republicans. Dec. 16, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. The Michigan Senate on Tuesday passed House Bill 4576, which would appropriate $634 million to state departments for fiscal year 2026 — offsetting nearly all of the funding that was cut by state House Republicans last week for $645 million in work projects. 
The decision by House leadership to employ a rarely-used provision in the law that allows the appropriations committee in either chamber of the legislature to unilaterally disapprove that funding has been heavily criticized, especially after the vote in the House Appropriations Committee was done with no testimony or debate. While that criticism has mostly come from Democrats, a number of Senate Republicans have broken ranks with their party to express concerns, including in Senate Appropriations Committee testimony on Tuesday.  
The vote on the Senate’s version of HB 4576 — a bill first passed by the House in June as just over $133 million specifically for the state’s Department of Education — showed these bipartisan concerns. Five Senate Republicans, Sens. Jon Bumstead (R-North Muskegon), John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs), Mark Huizenga (R-Walker), Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) and Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills), voted in favor of the supplemental spending bill, while 13 Republicans voted against it. 
The bill will now go back to the House, though it is unlikely that House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.), who has celebrated the funding disapprovals and slammed Republicans who have been critical of the cuts, will bring the bill to a vote. 
“Tonight, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate passed legislation to give House Republicans a second chance to do the right thing and let this funding — already negotiated, passed, and promised to organizations throughout the state — continue serving moms and babies, veterans, schools, children fighting cancer, and more,” said Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) in a statement from her office.
Among the nearly 80 organizations affected by the cuts were the Small Talk Children’s Advocacy Center, RxKids, Wayne State University College of Nursing, Michigan Community College Association and Maggie’s Wigs 4 Kids. 
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Around the same time as the vote to restore funding, Senate Democrats sent a letter to Attorney General Dana Nessel asking for her to weigh in on the constitutionality of the decision, with Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), writing that “scope of this action is unprecedented, and as such, it has raised serious questions about the legality” of the legislation being used. 
“As both a lawyer and a legislator, Matt Hall has taken oaths to uphold the constitution and serve and protect the people of Michigan but through a ruthless show of force and pure political gamesmanship, broke that oath last week,” Anthony said in a press release from the Senate Democrats. “The investments House Republicans so callously ripped away aren’t luxuries — they’re essential lifelines for people to survive.”  
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said in the press release, “Not only have Lansing Republicans violated the trust of Michiganders — we also are very concerned about the legality of their actions, and we’re holding them accountable.”
 “Michigan Senate Democrats are not going to sit idly by and watch as kids battling cancer, new moms struggling to make ends meet, and the communities we love and live in take the hit as House Republicans cruelly toy with their lives and the rule of law,” Brinks added.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3474-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 10:58:39.751982

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After initially filing a plea of no contest that wasn’t accepted when he didn’t attend his hearing, State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst has changed course and now plans to fight the allegation against him.
On Tuesday, the day before his rescheduled arraignment on a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace, McKeon filed a new plea of not guilty and waived his formal arraignment. The court accepted the plea and set his next court date for Jan. 26, ordering him to show up.

A legislative staffer accused the state lawmaker of groping her at an end-of-session party in May. The Nebraska State Patrol received a report in September that McKeon had allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said.
McKeon’s second arraignment was scheduled for Wednesday morning after his arraignment was delayed when he tried to file a no contest plea by written waiver. Lancaster County Court Judge Matthew Acton said a no contest plea must be submitted in person and postponed the arraignment one week.
A no contest plea would have allowed McKeon to accept any criminal penalties without formally admitting guilt and would waive his right to a trial.
McKeon’s attorney Perry Pirsch at one point called the disturbing the peace charge “a victory,” as the charge had been downgraded from public indecency, which the Patrol initially cited McKeon with.
Pirsch said disturbing the peace was more consistent with McKeon’s perspective of the incident and that he’d planned to plead no contest in hopes that he could put the matter behind him and focus on the upcoming legislative session.
Pirsch could not immediately be reached for comment about the changed plea.

McKeon has acknowledged that an exchange took place between him and a staffer after one of the Nebraska Legislature’s sine die parties this year, but argued his actions were not sexually charged. Pirsch has said McKeon “is guilty of nothing but a bad pun and pat on the back.”
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
Her attorney, Kathleen Neary, declined to comment on McKeon’s new plea, but noted her client is preparing a civil lawsuit against the senator.
McKeon, a married father of four, is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul.
Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign.
In the midst of his pending criminal trial, McKeon also faces possible expulsion from the Legislature.
The Legislature’s Executive Board, its group of 10 senators in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the legislative branch, voted unanimously Saturday to recommend McKeon’s expulsion.
Expulsion is the strongest disciplinary measure the board can recommend, but it requires a full vote of the Legislature to pass. This means the matter will likely come before lawmakers during the 60-day legislative session that begins in January. Expelling him would require the votes of 33 senators.
Executive Board Chair State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair has said the board concluded the expulsion recommendation was necessary “in light of a demonstrated pattern of behavior by Senator McKeon and not in response to a single isolated incident.”

(Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services)As the Walz administration clamps down on fraud in state-run Medicaid programs, service providers are fighting back in court.
At least half a dozen providers have sued the state Department of Human Services in recent months over suspended payments, which they say have either shut down their businesses or put them at existential risk, harming the clients who depend on their services.
One lawsuit filed in August in district court was dismissed in early December. In another suit in October, a personal care assistant filed suit and DHS resumed Medicaid payments a week later.
A lawsuit from a provider against DHS from September is ongoing, and three additional lawsuits were filed just last week.
The litigation is yet another fallout from the Walz administration’s focus on rooting out fraud in public programs after years of inaction, beginning with the now-notorious Feeding Our Future case that led to more than 75 federal charges and has since morphed into a wide-ranging Medicaid fraud investigation.
The stakes are significant: Successful litigation could encourage more providers to sue, which would complicate the administration’s efforts to thwart the burgeoning fraud scandal — and with it, Gov. Tim Walz’s 2026 reelection efforts.

A district court dismissed a lawsuit from Empathy Home Care in August in which the provider alleged that DHS stopped payments for its assisted living services starting in May but offered no evidence of fraud.
Michael Schwartz, Empathy Home Care’s attorney, said that “the state’s response to allegations of widespread fraud is being dealt with by just shutting payments off to a whole blanket of people, including Empathy, who’ve done nothing wrong.”
According to a court memo from the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, evidence gathered by DHS indicated that Empathy Home Care billed for services that it didn’t provide. The memo also said that DHS had evidence that Medicaid recipients went missing when services were supposed to be provided and overdosed without staff attempting to save them.
Much of Empathy’s legal argument rests on a new section in Minnesota statute that limits payment stoppages from all state agencies to 60 days if there’s evidence of fraud. But an older Minnesota statute, which applies specifically to Medicaid-funded services, allows DHS to impose sanctions on Medicaid providers until “the commissioner determines there is insufficient evidence of fraud by the individual or entity, or after legal proceedings relating to the alleged fraud are completed.”
The Minnesota 4th District Court ruled in early December that the older statute is in force, allowing DHS to continue to withhold payment beyond the 60 days allowed in the new statute. Historically, under the older statute, state and federal courts have not allowed Medicaid program providers the right to appeal payment sanctions.
Schwartz said that Empathy plans to appeal the court’s decision this week.
Integrated Community Supports provider sues
The three providers that filed lawsuits against DHS last week range in what services they provide and why DHS suspended their payments.
Bright Community Services says it helps more than 30 adults through Integrated Community Support services, a program that has been under scrutiny by DHS. The program started in 2021 and is designed to help disabled adults live more independently in apartments rather than in an institution.
Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS paused payments for some ICS providers starting in September and implementing a prepayment auditing process this month for 14 programs, including ICS.
DHS has withheld payments to 17 ICS providers as of late November. Bright Community Services was one of them — but, like Empathy Home Care, the business alleges that DHS suspended its payments without explanation. It also said that it asked DHS “on numerous occasions” for further explanation of the fraud allegation but received no response.
Bright Community Services has stopped offering services because it’s now unable to pay staff, according to the lawsuit. DHS has said that providers are still allowed to continue providing services while they stop payments.
“No business can reasonably be expected to do that,” reads the lawsuit from Bright Community Services.
A DHS spokesperson confirmed in a statement that all payments to Bright Community Services were suspended based on “credible allegations of fraud,” which have also been referred to law enforcement. The statement also said that payments may resume if the provider submits sufficient information to demonstrate that there was no fraud.
Lataa Elemo, who operates Bright Community Services, declined an interview request. So far, no providers have faced state or federal charges for defrauding ICS.
DHS investigating connections between different providers
DHS is also investigating and pausing payments for providers affiliated with other providers suspected of fraud.
Two Medicaid program providers partly owned by the same person, Suleiman Isse — Joy Home Healthcare and Hennepin Autism Center — filed a lawsuit against DHS in September over payments halted in June.
DHS said in a notice that it suspended payments to Hennepin Autism in part because it had evidence that the autism center participated in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, which the autism center denied. DHS additionally suspended payments to Joy Home Healthcare because of its shared ownership with Hennepin Autism.
That lawsuit is ongoing. The attorney representing the providers declined to comment.
Another provider, Agape Home Care Services, received a notice from DHS in September that the business was cut off from payments because of its affiliation with another provider under investigation for fraud, Healthy Living Home Care, according to another recent lawsuit.
Agape doesn’t provide ICS services but does provide other home- and community-based services, as well as nursing services, that are also paid through state-run Medicaid programs.
Michael Hunter, the co-owner of Agape, said that he owns 30% of Healthy Living Home Care but plays no part in the business operations of Healthy Living.
“Because someone has a stake in another company, you put another whole company on payment hold,” Hunter said. “We are not being accused of any wrongdoing, nothing like that.”
Since the payment hold started, Agape has had to stop providing services to all of its clients, Hunter said. The organization usually has 10 to 15 clients, many of whom have intense behavioral and medical needs and were sent to the hospital once services stopped, he said.
Hunter said that Healthy Living Home Care is still waiting to hear why their payments are being withheld. According to Hunter, DHS surveyed Healthy Living but “there was nothing on fraud” in the survey.
DHS and government officials have provided limited information, citing active investigations.
“Hopefully it’s understandable that we don’t want to be too forthcoming about what kinds of actions cause investigators to suspect someone is billing for services they didn’t provide, but in general we look for patterns of concern,” said a DHS spokesperson, in an email.
As in Empathy’s case, Agape’s lawsuit and another lawsuit recently filed by Benevolence LLC, an autism services provider, make the case that DHS can only stop payments for 60 days under the new statute.
A representative from Benevolence LLC declined to comment.
Federal investigators have charged one person for defrauding the autism program. The investigation emerged out of the Feeding Our Future investigation; state spending on autism services exploded by 3,000% in recent years.
Suing the state has been a successful strategy in the past
In yet another lawsuit, a personal care assistant alleged in October that her payments for taking care of her disabled son were suspended two years ago, and that she wasn’t given information or a timeline on DHS’s fraud investigation.
Joseph Dixon, the attorney for the personal care assistant, said that DHS “simply withdrew the payment suspension” rather than respond to the lawsuit, making the case moot.
Feeding Our Future, the nonprofit at the center of a $250 million scheme defrauding the federal government of pandemic money intended to feed children, filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the Minnesota Department of Education when the agency stopped processing applications for new meal sites. Feeding Our Future accused the agency of discriminating on the basis of race, national origin and religion.
Though the judge hearing the case never issued a written order for the Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future, he did say the state did not have authority to stop payments, according to a transcript of a 2021 hearing reviewed by the Star Tribune. Though stopped payments were outside of the purview of the lawsuit, which centered on meal site applications, MDE resumed payments six days later.
In 2022, MDE said in a statement that “the court made it clear that if MDE were to continue the legal fight to withhold payments, MDE would incur sanctions and legal penalties.”
MDE leaders also told reporters at the time that the department was, among other considerations, worried about tipping off the nonprofit to an ongoing FBI investigation by continuing to challenge payments after the lawsuit was settled.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-PHOTO-fraud-committee-MJ-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-17 11:58:41.041111

Research shows how current state and federal policies are affecting immigrant communities and California as a whole.,"The Partisan Divide on Immigration
California is home to 10.6 million immigrants, making up roughly 22% of the nation’s total immigrant population. An October 2025 survey of over 8,000 California registered voters conducted by the Possibility Lab as part of Berkeley’s IGS Poll shows mixed public opinion on immigration enforcement, with 51% opposing federal actions to reduce undocumented immigration and 61% opposing the deportation of all undocumented immigrants. However, these statewide averages mask a deeply partisan reality: Democrats overwhelmingly oppose current enforcement efforts and express concern about deportations adversely affecting California’s economy and culture, while only a small minority of Republicans share these concerns.
Beyond the partisan split, the survey reveals that immigration policies are hitting home for many Californians: nearly a quarter of voters report that they or someone close to them has been directly affected by current deportation efforts. In addition, approximately four in ten California voters say deportation efforts have made it less likely for people in their communities to send children to school, seek medical care, shop locally, go to work, or participate in community and religious activities.

The Intersection of Immigration and Health 
The real-world consequences of immigration policy extend beyond public opinion into everyday life. Research conducted in 2024 with Latino immigrant workers in California’s Inland Empire and Coachella Valley reveals the deep connections between immigration status and overall well-being.
Through focus groups and town halls with over 280 participants, Possibility Lab researchers identified 1,534 “Firsthand Indicators” of health and wellbeing—revealing that health encompasses far more than medical issues for immigrant communities. Economic stability emerged as participants’ top indicator of wellbeing, followed by mental health and access to health services.

The findings also highlight substantial barriers for this population, including limited access to medical care and health insurance, economic insecurity, and lack of accessible educational resources (especially in languages other than English or Spanish). As one participant described: “You work while going to college to pay your medical bills.”

Immigrants Build California
Finally, Latino workers play a crucial role in California’s economy, making up 39% of the state’s workforce, and one-third of this population is immigrants. These workers are heavily represented in sectors such as agriculture, construction, general maintenance, and food preparation.
The construction sector is a notable example: Immigrants comprise 41% of California’s construction workers and 50% of the state’s craftspeople. With California aiming to build 2.5 million homes by 2032, immigration policies are likely to have significant implications for the state’s ability to address its housing shortages. In 2025, 62% of construction firms reported difficulty filling hourly craft worker positions. Immigration enforcement is one reason that construction firms report difficulty in finding workers, especially those with specific skillsets. 
Community Messengers Build Trust 
California is taking steps to support immigrant communities. During COVID-19, state government agencies recognized that traditional approaches to workplace health and safety education often failed to reach vulnerable populations, including the state’s immigrants. The COVID-19 Workplace Outreach Program (CWOP) distributed funding to community-based organizations who could serve as “trusted messengers,” reaching workers who experience significant barriers to accessing information due to language access, fear of retaliation, or concerns about immigration enforcement.
Between 2023 and 2024, the program (now called the California Workplace Outreach Program) provided more than $25 million to 76 community-based organizations across six regions of California, focusing on high-risk industries such as agriculture, food processing, warehousing, and janitorial services: covering a combined total of 2.5 million California workers. Through these community-based trusted messengers, California  recorded roughly 5 million touchpoints with workers across the state, including about 830,000 in-depth interactions focused on workplace rights and protections.

In the coming years, the state will continue to fund organizations who can provide culturally-tailored outreach to immigrants and other vulnerable communities. In addition, the state is building on the success of CWOP by developing and implementing a broader strategy for agricultural outreach and rural strategic engagement. As California navigates the increasingly complex intersection of immigration policies and community wellbeing, this much is clear: what happens in immigrant communities can ripple throughout California, shaping the economic health, wellbeing, and social fabric of the state.

At the time of the fire, McDonough — a cardiologist formerly with Mat-Su Regional Medical Center — was on $50,000 bail after being arrested on Dec. 11 and accused of owning child sexual abuse images. 
The alleged crimes, and the bail posted by McDonough’s wife, were reported by the Anchorage Daily News on Friday, a day after the medical center fired him. 
The fatal fire at McDonough’s home took place Saturday; McDonough was initially listed as missing after the fire, but firefighters found human remains at the site, and preliminary testing later identified McDonough’s body. 
The cause of the fire remains under investigation, and the other people who lived at the home were unharmed.
Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed McDonough to the state medical board in August. That month, he joined other members of the medical board in voting to impose restrictions on medical care for transgender youth in the state and to recommend that Alaska lawmakers end legal access to abortion in the late stages of pregnancy.
McDonough subsequently appeared to drop off the board; he attended its August and September meetings but was absent from its October and November ones, public records show.
Because of absences and unfilled seats, the board — which regulates doctors and other medical professionals in Alaska — has had problems finding a quorum needed to do business.
McDonough’s name was removed from the board’s roster in November. A spokesperson for Dunleavy told the Anchorage Daily News that the governor’s office found out about McDonough’s alleged crimes on Friday and was not aware of any investigations at the time of his appointment.
According to an affidavit submitted in Palmer courts by a Department of Homeland Security officer, the online file storage company Dropbox sent a tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on July 31.
That tip led to the investigation of a Dropbox account linked to McDonough that contained a video of a child being sexually abused. A second tip followed another video on Aug. 10.
The Anchorage Police Department, in charge of investigating tips like those received by the National Center, obtained a search warrant for McDonough’s Dropbox, GCI and Google accounts. Subsequent searches found additional suspect videos, and McDonough’s computer was seized during a search warrant on Dec. 11, shortly before his arrest. 
The Alaska Beacon typically publishes copies of court affidavits but is not doing so in this case because of their graphic contents and because they describe acts of sexual violence against children.
McDonough’s next court appearance was scheduled for Jan. 31.

Kristey Williams opened a Tuesday committee hearing by stating her intention to promote educational excellence, “review and highlight anything that may have been a deterrent to that” and examine whether diversity, equity and inclusion serves the greater good.
She said true diversity is weakened when policies sort people into groups and when dissenting viewpoints are discouraged rather than encouraged.
She said her goal was to determine whether DEI creates less inclusive environments or suppresses free speech.
But as the hearing unfolded, it became apparent that Republicans have identified the next target in their anti-DEI crusade: curriculum.
Williams, an Augusta Republican and chairwoman of the House Committee on Government Efficiency,  presented four examples as evidence of DEI practices in Kansas universities despite state and federal rules against them. She included the Kansas Board of Regents’ free expression statement, which was last updated in 2021. She discussed a 2022 invitation from the Federalist Society chapter at the University of Kansas School of Law to the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal and advocacy organization. Administration condemned the invitation and DEI staff at the time scolded chapter members, Williams said. Conservative Kansas Supreme Court Justice Caleb Stegall withdrew his professorship in the wake of the incident.
Williams also played an anonymous video clip containing mention of services for LGBTQ+ students, including hormone therapy for students ages 19 and older, but those services were omitted from official communications, according to Williams, who did not disclose the identity or affiliation of the video’s subject.
She included descriptions of requisite English courses at Kansas State University, which included what she viewed as DEI language.
She said her findings beg a question about potential instructional bias.
Williams said later in the hearing: “It’s just when one viewpoint is required or pushed or so predominant in regular courses that it becomes a concern.”
The Legislature passed DEI-related mandates in 2024 and this year. The 2024 law directed universities to eradicate DEI within admissions and hiring practices, and a 2025 provision required all state agencies, including universities, to eliminate positions, mandates, programs, activities, training requirements, grants and contracts related to DEI.
Curricula at Kansas universities have been exempt from state and federal efforts to stifle DEI principles, but some Republican legislators are eager to change that.
A lineup of university higher-ups recounted at the hearing recently disbanded LGBTQ+ centers, eliminated STEM scholarships for women, reworked policy manuals and shuttered DEI offices in service of compliance with state and federal mandates targeting practices that are perceived by some as exclusionary and unequal. Funding, on state and federal levels, for universities has been threatened if universities don’t comply with the mandates.
The cost, for Democratic Rep. Barbara Ballard of Lawrence, wasn’t financial.
“There was a cost by individuals on campus that felt discriminated against, that felt this may not have been the right thing to do. I think there’s always a cost and it’s not only always financial,” said Ballard, who has served in various roles at the University of Kansas since 1980.
As DEI practices have grown on college campuses, opposition efforts have risen in popularity in conservative circles.
Kansas Board of Regents president and CEO Blake Flanders said the Legislature’s guidance in recent years had been clear. The board, which governs Kansas universities and colleges, advised its public universities to comply with those laws, along with federal directives, which resulted in the end of programs, positions and practices. Among the most visible were the eradication of pronouns in university staff and faculty email signatures.
However, the Legislature’s mandates left curricula untouched.
The statutory framework of the 2024 law specifically did not apply to curricula, Flanders said.
He said the board did not interpret the 2025 provision as applying to curricula because state agencies other than universities don’t have courses. Plus, applying the provision in classrooms would have conflicted with the 2024 law, Flanders said.
Doug Girod, chancellor of KU, Marshall Stewart, executive vice president of K-State, Richard Muma, president of Wichita State University, and Ken Hush, outgoing president of Emporia State University, recounted a list of changes in response to anti-DEI mandates.
Despite the changes, three legislators who are not on the committee presented personal observations of existing DEI components within Kansas universities.
Rep. Megan Steele, a Manhattan Republican, showed online examples of language and practices that didn’t adequately eradicate DEI rhetoric. She repeatedly took issue with terms such as “multicultural,” “diversity,” “oppression,” “social justice,” “intersectionality,” “belonging,” and “anti-racism,” which appeared on university websites and in policies.
Lawmakers reviewed model legislation from conservative advocacy group the Goldwater Institute that prohibits mandatory classes containing DEI or critical race theory curricula, establishes required courses that teach “the founding principles of our constitutional republic” and bars higher education institutions from requiring exercises in DEI, critical race theory or identity politics.
The members on the majority Republican committee held a range of viewpoints. The four Democrats on the committee questioned the intent and motivations of the topic of the day. After viewing the model legislation, Rep. Dan Osman of Overland Park cautioned the committee about the direction the majority was going.
“It’s not our responsibility to oversee topics of individual classrooms,” Osman said. “It’s not our responsibility to implement changes from the federal government on behalf of the federal government. To do so, I would consider to be a serious violation of the First Amendment, and it would open us up to countless legal challenges.”
Kansas law does not contain a definition of DEI, and the committee struggled to come up with one.
“You can’t just ban the word diversity from a website and call it a day,” Osman said.
Even if DEI were clearly defined, legal challenges remain a risk, he said.
Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican, said he favored eliminating DEI courses that are part of college student’s general studies prerequisites but was not opposed to keeping those courses available later in a student’s degree.
By the end of the hearing, Ballard, who had expressed her discomfort with the nature of the committee’s conversation at the beginning, said that discomfort had dissipated.
At the onset, Ballard, who is Black, said she had never felt as uncomfortable in her 32 years in the Legislature as she did then.
“Because we have to defend everything that happened before and forget 1865. Forget slavery. Forget when one person was admitted to a school and everyone else left,” she said.
She added: “A lot of people cannot forget what happened. History follows us. History lives. History does not die.”
In the committee’s final minutes, she said she shifted from uncomfortable to intrigued by what people had to say from their perspectives. She was left thinking about the broader polarization and racism “that no one wants to talk about” underneath disagreements over DEI.
“Usually the Legislature does not have a really good discussion,” Ballard said, “and, I have to say, we have had that today — a really good discussion about how things are.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC160219-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-17 10:00:17.575669

John Larson described rival Luke Bronin as variously hostile or indifferent to unions during his eight years as mayor of Hartford.,"Congressman John B. Larson, a long-serving Democrat facing his first serious challenge for renomination, opened a new phase in his campaign Wednesday with an attack describing his best-financed rival, Luke Bronin, as variously hostile or indifferent to unions during his eight years as mayor of Hartford.
Accompanied by endorsements from leaders of unions representing government workers, construction trades and machinists, Larson’s campaign portrayed the congressman as a reliable ally of labor and opponent to President Donald J. Trump’s reductions in the federal workforce.
“From defending collective bargaining rights to creating good-paying union jobs, I have always been in labor’s corner,” Larson said in a statement. “Now, as Trump and his allies intensify their attacks on unions and working families, we need leaders who fight for workers every single day, not just when it’s convenient.”
Larson’s campaign accused Bronin of “union busting,” quoting old news coverage of the municipal union leaders who objected to the mayor’s first-year demands for cost-cutting and concessions to avert bankruptcy by the financially struggling capital city in 2016.
It also capitalizes on the lingering resentment by the Hartford building trades over what one union executive says was Bronin’s unwillingness to push for union-friendly labor agreements on projects in Hartford by private developers or institutions, including Hartford Hospital.
“Did he go out of his way to kill us? No. But did he go out of his way to help us? No,” Joe Toner, the former director of the Hartford Building Trades Council and current director of the State Building Trades Council, said in an interview. “When the bell rang, he never was standing next to us. John was the opposite.
Toner acknowledged that a city library project begun during Bronin’s administration were done by a project-labor agreement, as were school projects originated by a predecessor and finished by Bronin. But overall the trades found the mayor to be more amenable to the desires of developers. 
The building trades endorsements are not new. Toner first made his support clear at Larson’s campaign kickoff in September, and the Hartford council endorsed Larson in August. 
But how Larson is now framing the endorsements is the strongest effort to date by his campaign to draw a distinction with Bronin, whom he evidently views as his chief rival for the party’s nomination in the solidly blue 1st Congressional District of Hartford and 26 suburbs.
Bronin quickly raised nearly $1.2 million after opening his campaign in July, slightly exceeding what Larson had raised all year.
Larson, 77, of East Hartford never has faced a Democratic primary since winning the open 1st Congressional District seat in 1998, leaving him without a well-oiled campaign structure as a string of Democratic challengers opened campaigns beginning on July 3 with a Hartford school board member, Ruth Fortune.
She was followed by Jack Perry, a former Southington councilman who dropped out of the race Monday, then Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, a four-term lawmaker who has resisted any suggestion the contest is a two person-race.
“There are a lot of people interested in making this a two-man race, but we need new kinds of leaders in Washington if we’re ever going to change anything,” Gilchrest said Monday after Perry dropped out. “I’m running to make a difference and I’m not going anywhere.”
All of the challengers are between 30 and 40 years younger than Larson, who has seen several political contemporaries opt for retirement, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. None of the challengers have faulted Larson’s liberal, pro-labor voting record, instead insisting it is time for new leaders in a struggling Democratic Party.
The challengers, like the four Democratic town committee leaders from Berlin, Rocky Hill, Wethersfield and Windsor who endorsed Bronin last month, generally have been respectful of Larson.
“I have tremendous respect for Congressman Larson and everything he has done for our district, but this is the right time to pass the torch to a new generation, just like Speaker Pelosi and so many other Democrats are doing,” said Julie Erickson, the acting DTC chair of Berlin.
Larson has been endorsed by the six other members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation, all Democrats. The labor endorsements Wednesday include the International Association of Machinists, which represent workers at Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford. Larson’s used the IAM hall in East Hartford for his campaign kickoff.
Until Wednesday, Larson largely had ignored the challengers.

Toner faulted Bronin for not pushing the Capital Regional Development Authority to insist on project-labor agreements in the housing projects it funded downtown or in the reconstruction of Dillon Stadium, now home to a professional soccer franchise.
“Wherever we had the ability on publicly funded projects, from hundreds of millions of dollars of school construction to new libraries, we did that work under project labor agreements,” Bronin said Wednesday.
But the margins on housing are especially tight, he said.
“We are a state and city with a housing crisis, and a city that was at the time struggling to attract any investment at all,” Bronin said. “We had a basic choice, whether to make it possible to get housing built or not, and I’m proud that for the first time in many years, we got a lot of housing built.”
This campaign is not the first in which the trades have opposed Bronin. In 2019, the construction unions backed Eddie A. Perez, the former mayor who was attempting a comeback after a corruption scandal forced his resignation. Bronin easily defeated Perez, winning a second term.
With Larson, the support by the construction unions predates his time in Congress. The trades, which have 30,000 members and are generally seen as effective players in campaigns, backed Larson in 1998, when he won the congressional seat in a tight race with the favored Miles Rapoport, the liberal secretary of the state, and others.
“I have deep respect for all of the members of the building trades, and I understand that Joe Toner and building trades leadership have relationships that go back many, many decades with John Larson,” Bronin said. 
Bronin said he would fight in Congress for the “building trades, for working class and middle class families across that district, and that’s going to include a focus on trying to make sure that we actually get new infrastructure built, that we actually accelerate the pace of housing construction, and that we actually focus on key cost of living issues like health care and electricity.”
Toner said he had little doubt that Bronin’s voting record in Congress would be different from Larson’s. But that was a reason to remain loyal to Larson and his nearly 28 years of contacts and seniority in Congress, Toner said.
“Every vote is going be identical,” Toner said. “All you are doing is forgoing the seniority. You are going from the head of the table to the broom closet.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LARSON-KICKOFF-0912-DE-Sony-150-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 10:00:17.575669

A Linn County woman representing workers at airport eateries throughout Iowa has filed a potential class action lawsuit against her employer alleging violations of state and federal wage-and-hour laws.
Tara Hill is suing SSP America CID, a limited liability corporation that does business in Iowa as part of SSP America Inc., the American division of SSP Group, which is a global company that partners with restaurants to operate food and beverage concessions in airports, railway stations and other travel locations.
The lawsuit accuses SSP America CID of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act’s requirements and a resulting failure to pay employees the federally mandated minimum wage for all hours worked.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under the tip-credit provision of the FLSA, an employer of tipped employees may, under certain circumstances, pay its employees less than the minimum wage by claiming a “tip credit” against the minimum wage, with the credit based on the amount of tips the employees collect from customers.
The FLSA sets forth a series of strict requirements for employers to utilize the “tip credit” and provides that an employer cannot pay less than the minimum wage to tipped employees while also requiring those employees to perform unrelated work that doesn’t generate tips.
According to the lawsuit, SSP America CID failed to inform Hill of its reliance on the tip credit; made illegal deductions that reduced the direct wage of Hill or others below the minimum required hourly wage for tipped employees; required workers to purchase specific clothing for work, indirectly reducing their wages to a level below the minimum hourly wage;  and required workers to perform “excessive amounts” of non-tipped work, such as preparing food, washing dishes and cleaning floors.
The lawsuit asserts that as a result of the alleged violations, SSP America CID “has lost the ability to use the tip credit and therefore must compensate” its workers for the difference between the wages paid and the actual minimum wage.
According to the lawsuit, Hill worked for the company as a server, bartender and cook at the Eastern Iowa Airport in Cedar Rapids airport from August 2023 to September 2025. The lawsuit alleges she was paid $6.75 per hour.

The law firm Fitzgerald, Alvarez and Ciummo has earned a nickname: The WalMart of public defense. 
Over three decades, the firm has won county contracts to provide poor people with criminal defense in the state’s rural stretches. It’s done so by making aggressively low bids. 
Old iterations of the firm’s website asked local politicians what they might do with all the money they could save on public defense: “Better schools? Better fire protection? More police? Improved roads? More parks?” 
Today, nearly half of California counties pay private lawyers and firms to represent poor people in criminal cases. Most of them do it through what’s known as a “flat-fee” contract, meaning they pay a fixed amount, regardless of how many cases the attorneys handle or how much time they spend on each case. 
As CalMatters investigative reporter Anat Rubin details, these arrangements so clearly disincentivize investigating and litigating cases that they’ve been banned in other parts of the country. 
But they have flourished in California. 
In San Benito County, for example, a state evaluation found that Ciummo attorneys barely spoke with their clients and seldom filed legal motions on their behalf. 
Defendants asked them to contest the prosecution’s evidence, to interview witnesses, to do anything, really, to challenge law enforcement’s narrative of the crime. Instead, they ushered almost all of them to plea deals. 
Even some law enforcement leaders — the people trying to put the Ciummo firm’s clients behind bars — are raising the alarm. They say they’re not being challenged like they should be in a functioning system.

GOP begins legal fight against Prop. 50

On Monday the Trump administration and California Republicans made their arguments challenging Proposition 50 before a panel of federal judges, kicking off the court battle over California’s voter-approved gerrymandering efforts, write CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller and Mikhail Zinshteyn.
Republicans say that Prop. 50’s congressional maps violate the 14th and 15th amendments because race, they argue, was used as a factor in determining district lines. They are seeking a preliminary injunction on the maps before Dec. 19 — the date when candidates can start collecting signatures to get on the 2026 primary ballot — to temporarily ban the use of the maps in an election.
Prop. 50 supporters argue that the maps were drawn to create a partisan advantage for Democrats, and it was only incidental if the maps lent any outsized influence to certain ethnic or racial groups.
Prop. 50 opponents face an uphill battle, given that the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld Texas’ redrawn maps by overturning a lower court’s finding that the Texas GOP committed unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.

Seeking solutions to a sewage crisis

Members of the California legislature brought together policymakers and scientists during a joint environmental committee hearing last week, which explored how the state can tackle the Tijuana River sewage crisis, reports CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.
During the hearing, lawmakers and others reviewed how neglect, failed infrastructure and industrial waste created the decadeslong environmental disaster. They discussed potential mitigating solutions such as updating air quality standards; improving working conditions for those who are exposed to the pollution; and holding companies accountable for their role in polluting the river. 

State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, an Encinitas Democrat who led the hearing: “What is happening in the Tijuana River Valley is an international, environmental disaster that undermines everything that California stands for. … The sewage flowing into San Diego County’s coastline is poisoning our air and water, harming public health, closing beaches and killing marine life.”

This year, the U.S. repaired and expanded a San Diego wastewater treatment plant, while Mexico repaired a plant near the border. But more work is still required, including at the Imperial Beach shoreline, which has remained closed for years. On Monday the U.S. and Mexico signed an agreement addressing the crisis.

December is full of reasons to bake, and December 18 adds an official one to the calendar. National Bake Cookies Day arrives just a week before Christmas, making it the perfect moment to turn on the oven, revisit family recipes, and lean into the sweet traditions that define the season.  CupKate’s Bakery shares family-style cookies in Greenville.
For many households, holiday baking is rooted in familiar favorites made year after year. It is also the time when kitchens fill with cookies destined for cookie exchanges, classroom parties, and neighborhood swaps, where everyone brings their specialty and goes home with a box of variety. At the same time, specialty cookies from local bakeries often play a role in celebrations, gifts, and gatherings. That mix of homemade and handcrafted treats is part of what keeps the season feeling special.
“Our customers are drawn to sugar cookies with royal icing and buttercream icing, hand-decorated like polar bears, snowmen, reindeer, presents, and all things holiday related,” said Kati Singley, owner of CupKate’s Bakery. “People tend to stick to baking the traditional cookies at home, but use those specialty cookies for family treats, presents, and hostess gifts.”
CupKate’s Bakery, located at 4001 Kennett Pike in Greenville, has been serving custom cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and other desserts since opening in 2022. During the holidays, the bakery’s detailed sugar cookies add a festive touch to celebrations across the area, complementing the classic cookies many families still prefer to bake themselves.
In honor of National Bake Cookies Day, here are ten Christmas cookie classics that continue to show up on holiday trays, cookie exchanges, and dessert tables year after year.

Sugar cookies
A holiday staple, perfect for rolling, cutting, and decorating with icing and sprinkles.
Gingerbread cookies
Spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cloves, these cookies are closely tied to Christmas traditions.
Chocolate chip cookies
A year-round favorite that always earns a spot on holiday dessert tables.
Peanut butter blossoms
Soft peanut butter cookies topped with a chocolate kiss and instantly recognizable.
Snickerdoodles
Rolled in cinnamon sugar and baked until just set, warm and comforting.
Thumbprint cookies
Buttery cookies with centers filled with jam, chocolate, or caramel.
Shortbread cookies
Simple, rich, and crumbly, often shaped or dipped in chocolate for the holidays.
Molasses cookies
Soft and chewy with deep spice flavor and crackled tops.
Spritz cookies
Pressed into festive shapes like trees and wreaths using a cookie press.
Linzer cookies
Delicate sandwich cookies filled with jam and dusted with powdered sugar.

National Bake Cookies Day may only last one day, but the tradition of baking and sharing cookies stretches throughout the season. Whether baking for a cookie exchange, filling tins for friends and neighbors, or picking up a few specialty treats from a local bakery, December 18 is a reminder that some of the simplest traditions are also the sweetest.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_IMG_1818_VSCO-2-e1765979443836.jpg,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547

(Photo provided by Clemons' campaign)A Louisville union president kept a Kentucky Senate seat in Democratic hands in Tuesday’s special election. The party heralded what it characterized as Gary Clemons’ overperformance in the district as a sign of growing support for Democrats. 
Clemons, the president of the Steelworkers Local 1693, won the election for the 37th Kentucky Senate District with about 72% of the vote, according to unofficial results. The Republican candidate who previously sought the seat, retired Army veteran Calvin Leach, received 25% of the vote. 
Overall, 5,181 votes were cast in the special election.
“Tonight, the people of Senate District 37 sent a clear message: they want a fighter in Frankfort who will stand up for working families, not corporate interests and greed,” Clemons said in a statement. “I’m honored by the trust voters have placed in me, and I’m ready to go fight for jobs, childcare, healthcare, and all the things Kentucky’s working families need. For far too long Wall Street greed has crushed working families in Frankfort. This is just the beginning of reclaiming our state for regular working people.”
The Louisville Democratic Party nominated Clemons to run for the seat, which opened after former Senate Democratic Whip David Yates was appointed as Jefferson County clerk earlier this year. Yates had launched a campaign for the local office in the spring, but it became vacant after late Republican Jefferson County Clerk Bobbie Holsclaw died in September. 
Kentucky’s top Democrat, Gov. Andy Beshear, said online that Clemons’ victory continued “the trend of Democrats outperforming previous elections by wide margins all over the country.” 
By comparison, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the district by six points in the 2024 election. Yates was also on the ballot in the district last year, and received 60% of the vote to Leach’s 40%. About 42,000 ballots were cast in that election. 
Shortly after Louisville Republicans nominated Leach for this year’s election, Louisville Public Media reported on his previous blog posts that said “‘millennial females’ aren’t ‘wife material’ and described the ‘vast majority of young women’ as ‘promiscuous skanks’ with no moral compass.”
Clemons will join a Democratic caucus with six seats in the Kentucky Senate. Republicans hold 32 seats, as well as a supermajority in the House. The 2026 legislative session begins in early January. 
Louisville Democrat Sen. Gerald Neal, the minority floor leader, said in a statement that Clemons’ campaign was “authentic, grounded in working people’s real struggles, and unafraid to call out the policies that are hurting Kentucky families.” 
“The Kentucky Senate Democratic Caucus Campaign Committee invested in this race because we knew Gary’s message would resonate,” Neal added. “Tonight proves that when we organize, invest in infrastructure, and run on what matters to people’s lives, we win.” 
Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Colmon Elridge said in a statement that South Louisville voters sent a message that “they are fed up with Republicans ignoring, undermining and demeaning the workers that have built Kentucky’s economy, and want their elected leaders to focus on affordability, common sense and compassion.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gary-Clemons-Victory-Night-KY-SD-37-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547

But, as the story of one law firm shows, they have flourished in the Golden State.","For three years, the fate of poor people accused of crimes in San Benito County lay in the hands of attorneys who barely spoke with their clients and seldom filed legal motions on their behalf. 
While defendants asked them to contest the prosecution’s evidence, to interview witnesses, to do anything, really, to challenge law enforcement’s narrative of the crime, they ushered almost all of them to plea deals instead, averaging just one jury trial for every 1,500 cases.
The attorneys worked for Fitzgerald, Alvarez and Ciummo, the firm that San Benito paid to provide public defense. According to a 2024 state evaluation, they were not doing a good job. Two of the attorneys had inappropriate relationships with clients, another struggled with addiction.
The situation had deteriorated so dramatically that the San Benito district attorney, Joel Buckingham, found himself worrying about the people his office was trying to send to prison. Their attorneys didn’t contest the evidence Buckingham’s prosecutors presented, no matter how it was obtained. Each year, they filed an average of just 10 motions to suppress evidence based on violations of constitutional rights — including unjustified stops and searches, illegal interrogations, and arrests without probable cause.  
“Police officers must make mistakes sometimes,” Buckingham told a researcher conducting the evaluation. 
The sheriff, Eric Taylor, was also alarmed. If his deputies were never challenged in court, how would they know when they had crossed a line? What would stop them from doing it again? 
In Taylor’s previous job, in Santa Cruz County, the courthouse was often packed with law enforcement officers who had been called to defend their actions. 
“If we’re doing our job correctly, then we prevail on those motions,” he told San Benito county supervisors last year.  “And if we’ve made a mistake, and we’re doing our job incorrectly, we’re held accountable for that.”

Nearly half of California counties pay private lawyers and firms to represent poor people in criminal cases, and most of them, like San Benito, do it through what’s known as a “flat-fee” contract, meaning they pay a fixed amount, regardless of how many cases the attorneys handle or how much time they spend on each case. 
It’s a far cheaper alternative — at least in the short run — to operating a public defender office with government lawyers, and it’s created a second-tier justice system in rural stretches of the state: Seven of the eight counties with the state’s highest jail and prison incarceration rates have flat-fee contracts. 
These arrangements so clearly disincentivize investigating and litigating cases that they’ve been banned in other parts of the country. But they have flourished in California, which provides no funding or oversight of county-level public defense.

Fitzgerald, Alvarez and Ciummo, commonly known as the Ciummo firm, has become the face of this model. Old iterations of the firm’s website asked local politicians what they might do with all the money they could save on public defense: “Better schools? Better fire protection? More police? Improved roads? More parks?” The message was clear: Don’t waste county money helping people accused of crimes. Spend it on the things your constituents actually care about. 
Over the past 30 years, the Ciummo firm has provided public defender services in nine California counties. Both its size and tactics have earned it a reputation as the Wal-Mart of public defense. “This is a high-volume, low-profit business for me,” Richard Ciummo told a reporter in 2007. “It’s more like a grocery store.” 
The firm left San Benito last year, but it is still the primary public defender in Madera, Amador and Calaveras counties, and it handles cases in Fresno and Merced counties when the public defender’s office has a conflict. 
CalMatters reviewed documents detailing the firm’s work in these counties and found that its lawyers were less likely than other defense attorneys to investigate their cases, challenge the prosecutors’ evidence in legal motions and push their cases to trial. 
In Madera, the percentage of felonies the firm took to a jury trial between 2019 and 2024 was half the statewide average. During three of those years, the firm reported caseloads that were more than double even the most permissive standards for how many cases one attorney should be allowed to handle. Those numbers do not account for the fact that some of the firm’s attorneys simultaneously represent private clients.

Michael Fitzgerald, the firm’s senior partner, said his firm provides a more affordable, though no less effective, alternative to an institutional public defender’s office. 
“Could we use more funding? Certainly,” he said. “But I think we do as good as anybody. I think we do better than public defenders’ offices.”
Fitzgerald said criticism of the contract system stems from longstanding bias and a romanticization of ardent public defenders — the true believers, he calls them — who push back against individual and systemic injustices.
The scenes playing out in criminal courts across the country have seldom resembled that ideal. Many institutional public defender offices are so severely outgunned that their lawyers are unable to put up a real fight. 
In 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union settled a lawsuit with Fresno County over its failure to adequately fund its institutional office, where government lawyers carried caseloads three times the recommended limit. In Merced, the institutional public defender’s office has 15 staff attorneys and no full-time investigators — the worst ratio in the state, according to the most recent data from the California Department of Justice. 
But the shortcomings that sometimes plague government offices are all but guaranteed in a for-profit, flat-fee system. 
“For it to be worthwhile for this firm to do this, its partners and shareholders have to be taking in enough money to make it profitable for them,” said Eve Primus, a University of Michigan law professor. “And the only way to do that is to cut back on expenses that are required for effective representation. I just don’t know how the math works out otherwise.”

The nation’s first public defender office opened its doors in Los Angeles in 1913, the result of a decades-long advocacy effort led by Clara Shortridge Foltz, the first woman to be admitted to the bar in California. By the time the U.S. Supreme Court established a right to an attorney in state court criminal proceedings in 1963, more than a dozen California counties were operating their own public defender systems.
But as other states funneled money to government-run public defender offices, California left its system in the hands of the counties. Elected officials in many of those counties would eventually opt for the cheapest path — a flat-fee contract.
In 1984, only nine of California’s 58 counties relied on contractors for their primary public defense systems, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report published that year. Today, that number is 25. 
If Foltz were to return, “she would find a criminal justice system that has broken faith with one of its fundamental underlying premises: the presumption of innocence,” wrote Larry Benner, a California Western School of Law professor, in a 2010 report examining the state’s public defender offices.
She would be alarmed to discover, Benner wrote, that across California, “justice is now up for sale to the lowest bidder.”

The Ciummo firm wasn’t built by people who saw themselves as protectors of the accused, but by people who had wanted to be on the other side of the courtroom, with the prosecutors. 
The firm’s founder, John Barker, began his career in law enforcement. He was one of a dozen sheriff’s deputies indicted on charges of using excessive force during the 1969 People’s Park protests in Berkeley, and later served as police chief for the small town of Huron in Fresno County. He went to law school to become a prosecutor. Instead, he began working with a lawyer who had a contract with Madera County to provide public defense.
During an unsuccessful campaign for judge in 1986, he told a Fresno Bee reporter, “I don’t have a lot of sympathy for the criminals.”
Two years later, in 1988, he submitted the winning bid for Madera’s public defense contract. He hired Ciummo, who had recently been fired from the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office for practicing law after losing his license, and together they represented poor people accused of crimes in the county. 
Barker was the face of the firm in those early years. He wore a cowboy hat and boots. He was the kind of guy you wanted to have a drink with, said Manuel Nieto, who was hired by the firm in 1994.
“He could charm the socks off anybody,” Nieto said. “But he wasn’t an advocate.”
California had just passed one of the nation’s first three-strikes laws, which ratcheted up punishments for repeat offenders. Suddenly, defendants were facing long prison sentences for crimes that would previously have landed them in jail or on probation. 
Nieto said the firm didn’t have the capability — or the drive — to push back against these punitive measures. New attorneys didn’t get any training, he said. They had too many cases and too few resources. Investigations were rare. Nieto doesn’t remember ever using an expert. 
“That was my first job out of law school and I was like, ‘Holy shit, this is not good,’” he said. He left after six months to join the Fresno public defender’s office. 
Over the next two decades, the Ciummo firm expanded into other parts of the state, growing its business by underbidding the competition. In 1994, it offered to take over public defense services in Placer County for around half of what the existing contractor proposed.
County supervisors seemed eager to make the switch, but Placer’s judges objected. 
A dozen years later, the county put the contract out for bid again. The local firm asked for $28 million over four years. The Ciummo firm offered to do the job for $15 million, and it won the contract.
In each new county, the firm encountered opposition. Local attorneys and community members wrote letters to elected officials, spoke at public hearings and talked to newspaper reporters to express their belief that the firm’s low-cost model would diminish the quality of legal services.
That process played out most recently in Merced in 2017, when prosecutors joined members of the local chapter of the NAACP in urging county officials to reject the firm’s proposal. At a hearing on the issue, a defense investigator who had worked for the previous contractor warned the supervisors that “you get what you pay for.” 
Ciummo, seemingly accustomed to this kind of rhetoric, walked up to the podium to address the board.
“I am Mr. Ciummo,” he said. “I don’t have horns and a tail.”

On a hot, dry morning in late August, William Martinez was in the lobby of the Madera County Probation Department, waiting for someone to call his name. He had just been released from the local jail after posting bond, and his assault case was pending. 
Martinez’s next court date was a few weeks away, and he would be represented by a Ciummo attorney. The firm had represented Martinez on a previous charge, in 2023, and he didn’t have high hopes for how his latest case would turn out.
“They go through the motions as though you’re being represented, but you’re not,” he said. “They’re representing Madera County.”

It’s a sentiment defendants repeated in San Benito County, where the Office of the State Public Defender surveyed the firm’s clients and their families as part of an audit it released in 2024. 
Two-thirds of respondents who had been convicted of a felony said they spoke with their attorney for less than five minutes over the course of their case. Researchers found that the Ciummo lawyers working in the county had failed to add themselves to a list at the local jail that would allow them to have confidential calls with their clients.
“My brother feels like he’s going to lose his case because the public defender won’t answer his calls, won’t visit, won’t do any work for him,” one family member said.
Another said his brother’s attorney didn’t chase down evidence or interview witnesses. “They wouldn’t help him,” he said. “I had to go and be an investigator and get a statement.”
Many of the defendants felt they were being pushed to accept a guilty plea, and that the person who was supposed to be their voice in court was not interested in putting up a fight.
Shortly before the San Benito evaluation was published, Fitzgerald decided to pull his firm out of the county. He dismissed the report as biased.
“It was the typical, almost boilerplate report that the Office for the State Public Defender does, saying how contract public defenders are no good, and they should do away with them,” Fitzgerald said.
The Office of the State Public Defender, once tasked solely with death penalty appeals, expanded its work in response to the ACLU’s lawsuit in Fresno. It now provides training and support for county-based public defenders and periodically evaluates local systems. Its recommendations are not binding. 
The San Benito contract, Fitzgerald said, had been problematic from the start. He said he had lowered his bid at the county’s insistence, agreeing to fewer lawyers than he needed. 
“It was not a lucky county for us. So we got out of there,” he said. “San Benito had problems, but they weren’t created by us.”

This year, the California Legislature considered a bill that would ban flat-fee contracts, requiring counties to compensate lawyers and firms based on the demands of their cases. 
In a committee hearing, senators heard from Rudy Castillo, who had been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in 2008 for his participation in a robbery that ended in murder. 
Castillo had been represented by the Ciummo firm. He said his first attorney excused himself from his case because Castillo refused to accept a plea deal. “It was apparent that he didn’t want to waste his time trying to defend me,” he said.
The second attorney was unprepared for trial and seemed to lack “any motivation to argue my case,” Castillo said.  
“This attorney never hired an investigator. He never submitted any motions to protect my constitutional rights and challenge the Miranda violations of my case, or hired any experts to challenge the DA’s arguments.”
When a change in the felony murder law gave Castillo an opportunity to petition the court, his family hired a private attorney to help him. He was released in 2021.
By the time Castillo addressed the committee, the California Association of Counties had already registered its opposition to the measure, calling it an unfunded mandate. California is one of just two states that don’t contribute any funding to trial-level public defense, and the bill’s requirements would force counties with contract systems to significantly increase their public defense budgets. 
Josh Schwartz, a researcher with the Wren Collective, a nonprofit organization advocating for criminal justice reform and a supporter of  the proposed legislation, said an increase in spending on public defense could save the counties money in the long run. The flat-fee model, he said, “creates needless incarceration. People are in jail longer pre-trial, they are convicted at higher rates, and sentenced to longer sentences.”
“Most counties spend between four and seven times their indigent defense budget on incarceration,” he said. Investing more funding in public defenders “can yield much bigger savings down the line.”
The legislation stalled in the Senate Appropriations Committee, where the chair, Sen. Anna Caballero, said she would “have a hard time supporting the bill.” Rural counties, she said, “just don’t have the money.” Caballero’s district includes parts of Madera, Fresno and Merced — three counties where the Ciummo firm has contracts. The bill was put on hold until next year.

Fitzgerald is soft-spoken and smiles often. Before becoming a lawyer, he was a police officer in New Jersey. Like Barker and Ciummo, he had gone to law school to become a prosecutor. He interviewed with six or seven district attorneys’ offices, he said, before giving up on that dream and responding to a job posting from the Ciummo firm in 1991. 
He said the firm’s critics often fail to differentiate it from flat-fee systems in which individual private attorneys each contract directly with the county. These lawyers get to keep every dollar they don’t spend on investigations and experts. The Ciummo firm’s attorneys earn annual salaries and have access to staff investigators. When they hire forensic experts and other specialists, the county covers the cost from a separate fund.
Fitzgerald said the firm’s low trial rate in Madera is the result of prosecutors offering reduced punishments in plea deals, and not an indication that defense attorneys are avoiding taking cases to a jury. 
“The attorneys in Madera, they’re aggressive,” he said. “They’re not afraid to do trials.”
Their high caseloads, he said, do not prevent them from advocating for their clients. “Is it perfect? No. But our attorneys work very hard to make sure every client is adequately represented, no matter what the caseloads are.”
In his office in Madera, Fitzgerald keeps a framed illustration of all the characters from “The Godfather.” His favorite line from the movie belongs to Mafia boss Michael Corleone: “Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.”
It’s what he pointed to when I asked him about the firm’s political contributions. For decades, it has donated to tough-on-crime candidates whose platforms seem at odds with the interests of the people the Ciummo lawyers represent in court.

The firm backed Frank Bigelow, a former Madera County supervisor, in his successful run for State Assembly and through several reelection campaigns. Bigelow co-authored a bill to increase punishments for petty theft and drug possession.
It also contributed to Anne Marie Schubert’s 2022 campaign for state attorney general, which was focused on repealing propositions 47 and 57, cornerstones of the criminal justice reform movement that reclassified certain drug and property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors and made it harder for prosecutors to charge juveniles in adult court. Schubert had previously pushed to expedite the time between conviction and execution in death penalty cases.
Fitzgerald called the donations “business decisions.” 
“We donate mainly so if we make a phone call and we want to be heard about something, they’ll take our phone call,” he said. “Frank Bigelow was very good to us when he was on the Board of Supervisors here. He always voted for us, always supported our contracts.”
The firm has also donated to the campaigns of several area district attorneys.
“​​I think you should strive to get along with the opposition,” Fitzgerald said. “But when it gets between the lines, you fight tooth and nail for your client. I don’t think it compromises you at all because you get along with the DAs.”
Fitzgerald met Lisa Smittcamp, the Fresno district attorney, when she was a young prosecutor in Madera. The two had worked opposite each other and are still friends. He has donated to her campaigns and attends her fundraisers. 
Smittcamp said she sees no difference in the quality of representation between Fresno’s institutional public defender’s office and the Ciummo firm. 
“I have never heard somebody say that the Ciummo attorneys give cases away, or they’re not zealous advocates,” she said.

One of the firm’s partners, Antonio Alvarez, is widely praised as an effective attorney. A former client, John Diaz, said Alvarez frequently visited him in jail, investigated his case, and reached out to him years after he was convicted to let him know that a change in the law allowed him to petition the court for resentencing. 
“He humanized me,” Diaz said.
Diaz had been assigned several other Ciummo attorneys before Alvarez, but said they “were just going through the motions.” He was in jail for years awaiting trial. 
“If you got money here, you’re good. If you don’t have money, you’re flipping a coin,” he said.

Much of the effort to ban flat-fee contracts has focused on the ways in which the model discourages investigations, one of the most critical components of criminal defense. 
Defense investigators review police reports, visit crime scenes, chase down video surveillance footage and interview witnesses — work that most attorneys are not trained to do. They often find evidence that challenges the prosecution’s case and affects the outcome of a trial or the terms of a plea deal. 
A recent CalMatters investigation found that poor people accused of crimes in California are routinely sent to prison without anyone investigating the charges against them, significantly increasing the likelihood of wrongful convictions. 
In Madera, where the Ciummo firm reported handling more than 6,000 cases last year, attorneys shared two full-time investigators. They were up against prosecutors who have 13 full-time investigators, in addition to the investigative powers of the Madera sheriff and two municipal police departments.  
“A big part of the job of the public defender is to probe our investigation,” said Madera District Attorney Sally Moreno. 
In April 2024, Moreno charged a 60-year-old man with the murder of his ex-girlfriend. After the man hired a private defense attorney from a neighboring county, the Madera prosecutors were overwhelmed by a barrage of legal motions.
“My lawyers were flabbergasted,” Moreno said. They were accustomed to dealing with the Ciummo attorneys.
“This is what defense lawyers do!” she told them. 
The case confirmed Moreno’s suspicion that her younger lawyers were unprepared to handle an aggressive defense attorney. She said she had previously spoken to county officials about creating an institutional public defender office in Madera.
The defense investigator eventually found evidence that complicated the prosecution’s case, and Moreno dropped the charges. She said that’s how the system is supposed to work. 
“Steel sharpens steel,” she said. 
In Amador County, lawyers with the firm resolved more than 2,000 cases in 2023 and 2024. They used an investigator in nine of those cases, according to the firm’s case reports. That means the overwhelming majority of people convicted in Amador during that time never had an investigator test the evidence against them.
Defendants in those 2,000 cases frequently tried to fire their Ciummo attorneys by filing what’s known as a Marsden motion, arguing that their attorney was doing a bad job or had a conflict of interest. Most of these requests were denied, but their frequency is almost four times that of neighboring Tulare County, which has an institutional public defender office. 
After CalMatters inquired about the apparent lack of investigations in Amador, Fitzgerald said the firm would hire an additional investigator to cover the area. But he also insisted the case reports were inaccurate, and that his attorneys had neglected to record the work of an investigator who currently splits her time between Amador and Calaveras counties.
“Any case that needs to be investigated is going to be investigated,” he said.
Early last year, Kristen Reid, a defense attorney and investigator, began working on the case of a Placer man who was convicted in 2009 of murdering his wife. Reid believed a new state law allowing people to contest convictions based on misleading or discredited forensic evidence could give him a second chance to prove his innocence. 
When she opened the case files, she expected to find thousands of pages of police reports, witness testimonies and forensic records. But the defense attorneys in the case hadn’t asked for much of this evidence. As she made her way through the documents, she thought, “We have a much bigger problem with this case than junk science.”
It seemed to Reid that the two Ciummo attorneys representing the man “had been working for the DA, not the Public Defender,” she later wrote in a complaint to the California State Bar. 
Court transcripts show that, in the months leading up to the trial, the judge repeatedly berated the lead attorney for failing to move forward with his investigation. He hadn’t interviewed key witnesses, filed basic motions or sent evidence for forensic testing.

More than a year after the Ciummo firm got the case, the lead attorney asked the court to postpone the trial. He said his investigator had a heavy workload and hadn’t been able to devote much time to the case. The judge refused. He had already pushed back the date multiple times at the urging of the defense attorneys, and they had failed to make much progress.
“This case should have been a priority for the public defender’s office,” he said.
The attorney told the judge he would show up to court but wouldn’t participate. “I will (in) no way respond or argue or offer evidence or any such thing,” he said, according to the court transcript.
During the trial, the defense attorneys missed multiple opportunities to discredit law enforcement’s theory of the crime, Reid said. She obtained records through discovery showing that, weeks before the jury found the man guilty, the prosecution’s key forensic witness emailed one of the Ciummo attorneys to thank him for “taking it easy on me” during cross-examination. “I owe you,” he wrote. 
That lawyer has since been disbarred. The other, Reid discovered, had been charged with domestic violence just two weeks before the trial and had multiple DUI cases on his record. 
Reid has received help from several different Innocence Projects in her efforts to overturn the man’s conviction, but the odds are stacked against her. The U.S. Supreme Court has made it almost impossible for appellate courts to overturn convictions because a defense lawyer didn’t do their job. 
“Once the bad thing happens,” Reid said, “there’s just no way out of it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Public-Defenders_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-17 13:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What is a doula and how can I get one in Hartford?,Mariana Navarrete Villegas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/17/doula-hartford-ct/,"Here's what you need to know about what a doula is, how much their services can cost and how to find one in Hartford.","Birth workers are spread across Connecticut, and few doula services are centralized in Hartford. However, there are coalitions and organizations that connect people, ease the costs and offer referral processes who want these services.
Doulas are trained professionals — or caregivers — who provide continuous physical, emotional and informational non-medical support to a person who will get pregnant, is pregnant or just gave birth.
Studies show doula perinatal care is associated with positive delivery outcomes such as reduced number of cesarean sections, premature deliveries and length of labor. Doula emotional support is also shown to reduce anxiety and stress and, among lower-income women, improved breastfeeding.
In 1992, the Doulas of North America founded the first organization to certify and license doulas. But while the formal word “doula” is new, the role has been known for centuries in indigenous nations like the Navajo and Mohawk as birth attendants. 
Here’s what you need to know about what a doula is, how much their services can cost and how to find one in Hartford.
Is a doula the same as a midwife or obstetrician?
No. Doulas have different roles and medical training than a midwife or obstetrician. Doulas provide emotional support, comfort and advocacy during the birth process, and not medical advice.
Unlike a doula, midwives are trained healthcare professionals that provide care around the medical aspects of pregnancy and birth. Midwives have different levels of education and expertise, and the majority in this country are certified nurse-midwives or certified midwives.
Obstetricians are doctors who went to medical school and specialize in the reproductive system, pregnancy and childbirth. They perform surgeries like a cesarean delivery and episiotomy.
So, if they are not midwives or obstetricians, how can a doula help me if I’m pregnant?
Doulas work alongside medical providers to make sure your emotional and physical needs are met, from advocating birthing preferences to demonstrating coping techniques to ease stress and contractions and even requesting language interpreters.
Doulas aim to achieve the healthiest experience possible for the mother-to-be, guiding every step of the way so the birthing person and their family is accompanied, comfortable and informed.
While most doulas work around the birth process, they also provide support and guidance during other aspects of reproductive health, such as menstruation, fertility, abortion, miscarriage, breastfeeding and gender transition.
Do doulas have a certification or license?
Certification is not required to be a doula in Connecticut, but the ones that can provide services and be paid through HUSKY, Connecticut’s Medicaid program, are licensed by the Department of Public Health.
While there is no state or national database that shows a directory with certified doulas per state and city, in Connecticut’s latest Doula Landscape Analysis and Implementation Plan it shows that most of the surveyed doulas were certified by: DONA, Earth’s Natural Touch, Madriella or Childbirth International.
What are some local organizations I can reach out to for help finding a doula in Hartford?
Doulas4CT, a statewide coalition of doulas, grassroots advocates and community organizations, offers free doula services through their 4 Families project. Any birthing person living in Hartford between 20 and 28 weeks of pregnancy can sign up on their website and fill out a request form.
Lucinda’s House was founded by midwife and nurse Lucinda Canty, associate professor of UMass Amherst, who rooted her patient care in Hartford to create a safe space for women of color and to address racial disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity. The first step would be to fill out a request form. Canty will try to find a doula the person feels safe with and help determine how to get the service covered.
NuBeing Doula is a full spectrum certified doula that works in the greater Hartford area. To schedule a free consultation visit the website.
Choosing a doula can take time. Qualitative studies show that women feel more comfortable having a doula who shares their race or culture. With this in mind, organizations like the Hispanic Health Council in Hartford are working on building a community doula workforce from the same community in which they would provide the services.
There is not a national database that shows the demographics of the doula workforce in the U.S., although state studies exist centered around doulas and their clients.
In Connecticut, the most recent state-led Doula Landscape Analysis and Implementation Plan surveyed doulas, and it showed that more than 40% reported their race as Black or African American and more than 30% reported their race as white. All spoke English, and less than a quarter Spanish, Portuguese, Italian or Creole.
Can I get a doula and get reimbursed with my insurance?
It’s common that doulas provide independent services, as this is why it tends to be a costly complement to the birthing process. But in 2025, HUSKY Health, known as Medicaid in Connecticut, included doula care through its Maternity Bundle Payment program. 
Health care providers such as obstetricians might have information and referrals to find doulas covered by Medicaid. These doulas must be certified through the Department of Public Health. 
After matching with one, the provider would be supervising the care plan. Then, the doula services would be rendered and reimbursed under the provider’s supervision through the bundle, according to DPH.
Most private insurances do not cover doula care since it’s not considered a medical service like the one of an obstetrician or midwife. However, call your provider and check if out-of-network maternity services are covered.
I want to pay out of pocket for doula services, where can I find one? 
Hartford does not have a citywide directory of doulas, but there are online platforms that can help you find one close to you.
Doula Match lets you find birth or postpartum doulas. It shows the available doulas that provide services in your area, if their certification is verified, years of experience and client testimonials. The range of birth doulas’ cost is from $500 to $5,000. Postpartum doula rates range from $35 to $100 an hour.
Born Bir is an online matching system where you can share details about your doula needs ranging from birth prep, breastfeeding, baby sleep, postpartum recovery, or newborn care, and they will match you with the best local doulas. International organizations like CAPPA, have their own directories too with doulas which have their certifications and provide services in the area.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0905_SR_DoulaGraduation_091-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547
,California,2025-12-17 13:10:00+00:00,CalMatters,‘False hope’: Why families who celebrated California’s new mental health court feel let down by it,Jocelyn Wiener,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/12/care-court-families/,"Californians with loved ones in the throes of severe mental illness embraced Gov. Newsom's CARE Court and helped him sign it into law. Two years later, some of them say little has changed.","Boom.
Ronda Deplazes had just gotten out of the shower and placed curlers in her long blond hair when she heard something slam against her front door. 
Boom.
Outside, her son — a man who could fix anything, who loved his family, who never remembered these incidents but always apologized later — was yelling and swearing as he pulled large gray river rocks from the planter beds and hurled them at the front of his parents’ suburban Concord home.  
Boom. 
Deplazes heard a woman scream.
Later she learned her 38-year-old son had ripped a branch from a crepe myrtle in the front yard, leapt over a retaining wall and fallen onto the sidewalk. CalMatters is not naming Deplazes’ son, who lives with psychosis and addiction and could not be  interviewed for this story.
Police arrived within minutes that August evening. They found Deplazes, hair still in rollers, in bed cuddling her shaking 17-year-old Labrador, Farley.
This was not the first time officers had visited the family’s home.
“What happened with CARE Court?” one officer asked.
Deplazes offered her assessment of a program she’d once seen as an answer to her prayers. 
“They did nothing,” she said.
More than three years have passed since Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced the concept of CARE Court. Standing at a lectern in front of a San Jose treatment center in March 2022, he described a new court system that would steer hard-to-treat individuals down a pathway of housing and services. He called it “a completely new paradigm, a new approach, a different pathway.”
“I’ve got four kids,” he said that day. “I can’t imagine how hard this is …It breaks your heart. I mean, your life just torn asunder because you’re desperately trying to reach someone you love and you watch them suffer and you watch a system that consistently lets you down and lets them down.”
Family members of people with serious mental illnesses told CalMatters they breathed a sigh of relief that day. So many struggled for years to find help for loved ones who seemed to slip ever deeper into psychosis. 
While disability rights advocates decried the program as a threat to the civil liberties of people with mental illness, and counties protested that they didn’t have the necessary resources or time, family members described feeling a twinge of something that had long eluded them: Hope.
Finally, they thought, someone heard them.
Finally, their loved ones would get help.
With the vocal support of many of these families, Newsom shepherded CARE Court through the Legislature. That October, he signed it into law. A year later, the program rolled out in an initial cohort, reaching the entire state by December 2024.
Now, many of the same family members who embraced CARE Court say it has fallen short of their expectations. In dozens of conversations with CalMatters, they described loved ones who continue to cycle between jail and homelessness. Some said their loved ones were dropped because they failed to participate in voluntary treatment plans. Others said counties had lost track of them entirely.
Some of the disappointment is a matter of scale. Newsom had initially projected that as many as 12,000 people could be eligible for the new program.
Two years of data from the state’s judicial council shows that, as of October, courts had received 3,092 petitions for CARE Court. Almost half were dismissed. Thus far, these petitions have translated into just 706 CARE plans and agreements.

County and state officials say it’s too soon to pass judgment on the program. They point to the uncounted individuals who received help without ever enrolling in the program, and to those who have made incremental progress, perhaps working with a substance use counselor for the first time. They also say buy-in from vulnerable people takes a long time to achieve, but that the voluntary nature of the program is essential for lasting recovery.
Some officials acknowledge a significant disconnect between what many families expected, and what the law actually prescribes.
In Contra Costa County, where Deplazes lives, Judge Melissa O’Connell said she meets with participants who tell her they now have stable housing or are preparing for their first job interview. Such accounts buoy her.
“That’s how I view CARE,” she said. “It is helping people that would not be helped if CARE did not exist. It’s not helping everyone. I get that.”
But many families who have spent years or decades begging for help have lost patience.
In Ronda Deplazes’ case, she’s going to war.
“That’s my mission,” she said. “We have to stop CARE Court.”
Years of desperation
Anosognosia.
It’s a word people struggle to pronounce, even as they describe how profoundly it has upended their loved ones’ lives. It means an inability or refusal to recognize a defect or disorder that is clinically evident.
Ronda Deplazes knows it as a Catch-22. 
Her son is sick but doesn’t believe he’s sick. Who would voluntarily accept treatment for an illness they don’t think they have?
The conundrum dates to 1967, when California passed the Lanterman-Petris-Short law. Prior to the law, it had been far too easy for family members to force loved ones into mental health treatment. Civil rights violations were rampant. Conditions in state hospitals were dismal. 

The landmark law established strict criteria for involuntary treatment. It imposed specific timeframes for confinement and limited who could be subjected to holds: only people deemed a danger to themselves or others, or gravely disabled. 
These civil rights protections are still widely considered imperative. But desperate family members say the law has at times made it difficult for them to get their loved ones life-saving treatment. 
Many families pinned their newfound hope on Newsom’s initial comments, in which he said individuals who weren’t willing or able to follow through on their CARE plans might be moved “into a different category of care and support, more traditional along the lines of what we have today, through the (Lanterman-Petris-Short) conservatorship system.” 
Several family members CalMatters interviewed interpreted that to mean CARE Court could compel their seriously mentally ill loved ones to get help. 
“We get so pumped up with hope,” Deplazes said.
“I think the frustration and disappointment is more than a person can bear. That’s the truth of it. That is the bottom line,” she said.
In an interview with CalMatters, California Health and Human Services Undersecretary Corrin Buchanan said CARE Court was never intended to be another form of conservatorship. She emphasized what she considers unique facets of the program – families can directly petition the courts for help, county behavioral health departments face increased accountability and they are getting state support to develop the “three-legged stool” of treatment, medication and housing. 
She said she’s heard from many families whose loved ones have benefited from the program, which can provide tools to meet the needs of “the right person, who’s the right fit for the model.” 
Growing up, Deplazes’ son loved baseball, tinkering and spending time outside. 
In retrospect, the first signs that something was wrong were the risky behaviors — leaping from the second story window onto the trampoline, doing donuts with his truck. By the time he was 19, he had received three DUIs. At one point, neighbors filed for a restraining order against him.

Deplazes, a preschool teacher who regularly volunteers through her church, and her husband, Roger, who runs a family solar electricity business, met in middle school and have been together since their teens. They tried everything they could think of to help their son. They paid to send him to a high-end rehabilitation center. Staff told them their son was hearing voices. Eventually, he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a condition marked by symptoms of psychosis as well as mood disorders.
Deplazes was familiar with the implications of that diagnosis: Her mother, sister and brother had all suffered with similar illnesses. She and her husband found their son a psychiatrist. He thrived for a while, with professional help, a girlfriend and a part-time job.
Then, during the pandemic, Deplazes said her son went off his medication because he didn’t like the way it made him feel. 
Things spiraled.
He lived with his parents until violence fueled by fentanyl use made the arrangement untenable. 
In 2022, court records show, Deplazes filed for a temporary restraining order.
 Her son started sleeping in strip malls near their home. 
Inspired by Newsom
After hearing Newsom describe his plans for CARE Court, Deplazes felt inspired to participate in transforming the mental health system. She signed up for a class to help other families navigate mental illness. 
In that class, she learned about Contra Costa County’s assisted outpatient treatment program — a court-ordered mental health treatment program that predated CARE Court. Upon her referral, he was accepted, she said; she hoped county mental health workers could convince him to participate in treatment.
One summer day in 2024, Deplazes pulled her car into the parking lot of an abandoned Dollar Tree where her son sometimes slept. She initially didn’t recognize the unconscious body surrounded by trash, grease caked into the neck, face and arms. 
When she finally managed to shake her son awake, he was weak and trembling. She moved him to the shade and ran to get water, Gatorade and food. 
She called the county behavioral health team.
“You have to help me,” she said. 
County workers brought him food and water, she said, but her son wasn’t willing to accept additional help.
“‘Don’t worry,’” she remembers them saying. “‘In December you can apply for CARE Court.’”
Deplazes spent three days filling out paperwork ahead of CARE Court’s rollout in Contra Costa County. It was so complicated, she said, and required so much information that she eventually had to seek help: first from a volunteer from the local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, then from staff at the local law library. But she got the petition submitted, and in late January, her son was approved.
High expectations, then disappointment
The first CARE Court hearing for Deplazes’ son was on the morning of Feb. 7 of this year. She and her husband arrived at the Martinez courthouse at the appointed time. Their son did not.
In the coming months, Deplazes continued to find him crumpled up in strip malls a few blocks from her home. She had to stop frequenting those shopping centers. It was too hard to see him like that. 
Sometimes, in the cold and rain, he would appear on her doorstep barefoot and freezing. He might lie there for days, barely moving. She’d contact the CARE Court team to alert them to his location. On some occasions, she said, they came out and did their best to help him. But most times, he was gone before they arrived. 
She cut back on work, spending hours each day on the phone. 
He kept getting arrested. Police would drive him to the county jail in Richmond. Often, Deplazes said, they discharged him in the middle of the night and he would walk until he could borrow a phone to call home. Her husband, worried for their son’s safety, would drive 25 miles to pick him up. CARE Court workers often weren’t even aware he was behind bars, Deplazes said.
Deplazes and her husband stopped going anywhere, fearing a crisis would emerge in their absence.
“You can’t have a life when you have a kid like this,” Deplazes said.
By March, she was already convinced that CARE Court wasn’t going to save her son. 
She started reaching out to everyone she could. The county behavioral health department. The public defender. The district attorney. 
“Dear Secretary Welch,” she wrote in a March email to the deputy secretary of behavioral health at the California Health and Human Services Agency, “This is a desperate plea to save our son’s life as now we are being told that CARE Court is also 100% voluntary…my son is deteriorating rapidly and being arrested on a regular basis for extreme and escalating behaviors….Secretary Welch please let me know if this CARE Court petition is futile and I should go another route. We love our son. He is smart, sweet and worth saving. We will never give up on his recovery. Please send guidance before it is too late for our family.”
She followed up with a second email, but never heard back.
“I’m giving up,” she told a reporter one morning soon after. “Honestly, I’m giving up.”
Instead, she began begging the county to let her son out of CARE Court, reasoning that he would get more treatment through the criminal courts if he was not constrained by his participation in the program.
Welch, in an interview with CalMatters, offered a message to parents like Deplazes:
“We’re listening,” she said. “We’re trying to better understand how we can be helpful. There’s lots of tools in the toolbox and CARE wasn’t necessarily a panacea.”
‘It was my baby’
Not long into her CARE Court experience, Deplazes was introduced to a former police officer named Sam Figueroa. The two instantly bonded over their shared desperation.
During his 25-year career, Figueroa said he had specially trained to help people in mental distress. By his own estimation, he had placed thousands of people on involuntary holds.
In 2023, he said someone called to tell him they heard screaming from his son’s Los Angeles area apartment. Figueroa immediately flew south, arriving to find his son emaciated and lying in the bathtub in a urine-soaked sleeping bag. Feces and rotting food coated the apartment.
“I thought I was in a nightmare,” he said. “And it was my baby.”
His son had recently graduated magna cum laude from UC Santa Cruz. Now, doctors told Figueroa that the sooner he intervened, the more likely he was to save his son’s life.
Despite his years of experience, Figueroa couldn’t convince anyone to place his son on an involuntary hold. Not after the young man tried to break into someone’s home. Not after he jumped from a moving vehicle.
Like Deplazes, Figueroa had started out optimistic about CARE Court. Like her, he soon grew angry. The clock was ticking.
“Doctor says ‘He doesn’t know he’s sick, he needs treatment now.’ CARE Court says ‘He doesn’t know he’s sick, he has to volunteer,’” he said. “I don’t understand that language. And I barely got high school, but that sounds very stupid.”
 Gigi Crowder, CEO of Contra Costa’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness — an organization that represents family members — said she had initially felt hopeful about the new program. She remembers telling  parents that CARE Court represented a new opportunity.
“We have failed this community of individuals,” she said recently. “We just have. We continue to do it when we offer false hope.”

By last summer, Deplazes had had enough. 
One June morning, she came before Judge O’Connell, who oversees the county’s assisted outpatient program, conservatorship proceedings and CARE Court.
Deplazes’ health had deteriorated from the constant stress. Her son seemed to be getting worse.
Irate, she begged the judge to remove her son from CARE Court before he ended up dead.
“I said ‘let him out. I need to find him help and he’s not getting it here,’” she said.
In retrospect, Deplazes wishes she had been more tactful. 
But, at that moment, she just didn’t care.
The hardest days
O’Connell is not oblivious to the pain of families like the Deplazes. 
She and others in her courtroom are acutely aware that many have submitted petitions only after decades of heartache.
The hardest days are the ones when she has to tell family members that CARE Court is not going to help their loved ones. 
“As a parent, when you feel like our systems have failed your loved one time and again, that can be devastating,” she said. “That’s never lost on us in CARE. But I know that doesn’t help make someone feel better about it.”
Prior to being sworn in on Jan. 8, 2024, O’Connell spent years working for the Northern California Innocence Project. A psychology major in college, she was excited to take on her new role.
About six or seven months into the county’s CARE Court rollout, she became concerned about the apparent disconnect between what the law described and what community members expected. She edited the county’s CARE Court webpage to better emphasize the program’s voluntary nature.
“I would never want to give someone false hope,” she said. “The only way you can try to avoid that is by being good at communicating and managing expectations.”
As of October, Contra Costa County had received 69 petitions for CARE Court, 28 of which had been filed by family members. Twenty-four of these petitions had since been dismissed, 11 led to CARE agreements with four more agreements pending. Seven individuals had exited the program to enter the Lanterman-Petris-Short conservatorship system, the county said.
Marie Scannell, Contra Costa County’s mental health program chief, and Elyse Perata, the mental health program manager, describe the challenges they’ve faced in rolling out CARE Court. Their staff members spend countless hours searching for hard-to-locate individuals, they said. They then make multiple visits over several months to gradually gain these individuals’ trust. 
Then there are the families.
Perata, a therapist, said she empathizes with families frustrated that their loved ones can’t be compelled to participate. But she also emphasized the importance of a client’s buy-in in order to achieve “longstanding success.”
She and Scannell described the dedication of their staff, and the warmth of O’Connell’s courtroom – where participants are greeted with snacks and support. 
For some people in the community, they said, the program has worked well.
One 31-year-old man, who asked that his name not be used for privacy reasons, told CalMatters he had participated in the county’s CARE Court program for several months. Prior to that, his father had referred him to a mental health treatment facility after he went off his medication, fell into psychosis and poured water into his gas tank, ruining his car. 
He appreciates the help he’s received connecting with job training, as well as the program’s more intangible aspects – moral support, reassurance, a positive outlook. 
“I didn’t expect it to be this life-changing,” he said.
After CARE Court
In July, Deplazes’ son was released from CARE Court. Deplazes said the judge told her it was because the CARE Court team couldn’t locate him.
In August, on the evening he was found throwing river rocks at the front door, police arrested him for repeatedly violating his parents’ restraining order, Deplazes said.
In September, she said, a criminal court judge ordered her son placed in 180 days of inpatient treatment, along with domestic violence classes and antipsychotic medications. 
“My son, we finally got him criminalized,” Deplazes informed her friend, Figueroa, as the two sat together on the leather couches in her living room.  
“God bless,” he said.
Figueroa remained worried about his son. He had brought him back north and put him up in a nearby hotel for nine months, he said, until the young man was kicked out for frightening the staff. 
Homeless, his son had wandered into a neighboring county. His county responded by closing his son’s CARE Court case, he said. 
Now, Figueroa was trying to track his son’s Instagram posts to make sure he was still alive. 
In the meantime, the days of the involuntary hold the judge had ordered for Deplazes’ son were slipping away. She was still desperately trying to find a long-term placement her son would be willing to accept. She knew he longed for his freedom.
“And there’s no talking to him,” she said. “Because remember again, in his mind, he’s not sick.”
The two talked briefly about a new law that will take effect this January. It promises to expand the grave disability standard as laid out by the Lanterman-Petris-Short law. Many families hope it will open a new pathway to conservatorship.
“But again, it’s a law,” Deplazes said. 
Implementation, she said, was another question entirely.

Newsom called for accountability on mental health and homelessness when he proposed his CARE Court program. What became law, however, pleased almost no one.","Welcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.
Three years ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a court with real power both to force a government agency to treat a mentally ill patient, and to compel that patient to stick to the program. 
That’s how many Californians remember his CARE Court proposal: As a mandate to bring people with severe mental illness off the street and into treatment. Noncompliance, Newsom said at the time, would lead to consequences — counties could face fines for not providing court-ordered services, and participants who fail the program could be referred to conservatorship, which often means involuntary treatment in locked facilities.
But a CalMatters review of the legislative record shows that vision is not what became law, and, as a result, the state has rarely mandated treatment of a mentally ill person or referred someone to conservatorship. It has not handed down a single fine for counties that failed to provide court-ordered services to many CARE participants.
The bill went through several amendments that: 

narrowed eligibility for CARE court,
demanded more time and information from people filing petitions, 
favored voluntary treatment agreements over court-ordered plans, 
and eliminated requirements that counties provide certain services, according to a CalMatters analysis of versions of the 2022 bill.

Newsom had envisioned that 7,000 to 12,000 Californians would qualify for the program. But by July, only 528 people enrolled in treatment plans. Almost all — 514 — were through voluntary agreements instead of court-ordered plans. 
“I think the law that was promised was pretty ambitious,” said Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a San Jose Democrat and the only lawmaker to consistently vote against the 2022 measure. “It’s not surprising to me that it didn’t live up to all the hype of what was promised.”

While Newsom’s proposal sailed through the state Legislature with near-unanimous, bipartisan support, it was contentious among various interest groups.
Civil rights organizations, such as ACLU and Disability Rights California, wanted to protect the liberties of mentally ill people and fought the proposal on principle. Counties and behavioral health professionals worried about funding and execution as they pressed for adjustments to the bill text. 
Some mental health advocates, including the National Alliance on Mental Illness of California, were supportive from the start. The Steinberg Institute, founded by former California Senate President Darrell Steinberg, applauded CARE Court as a “huge step forward” to protect vulnerable Californians.
But the final product pleased few, if any. The law was both too coercive for the civil rights groups and not coercive enough for many families who wanted to see their loved ones in treatment. 
“I’ve wondered (about) the point of a court with no real power,” said Anita Fisher, a San Diego mother who advocated for Newsom’s idea but later called the program a “total failure” in practice.
Newsom, who campaigned on eradicating chronic homelessness, unveiled CARE Court as the state’s unhoused population surged and public frustration climbed despite the tens of billions of dollars his administration spent on homelessness and affordable housing. Cities such as Sacramento and Los Angeles were mulling ballot measures to prohibit homeless people from sleeping in public spaces when Newsom unveiled the proposal. 
“There’s no compassion with people with their clothes off defecating and urinating in the middle of the streets, screaming and talking to themselves,” Newsom told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2022. “I’m increasingly outraged by what’s going on in the streets. I’m disgusted with it.”
Eve Garrow of ACLU of Southern California called Newsom’s focus on accountability a “political maneuver” that shifts the blame for homelessness onto counties while ignoring the lack of resources to support them. Without guaranteed permanent housing, CARE Court is merely “window-dressing,” she said.
The law stipulates that CARE Court participants get priority from certain existing state housing funds, but did not come with any additional money, a concern cities, counties, and care providers raised throughout the bill process.
“There’s very little political will in Sacramento for (funding permanent housing), given the price tag,” Garrow said. “I honestly think that the houselessness crisis in California has … contributed to a political climate, in which state legislators are looking for easy fixes.”
When asked by CalMatters if Newsom believed the individual and county-level accountability he spoke of materialized, Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos did not give a direct answer. Instead, she said the law has improved in recent years and that is evidence that “(the) government is working as it should.”
The core of CARE Court, Gallegos stressed, was “voluntary” participation. “Coercion rarely works with those who need care,” she said in a statement last week. 
She took a more forceful tone on counties’ responsibility to provide care.
“It shouldn’t take stronger accountability measures for counties to do the right thing,” she said. “The public has called for action and counties should be listening and acting with urgency — or voters will do it for them. There’s no excuse for counties failing to deliver — and the variability in implementation that we are seeing now is completely unacceptable.” 
State Sen. Tom Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat who co-authored the original bill, acknowledged it’s still a “work in progress.” In recent years, he’s introduced “cleanup” bills to expand eligibility for CARE court and boost program uptake. 
The law largely relies on the “soft power” of judges, leaving it at their discretion to hold counties and individuals accountable, Umberg said. 
“I don’t think that we’ve done the kind of job that needs to be done,” he said. “Do we need to have more folks who are engaged and successfully complete the program? Absolutely. Have we gotten there yet? No.”

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)Citing their highly addictive properties and strong withdrawal issues, Utah lawmakers will consider banning a little-regulated substance sold in gas stations and vape shops — kratom.
Kratom is a tree native to Southeast Asia with leaves that are often used to self-treat conditions like “pain, coughing, diarrhea, anxiety and depression, opioid use disorder, and opioid withdrawal,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, in its increasingly popular energy drink form and capsules, it has produced deep impacts among Utahns, lawmakers say.
“There’s a product out there on the market called kratom. It’s actually sold at gas stations. It impacts you like an opioid. It’s very addictive. It’s much, much worse than we realize,” Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork said in a video he posted on social media on Tuesday.

McKell is proposing a bill repealing the Kratom Consumer Protection Act state legislators passed in 2019, establishing a regulatory framework for kratom products in Utah, and including alkaloids found or derived from Kratom as schedule I controlled substances, the same category as other drugs with high potential for abuse, like heroin and ecstasy. 
That would effectively ban kratom in the state. 
The Health and Human Services Interim Committee unanimously voted in November to fast track the bill next legislative session. If the full Legislature votes to approve McKell’s bill, Utah would become the 10th state to ban kratom, he said.
During a November presentation, McKell showed $500 worth of kratom products to the committee, saying he easily bought them in his district and had some of them tested at the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food State Laboratory.
“It was interesting that those samples were within the state legal limit. And what that tells me is that the product itself is very, very dangerous,” McKell said in the video. 
Michael Moss, director of the Utah Poison Control Center said during the November hearing that 7OH, a compound found in the kratom plant “at something less than 1% of it” is now getting purified and synthesized for consumption.



Let us know what you think...


 


“This stuff is more like 10 to 20 times more potent than morphine, and no one should have access to 7OH,” Moss said. 
The products are often marketed as natural, safe and drug-free, Moss said, with many patients arguing they had no idea the product could lead to addiction. The case load at the Poison Control Center related to the substance has doubled in the last two years, he said. And in the last several months there have also been an increase in calls related to 7OH.
“We get calls about all sorts of things, the combination of both intoxication, where someone has taken too much, often in combination with other medications, they can have unusual symptoms like agitation and tremor and hallucinations that you wouldn’t expect from an opioid,” Moss said, “on top of the opioid effects, like I’ve already mentioned, that might require Narcan to reverse an opioid overdose. We also get calls about withdrawal.”
Kratom advocates have decried what they describe as the FDA’s “war on kratom.” The American Kratom Association said on its website its members “hope to demonstrate responsible use and the health benefits of kratom will convince other countries to responsibly regulate kratom, not ban it.”
How are kratom effects felt in the state
Other experts also joined McKell during the committee presentation to speak about how kratom’s presence has been felt in Utah’s emergency rooms and other centers. 
Ryan Stoneworthy, an emergency medicine physician at the Logan Regional Hospital, said that in the last four to six months he has seen 10 or more cases of kratom withdrawal, a seizure, and one death related to a kratom issue. 
Megan Broekemeier, overdose fatality examiner at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, said that in five years, there were 158 fatal overdoses involving kratom. The vast majority of them were the result of multiple substances, but her office has seen an increase of kratom-only deaths in the last year.

The areas that have a higher burden of kratom overdoses are in the Southwest Health District, which serves Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, Broekemeier said. That’s followed by the TriCounty Health Department, which includes Uintah, Duchesne and Daggett counties, and the Weber-Morgan Health Department.
Another notable area, she added, is Provo.
“Typically, they have the lowest rates of overdose in this state,” Broekemeier said. “But this was just an area where I noticed that there’s more of a difference among kratom overdoses than all drug overdoses.” 
Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, is also working on a bill that would tackle just 7OH, including it in the schedule I category with some exceptions for small traces of the element. That also passed in the Business and Labor Interim Committee.
“If we go forward with a complete ban on kratom, there will be a coordinating clause that the trace element component would come out, so it would just be a complete ban on both (7OH) and kratom,” Vickers said.

Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the Dec. 11 Alabama State Board of Education meeting teacher healthcare costs are a big issue the department wants to address.
“We asked for a lot of increases this year, but particularly we’re obviously supportive of the legislature, the executive budget office and the governor working out what they can to support teacher and employee healthcare,” Mackey said.

Rising health care costs are likely to be a major part of budget discussions when the Legislature returns on Jan. 13. During the Public Education Employee Healthcare Plan (PEEHIP) meeting on Dec. 3, board members discussed potentially having to dip into the Retiree Trust Fund to avoid healthcare premiums increasing for teachers. PEEHIP plans to ask for a $380 million increase for fiscal year 2027. The State Employee Insurance Board in September approved withdrawals from a trust fund and increases to some employee costs to address a deficit. 
ACCS also has employee health care on its legislative agenda, stating the system wants “full funding for any increased costs of health insurance, retirement benefits and other statutorily mandated benefits” for ACCS and community and technical employees.
“We’re going to be fighting an uphill battle to not only advocate for what we’re going to need for our employees and for us with regards to health care,” Alan Bates, a special assistant to the ACCS chancellor, said during the Dec. 10 ACCS meeting.
Adolescent literacy is another item on the ALSDE legislative agenda. Mackey said the department has asked for $50 million from the Alabama Legislature.
“Adolescent literacy is the next big step in making sure all of our students are not just reading on grade level, but above that grade level minimum and that they’re able to read in the content area,” Mackey said.
ALSDE was granted $20 million for adolescent literacy during the 2026 fiscal year.
ACCS plans to ask Legislature for additional funding to support dual enrollment scholarships to eligible high school students.
“You’re going to see a lot of emphasis around dual enrollment, because we recognize the impact that we can have at an earlier basis,” Bates said. “We want to make sure that every legislature understands what that local impact is in their communities and how many students we are serving as they’re hearing things out in the community.”
Vice Chancellor of Student Success Neil Scott told the Board of Trustees over 40,000 students are enrolled in at least one dual enrollment course for the 2024-25 school year. 
“Affordability and access are major drivers of this growth. We offer top tier instruction at the lowest price point in the state, allowing many students to take multiple courses at once and make real progress toward a credential,” Scott said to the board.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/insurance-1024x666.jpg,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547
,California,2025-12-17 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom relaxed his pro-housing stance for certain Democratic locales,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/newsom-relaxed-housing-stance-democratic/,Gov. Gavin Newsom is tougher on Republican-leaning communities that resist building housing than on similar regions run by affluent Democrats.,"When Gavin Newsom was running for governor he made many promises, one of which was to ramp up housing production, which had been in the doldrums for a decade.
Describing housing as “a fundamental human need,” Newsom said the shortage “breaks my heart” and promised that as governor he would lead the effort to develop “the 3.5 million new housing units we need by 2025, because our solutions must be as bold as the problem is big.”
The goal was impossible on its face, and he later backed away from it, terming it  “aspirational” rather than achievable.
Nevertheless, Newsom has championed policies to remove artificial barriers to new housing, particularly local rules that make development more difficult, or in some cases virtually impossible.
His administration has cracked down on cities that ignore housing quotas when planning land use and supported legislation to encourage “accessory dwelling units” and multiple-family projects on land zoned for single-family homes.
If a city resists higher-density projects, developers can invoke a “builder’s remedy” allowing them to proceed without local approval.
Caught between the state and voters 
All of these pro-housing moves are highly controversial, as local officials often are squeezed between pressure from the state and the desires of their constituents to maintain the status quo.
The interactions have shown a curious tendency. The state, dominated by Newsom and other Democrats, is tougher on Republican-leaning communities that resist pressure from Sacramento than on those full of Democratic voters, particularly affluent ones.
For instance, Newsom has made an example of heavily Republican Huntington Beach, recently hailing the state Supreme Court’s rejection of that city’s contention that as a charter city it was partially exempt from pro-housing laws.
“Huntington Beach needs to end this pathetic NIMBY behavior,” Newsom said in a statement. “They are failing their own citizens by wasting time and money that could be used to create much-needed housing. No more excuses, you lost once again — it’s time to get building.”
Contrast that with how the state has dealt with Marin County, a bastion of affluent Democrats just as resistant to high-density housing as Huntington Beach.
Legislation to give Marin a partial exemption from state housing quotas by altering its status from urban to suburban was enacted during Jerry Brown’s governorship and extended by Newsom.
Newsom was a Marin resident prior to being elected governor and has recently relocated his family from Sacramento to a $9 million home in Kentfield, one of Marin’s most affluent communities.
And a few months ago, Newsom signed legislation that broadly exempts multi-family projects from the California Environmental Quality Act, but it contains a brief passage that subjects a 270-unit, eight-story project near Santa Barbara’s historic mission to CEQA compliance.
The project in picturesque, wealthy and heavily Democratic Santa Barbara faces sharp local opposition, and the language will help opponents prevail. It was inserted at the behest of state Sen. Monique Limón, a Santa Barbara Democrat who is the newly designated Senate president pro tem.
Finally, Newsom issued an executive order allowing affluent Los Angeles County communities stricken by wildfires early this year, such as Pacific Palisades, to ignore a pro-housing law that Newsom signed in 2001 as they rebuild. The law allows homeowners to split their single-family lots into as many as four properties, thus making more land available for duplexes.
Newsom’s order essentially limits rebuilding in those communities to single-family homes. It drew an immediate lawsuit from YIMBY Law, a pro-housing organization that has been a Newsom ally on previous housing issues. The suit alleges this order is illegal.
The tenor of these incidents could be coincidental. But taken as a whole, they imply that on housing policy some Californians are more equal than others, depending on their politics and economic status.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/082025_Palisades-Construction_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547

California’s biggest water districts presented their own framework Tuesday for how to share the Colorado River’s dwindling water supply, including a commitment to conserve 440,000 acre-feet of water per year – enough to meet the needs of 1.5 million households annually. 
Last month, the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River missed a federally-imposed deadline to submit a preliminary agreement for a plan to replace the river’s operating guidelines set to expire at the end of 2026.
Those negotiations continued Tuesday during the annual Colorado River Water Users Association’s conference in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace.
California’s water users receive the largest allocation of Colorado River water and have some of the most senior water rights on the river, granting them priority access, even during droughts. That means the state is a significant player in the future of the river.
“California has the biggest stake on the Colorado River,” said JB Hamby, Colorado River Board of California chairman and Colorado River commissioner for California.
“We have the greatest agricultural production in the basin, with the greatest population in the basin, serving half of those who depend on Colorado River water. We have some of the most protective rights as well,” he continued.
An influx of federal dollars has helped California make significant strides in water conservation over the last few years, said Hamby. California is projected to cap water use at 3.76 million acre-feet in 2025 – the lowest annual use since 1949.
If the projection holds, California will conserve more than 600,000 acre-feet of water by the end of the year.
“That’s more than three Nevada’s worth of water in the terms of their current use. That’s a tremendous effort,” Hamby said. “The reductions in use that we need to deal with a reduced river are possible if there’s the willingness to do so.”
Nevada, Arizona, and California previously committed to collectively reduce water use by at least 3 million acre-feet through the end of 2026, when the Colorado River’s current water management rules are set to expire. California water agencies took the largest water cuts, committing to conserve 1.6 million acre feet of water in Lake Mead by 2026.
Since 2023, California has conserved a total of 1.2 million acre-feet of system water, and is on track to meet and exceed its commitment to leave 1.6 million acre-feet in Lake Mead a year ahead of schedule.
California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said those conservation efforts have given states more time to negotiate and stressed the need for a seven-state solution to avoid litigation or unilateral federal actions.
“We need to utilize this time to achieve a seven state agreement,” said Crowfoot. “The alternative is a pathway that we don’t control and that may very much harm the constituents that rely on water in California and across the states.”
“Our sleeves are rolled up. We’re not focused on making sound bites or proving points, but finding solutions,” Crowfoot continued.
The framework proposed by the Colorado River Board of California – which represents the states’ water districts and tribes – builds on priorities set by the Lower Basin states, Arizona, California, and Nevada.
California’s biggest water districts laid out several compromises they are willing to accept in order to reach a seven-state agreement, including releases from Lake Powell based on hydrology and changes to how water allocations are distributed in Lower Basin states during water shortages.
But California water users said their willingness to “set aside many of their legal positions” is based on whether “there are equitable and sufficient water contributions from every state in the Basin and the country of Mexico.”
California’s proposed outline also calls for all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years, a proposal that has received strong pushback from Upper Colorado River Basin states – Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.
The California framework included priorities related to interstate exchanges, operational flexibility, and a long-term agreement carried out in phases. 
California water managers said “interstate exchanges need to be part of any long-term solution to encourage interstate investments in new water supply projects that may not be economically viable for just one state or agency.”
California officials said they support the expansion of water storage in both Lake Mead and Upper Basin reservoirs to maintain operational flexibility for water users on the river and to encourage conservation. 
The Colorado River Board of California proposal also seeks a long-term operating agreement with adaptive phases, which would allow more management flexibility when the river’s hydrology does not meet expectations.
Leaders from the Bureau of Reclamation – the federal agency charged with overseeing Colorado River negotiations – are expected to provide an update on the river’s operating guidelines at the conference Wednesday morning.
California water savings
California’s Imperial Irrigation District – the largest water user on the Colorado River – also anticipates reaching its highest ever annual water conservation yield in 2025. Through various programs and partnerships the water district has reduced consumptive use by at least 22%. 
By the end of 2026, the Imperial Irrigation District is expected to conserve over 800,000 acre-feet for Lake Mead, enough water to increase Lake Mead’s elevation by over 11 feet. 
Those conservation savings, along with conservation efforts by Nevada and Arizona, could increase Lake Mead’s water level by about 50 feet.
Several other California water districts announced water conservation efforts that will contribute to the state’s annual water savings goals. 
The Palo Verde Irrigation District established an $8 million Community Improvement Program in 2025 that will pay the farmers to temporarily leave their fields empty. The program will remove 26,000 acres – or 28% – of valley farmland-for three years starting in August 2023, which is expected to conserve 117,000 acre-feet of water annually.
The Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe has also conserved 13,000 acre-feet of water to bolster elevations in Lake Mead, and contributed additional water savings through its ongoing seasonal fallowing agreement with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
Coachella Valley Water District was able to expand its Thermal Water Reclamation Plant through a $39 million Bureau of Reclamation grant, which will allow the agency to supplement Colorado River water with recycled water for agricultural irrigation and conserve 33,600 acre-feet of water from 2029 to 2059.
Coachella Valley Water District has also conserved about 35,000 acre-feet annually since 2023 by avoiding supplying its Thomas E. Levy Groundwater Replenishment Facility. 
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has also been awarded nearly $160 million in funding from the Bureau of Reclamation for three water conservation and water efficiency projects in exchange for the district adding up to 269,000 acre-feet of conserved water to Lake Mead by 2031.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-5-1024x683.png,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547

Done well, transformation does not weaken a hospital. It ensures its success.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tom Papeika: Change in how pediatric care is delivered is not only reasonable — it is responsible.","This commentary is by Tom Papeika, a resident in Shrewsbury. 



Rutland Regional Medical Center recently withdrew its request to transition inpatient pediatric care away from a small number of consistently underused beds toward a more modern model of care. The proposal had been scheduled for review by the Green Mountain Care Board under new authority granted by the Vermont Legislature. With the withdrawal, any future changes will now fall under the Agency of Human Services’ broader “transformation template.”
However the process unfolds, one point should be clear: change in how pediatric care is delivered is not only reasonable—it is responsible.
Hospitals in Vermont, like hospitals nationwide, are navigating workforce shortages, shifting patient volumes and the growing challenge of sustaining low-volume specialty services at the highest clinical standards. Rutland Regional is no exception. The hospital has been transparent that its inpatient pediatric unit is lightly used.  Low volume directly affects the ability to maintain staffing, expertise and quality, which in no way is a criticism of the dedication of clinicians or the value of pediatric care; it is simply a modern clinical reality.
To remain strong and sustainable, hospitals must be able to make decisions guided by evidence and outcomes rather than by habit or fear. Maintaining a service model that no longer reflects how children actually receive care does not serve patients well in the long term, nor does it support excellence in medicine. Adapting care delivery to present-day needs is not a retreat—it is stewardship.
It would have been easier to avoid controversy and preserve a familiar structure. Instead, the hospital attempted the more difficult work of reimagining care in a way that aligns with today’s realities and tomorrow’s needs. That effort deserves serious, thoughtful consideration.
Unfortunately, much of the public response has been driven more by emotion than by fact. Claims that Rutland Regional would be “abandoning” children are not only inaccurate; they risk frightening families and undermining trust in an institution that has long served this community with care and commitment.
As a father and a grandfather, I understand the emotional instinct to want every possible service close to home. My own children were hospitalized when they were young. Each began their road back to health in a local hospital, and each was transferred when they needed more specialized care. Those transfers were stressful and inconvenient—but they were unquestionably the right choice for their wellbeing. The best care is not always the closest care, and it is rarely the care we cling to simply because it is familiar. 
At its core, Rutland Regional’s proposal was grounded in data, practicality and a commitment to high-quality pediatric care. It sought to use limited resources wisely, not to diminish responsibility but to strengthen outcomes for children and families.
This moment also highlights the need for greater clarity around how the Green Mountain Care Board and the Agency of Human Services will coordinate their roles as health care continues to evolve. Act 68 grants both entities meaningful authority, and clearer alignment would help ensure that hospitals and communities are not caught between overlapping processes at a time when decisiveness and collaboration are essential.
Change in health care is never easy. It invites anxiety, disagreement and sometimes misunderstanding. Yet progress depends on the willingness of institutions—and communities—to engage thoughtfully with hard realities and to keep patient well-being at the center of every decision.
If we want Rutland Regional Medical Center to remain strong, resilient and responsive for decades to come, we must allow it to evolve. That means supporting evidence-based decisions, encouraging constructive dialogue and resisting the pull of fear when change feels uncomfortable. Done well, transformation does not weaken a hospital. It ensures that it remains a trusted cornerstone of care prepared to serve Vermont families now and for generations to come.

Alabama's two Democratic U.S. representatives have sent a letter to the University of Alabama calling for the reinstatement of two student magazines suspended earlier this month. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s two Democratic U.S. representatives want the University of Alabama to reinstate two student magazines  suspended earlier this month.
U.S. Reps. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, and Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham, wrote a letter to UA President Peter Mohler Monday asking to meet with him to restore publication of Alice, a women’s magazine, and Nineteen Fifty-Six, a Black lifestyle and culture magazine.
“The discontinuation of Nineteen Fifty-Six and [alice] is not merely a procedural decision; it is a decision with profound implications for free speech, academic freedom, and the University’s stated commitment to fostering an inclusive campus environment,” the letter said. “This decision undermines the significant progress made by the University over the last six decades towards fostering a welcoming and inclusive campus environment for all students.”
Messages seeking comment were left with Nineteen Fifty-Six Editor-in-Chief Kendal Wright, Alice Editor-in-Chief Gabrielle Gunter and The University of Alabama Tuesday afternoon.
UA administrators suspended Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six on Dec. 1, claiming that they were not in compliance with federal guidance on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
UA cited a July 29 memo from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that made non-binding recommendations on how to maintain compliance with anti-DEI policies supported by the Trump administration. The memo was also cited by the university in a legal filing this summer when claiming that it couldn’t reopen spaces for LGBTQ+ and Black students.
Figures and Sewell said they were “alarmed” by the university suggesting that the magazines were a “proxy of discrimination.”
“Treating them as proxies for discrimination represents a dangerous slippery slope. If student expression can be deemed impermissible simply because it reflects the experiences of women, African American students, or other underrepresented groups, what comes next?” they wrote.
Suspension of the magazines has garnered national attention and backlash on campus. A fundraiser started by an alumni organization to publish the magazines independently has surpassed its original goal of $25,000 and a petition started on MoveOn to reinstate the publications gathered over 2,900 signatures. 
Alex House, associate director of communications for UA, said in an email statement Dec. 2 university staff “hope to work with students to develop a new publication that features a variety of voices and perspectives to debut in the next academic year.” 
Sewell and Figures said a new magazine is not “an adequate solution.”
“While we appreciate efforts to promote unity by combining distinct voices into a single publication, this action dilutes and diminishes the culture, contributions, and personal experiences of women and Black students, over half of your campus student population,” the representatives said in the letter.

Mike Braun celebrated changes in property taxes, education, public safety, economic development and more.","Indiana Gov. Mike Braun sits for an end-of-year interview with the Indiana Capital Chronicle in his Statehouse office on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hoosier Gov. Mike Braun is weeks away from wrapping up his first year as Indiana’s top leader and took time this week to dissect his successes and failures.
In a Tuesday sit-down interview with the Capital Chronicle, Braun pointed to big changes in property taxes, education, public safety, economic development and more.
An estimated two-thirds of homeowners will pay less in property taxes next year than they do this year under an immense local government finance bill Braun signed into law in April.
“That’s significant,” he said of the changes.
“The lesson to be learned was that the Senate gives you Senate Bill 1 and then completely guts it. You know, where it had to be rebuilt was in the House,” Braun said. “… It took three months to get it back to record property tax relief.”
The final product remained very different from Braun’s original plan, which he acknowledged faced greater opposition from cash-strapped units of local government.

“I don’t think we ended up too far from where we would have been anyway,” he said.
But his tussle with the Senate presented a “fairly similar dynamic” to another major test of the new governor’s power: fulfilling President Donald Trump’s demand for a congressional redraw benefiting Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The 50-member Senate rejected the new maps last week on a vote of 31-19, with 21 Republicans joining all 10 Democrats in opposition. The defeat came despite threats of primary competition from Trump, Braun and spendy political groups.
“It will have consequences, most likely, and the White House has said that they’re not going to forget it,” Braun said. But it “doesn’t define what happens going forward” on other topics.
“I wouldn’t try to extrapolate on more of a federal issue — redistricting — in terms of what that means on all the kitchen table issues,” he said.
Beyond redistricting
Braun touted a wide range of wins:

Education: entry-level teacher pay increased; public colleges and universities froze tuition; income limits on state-funded private school vouchers were removed.
Public safety: Indiana inked cooperation agreements with federal immigration officials; state police seized more illicit drugs.
Economic development: The state’s economy is growing faster than neighbors and the U.S. average; cost per incentivized job is down; average incentivized job wages are up.

“We did a forensic audit to get to the bottom of what was going on,” Braun said of the controversial Indiana Economic Development Corp.
The analysis identified lackluster oversight and questionable spending from 2022 through 2024, emphasizing a need for greater transparency.
“What they did do may have had merit, but it can’t be cloaked in opaqueness so you can’t see what the heck you’re doing. We’ve turned all that around,” Braun said.
His remake of the quasi-public agency has included an entirely new board of directors.
Braun has also overhauled the state panel that oversees utility companies, naming three new “ratepayer-conscious” commissioners last week.

Amid slower revenue growth, he led the push to slash state spending. Agencies have cut staff, contracts and more to comply, although some nabbed exemptions.
“We got hit with an austere budget forecast, and our cash flow’s already exceeding it,” Braun said, “meaning things I was asking for — in terms of running government more leanly, more efficiently — has paid off.”
His reorganization of government, featuring verticals led by cabinet secretaries, has made it “easier to do business with the state.”
“It’s been surprising how much we’ve been able to do through executive orders and just better management,” he said.
It was through an executive order that agencies completed an exhaustive review of “diversity, equity and inclusion,” or DEI, initiatives throughout state government, complete with plans to remove certain programs, positions and more.
Another executive order kicked off major changes to government food assistance.
A recent statewide poll, however, found that Hoosiers aren’t enamored with Braun’s job performance so far. About 32% approved and 50% disapproved.
Looking forward
Braun indicated administration members “weren’t able to craft, really, any of our own legislation” in the 2025 session. The Legislature reconvened before he was even inaugurated.
The administration hasn’t yet unveiled a specific legislative agenda, even though lawmakers have already spent two weeks of the 2026 session on redistricting. They also have pledged to cut work next year short by two weeks to avoid extra expense to taxpayers.
“Even though it won’t be very long or extensive,” Braun said, “we’ll still maybe work forward” and “buil(d) upon what we did in the first year.”

He said lowering health care costs remains a top priority along with education and utilities.
“I’m really looking at anything that’s going to take the kitchen table issues, whether it comes from the Senate or the House, and see what we can do to make that better for Hoosiers,” Braun said. “And I’m holding nothing against anyone when it comes to what we do collectively there.”
Dozens of bills have already been filed. Lawmakers gather again beginning Jan. 5.
Asked what he’s looking forward to in the interim, Braun said he fishes and hunts — including for mushrooms — and manages timber grounds.
“I didn’t give up the things I really like,” he added, despite the demands of public office. “I love nature.”
His favorite foraged fungi are shelves of oyster mushrooms.
“You can find them all throughout the year. They’re not near as particular as a morel would be,” Braun said. “Most years, (morels) decide just not to come up due to it being too warm or not moist enough, and they say, ‘See you maybe next year.'”

Farm industry leaders in Michigan and across the country say a new federal aid package announced last week, including $12 billion in one-time “bridge payments” to farmers, will not come close to offsetting mounting losses tied to trade disruptions and rising input costs.
Michigan is home to more than 40,000 farms and nearly 10 million acres of farmland, and agriculture contributes more than $100 billion a year to the state’s economy.
Bob Thompson, president of the Michigan Farmer’s Union, said tariffs have significantly disrupted income for small family farms across the state.
“The income levels that we had anticipated are out the window,” Thompson pointed out. “Our markets have pretty much dried up. The input costs have risen dramatically. Your family farmers are squeezed right to the bone.”
Federal officials say the $12 billion package is meant as short-term relief, with payments expected by late February. They say longer-term trade and Farm Bill provisions take effect later.
National farm policy experts said the aid may help with short-term cash flow but does not address deeper problems in the agricultural economy.
Ben Lilliston, director of rural strategies and climate change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, said for farmers, there is a huge amount of uncertainty going into 2026.
“They don’t know how real these trade agreements actually are,” Lilliston explained. “They don’t know what the market’s going to look like. They have to make planting decisions soon. I think that is the real concern. It’s causing an enormous amount of stress.”
And for farm families in Michigan, Thompson noted uncertainty is showing up in very real ways.
“Bridge payments will undoubtedly go to cover banknotes, fertilizer bills,” Lilliston outlined. “Unlikely to actually put any money in a living account to buy our own groceries.”

The Trump administration is trying to slash access to lawyers who defend the rights of Americans with disabilities, advocates say.
Most of the lawyers work either for the Department of Justice or for disability rights agencies that Congress set up in every state decades ago. Many of the Justice Department lawyers quit in 2025 after being reassigned to other duties, their supporters say. And Trump budget officials proposed deep cuts to federal grants supporting the state-based legal groups.
People with disabilities have the right to live in their communities if possible. Federal laws and court decisions say they may attend school, work jobs, and go to restaurants, movie theaters, and other public places. If they can find lawyers, they can file legal challenges when those rights are denied.
The federally funded attorneys quietly work to ensure the U.S. lives up to promises made by the Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws, said Alison Barkoff, a health law professor at George Washington University.
“I think many families of people with disabilities, or even many people with disabilities themselves, don’t hear about it until they Google, ‘Where can I get help?’” said Barkoff, who helped lead such efforts under Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.
The attorneys’ goals include ensuring that people with disabilities have the services they need to live in their own homes, instead of having to move into nursing homes or other types of institutions, Barkoff said.
“These are people who, if these supports are ripped away, are going to have to leave their communities and their families, at a higher cost for taxpayers,” she said.
The state-based disability rights groups are known as “protection and advocacy” organizations. Most of them are nonprofit groups.
Congress approved the federally financed system in the 1970s after TV journalist Geraldo Rivera exposed abuses in a New York institution for people with mental and intellectual disabilities, revelations that ignited a national outcry.
President Donald Trump proposed cutting the system’s federal funding from $148 million to $69 million for fiscal year 2026, according to the National Disability Rights Network, which represents the state-based groups.
Appropriations committees in the U.S. House and Senate have recommended Congress maintain funding at the previous level. But advocates for the agencies worry that even if Congress maintains current support, the administration will try again to slash their support in future years. “It definitely would put people in our communities in harm’s way,” said Marlene Sallo, the national network’s executive director.
White House officials declined to comment on why the Trump administration proposed the deep cuts.
Isaac Schreier’s family can attest to the value of the state-based legal groups.
Isaac, 7, lives in Ankeny, Iowa. He has a rare condition called osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease. The condition has caused about 60 bone fractures, including in his limbs, spine, and skull. It can cause intense pain and leave him unable to walk.
At times, Isaac’s disability is practically invisible, said his father, Jake Schreier. Unless he has recently suffered a broken leg bone, he walks well. “But he tires much more quickly than you or I would.”
Isaac’s doctor said he needed a special wheelchair that could be adjusted to put him in different positions depending on which bones were broken. But the private insurer that manages his Medicaid coverage declined to pay for the $3,500 wheelchair. “They required proof that it was a permanent and long-standing condition,” Jake Schreier said. “We were very frustrated.”
Schreier appealed the denial but lost. A nurse at a specialty clinic then recommended he reach out to Disability Rights Iowa, a federally funded protection and advocacy group that had helped other families in similar straits.
The group linked Schreier with two of its attorneys, who filed a new appeal. The lawyers wrote a detailed letter explaining why Isaac was legally entitled to the new wheelchair, and they cited specific Iowa codes and court precedents.
The insurer wound up paying for Isaac’s special wheelchair.
The chair allows Isaac to participate in school and community activities even when he has broken bones. “It’s absolutely night and day. I can’t imagine a world where we didn’t have it,” his father said.
Isaac may again need people like the disability rights lawyers to fight for him, so he won’t be shunted away from society, Schreier said. “We’re really trying to keep as many doors open as possible for him.”
The threat to the state-based groups’ funding comes as the Trump administration seeks to force more people with mental illness or addictions into institutions.
David Hutt, deputy executive director for legal services at the National Disability Rights Network, noted that the groups have legal authority to go into facilities where people with disabilities live, to check conditions and treatment. Those facilities include state institutions and privately owned nursing homes.
More Americans could wind up living in such settings if Trump succeeds in his quest to institutionalize people with mental illness who are living on the streets, Hutt said.
At the same time, states are facing cuts in federal contributions to Medicaid, the public health coverage program for people with low incomes or disabilities. In response, they may be tempted to reduce Medicaid coverage of community care programs, many of which are considered optional under federal law, Hutt said. If that happens, “you’re going to get increased institutionalization, which actually costs more,” he said.
Disability rights organizations often have stepped in when states failed to provide care and services that people with disabilities are entitled to. So have lawyers from the Justice Department’s civil rights division.
For example, Disability Rights Iowa filed a lawsuit in 2023 alleging the state failed to provide proper mental health resources for children on the Medicaid program. The state agreed to a settlement that advocates said could bring “radical change” to the system.
In 2021, the Justice Department warned Iowa officials that their lack of support for community services meant too many people with intellectual disabilities had to live in facilities. State officials vowed to do better.
Since Trump returned to office, many of the Justice Department’s most experienced disability rights lawyers have taken buyouts or been reassigned to other areas, said Jennifer Mathis, a former top administrator at the Justice Department under Biden. “There’s really skeleton staffing at this point,” said Mathis, now deputy director of the Bazelon Center, which advocates for rights of people with mental disabilities.
The overall civil rights division is down to about 300 people, fewer than half the number it had under Biden, Mathis said.
The civil rights division’s new director, Harmeet Dhillon, told conservative commentator Glenn Beck in April that more than 100 attorneys had left the division, but that they didn’t support Trump’s priorities. “The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws, not woke ideology,” she told Beck.
In a statement to KFF Health News, Dhillon said the division continues to be “a vocal and active advocate for Americans with disabilities.”
Dhillon noted the department recently sued Uber over complaints that the ride-hailing service was turning away customers with service dogs or wheelchairs; has secured agreements with Arkansas and North Carolina to improve treatment of imprisoned people with disabilities; and is investigating large bus companies over allegations of failing to provide proper accommodations for people with disabilities.
The department declined to comment on the record about the number of attorneys it has working on disability rights issues. However, it is publicly recruiting “civil rights warriors,” including lawyers, to join the civil rights division.
Jake Schreier, the Iowa parent, hopes the issue will be worked out nationally. “I really can’t believe this is anything that would be partisan,” he said.

(Getty Images)Affordability has become a national political watchword recently, but the challenges of making ends meet are all too real for many across Indiana.
For over a decade, more than a third of Hoosiers have been in or near poverty. The challenges of affording to live in a state that touts its low cost of living have long been clear to many Hoosier families.
Simply put, everything in Indiana continues to get more expensive, and wage growth in the state fails to keep up with household survival budgets.
Most of those in Indiana experiencing hunger earn too much to qualify for federal SNAP benefits. With rents rising and not enough rental units available, half of all Marion County renters are cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their monthly income on rent and utilities. The average age for first-time homebuyers is now 38 in Indiana, in part because of soaring prices and high interest rates. Utility rates are growing faster now than they have in two decades. Child care costs also continue to grow, and Hoosier families are spending on average 11% of their incomes on care that feels increasingly out-of-reach but never has been more essential. The number of Hoosier students going to college continues to decline, in part because of growing tuition and concerns about returns on investment.

These problems do more than just keep people stuck in place. They prevent Hoosiers from achieving some measure of the American dream.
Hoosiers need policy responses to these cost pressures if they are to thrive. Too many in our state are delaying — or foregoing — things once seen as central features of what it meant to be successful and stable in America: college education, marriage and children, financial savings, home ownership. This is happening because of a chronic affordability crisis in our state.
Nonprofits and philanthropies are doing their best to support those most in need. They raise money to alleviate hunger; they step up to help develop new housing; they are, despite waitlists and rate cuts, providing essential services like child care and health care to people with few other options. Americans have always supported one another by donating and volunteering through nonprofits. But today, fewer people have the means or the time to help.
Private philanthropy alone cannot solve these challenges. It needs partners in government to create conditions that allow all families to be economically stable.
As the General Assembly reconvenes in 2026, its members must make affordability its focus. Indiana needs its leaders to deliver policies that create economic opportunities, and that address the high costs of getting by for all Hoosiers.

Now, the Yale-educated attorney from Jackson is launching a primary challenge aimed at ousting one of the body’s most long-entrenched members.  
Turnage, 33, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senate Conference Vice Chair Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, will challenge U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson. Thompson has represented the 2nd Congressional District covering Jackson and the Delta since 1993. Thompson, a civil rights leader and former chair of the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6th Capitol attack, is a towering figure in state and national politics. 
The intraparty contest between a millennial first-time candidate with a polished resume and a baby boomer who is one of the longest-serving members of the U.S. House could reveal generational and policy debates simmering among Democrats as the party aims to reclaim a House majority in 2026.  
Turnage has positioned himself as a generational challenger focused on affordability, economic power and what he calls a “come home agenda” centered on reversing Mississippi’s brain drain problem. 
“This is the poorest district in the poorest state in the country,” Turnage said in an interview. “It was that way when I was 1-year old, when Congressman Thompson was first elected, and it remains that way today. We need real plans for real change.”
In a statement to Mississippi Today, Thompson said his record speaks for itself.
“Elections were created to give people the ability to make a choice,” Thompson said. “I am confident that my record on behalf of the people of Mississippi’s Second Congressional District will speak for itself. I will continue to run my campaign the way I always have. I trust the voters of the district to make their choice.”
Mississippi’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from the Delta through much of Jackson and along the Mississippi River. It is majority Black and has been reliably Democratic for decades, a product of both demographics and court-ordered redistricting under the Voting Rights Act, a key provision of which is now before the Supreme Court. If federal law changes, some leading Republicans have suggested that Mississippi should redraw the lines of Thompson’s district in an effort to remove him from office. 
Turnage lived briefly in Cleveland as a child before returning to Jackson, attending Murrah High School in the Jackson Public Schools system. His parents, Ellis and Ellie Turnage, are both attorneys. His father spent much of his early career litigating Voting Rights Act cases in Mississippi, Turnage said, while his mother now serves as general counsel for Jackson Public Schools.
Turnage described a family story shaped by his parents’ experience as children during the first wave of school integration in Mississippi. His parents both drew from those memories to pursue careers in public service. His father went on to work on judicial redistricting in the 1980s, which helped elect more Black judges in Mississippi who had been disadvantaged due to unfair maps, Turnage said. His mother went on to work for Jackson Public Schools, one of the largest districts in the state. 
But Turnage did not have grand designs on a political career from an early age. 
Initially planning a career in science, majoring in physics at Morehouse College in Atlanta, he ultimately chose law school. His decision to enter law school at Yale and the political worldview he adopted while in school were sharpened amid the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. 
While the movement focused squarely on policing and criminal justice, Turnage said he became increasingly concerned with what felt like an element of the story that had been overlooked: the economic conditions underlying inequality.
“I was equally enraged that a Black man in America felt he had to sell loose cigarettes,” Turnage said, referencing the 2014 death of Eric Garner in New York. “Missing from the conversation was economic rights.”
At Yale, Turnage was also a classmate of Lina Kahn, who would go on to become former President Joe Biden’s Federal Trade Commission chair. Turnage’s proximity to Kahn offers a window into his policy background and the way he might try to frame his agenda on the campaign trail. 
Kahn is credited with ushering in a resurgent interest in antitrust and the way corporate concentration leads to unfairness in the economy, particularly amid the ever-growing power of American technology giants such as Amazon and Google. 
She is perhaps the leading intellectual architect behind the “Neo-Brandeisianists,” a group of legal scholars, think tanks and activists jockeying for influence within the Democratic Party. Drawing inspiration from the anti-monopolist work of 20th-century U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, these Democrats see increasing corporate concentration in the economy as a threat to democracy and individual freedom. Bringing corporations to heel through stronger antitrust enforcement and redistributive tax policy is at the center of this approach.
Another central figure close to this faction is Sen. Warren of Massachusetts. After law school, Turnage worked for Warren, helping her draft legislation aimed at curbing corporate power, including the Price Gouging Prevention Act. He later served as a top lawyer for Sen. Schumer of New York, working on Democratic leadership priorities.
Turnage currently leads the Southern Justice Project at the Open Markets Institute, an antitrust-focused think tank that also counts Kahn among its former employees. 
Turnage places himself firmly in the wing of the Democratic Party pushing for aggressive antitrust enforcement and consumer protections, arguing that corporate concentration is driving high prices and public distrust.
“Affordability is at the top of mind for people,” he said. “It’s not enough anymore to just say you’re a Democrat or you’re not Donald Trump. People want real plans.”
That perspective, Turnage said, informs his “come home agenda,” aimed at stemming Mississippi’s long-running brain drain. He hopes to win economic incentives for young people to stay in or return to the state. He has also pledged to refuse corporate PAC money, support a ban on stock trading by members of Congress and push for tighter campaign-finance rules.
Turnage pointed to Thompson’s vote against the For the People Act, a sweeping Biden-era Democratic voting rights and ethics bill. Thompson was the lone Democratic “no” vote against the legislation in March of 2021. Thompson, who has long been a defender of voting rights, said he worried that the independent redistricting provisions in the bill might threaten majority-minority districts. 
Thompson has built his influence through decades-long seniority. He chaired the House Homeland Security Committee and later led the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, making him the most visible Mississippi politician in national Democratic politics.
Turnage acknowledged Thompson’s stature but said incumbency would not deter him from mounting a challenge. 
“Nobody’s entitled to this seat,” he said. “It belongs to the district, and they decide every two years who gets to hold it.”
Another Democratic candidate named Bennie Foster has also filed to run against Thompson. 
On the Republican side, Adams County Supervisor Kevin Wilson announced last week that he plans to challenge Ron Eller, who is running again for the GOP nomination after losing to Thompson by nearly 25 points in 2024.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16154954/20251215_EvanTurnage-102.jpg,,,2025-12-17 07:57:12.604100

At the St. Louis City Justice Center, people behind bars have complained of going weeks without showers and months without fresh air or direct sunlight. One incarcerated person described how swiftly fights can break out without staff present. 
At the St. Louis County Jail, a former corrections officer said women detainees have bled through their clothes onto the floor because no one provided pads or tampons during their periods. Several people have attempted suicide, the officer added, including one man who was just minutes away from hanging himself from a ceiling vent by a bedsheet before officers intervened.

The situation inside the county jail is so bad that it failed an inspection by the American Correctional Association, an organization that critics say has rubber-stamped dangerous facilities. The preliminary audit cited overcrowding and understaffing as among the jail’s major issues. 
Both currently and previously incarcerated people, and current or former officers at both jails, told The Marshall Project – St. Louis that staffing shortages are endangering the health and safety of officers and residents alike. The jails are short between one-quarter and one-half the expected number of officers. As a result, detainees’ basic needs are ignored, emergency medical response is delayed, and staff are pushed to their limits. The situation is dire, said former city and county jail administrator Doug Burris. 
“The culture at the Justice Center is one of regularly being overwhelmed because of the lack of correctional officer staffing available to operate the facility safely,” Burris wrote in his operational review of the city jail in January. “There is a need for officers to be available to respond to an emergency literally every minute of the day.” 
The current crisis began during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the city jail experienced a sharp drop in staffing while the jail population rose. Officer employment decreased by 32% between 2021 and 2024, as the incarcerated population climbed by 40% in that same three-year period. Corrections officers at the city jail said the health risk of interacting with hundreds of people a day, without the additional pay other essential workers received, drove many people away. 
“I’ve been working since 2019, through the trenches. I was in here every single day until it was over, and I’m still coming in here,” Officer Nikie Edwards said. “Give us our hazard pay.” 

At the slightly larger county jail, the population and staffing trends are similar, according to Nate Hayward, who worked more than three decades at the county jail until becoming the city jail’s newest commissioner earlier this year. As of the September audit, the jail’s population had climbed to 1,340 people — more than 100 detainees above its rated capacity — while the number of full-time staff dropped to 269, from an average of 362 employees last year. 
“We were short big-time in St. Louis County,” he told The Marshall Project – St. Louis in a September interview, noting that the county was down at least 70 officers when he left. “We made it work, but it’s a big issue there, just like in the city.” 
Both St. Louis city and county have tried to grow their ranks by lowering the minimum age necessary to become a correctional officer. At the county jail, applicants were required to be at least 21 years old to work there until 2021; on current applications, that age restriction no longer exists. At the city jail, the minimum age is 19. 
While this range is standard among prisons and jails across the country, and mirrors a similar loosening of the age requirement at the state prison level, administrators said hiring teenagers has only created new problems.  
According to Hayward and other current staff, young officers rarely last at the jails. They are often unable to control their tempers when provoked by people behind bars and fail to keep calm under pressure, staff said. Conversely, the teenagers are also easily influenced by their peers and by older detainees, and frequently get in trouble for showing preferential treatment or choosing not to enforce policies for the detainees they prefer. 
The swift termination of young officers contributes to an already high turnover rate, officers said. A large share of newly hired officers quit their jobs within 180 days of starting, Burris noted in his January report of the city jail. Current officers attribute the attrition to the long and often demanding shifts, where they are expected to perform the duties of multiple officers on their own. 
And as staff numbers dwindle, a vicious cycle intensifies.
“A lot of the issues come from not having staff, and a lot of the staff don’t want to stay because of the issues,” said Trey Lodge, the city jail’s security chief. “It’s like we can’t get out of that cycle.” 
For corrections officers, issues range from having to sacrifice meals and breaks to mandatory overtime, they said, which grates away at their mental health, causing some officers to snap and others to grow apathetic to bleak living conditions for people in jail. And for people incarcerated at both jails, understaffing means their rights are violated when access to essential services like showers, soap, and phone calls is denied, while medical and mental health conditions are often ignored until they become deadly.  
“I’ve worked 12-hour shifts by myself,” said Ushma Michel, a former corrections officer at the St. Louis County jail who said she was hired in late 2024 and quit in July. 
“I had to, because overnight it would just be one of us handling 200 inmates,” she said. “ If you had an emergency, which I did, it took the lieutenant five minutes to get there. By that time, the individual could have passed away.”
Near the end of her time at the county jail, Michel said two people tried to kill themselves within the same week: one by drug overdose, and one by attempted hanging. 
According to the audit, the jail is short 74 officers, making it difficult for the facility to meet the mandated two-officer minimum per housing unit. When an officer is working a wing of the jail alone, Michel said, they must be constantly roving the floor and checking for signs of life in every cell, hoping nothing goes wrong in another unit — or if it does, that someone gets there in time.   
“These walks are so important… the thing is, no one wants to do them because they’re exhausted,” she said. “But if you’re not doing your job, then someone’s gonna die.”
A consequence of long hours and low morale, Michel said, is that meeting detainees’ basic needs becomes a low priority for some officers. She recalled putting in a request to a lieutenant for a new pair of underwear for a woman on her period. When she returned to work later that week, she found out the woman had been stuck in the same bloody undergarments for over a day, until they became so unusable that her cellmate offered to share her extra pair. 
In the jail’s audit, inspectors reported that 28 people were diagnosed last year with hygiene-related illnesses or conditions, such as scabies or fungal infections. 
“They shouldn’t have to wait three days to get toilet paper, or two days to get pads,” Michel said. “When I left, I had inmates that were literally sobbing because I was the only one that made sure they had pads, or toilet paper, or a toothbrush.”
At the city jail, violence and neglect of medical emergencies pose a threat to both staff and incarcerated people. In November, a detainee was charged with beating a corrections officer unconscious. Incidents like these are part of a pattern of behavior that Burris said “is making the jail unsafe and destroying staff morale.” The beating came only a week after a man in his 50s was found unresponsive at the jail due to an unidentified medical emergency, marking the jail’s third death this year. 
Charl Howard, who has been waiting since March for his trial on assault and trespassing charges, said he’s become increasingly fearful about what the officer shortage means for his safety, and the safety of others inside. Last fiscal year, the city reportedly employed 84 corrections officers out of a budgeted 226. Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Jamella Brown said the number of officers held steady this fiscal year, but the budget now only supports 161 officers to work with the nearly 800 detainees at the jail. 
In June, Howard recalled a fight that broke out when his unit was left unsupervised for nearly an hour. In the absence of any staff, he said, “guys know they’ll have a chance to fight” with impunity. Howard said he watched from his cell as two men let out of their cells began to brawl, until one detainee flung the other from the top tier of the housing unit onto the floor below. 
“The guy got up, shook it off, and they fought some more. He limps now,” Howard said. “But it was like 30 to 45 minutes before a CO showed up. There was enough time to clean up the blood on the tables and floor of the day room. By the time the officer came in, it was hush-hush again.”
The panic buttons in the cells also don’t work, Howard noted, which makes it challenging to alert an officer when there’s a fight or other urgent issue. If someone is having a medical emergency, he said, detainees are forced to kick the doors and scream to get someone’s attention.
Corrections officers from both the city and county detailed the steps they believe the jail’s leadership — the commissioner or director, and other administrators — could take to hire and retain more employees. At the top of the list are better pay and greater investment in the essential resources that benefit both staff and detainees. These two fixes could help to change the perception of what it’s like to work at the local jail, they said. 
The county jail’s starting salary is just shy of $44,000. At the city jail, meanwhile, starting salaries range from about $47,000 to nearly $54,000, with a potential bonus of $3,500 for officers who complete their probationary period. 
“There could be more money across the board,” said Edwards, the city jail officer. “There are people who say, ‘You could pay me a million dollars, and I wouldn’t do corrections.’ But we’re doing it, so pay us what we’re worth.”  
Other officers cited a need for more cleaning supplies, a mentorship program and a stronger presence at job fairs and recruitment events. Officers are eager to increase educational opportunities and other resources for people in jail, they said, but those programs are impossible to run without hiring more employees. 
Hayward, the city jail commissioner, said finding new ways to improve recruitment and retention is among his top priorities. Candidates are interviewed steadily throughout the year, and so finding people who are the right fit for the job to reduce turnover is the next step. 
The city’s Division of Corrections held its first-ever job fair to recruit new officers in October, and Hayward said he would also consider increasing bonuses for new officers who perform well during their first few months on the job (He also acknowledged that he was not opposed to poaching some of the county’s more experienced officers).
The county jail’s interim director, Jonel Coleman, said pay is the biggest barrier to recruitment and retention. Coleman said the top priority needs to be offering more competitive salaries, and that she was also looking into launching a “staff wellness program” focused on addressing stress and burnout. Regarding deteriorating conditions, she stated that she was not aware of, and does not condone, forcing a female resident to stay in bloody underwear. She also said that suicide attempts “are common in jail,” but that officers’ responses to these situations have saved lives. 
However, a coalition of community organizers is pushing for a greater focus on reducing the population of both jails, rather than hiring more officers. In his operational review, Burris warned of an “alarming” increase in population in recent years and acknowledged that the jail is “incapable of sustaining this kind of continued growth.” The county jail’s audit cited similar concerns with overcrowding. 
Michel, the former corrections officer, said the county jail’s problems stem from leadership’s willful ignorance of fundamental health and safety issues, choosing to spend the department’s money on luxuries instead of necessities. 
“We got them gym equipment,” she said, “but my inmate hasn’t had a shower in three days.” 
The jails’ audit noted that the facility is suffering a crisis of leadership, with different people cycling through multiple top administrator positions in just the short time the audit was conducted. The numerous vacancies, and lack of experience from those who have just started their jobs, have undoubtedly contributed to the jail’s lack of direction and high turnover, the report noted. 
In an open letter sent to the American Correctional Association over the summer, Michel asked the association to launch an independent investigation into workplace safety and staffing levels at the jail (in addition to the routine inspection and audit conducted in September).
“These issues have escalated to a point that threatens the safety, dignity, and legal rights of both staff and inmates,” she wrote. “The [county’s] Department of Justice Services is hemorrhaging skilled, dedicated professionals because those in power have failed to protect them. The consequences of inaction are not theoretical — they are immediate, measurable, and dangerous.” 
According to Michel, the correctional association has yet to respond.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BReTJNAQ-1024x538.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 07:57:12.604100

(Photo by Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images)Health facilities in New Jersey that store frozen human embryos and eggs have new licensing requirements and rules to guard against operational failures under regulations that took effect Monday.
State lawmakers ordered the state Department of Health in a 2019 law to create statewide standards for hospitals, reproductive laboratories and medical practices, in-vitro fertilization clinics, and cryopreservation facilities where such tissue is stored.
The new rules require the facilities to be accredited, apply for licensure, and follow new standards on equipment safety and maintenance, emergency preparedness, quality management, recordkeeping, and reporting.
New Jersey officials say we are the first state to adopt a regulatory framework specifically targeting such facilities, which otherwise are overseen by federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Gov. Phil Murphy said New Jersey’s new rules set a national standard for safe embryo storage.
“Undergoing fertility services can be an emotional and life-altering process for New Jerseyans trying to start a family. The last thing patients undergoing fertility services should have to worry about is whether their eggs and embryos are stored correctly,” Murphy said in a statement. “By setting clear regulations, we are holding embryo storage facilities in New Jersey to a higher standard and ensuring patients focus on what matters most in their pursuit of parenthood.”
The new rules come as people increasingly rely on reproductive medicine and technology. New Jersey fertility clinics performed nearly 13,000 assisted reproductive technology procedures in 2022, resulting in more than 5,500 births, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Key provisions of the new rules require backup power systems and oxygen sensors in rooms where liquid nitrogen is used; remote alarms on cryogenic storage equipment; written policies on how reproductive tissue should be disposed of if a facility closes or a client dies; and reporting on equipment issues that could affect stored reproductive tissue.
Violators face fines and license suspension, revocation, or renewal refusal.
“With these rules, New Jersey is setting a national benchmark for protecting people hoping to start or grow their families as they navigate one of the most significant and complicated periods in their lives,” acting Health Commissioner Jeff Brown said in a statement.

With most of the federal funding targeting commodity crops less common in Vermont, officials encourage area farmers to stay informed.

President Donald Trump’s administration recently announced $12 billion available in one-time bridge payments to farmers impacted by trade market disruptions and increased production costs, including some in Vermont.
Up to $11 billion would be used for the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program, some of which could provide relief to Vermont row crop farmers eligible for the program. 
The program will consider crop losses during the past year and help tackle market disruptions, high input costs, inflation and market losses due to “unfair trade practices,” according to a press statement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week.
The remaining $1 billion would be dedicated to specialty crops not covered by the bridge assistance program. The USDA has yet to share details on what crops would fit into this category and the timeline for allocating the funds.
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said in a statement that the hardships farmers in Vermont and nationwide are experiencing are largely caused by President Trump’s tariffs and trade policies.
“Farmers want to farm, they don’t want endless government handouts,” Welch wrote, pointing out that the funding won’t really help dairy farmers. “President Trump’s proposed bailout will do nothing to end the pain of his tariffs or support farmers in the long-term.”
“Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to work together to pass the multi-year Farm Bill that America’s farmers deserve,” he added.

Wendy Wilton, executive director of the Farm Service Agency in Vermont, said the $11 billion is aimed at commodity crops, which are primarily located in Southern and Midwestern states, whereas a lot of the corn grown in Vermont is for cattle feed. She said it is still unclear whether that will be included in the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program.
But, Wilton added, the $1 billion set aside for specialty crops might have a bigger impact in Vermont. 
“That’s where I see Vermont producers being able to apply for this money or to obtain it,” she said.
Brian Kemp, who manages a large dairy heifer raising operation in Addison and Rutland counties, said the farm only had about half the corn it normally produces because of the recent drought, resulting in losses of over $100,000.

Kemp said he contacted his local FSA office, but it was still unclear whether there would be any money available for dairies like his own that predominantly grow corn.  
“Nobody’s really clear yet if this is going to have much of an impact in our region or in the dairy industry,” he said, adding that there are some grain growers in Vermont who might be able to benefit from the program, albeit a small percentage.
Wilton said the agency would provide more information as soon as it becomes clear what crops would be covered among the specialty crops and the process to apply for the funds.
In the meantime, she encouraged Vermont farmers to submit their 2025 acreage reporting by 5 pm on Dec. 19 and contact their local Farm Service office with any questions. Farmers eligible for the $11 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance Program can expect payments to be issued by the end of February, according to the USDA press release.
As some aspects of the aid package are yet to be finalized, Anson Tebbetts, Vermont’s agriculture secretary, said there might be some opportunities for Vermont farmers.
“Over the next few weeks, farmers should at least make contact with their FSA office and see if there’s anything there that they’d be eligible for,” Tebbetts said.

The seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit), is a deep blue district that covers much of Detroit. 
Morton said in a press release from his campaign that he decided to run as an independent candidate as a rejection of partisan politics, “because my allegiance is to the people of Michigan’s 13th Congressional District — not a party label.”
“I know families are struggling to make ends meet, seniors worry about their health and security, and too many hardworking people including young people see little opportunity to get ahead,” Morton added in the press release. “Michigan’s 13th Congressional District needs a leader with a bold plan who will bridge the divide between business and labor, create good-paying jobs, make housing and healthcare affordable, and deliver real results for every community across Detroit, Downriver, Grosse Pointe and the entire district.”
He announced his candidacy on Monday night at the Considine Little Rock Recreation Center in Detroit.
According to the press release, Morton has worked as CEO of the Detroit Academy of Arts and Sciences and as associate general counsel and Director of Community Affairs at the Detroit Medical Center, as well as serving with the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin lawmakers at the state and federal level have proposed a flurry of policies to support Wisconsin farmers after the first year of the second Trump administration brought increased uncertainty, the whiplash of trade wars and the fear of increased immigration enforcement against migrant workers. 
Last week, the Trump administration announced it would be providing $12 billion in bridge payments to American farmers to help them manage the economic fallout of Trump’s tariffs. The tariffs have increased the costs of inputs such as machinery and fertilizer while limiting international markets for U.S. farm products. 
After the bailout was announced, Wisconsin farm advocates said the money was needed to help make ends meet this year, but called for more permanent solutions so farmers can make a living from what they grow. 
“This relief will help many Wisconsin farm families get through a tough stretch, and we recognize the need for that kind of support in a crisis,” Wisconsin Farmers Union President Darin Von Ruden said in a statement. “But farmers in our state don’t want to rely on emergency payments year after year — we want a fair shot at making a living from the work we do. It’s time for long-term solutions that bring stability back to our markets, tackle consolidation, and ensure rural communities across Wisconsin can thrive.”
Wisconsin’s soybean farmers have been among the hardest hit by the Trump trade wars because China was a massive market for the crop. 
Dr. Success Okafor, policy fellow at the Michael Fields Agricultural Institute, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the Trump administration needs to help farmers of commodity crops such as corn and soybeans and specialty crops such as vegetables. The U.S. Department of Agriculture program has set aside $11 billion for commodity producers and $1 billion for specialty crops. 
“For many Wisconsin farmers, especially those already under financial pressure, the relief is important, but the key issue is not whether the relief exists, but it is whether it is accessible and aligned with long-term resilience,” Okafor said. “Soybean farmers in Wisconsin have been hit particularly hard by the trade disruptions, and targeted relief for those losses is absolutely warranted. But the question is not whether soybean producers should receive support, but how this relief can be structured so it does not unintentionally exclude other farmers who are also economically vulnerable.”
Okafor said key elements of an equitable government relief program for farmers would include transparency in how losses are calculated, flexibility in program design and making sure access is not limited by short deadlines or complex paperwork. 
Bipartisan bill to help for organic farms
Last week, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden joined a bipartisan effort to support organic farmers. The Domestic Organic Investment Act would extend a UDA grant program to help organic farmers find markets for their products. 
A number of Democratic state legislators also introduced legislation aimed at helping Wisconsin’s farmers find markets for their products. The bills are unlikely to move forward under the Republican-controlled Legislature, but the package of agriculture bills is among the proposals Democrats have made throughout the year to signal their agenda if they win a state legislative majority next year. 
The proposal includes grants to support specialty products that are sold locally, providing healthy food to federal food assistance recipients and expanding the state’s farmland preservation program. 
“The federal government has failed our farmers and our agricultural economy,” Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said at a news conference last week. “We would not need a $12 billion bailout for our farmers if the Trump administration was doing right by them in the first place. We are now trying to play catch up, and here in Wisconsin, we are trying to fill in those gaps and support our farmers in these difficult times as the Trump administration fails.” 
At its annual conference in Wisconsin Dells last week, the Farmers Union set its 2026 priorities, which include managing the continued consolidation of the agricultural industry, protecting the rights of immigrant workers, supporting family dairy farms and ensuring access to quality health care. 
At the local level across Wisconsin, debates are raging over the best use of the state’s agricultural land. A number of communities had heated  arguments over proposals to construct massive data centers on existing farmland while others have continued yearslong efforts to oppose the expansion of massive factory farms. 
Despite pressure from industry groups and business lobbyists, towns across western Wisconsin have enacted local ordinances limiting the ability of farms to expand without local approval. Last week, the town of Gilman became the third Pierce County community to pass a local CAFO ordinance. Gilman officials said their goal was protecting local resources while trying to encourage a local agricultural industry that can support smaller family farms. 
The new ordinance, Gilman town board chair Phil Verges said, puts in place minimum standards to address community concerns.
“We have legitimate concerns and this is the best option we have to protect ourselves from the seemingly unlimited growth of these factory farms,” Verges said. “We can’t sit by and do nothing.”

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein told the Wisconsin Examiner in a year-end interview that while she may have had a seat at the budget negotiating table this year, the Legislature still hasn’t engaged in as much bipartisan work as she had hoped. 
Democratic lawmakers entered this year with bolstered numbers under new voting maps, but still in the minority. The closely divided partisan breakdown in the Senate — 15 Democrats and 18 Republicans —  led to Republicans scrapping their plans to cut the University of Wisconsin budget and providing additional funding for K-12 schools, in budget negotiations with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers where Hesselbein had a seat at the negotiating table. But the current session still hasn’t matched up to Hesselbein’s “really high hopes at the beginning of the session that we were going to be able to do some really good bipartisan work.” 
Hesselbein noted that at the start of the session, lawmakers introduced three bills she thought were “really strong.”
“Unfortunately, Republicans are refusing to work with us on those issues,” Hesselbein said. “I am hopeful that they will go spend time with their families back home over the holidays, and they will realize that we can still get a lot of great things done for the state of Wisconsin in the spring.” 
One bill would provide school breakfast and lunch to students at no cost, another would make several policy changes aimed at helping bring down the costs of prescription drugs and the final one would expand the homestead tax credit to provide additional relief to low-income homeowners and renters.
Hesselbein said the “Healthy Schools Meals” legislation would help “every single kid, make sure they get a good nutritious lunch at school” and help “save the average family like $1800 a year on grocery costs.” She said the prescription drug legislation would help prevent more people from “choosing to cut their medicine in half” due to costs and the tax credit would help people stay in their homes longer. 
“These were three really common-sense bills. I still really think they are, and all we needed was two Senate Republicans to help us get these bills across the finish line and show that they care about the people of the state of Wisconsin and that they want to do some bipartisan work,” Hesselbein said. “Unfortunately, they weren’t interested in doing that work with us, and they don’t have a plan to help people with the rising costs in the state of Wisconsin.” 
Hesselbein said that passing helpful legislation, including the three bills she mentioned, could mitigate the upheaval of President Donald Trump’s administration.
“There’s so much chaos and confusion happening with the Trump administration that sometimes it’s hard to keep track of it day to day,” she said. “…What we can do as legislators in the state of Wisconsin is pass bills that actually help people.” 
Hesselbein said Senate Democrats continue to have conversations with Republicans in the hopes that they can get more legislation passed. One pressing concern is  the Knowles-Nelson stewardship program which, without legislative action, will sunset early in 2026. 
“We’re very worried about that happening, so our doors are open to any ideas they have,” Hesselbein said of her Republican colleagues, adding that she hopes a bill authored by Sen. Jodi Habush-Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) can move forward.
Hesselbein noted that the stewardship program, which was created in 1989 to fund land conservation in Wisconsin, has bipartisan roots. It is named after former Republican Gov. Warren Knowles and former Democratic Gov. Gaylord Nelson and was signed into law by Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson.
“This has never been a partisan issue,” Hesselbein said, noting that the program is popular with people across Wisconsin who love the outdoors, “whether they’re going hiking or they’re fishing, or they’re hunting.”
Hesselbein also said she is hopeful that the bill she coauthored, which would bolster education on menopause and perimenopause, will advance. It received a public hearing in the Senate earlier this year.
Wisconsin Senate is the ‘most flippable’ in 2026
Next year will be a definitive election year in Wisconsin with control of the Senate, Assembly and governor’s office up for grabs.
Hesselbein said she believes that the Wisconsin State Senate is “the most flippable chamber” in the United States — and Democrats are working hard towards that goal. Wisconsin’s 17 odd-numbered Senate districts are up for reelections in 2026. It’s the first time new legislative maps adopted in 2024 that reflect the 50/50 partisan divide in the state will be in effect for those districts.
Hesselbein said Democrats are focused on winning districts that previously went to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, former President Joe Biden in 2020, Gov. Tony Evers in his two elections and to Mary Burke, who lost to former Gov. Scott Walker in 2014. 
Two seats targeted by Democrats to flip are Senate District 5, which is currently held by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield) and Senate District 17, which is currently held by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green).
“Fair maps and great candidates matter, and we already have people on the field that are out there knocking on doors listening to voters today on a cold day in Wisconsin… We have people that want to be elected to do the right thing for the people in the state of Wisconsin,” Hesselbein said.
Democratic candidates in Wisconsin and nationwide are hammering a message about affordability. Through the State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, senators and two current representatives seeking Senate seats in 2026 have been touring the state to highlight the effects of Republican policy choices, including tariffs and cuts to health care at the federal level. They also recently launched an ad titled “Aisle 5.”
The ad opens as a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi), Sen. Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) and Hesselbein, declare: “Same groceries from the same store. Same people in power, calling the shots and driving the prices up.”  The words “Senate Republicans” pop up on the screen. “My colleagues and I are fighting every single day against tariffs that make beef, eggs, and even cheese more expensive,” Hesselbein says. “But guess what? They don’t care. We can’t keep hoping they’re going to make the right choice because they’ve shown us they won’t.”
Hesselbein vowed in the interview with the Examiner that under Democratic control the Senate will have more floor sessions, be more transparent and “be actually doing the people’s work.”
“When Senate Democrats are fortunate enough to be the majority, we will continue to work with our Republican colleagues and get the best policies to help the people in the state of Wisconsin, especially when it comes to rising costs,” she told the Examiner. 
Senate Democrats’ ability to pursue their agenda will not only rely on winning the majority, but will also depend on who wins the consequential gubernatorial race, though Hesselbein said she is prepared to work with whoever wins. 
“I was able to work with a Republican governor when Scott Walker was there. I was able to pass some bills,” Hesselbein said. “I’m hoping we have a Democratic governor so we can finally start listening to the people of the state of Wisconsin and get things done because we’ve been waiting a long time.” 
Hesselbein said she doesn’t plan to endorse anyone in the Democratic primary for governor. 
Many of the candidates have legislative experience including state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) as well as Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Exec. David Crowley, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey. Other Democratic candidates include former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes and former Department of Administration Sec. Joel Brennan.
“I have too many friends,” Hesselbein said of her decision not to make an endorsement. “I have been in caucus with some of them… They are really good people, and when the going got tough, they never ran from an argument or anything, so I’m really looking forward to seeing how that race shapes up.” 
Hesselbein said she is looking forward to seeing each candidate’s platform and a “robust” discussion among them. 
“What are the plans that they have for the state of Wisconsin? How do they see us addressing rising costs and affordability? What is their plan for K-12 education, higher education? For the environment and all the things that we’ve been hearing about for years that people in the state of Wisconsin want us to effectively address,” Hesselbein said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A state law aimed at forcing some immigrants to leave the state has created fear, uncertainty and tension, and left families worried about what future enforcement might mean for their safety and stability, advocates say.  
While implementation of House Bill 4156 has been placed on hold by a federal judge amid ongoing constitutionality challenges, advocates who work with the state’s immigrant communities say the 2024 law, which creates a new crime called “impermissible occupation,” continues to generate fear across the state.
The measure, which was the first of its kind in the nation, would make it a state crime to be in Oklahoma without legal authorization.  It allows state and local law enforcement to arrest anyone suspected of being unlawfully present. A first offense could result in a misdemeanor charge, punishable by up to one year in jail, a $500 fine, or both. Repeat offenses could lead to felony charges, and anyone convicted could face increased jail time or fines and would be required to leave the state within 72 hours.
The Rev. Tim Luschen, a priest at Our Lady of Mt. Carmel and Saint Therese Little Flower Church in Oklahoma City, said many of his parishioners felt fear and confusion when HB 4156 became law. 
“People were shocked and began to make plans for themselves and their families,” he said.
Luschen said anxiety grew as families worried about being detained or separated. 
“Some people grew afraid to venture out in public — to church, to school, or to the grocery store,” he said.
The enforcement debate has also spilled onto college campuses. 
Emma Martinez, University of Central Oklahoma student body vice president, recently became a U.S. citizen but said the law still feels deeply personal.
“HB 4156 fails to protect children, naturalized immigrants, and those who are actively navigating the immigration system,” she said.
She said it has created fear and division among Oklahomans.
“It has become more common to hear stories of people being afraid of going to work or running errands due to the fear of being stopped and asked for documentation,” Martinez said.
Despite being a U.S. citizen, Martinez said she’s felt discomfort when questioned about her legal status. She’s also been hesitant to speak Spanish in public. 
Still, Martinez believes awareness and solidarity can help counter that fear. She encourages Oklahomans to stay informed, support immigrant-led organizations, and remind others that “going to work or getting an education is not a crime.”
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office, meanwhile, continues to push for the ability to enforce the law. They have the backing of the Trump administration, which filed a legal brief arguing the lower court erred in blocking the law and that the statute “supplements, not undermines” federal immigration enforcement.
The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to request for comment.
As uncertainty continues, advocacy groups said they are stepping forward to support immigrant families and to challenge the constitutionality of law in court. 
League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of the plaintiffs challenging the law, has been at the forefront of efforts to bring awareness to the law’s impact.
Cristian Zapata, who served as president of LULAC’s Oklahoma City council when the bill was introduced, said his group organized a protest as the state Senate prepared to vote, filling the Capitol with immigrants from across Oklahoma. Although the measure still passed, the demonstration sent a message.
“We wanted to make sure they didn’t pass it in silence,” he said. “After that, we gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures asking the governor to reconsider.”
Despite the setback, Zapata said the organization remains committed to standing with Oklahoma’s immigrant community.
“We continue to fight for them every single day,” he said. “Diversity continues to be our greatest strength — it’s what makes not just Oklahoma, but this country, great.”
Travis Handler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said all Oklahomans, regardless of their immigration status, have “the right to build a life free from fear and persecution.
“Immigrants make Oklahoma stronger,” Handler said. “They’re not political pawns—they’re people with families, jobs, and dreams just like anyone else.”

The school filed suit against a Houston-based energy company it had partnered with to conduct enhanced oil recovery research.
The post University of Wyoming sues former energy research partner for $2.5M appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming filed a lawsuit this week seeking $2.5 million from an energy company it partnered with to research enhanced oil recovery.
The university in 2024 signed a contract with Houston-based ACU Energy to advance research at the university’s Center of Innovation for Flow Through Porous Media, according to the university’s complaint filed Monday in Wyoming’s U.S. District Court. ACU Energy agreed to pay the university $15 million over the six-year research period. The company, according to the complaint, was to pay the university $2.5 million annually with two payments each year.
While the university kept up its end of the bargain — by assembling a research team, training research members and incurring costs to modify laboratory space — ACU Energy “failed to pay the University even a cent owed under the Agreement, leaving $2,500,000 outstanding in unpaid invoices,” the complaint alleges.
ACU Energy did not respond to a WyoFile request for comment before publication.

The company notified the university in February that it was terminating the contract, and the university notified ACU Energy in May of its breach of contract, according to court filings. The university asked the court for a jury trial.
Enhanced oil recovery refers to methods used to squeeze more crude from reservoirs that have already been tapped for primary production, extending the life of an oilfield.
The university commonly accepts money from private businesses in return for lending resources and expertise to advance research. The Center of Innovation for Flow Through Porous Media is part of the university’s Research Centers of Excellence in the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences. 
The Center of Innovation for Flow Through Porous Media, led by Mohammad Piri, a professor of petroleum engineering, bills itself as “the most advanced oil and gas research facility in the world.” The center conducts research at the university’s High Bay Research facility, which “is funded by $37.2 million in state dollars and $16.3 million in private contributions, with an additional $9.2 million in private gifts for research equipment,” according to the center’s website.
The center has received donations from oil industry heavyweights like ExxonMobil, Halliburton and Baker Hughes.
Piri was tapped to serve as “principal investigator” for the UW-ACU Energy partnership, according to the university’s complaint. As of press time, ACU Energy had not filed a response to the lawsuit.

Miller’s mythical cowboys contend with the looming threat of UFOs.
The post Next stop for the Wyoming Chemtrail Caucus: The Twilight Zone appeared first on WyoFile .","“Didja see that?” Powder River Pete asked, with his neck craned to stare into a night sky darker than the inside of a cow. “There’s another ‘un. Them’s UFOs!” There was fear in his voice.

Opinion

“Naw, Pete,” Little Joe the Wrangler said soothingly, “them’s just shootin’ stars. Nothin’ to worry ‘bout, pard.”
Around the ol’ campfire, Stetsons tilted back as the circle of cowboys tried to see what had Pete so spooked.
Pete was still nervous when he answered, “Don’t be so sure. Y’all know Buck Rogers, foreman over at the Bar ET dude ranch? One o’ them flyin’ saucers sucked him outa his bedroll one night, an’ he woke up with li’l green men pokin’ and proddin’ at ‘im. He don’t remember what they done to him, but he used to have red hair an’ could yodel. Nowadays, his hair’s pure white an’ when he tries to sing, he gets hiccups that last all day. But he can speak nine different languages now.”
“Buck’s always been as full o’ bullshit as a Christmas goose,” offered Panhandle, stirring the embers with a stick.
“Y’all might not believe in that stuff,” cautioned Sweetwater Slim, “but my uncle found a dozen o’ his cows dead in a circle a couple years back. Them poor critters had been molested somethin’ terrible. Had their assholes an’ eyeballs cut out slicker’n hell, like with a straight razor.”
“Souvenirs!” snickered a voice from the smoke.
“Grass all ‘round ‘em was scorched,” continued Slim. “And he said the whole shebang smelled o’ fried stinkbugs. Go ‘head an’ laugh if ya want.”
“Some things,” exhorted Deacon from Dayton, “jest cain’t be explained. Ya simply gotta believe.” Sweaty Stetsons nodded in agreement.
“Maybe they ain’t all evil, them flyin’ saucer fellers,” suggested Sourdough. “There was this ol’ boy had a booger farm outside Lusk, an’ his well dried up. He got beamed up into one o’ them space ships, an’ them aliens showed him on a map where to drill — even told him how deep. Next day, he drilled where they told him, an’ he hit artesian water. Now, he grows the finest crop o’ Ivermectin vines ya ever laid eyes on.”
Rawhide Ricky from Rawlins recollected, “Back a few years ago, some sheepherders found a mummy o’ one o’ them aliens in a cave in the Pedro Mountains. It was ‘bout a foot an’ a half tall an’ looked meaner’n hell, like a li’l cannibal. They didn’t find no spaceship, though.”
“Yessir,” Ricky said, “I read about it in Casper Planet when I was a kid, an’ I couldn’t sleep fer a week.”

Sourdough added, “There’s an Indian rock paintin o’ them bastids up on Difficulty Creek. They got heads like buzzards an’ arms an’ legs like rattlesnakes. Ya get the heebie-jeebies when ya look at ‘em.”
“Signs an’ wonders,” preached Deacon.
The Trail Boss strode up to the campfire and chuckled, “Y’all sound like a buncha shoolkids frettiin’ ‘bout the boogieman. Dontcha know that the Chemtrail Caucus in the Legislature is gonna protect ya?”
“The who?” came the puzzled question from the encircled trail hands.
Trail Boss answered, “They used to call themselves the Freedom Caucus, but when they solved the Great Chemtrail Conundrum of 2025, they changed their name to the Chemtrail Caucus. An’ they just announced that they’s gonna tackle the UFO threat next.”
The sigh of relief around the campfire sounded like a stiff breeze.
“Iff’n ya see one o’ them flyin’ saucers full o’ aliens nowadays, them gomers in the Chemtrail Caucus has authorized ya to shoot ‘em on sight. No questions asked,” Trail Boss told the crew.
Noggins were scratched around the ol’ campfire, and questions arose through the smoke: “Is it an open season?” “Will there be a bag limit?” “Do ya think they taste like chicken?”
Just then, Cookie banged on a skillet with the butt of his suxgun and bellowed, “Come an’ git it. I cooked y’all somethin’ special fer supper. See iff’n ya can guess what it is!”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As Ukraine continues its multi-year resistance to Russian invasion, a former Nebraska state lawmaker and Army veteran is now halfway through his eighth fact-finding visit to the country since the war began.
Former State Sen. Tom Brewer, a 36-year veteran who has earned two Purple Hearts, continues to uplift stories of Ukrainians and build relationships with a small delegation to the European country.

Speaking with the Nebraska Examiner about his latest trip from a hotel in Kyiv, Brewer said a concern among Ukrainians is a fear that the U.S. will walk away. Part of his team this trip traveled to document soldiers’ stories on the eastern front.
Worries include whether Ukrainians will keep their freedom, enjoy life and maintain the democracy they’ve come to know since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Brewer said. There is also concern about whether the world fends off a ripple of conflict to the rest of Europe or beyond.
“They’re going up against a very big enemy with a lot of resources,” Brewer said. “Without especially the United States, their chances of being able to win the war are really going to be very limited.”
An offensive opportunity
Brewer, who served eight years in the Nebraska Legislature until January, sees an opportunity for the U.S. to support Ukraine with a major offensive, “to break the backs of the Russians” in key locations, such as by destroying railheads, ports, bridges, refueling stations and other critical Russian infrastructure, including in Russia. 
Doing so would require more equipment, such as Tomahawk missiles, Brewer said, but coupled with Russia’s struggling economy, he thinks it could lead to a sooner end to the war.

“But if we continue to give them bits and pieces and string this out and let Putin decide that he doesn’t like this agreement … then this war will probably drag on for years,” Brewer said, fearing more deaths of Ukrainians and Russians.
Brewer has become a household name for many Nebraska-based Ukrainians who affectionately call him “lionheart” and a “brother in arms.”
While on past trips to Ukraine, Brewer’s team has seen the Russian aggression firsthand. They’ve sheltered in bunkers as artillery shells fell and seen Russian military drones flying above.
Ongoing peace talks
Peace talks loom over whether the war could end without an offensive push. Brewer recently said on Ukrainian television he worries Russian President Vladimir Putin will drag out the talks to try to break up NATO or the European Union or to try to fray key western alliances.
Brewer and other Nebraska officials, including Gov. Jim Pillen and multiple members of the state’s congressional delegation, say peace should not mean Ukraine loses land.

For example, Brewer warned, losing the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine would cost the country the high ground and risk a “fast run” into other towns, including Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and even Kyiv.
“It would just be a horrible thing to say we will let you, Russia, write a peace plan that totally favors you and disregards Ukraine, and that that becomes the standard that we’re going to have a peace plan,” Brewer said.
He described a 28-point peace plan President Donald Trump supported as exactly that.
“Ukraine wants to end the war,” Brewer said. “Don’t get me wrong. But they don’t want to do it at such a horrible price as to lose everything that they fought for.”
Losing Ukraine would also mean the loss of a major breadbasket of much of the world, Brewer said. It would also put Russia 600 miles closer to the Baltic states and closer to potential conflict with NATO allies. Weapons systems given to Ukraine would also fall into Russian hands.

‘How to drive on with life’
The latest Brewer-led trip again includes Don Hutchens, the former longtime executive director of the Nebraska Corn Board, as Brewer’s team continues its agricultural-focused mission. The group already toured grain facilities and continues to meet with Ukrainian officials.
Another important part of Brewer’s missions has been documenting Ukrainian stories. Brewer has partnered with multiple journalists on his trips, including enlisting Nebraska’s John Grinvalds, who has joined Brewer independently. Brewer’s team visited the eastern front to interview soldiers in the trenches during this latest trip.

A previous series about Ukraine from Grinvalds, produced with 10/11 News, won a regional Edward R. Murrow award. Grinvalds published another documentary series with KETV this summer.
“The more that the American people are educated on the situation, the better off for Ukraine, because their hearts are in it,” Brewer said in his recent interview with Ukrainian state television based in Kyiv.
The latest Nebraska-led trip coincides with the Christmas season, and Brewer said Ukrainians are still celebrating. Lights are on, many via generators in Kyiv, and kids are laughing.
It’s still clear Ukraine is at war, with the number of soldiers on the streets of Kyiv home on leave, Brewer said. But despite the worry that air raid sirens could go off and send everyone scrambling for bunkers, war is not affecting the day-to-day lives of Ukrainians.
“They figured out how to drive on with life, even though they’re at war and have been at war for quite a while now,” Brewer said. “It’s just part of the routine that they’ve come to accept.”
‘A real heart for the Ukrainian people’
This time, Brewer came to Ukraine with a formal letter of support for his work from Pillen. It asks Ukrainian dignitaries to work with Brewer’s team. Pillen wrote that the Nebraska delegation comes on behalf of the state, intending to foster “a closer bond.” 
Among the named dignitaries in the letter are the Ukrainian ministers of veterans’ affairs and energy and the head of the Khmelnytskyi Oblast Military Administration.
“I ask that you grant them [Brewer and his team] full and unfettered access during their time and welcome you to share your thoughts and ideas for future cooperation between us,” Pillen wrote.

Pillen, who sat down with Grinvalds just before Brewer’s trip, said he is pleased to support Brewer’s efforts. He described Brewer, a retired Army colonel, as no stranger to serving in combat zones or providing support for special missions.
“He has a real heart for the Ukrainian people, and they could not be more grateful for his service on behalf of their country,” Pillen told the Examiner separately.
Brewer said many Ukrainians have an “old Soviet mindset” that someone isn’t official unless someone makes them official. So Pillen’s letter has the ability to open new doors, such as where Nebraska and Ukraine, with similar agricultural roots, might build future partnerships.
“You’re not some guy that just wandered in off the street and may want information or ask questions,” Brewer said.
U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., ran into Brewer’s team before they left Omaha for Ukraine and told them: “Don’t get hurt over there.” He said he has known Brewer a long time and that he’s dedicated to serving.
“He, also like the rest of us, sees an opportunity for the United States and specifically Nebraska as such an agriculturally driven country,” Flood said. “I think we are and Senator Brewer [are] taking all the steps that we should be thankful for right now.”

A freedom-loving ally
Brewer said he recognizes many Americans might see Ukraine as just a European country that the U.S. has no “dog in the hunt” for, or that “it’s not part of what we should worry about.” But Brewer stresses Ukraine is the country that “did nothing wrong.”
Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and killed many sons, daughters, fathers, mothers and even grandparents in “total war,” he said. Brewer and his team have seen and documented the destruction, including after rockets hit apartment buildings and the lives of civilians changed forever.

Brewer, who served six combat tours in Afghanistan and two in Kyrgyzstan, said Americans sometimes take freedom for granted, “because it’s just part of our life.”
“I think if you were to talk to the average Ukrainian, they would love to be more like us,” Brewer said. “They would be able to enjoy all of these freedoms and not have to constantly be fighting just to survive day to day.”
Once the war ends, Brewer said the European Union will help with a lot of funding, but he sees an opportunity for the U.S. to help with reconstruction, which could help Nebraska.
Brewer said the war in Ukraine reminds him of the American Revolution. As American colonists sought independence and freedom from the British, a much larger enemy, it was the French who made American independence possible by helping in places such as the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.
“They need help, and if they’re to be able to live to the ideals that we want to see countries be able to maintain and sustain, then we need to provide that help to them,” Brewer said of Ukraine.
He continued: “I know it sounds bad that, well, we got to send money there and all, but if it prevents us from filling body bags, I think we can afford to pay a much dearer price.”

Overall, enrollment in health insurance plans on Your Health Idaho rose by 3% this year compared to last year, with more than 120,000 Idahoans enrolled in plans on the state exchange. But the exchange also saw twice as many people — nearly 8,850 — disenroll in health insurance plans, 24% less new enrollments, and more people shifting to cheaper insurance plans, where health care costs are higher. 
Your Health Idaho Executive Director Pat Kelly said affordability was a key concern for Idahoans. 
“While we’re certainly encouraged by the increase in enrollment, we’re concerned about those that will find the plan they selected unaffordable and cancel coverage,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
In the coming months, Kelly said he expects another 20,000 Idahoans will cancel coverage due to affordability concerns. It’ll likely take until April for enrollment to settle, he said, as Idahoans get a better sense of how their insurance premiums fit in their budget, and as insurance companies can cancel coverage for nonpayment.
Enhanced premium tax credits that deeply subsidize health insurance premiums on Affordable Care Act exchanges are set to expire at the end of this year, unless Congress renews them. Congress appears on track to let the tax credits expire, as Republican leaders pursue legislation to address health care costs without extending the credits.

 ‘Idaho is about to be ground-zero for a national health care affordability crisis,’ Idaho Democrat says

Idaho’s health insurance exchange, Your Health Idaho, is likely the first state-based exchange in the nation to end open enrollment this year. 
“Idaho is about to be ground zero for a national health care affordability crisis — not because Idahoans did anything wrong, but because Republicans in Congress refuse to act,” Ada County Democratic Party Chair Jared Deloof told reporters at a news conference near U.S. Sen. Jim Risch’s office in downtown Boise.
The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

In Idaho, the credits reduced premiums by an average of $407 each month, according to the nonpartisan health policy group KFF. About 87% of Idahoans who have insurance through the state exchange received the credits, according to a report by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Jenn Bazer, a single mom of two, said she earns $75,000 a year, and picks up work on the side, but doesn’t get insurance through work. 
So, she gets insurance on the exchange for her two kids, subsidized by the tax credits, Bazer said. 
But when she got a raise at work recently — to help deal with the rising costs of her own private insurance plan — “there was just enough to kick my boys out of eligibility for the enhanced premium tax credit,” she said.

“Even if they had been able to stay on, their premium was going to increase $200 a month starting January 1st. So that was unaffordable anyway,” Bazer said. 
 Instead of extending tax credits, Idaho U.S. Sen. Crapo pursued another idea in Congress

Congress appears to be on track to let the enhanced premium tax credits expire at the end of this year. 
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said Tuesday he won’t allow a floor vote this week on a bipartisan amendment supported by moderate Republicans that would extend the credits, States Newsroom reported. 
The House is instead preparing to vote on a GOP health care bill that Republicans hope will curb rising costs.

In the Senate last week, a bill cosponsored by Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo to address rising health insurance costs didn’t pass. Crapo’s bill would provide funding through Health Savings Accounts for some Affordable Care Act marketplace enrollees, but it would not extend the enhanced tax credits.
Crapo and fellow Republican Risch also voted against a Democratic bill in the Senate that would’ve extended the credits for three years. 
“If there is a crisis coming, it is entirely of the Democrats’ making,” Crapo said in a statement. “My colleagues on the other side of the aisle created the premium tax credits as part of the Obamacare system, because they did not trust their own policy to make health insurance affordable without shifting the burden of paying for it from enrollees to taxpayers.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)An audit by the Tennessee Comptroller outlines new and persistent failures in caring for abused and neglected children taken into custody by the Department of Children’s Services.
Tennessee’s child welfare agency has fallen under scrutiny in recent years over reports of children forced to sleep on office floors, lax oversight of juvenile facilities and abuse in residential treatment centers.
Two ongoing class-action lawsuits are challenging the department’s care of children in foster care and youth with disabilities in juvenile detention.
Lawmakers have responded to the agency’s troubling record by allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding since 2022 to build more transitional housing, hire more social workers and boost their salaries and outsource case management to private companies. Child advocates have criticized the emphasis on building more institutions over prioritizing services to keep children in homes where poverty, parental substance abuse or other challenges could be addressed.
The audit released Tuesday by the Tennessee comptroller noted some agency improvements but outlined a series of lapses that place kids at risk. More than 8,000 children are in DCS custody.
“These findings call for immediate attention and meaningful action to improve oversight, accountability and care for Tennessee’s most vulnerable children and youth,” Lindsey Stadterman, an auditor for the Tennessee comptroller, told lawmakers Tuesday.
 The 213-page audit of DCS found:

delays in obtaining medical and dental screenings for children;
reliance on extended stays in temporary housing, particularly for “hard to place” children, that “further expose children and youth to significant emotional, behavioral, and safety risks”;
insufficient and untimely investigations of child abuse and neglect perpetrated by adults in authority roles, such as teachers and coaches;
delays in reporting child fatalities and near fatalities to the public. The department is charged with investigating and reporting all child abuse deaths and serious injuries;
and inadequate oversight of residential and juvenile detention centers, placing the safety of children and youth in jeopardy. 

Children’s Services Commissioner Margie Quin, who was tapped by Gov. Bill Lee to turn the agency around in 2022, told lawmakers she recognized problems persisted at the agency but said it had “moved the needle.”
Lawsuit: ‘Tennessee’s foster care system is failing children it is intended to protect’

“First, there is no question, we want immediate action, and our children and youth deserve immediate results,” Quin said during a legislative committee hearing to review the audit findings. 
“Turning a ship with almost 4,000 employees does not happen overnight,” she said. “It takes time and effort. It takes committed leadership at all levels of the department. Over the last three years, we have moved DCS and the children of Tennessee in a better direction.”
With the infusion of state funding the agency has hired more caseworkers and paid them better, limiting crushing workloads that once overwhelmed staff responsible for too many children at once. 
The department has invested more funding in allowing relatives, instead of strangers, to care for children taken from their parents.
Eleven new facilities are planned to house children, including three new “wellness spaces,” six welcome centers and two new juvenile justice centers, Quin said.
For many children now in state custody, however, the audit paints a disquieting picture.
Between March 3 and Sept. 5, 172 children spent at least one night in an office building because no appropriate foster home or treatment facility was available.
In northeast Tennessee, children spent an average of 18 days housed in government offices during the same six-month period. One child spent 104 days in an office.
An additional 1,134 children were placed in transitional housing such as churches or short-term shelters, averaging nine to 12 nights per child. The audit noted one child spent more than two months in transitional housing.
Class action complaint accuses Tennessee Department of Children’s Services of abusing disabled kids

“Extended stays in temporary housing can further expose children and youth to significant emotional, behavioral, and safety risks,” the audit noted. “These settings often lack the stability, comfort, and routine that children in state custody need to recover from trauma and build trust with caregivers.”
The unregulated spaces require DCS social workers to remain with children overnight, contributing to the strain and burnout of staff charged with looking out for kids.
“We spend more nights in offices and transitional homes than we do in our beds,” one staff member wrote anonymously in a survey cited by the audit. “It’s hard to tell a child that this is temporary when weeks keep passing and nothing changes.”
Another staff member reported the temporary shelters felt, at times, unsafe for both children and adults.
The audit noted wide variations in the conditions of the temporary shelters.
At one shelter for children in Nashville, “we observed mattresses on the floor as sleeping spaces, holes in the walls, and graffiti throughout,” auditors wrote.
In contrast, a facility in Shelby County had “newly refurbished units that were clean, organized, and equipped with bunk beds and mattresses awaiting occupancy.”
Yet that facility soon was filled with more children than the space could safely handle and “the conditions began to deteriorate.” On one night 15 children were housed in the facility, which has just nine beds, the audit noted.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DCS-23-2-1024x619.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 06:57:31.070381

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee lawmakers gave Tennessee State University a vote of confidence Tuesday, just a year after the state’s only historically Black university needed help to pay its bills following decades of underfunding.
A joint Government Operations committee voted unanimously to extend the university’s board of trustees for three years, up from the typical two-year extension. The move represented a shift in support for the university’s leadership after lawmakers voted in February 2024 to replace the previous board and forced former President Glenda Glover to resign amid questions about financial and enrollment mismanagement.
Nashville businessman Dwayne Tucker was hired after an interim president resigned when state leaders found out he signed two $800,000 consulting contracts with Glover when she left the post.
The committee heaped praise on TSU officials Tuesday, marking an about-face from a late 2022 hearing in which senators bashed Glover for mishandling an aggressive scholarship program on the heels of the COVID pandemic and causing a student housing crunch.
Democratic state Rep. Harold Love of Nashville called the move “an indication that the legislature has confidence in the direction Tennessee State University is going.”
TSU Board of Trustees Chairperson Dakasha Winton told lawmakers Tuesday the toughest task was figuring out where to start in “transforming” the university’s operations. Part of the task was to settle on enrollment figures and tuition expenses that would allow the university to flourish.
$2 million audit finds accounting problems but no fraud at Tennessee State University

“We recognize these challenges did not arise overnight,’ Winton said, adding resolving them wouldn’t happen immediately either.
A land grant university funding study determined the state shorted TSU by as much as $544 million over the course of a century. A subsequent federal study showed TSU was cut short by $2.1 billion over about 30 years.
Constantly short on money, TSU has survived over the years by borrowing money from its foundation.
The legislature funded a $2 million audit of the university when the Comptroller’s office continued to find the same budget problems yearly.
A recent audit of TSU showed it resolved four major problems but made 11 findings repeated from previous years. For instance, former management lacked controls, oversight and knowledge over accounting ledgers and related systems, weaknesses that created an error-prone environment that made it hard to identify problems, causing “enormous complexity” in tracking the simplest activities.
In addition, the audit said, “Management continued to allow a breakdown of controls related to financial reporting and has not corrected control deficiencies noted in the prior nine audits.”
The university also overcharged and undercharged students for courses and failed to properly refund some students who withdrew from classes, the audit found.
Comptroller Jason Mumpower, who has worked closely with Tucker to reshape TSU’s financial situation, blamed previous administrations for the continuing problems.
Since being appointed, Tucker and the new board have been trying to understand the “issues they inherited,” Mumpower said.
“While it is too early to measure long-term results, early indications show a willingness to confront longstanding problems, increase transparency, and cooperate with state oversight partners,” Mumpower said.
TSU signed an operating agreement with the state in June, shortly after approving a 6% increase in tuition and fees. The memorandum allowed the university to use $96 million for operations over three years, part of a $250 million grant the legislature made in 2022 for campus maintenance.
The state also approved a $43 million infusion into TSU’s operating budget in November 2024 to make payroll and prop up the university for the rest of the budget year.
Mumpower said last year the university should sell the Avon Williams Campus in downtown Nashville and property at John Tune Airport to make ends meet.
TSU officials disagreed with the idea and under Tucker’s direction requested approval of funds remaining from the campus grant to keep operating.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As peace talks and fighting continue in the multi-year fight since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Nebraska’s governor and congressional delegation spoke out in defense of Ukraine and Nebraska’s interests.
Most of Nebraska’s Republican leadership agreed that Ukraine should not cede land as part of peace talks. Pillen, in an interview with KETV, threw his support behind giving Ukrainians permanent refugee status, as temporary refugee statuses for Ukrainians expire. Two members of Nebraska’s federal delegation agreed or said they were open to it — U.S. Reps. Don Bacon and Mike Flood.

“I agree we should give permanent legal status to Ukrainian refugees and an eventual pathway to citizenship,” said Bacon, who represents Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. “They love freedom and will make great citizens.”
The refugee status issue would require legislation in part because Ukrainians are fleeing an external foreign enemy and not an oppressive regime running their own country.
Putin ‘will stop at nothing’
Every member of Nebraska’s congressional team blamed the war on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, said Putin thinks he is “Peter the Great” and wants to reestablish the Russian motherland while taking away people’s liberties, freedom and land.
“This guy’s a vicious killer, and he will stop at nothing,” Flood told the Nebraska Examiner. “I hope the good people of Ukraine don’t get to a spot where they consider giving up any ground to this guy.”

U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, a member of the powerful U.S. House Ways and Means Committee and chair of its Trade Subcommittee, thanked President Donald Trump for efforts to bring Putin’s “ambitions” to an end. 
Smith, who represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd Congressional District, said he appreciates the Trump administration’s efforts to address nations whose purchases from Russia, including energy, support the “illegal war.”
“Russia is the clear aggressor in this unjustified war, and it is my hope any solution ending the war ensures the Ukrainian people can resume normal life in a reconstructed nation and does not reward Russia’s actions with territory ceded by Ukraine,” Smith said.
Peace deal contours
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also applauded Trump and said that while negotiations are still underway, any agreement needs “total buy-in from Ukraine.”
“We also need to pressure Russia to come to the table, which means applying additional sanctions on Putin,” Fischer said, noting she is a cosponsor of a bill to do that and would keep advocating for its passage.
She told Fox News this month that she doesn’t believe Putin is looking for peace.
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, who served two terms as governor, said a peace deal needs to work for the people of Ukraine and, in a press call, said he would let Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy determine that. He agreed that the U.S. should continue to ramp up sanctions and “make it really painful.”
Ricketts said it’s also important to work with European allies to get them to stop importing Russian gas and ensure the U.S. is arming Ukraine to the best of its ability to resist Russian aggression.
“It’s not going to be an easy solution,” Ricketts said. “The president is working on a peace deal right now, and I’ll certainly let the Ukrainians decide if that is something that they want to pursue.”
Europe and NATO
Flood, who chairs the House Republican Main Street Caucus, a group of more than 85 congressional Republicans, agreed with Ricketts on arms. Flood said he is open-minded on what the United States can do to help and said the Baltic states see the prospect of Putin gaining ground as a “zero-sum game.”

— Rep. Don Bacon  (@RepDonBacon) December 11, 2025
 
“What’s to stop him from going to the next country?” Flood said. “Then we find ourselves in a trickier situation.”
Flood said it doesn’t make sense to put American troops on foreign soil now, but if NATO allies are attacked, the U.S. must act and do its part. He said he is in favor of Ukraine joining NATO.
Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general who served during the Cold War and has been among Nebraska’s most vocal defenders of Ukraine, has called Trump “the new Chamberlain,” referring to former United Kingdom Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who ceded Czechoslovakian land to Adolf Hitler in 1938. 
Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. Chamberlain resigned eight months later and was succeeded by Winston Churchill.
“Russia is the aggressor, and we shouldn’t reward aggression,” Bacon said.
Just this week, Bacon said he agreed with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz comparing Putin to Hitler. Bacon said in a post on X: “This is our late 1930s moment.”

Bacon last month told Axios he was “so angry” at a Trump-backed 28-point peace plan that he thought about resigning, which would matter because of how narrow the margins are in the Republican-controlled House. But Bacon said he needed to stay for his constituents. 
He has already decided not to seek reelection.
‘When the sun comes up again’
Ricketts said what can be done economically to help rebuild Ukraine can also help the United States, such as with critical minerals or knowledge of drone technology, in a “win-win” situation.
Flood said he sees an “outsized role” for the University of Nebraska and agricultural research once the war ends and said he thinks the Ukrainian people should welcome Americans with “open arms,” given the amount of support the U.S. has provided.
Said Flood: “When the sun comes up again for them to rebuild a nation … we can do things for them with our resources that will make money for Americans too, and give us a bright opportunity to sell our products.”

The cost of solar and wind power has dropped so much that it is now cheaper than electricity from gas and coal, and solar and wind power is far more reliable. In fact, during recent winter storms, when many gas and coal plants failed, solar and wind kept working.
With new advances in energy storage, we can now produce solar and wind power when it’s cheap and abundant and use it when we need it. Solar farms often take less than a year to build while gas power plants take up to seven years to start providing electricity.
Even worse, while wind and solar are a short and long-term solution to our power generation needs, building new gas plants and pipelines would lock us into this expensive and volatile energy source for 50 years or more, even as solar and wind continue to get less expensive.
This year, the North Carolina Justice Center officially took a stance against Transco’s proposed Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) set to come through the Triad because of “the likelihood of safety violations and incidents, based on Transco’s poor track record of compliance with Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations.”
For decades, taxpayers have been forced to subsidize the astronomical profits of Big Oil and Gas companies like Transco through subsidies, handouts, and sweetheart deals. Americans are then forced to bear the brunt of high energy prices, dirty water and air, public health risks, and the fallout from climate-driven disasters. Big Oil and Gas companies hid the truth about the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis for decades, while raking in unimaginable profits on the backs of consumers.
The gas for the proposed SSEP is set to fuel massive data centers in the Southeast, according to a new report from IEEFA. But growing electricity demand does not have to mean growing emissions, and transparency is critical, because data center projects and utility contracts are often proprietary, leading to the potential over-building of power plants and pipelines, causing stranded assets for utility customers to pay off over decades.
We know living near fossil fuel infrastructure, like pipelines, refineries and methane gas export facilities, causes a vast array of health problems. From asthma and cancer to premature death, oil and gas extraction and use is bad for quality of life. Not to mention that the SSEP would go near churches, schools, and dozens of houses and environmental justice communities.
On top of the direct health impacts, public health suffers as we deal with climate disasters caused by emissions from fossil fuel development. Injuries, death, and stressed health infrastructure contribute to poor health outcomes. Everyone suffers harm from this pollution, but vulnerable populations, like children and elderly people, pregnant women, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities are most at risk.
The gas industry continues to try and push a false narrative that its products are part of a clean energy solution instead of the risky and polluting reality that is fracked methane gas. The Trump administration has promised to push through fossil fuel projects without environmental reviews or considerations for how they will impact communities or prices.
The vast majority of people support increased access to clean, affordable energy instead of propping up polluting industries. We have a wide array of tools in our tool belt to not only fight, but win.
That is why five localities in the last six months in North Carolina have passed resolutions of concern or against SSEP. This is a no brainer to us. It’s time our leaders listened and acted by denying permits, so this dirty, dangerous pipeline won’t be constructed.

The friend’s Guatemalan tenant, who didn’t know she was pregnant, had just delivered a premature baby in the New Orleans house. The parents lacked legal residency, and the mother refused to go to a hospital for fear of being detained by federal immigration officers.
“There’s blood everywhere, and the baby’s dead,” Rosales-Fajardo recalled her friend saying.
Rosales-Fajardo put on her sandals, grabbed surgical gloves, and rushed to the house.

Rosales-Fajardo, herself an immigrant from Brazil, is a grassroots organizer and advocate in the New Orleans East community, where many immigrants live. She has no formal medical training, but she has experience with delivering babies.
She scanned the room when she arrived. A 3-year-old child stood to one side while the mother sat on the edge of the bed. The father held their swaddled newborn son, who wasn’t breathing and was wrapped in blood-soaked towels.
“The baby was completely gray,” Rosales-Fajardo later said.
Rosales-Fajardo wiped fluid away from his small mouth and rubbed his back before performing tiny chest compressions and breathing air into his lungs.
She told the parents she had to call 911 to get the mother and newborn to a hospital for care. The baby was out, but the delivery wasn’t over.
“I assured her. I promised her that she was going to be safe,” Rosales-Fajardo said.
Fear hung over the room. Still, she made the call and continued performing CPR. Finally, the newborn revived and squirmed in Rosales-Fajardo’s arms. When the ambulance arrived, the mother tried to keep her husband from riding with her, terrified they would both be arrested. He went, anyway.
“These are hard-working people,” Rosales-Fajardo said. “All they do is work to provide for their family. But they were almost at risk of losing their child rather than call 911.”

Putting safety over health
Nearly two weeks into the Department of Homeland Security’s Operation Catahoula Crunch, which launched Dec. 3, health professionals and community advocates in Louisiana and Mississippi report that a significantly higher-than-usual number of immigrant patients have skipped health care appointments and experienced heightened stress levels.
According to a press release, DHS said it had arrested more than 250 people as of Dec. 11. Though federal officials say they’re targeting criminals, The Associated Press reported that most of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the New Orleans operation had no criminal record.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, immigrant families nationwide have become more likely to skip or delay health care, due in part to concerns about their legal status, according to a recent survey by KFF and The New York Times.
The survey found that nearly 8 in 10 immigrants likely to be living in the U.S. without legal permission say they’ve experienced negative health impacts this year, from increased anxiety to sleeping problems to worsened health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. The federal immigration raids in California, Illinois, North Carolina, and now Louisiana and Mississippi add to the health care barriers that these families already face, including access to services, language barriers, lack of insurance, and high costs.
That hesitancy to receive even emergency care appears justified amid the ongoing raids. Hospitals and health facilities generally must allow federal agents in areas where the public is allowed, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In California this year, federal agents have staked out hospital lobbies, shown up at community clinics, and guarded detainees in hospital rooms. Even driving to and from appointments poses a risk, as traffic stops are a popular place for immigration agents to make arrests.
University Medical Center nurse Terry Mogilles said that immigrants typically make up at least half the patients in her orthopedic trauma clinic in New Orleans, many of them with construction-related, bone-crushing injuries that require surgery. But now, Mogilles said, many of those patients aren’t coming in for follow-up appointments, despite the risk of infection.
“When we call, we can’t get through,” Mogilles said. “It is so upsetting because we have no idea what’s happening to them post-op.”

A chill spreads in the South
Federal officials said the Catahoula Crunch operation extends to southern Mississippi, though the bulk of the initial arrests have occurred in the Greater New Orleans area. Immigrant families throughout Mississippi are hunkering down in anticipation.
Michael Oropeza, the executive director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities in Biloxi and Forest, said the organization has witnessed families delay care, cancel children’s checkups, and go without refilling medication.
“It’s not because they don’t value their health; it’s because they don’t feel safe,” Oropeza said. “When hospitals and clinics are no longer that safe place, people withdraw trust that took years to build up. It can disappear overnight.”
Maria, a Biloxi resident from Honduras, said, in Spanish, she and her two children have missed routine doctors’ appointments because they are “terrified” to leave the house amid an increased presence of federal immigration officers. Her husband, who is authorized to work in the U.S., was detained for two months this year.
Her children are U.S. citizens. They previously qualified for Medicaid, but Maria opted to disenroll them three years ago out of concern that using public benefits would jeopardize her family’s residency applications, she said. The family now pays for their children’s care out-of-pocket.
When it feels safe to attend doctors’ appointments again, Maria said, her priority will be seeking mental health care to address the stress her family has endured.
“I definitely need to see a doctor to get checked out, because I don’t feel well,” she said, describing her anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
In Louisiana, Marcela Hernandez of Familias Unidas en Acción, a nonprofit that provides direct aid to immigrants, said many of the families she works with live paycheck to paycheck. Sheltering at home and missing work only adds to the stress. Hernandez said she received 800 calls for food in two days from families afraid to leave home.
The federal operation in Louisiana and Mississippi could last more than two months, according to the AP. The longer it goes on, Hernandez said, the more she worries evictions will come next as people can’t pay rent, further traumatizing a community whose members often had to make difficult and dangerous journeys to flee hardships in their countries of origin to reach the U.S.
“You don’t leave your country knowing that you’re gonna get raped on the way just simply because you wanna come and meet Mickey Mouse,” she said.

Rosales-Fajardo, who runs a nonprofit called El Pueblo NOLA, said families tell her how children have started urinating on themselves due to stress and fear. Nationally, immigrants who are likely to lack legal status report that some of their children have had problems sleeping and that they’ve seen changes in school performance or behavior, according to the KFF and New York Times survey.
Community groups said they hope people step up locally to deliver food and hygiene products to immigrant homes, and that health care professionals provide more at-home or telehealth visits.
Like at other hospitals, UMC’s waiting rooms are considered public spaces, Mogilles noted. But the nurses union is calling for the hospital to create safe spaces for patients that federal agents can’t access and clearer policies to protect health care workers who shield patients. Post-op appointments can’t be done virtually, so patients need to feel safe enough to come in, Mogilles said.
Prenatal and postnatal care is also challenging to provide virtually, leaving the health of new and expecting mothers vulnerable, said Latona Giwa, the executive director of Repro TLC, a national sexual and reproductive health training nonprofit.
Since the Chicago immigration sweeps began in September, Giwa said, the clinics and health providers her organization works with have reported that 30% of patients had missed appointments. She said pharmacies saw a 40% drop in medication pickups.
“What we know about management of chronic conditions, especially in pregnancy, but in general, is that even missing one appointment can impact the trajectory of that condition and worsen a patient’s outcomes,” Giwa said.
In Louisiana, which already has poor maternal health outcomes, the fear of arrest could exacerbate the crisis worsened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and threaten lives. She’s especially concerned about families with preterm babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.
“Imagine your child is in the hospital, and so vulnerable, and you are terrified to go visit and care for your newborn infant because you’re worried about being deported,” Giwa said, noting that a newborn’s health partly relies on parental visits.
That’s the position the Guatemalan family in New Orleans is navigating.
On a recent day in December, Rosales-Fajardo acted as the family’s translator and advocate on their first visit to see their son in the NICU at a hospital on Lake Pontchartrain’s Northshore. Hospital staffers told the parents they would need to make the long and risky trip to the hospital repeatedly for at least a month to provide skin-to-skin contact and breast milk.
Rosales-Fajardo drove the parents, who were afraid to travel alone out of fear of being pulled over and arrested on a bridge. She said she’ll keep driving them as long as she needs to.
“Whenever they see a Hispanic driving or anything like that, that’s suspicious to them,” she said of federal agents.
But the baby is safe and healthy. And the parents have named Rosales-Fajardo his godmother.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)It has been my honor and privilege to practice general pediatrics in Idaho for 25 years. I have worked with families from Boise and Eagle to Nampa and Caldwell. But I feel compelled to speak out today because the world has shifted underneath my colleagues and me, and not in a good way. Until this year, I can honestly say:

Never have I ever thought I would worry about taking care of a child with measles, a disease that I have studied but have never seen before now, thanks to the MMR vaccine. However, because of misinformation spread by people who have not spent their lives taking care of kids, we have seen over 1,500 cases nationally this year, with more than one in 10 children needing to be hospitalized. And it’s not just measles. Because of decreased immunization rates, more children have suffered and died from measles, influenza, and pertussis in the United States in the last year than during the past several decades combined.
Never have I ever seen a mother, paralyzed by doubt over the barrage of conflicting, politicized information, cry over whether or not to vaccinate her newborn … not until last month.  
Never have I ever thought that something that was proven wrong years ago would be brought up again as “fact” by people in authority. We know the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Any supposed link has been robustly and repeatedly disproven by large-scale, independent, published studies conducted over many years. 
Never have I ever imagined that individuals who misspell the names of the vaccine-preventable diseases, diseases that I have spent my professional life studying and treating, would hold sway over public health decisions.

The American people should be able to trust the government to use science, experience, and expertise when it comes to our nation’s health. But today we have a secretary of Health and Human Services with no medical background who is pushing his own agenda. While I strongly believe that everyone is entitled to an opinion, I submit that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. should not be the person dictating health policy for all Americans.
As CDC vaccine officials resign in protest, childhood vaccination rates are declining

Vaccines save lives. They have done so for over a century. Do they carry potential adverse side effects and preservatives? Yes, they do; nobody has said otherwise. All medicines, such as intravenous antibiotics and chemotherapy agents, carry risks and also use preservatives. Should we have a federally-appointed attorney make life-and-death decisions about those as well? We, providers, go through years of medical training so we can spend our days helping families weigh the benefits and risks of all types of decisions, including vaccines. I do not need unfounded accusations in the room between my patient and me while I am practicing medicine.
So, who will protect the children in this year of falsehoods and half-truths? It is not our government, or perhaps not even the 67,000+ pediatricians across the U.S.
 I believe it will be the parents. Because despite everything that has happened in the last several years, seventy-five percent of American parents across all political affiliations support vaccines and school entry requirements. If parents use their parental freedom to ignore the divisive noise and once again trust evidence and their medical providers, we can protect the progress we’ve made against vaccine-preventable diseases.
Next month, during Idaho’s legislative session, there will be a bill introduced to ban all immunization requirements. This bill is extremely dangerous and unnecessary, as it is already very easy in our great state for families to opt out of vaccines if they choose. All this bill will do is send our record-low vaccination rates even lower, which will, in turn, cause more illness and death. 
We need to step back from the constant barrage of information and demand medical facts over political fiction. Our children are counting on us.

Harold Love, Jr.  speaks on the Tennessee House floor during debate over vacating the Tennessee State University board of trustees in 2024. (Photo:  John Partipilo / Tennessee Lookout)This story was produced by the Tennessee Lookout and WPLN News, with support from the Pulitzer Center and the Education Writers Association. 
In the late 2010s, state Rep. Harold Love, D-Nashville, provided the Tennessee Legislature with proof that the state failed to properly fund Tennessee State University for years. He convinced lawmakers to tally how much the state owed its only historically Black public university. 
But nearly 50 years earlier, his father was working on a tally of his own. 
Love is a TSU alum with a family heavily connected to the university. His father, Harold Love, Sr., served as a state representative whose district included TSU, and his mother taught mathematics there. 
“I would spend time at my mother’s office at Tennessee State,” he said. “I would spend time at my father’s office at the Capitol. And my father, I think, wanted to set the groundwork for me to know what he was doing.”
Even at home, during dinner, “there were conversations oftentimes about Tennessee State’s funding and the work he was doing and trying to get money for the school,” Love said.
Those conversations stayed with him when he followed in his father’s footsteps and became a state representative in 2012. His father died in 1996, but Love found ways to keep his memory alive.
While moving into his father’s old office at the state capitol, he was going back and forth to his parents’ house to bring some of Love Sr.’s memorabilia with him. He came across a 1970 report in his father’s papers called “The Special Needs of Negro Universities.” 
He didn’t think much of it until years later.
No state matching funds for TSU
As a new lawmaker, Love began meeting with his constituents to learn about their most pressing concerns. He said he was surprised when a TSU agriculture dean asked him to get the state to match their land grant agricultural funds.
TSU and the University of Tennessee Knoxville are the state’s two land grant universities. In the late 1800s, Congress donated land or money to states so they could build colleges. These schools get federal funding for programs like agriculture and science, and the states are required to match those funds.
Love vaguely remembered his parents discussing this funding for TSU when he was a child. The university provided him with a report stating that between the years 2000 and 2007, the school didn’t receive any state funding to match its land grant programs. There was no information available before 2000.
The Debt: Almost 60 years ago, a court case at TSU transformed Tennessee higher education

Love visited the legislative library to review archival budget records dating back to fiscal year 1957. He was expecting to find more proof that the state underfunded TSU. Still, he was shocked to find that, for many years, the state hadn’t budgeted any land grant matching funds for the school.
“That was my natural belief that it was something, but then I’m like, hold on, this a zero,” he said. “Not even a zero. It’s not even a line there.”
The state did, however, provide those funds for the University of Tennessee. Love found that sometimes Tennessee gave the school more than the one-to-one match that the federal government required.
“Why would the state of Tennessee not fund a university that’s educating kids?  I can’t think of a rational reason why,” Love said. “And so my mind has to go to, ‘Well, you must have not thought that the kids at this school were as valuable as the other school.’”
Still, he had trouble getting his colleagues on board. Love was a freshman legislator who didn’t yet wield much political power.
“The disconnect was, I’m saying that TSU has been underfunded,” he said. “But to throw that broadly out there — ‘Well, what do you mean underfunded? You didn’t get what you asked for last year?’ ‘No, no. For the last 30 years.’”
‘Read the report’
Frustrated, he started looking again through his father’s old papers. It was then that he said he heard a voice: Read the report.
Love is a man of faith and the pastor of Lee Chapel A.M.E. Church in North Nashville. He said the voice was not audible, but rather internal.  
So he picked up his father’s old report about the needs of Black universities.
“And when I read it, I said, ‘Wow, this is exactly what I needed,’” he said.
The legislative report stated that in 1970, TSU had only received $51,599 of the $4.5 million in federal land grant funds given to Tennessee. This provided Love with proof that concerns about land grant underfunding at TSU were brought to the legislature nearly 50 years earlier.  
“I could then make the case that Tennessee State University had not been getting its funding,” he said. “There was research done in the 1970s that spoke to this, and here we still are at this present age.”
During debates about the 2016 FOCUS Act, which changed the governance structure for Tennessee State University, Love held up his father’s report on the floor of the Tennessee House and began reading from it. He explained to lawmakers that the state’s chronic failure to match those federal funds had forced TSU to pull money from its operational funds to cover the difference.  










Why would the state of Tennessee not fund a university that’s educating kids?  I can’t think of a rational reason why. And so my mind has to go to, ‘Well, you must have not thought that the kids at this school were as valuable as the other school.


– Rep. Harold Love, Jr.


The effect was immediate.
“As I start reading the report, the chair of education comes over and says, ‘We got it. We understand, and we’re gonna fix it,’” he said.
The state then started fully matching the federal funds for TSU going forward. Love credits his father’s research for this victory. 
Still, Love knew this wasn’t enough to make up for the backpay.
Political momentum for funding
Then came the summer of 2020.
The police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked racial justice movements across the country. Many people in positions of power, including in Tennessee, were making attempts to address these injustices.
Love recalls Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, calling Black lawmakers into his office and asking if there were “instances you can point to where we’re not treating African Americans right in Tennessee,” Love said. “So my hand goes up. I said, ‘Tennessee State’s matching funds.’”
According to Love, Sexton agreed to set up a legislative committee to look into the underfunding. “‘I really want to know, how much is it?’” Love recalls Sexton saying. “‘Because I don’t want you to keep thinking that we’re just eating around the edge.’”
Sexton did not respond to requests for comment on this meeting.
Long before fights over DEI, a judge told Tennessee State University to lose its Black identity

Finally, Love was able to do thorough research on the state’s budget records back to the 1950s. He and his colleagues came up with a number: Tennessee had shortchanged TSU by as much as $544 million, without accounting for inflation.
Love knew he had to act quickly. At that moment, he said, he had the right legislative mix — with the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the House, and other committee chairs all on board to address the state’s underfunding TSU. The political momentum was there.
In 2022, at Gov. Bill Lee’s request, the legislature approved $250 million for TSU for infrastructure improvements — a major victory, although Love was still eyeing additional funding.
But then, in February 2023, the state comptroller released a scathing audit of TSU operations and its finances. It found that the school disregarded financial management guidelines, including students not receiving the scholarships they were promised and freshmen having to live in hotels because the school didn’t have enough housing.
At the state capitol, Love immediately started trying to do damage control. 
“When the report came out, my first thought was … I don’t need another competing story coming up and saying, ‘Yes, there’s underfunding, but also there’s this,’” Love said. “I tell folks all the time, I say, listen, two things can be true. You could have underfunding and you can have some fiscal policy that were not followed.”
But TSU’s alleged fiscal mismanagement became the focus at the state Capitol for multiple years. There were legislative hearings. The president of TSU resigned. Then the governor pushed to replace the entire board of trustees at TSU.
And then, another bombshell dropped: The Biden administration put out a report with their own calculation of how much southern states have underfunded their historically Black land grant universities over the last 30 years, based on a completely different calculation.
The state of Tennessee, it said, owed TSU more than $2 billion, more than any other southern state. 
Love was stuck in the middle — on one side, trying to convince lawmakers that TSU still deserved its remaining backpay, and on the other side, trying to talk down TSU alumni who wanted him to demand even more money from the state. 
“The challenge is, how long can we keep making the case for underfunding?” he said. “We should always be able to make the case, but you’re also dealing with human beings and people.”
Today, TSU has a new president who seems to have a good relationship with the state. The Trump administration has not followed up on the Biden administration’s report. 
And Love said he is still trying to recover another couple hundred million dollars for the school — although it’s unclear if the political momentum is still there to make it happen.
This is Part 3 of The Debt. Read the rest here.

Compared to their urban and suburban counterparts, a greater share of the rural population lives in states with the most restrictive abortion legislation, according to my analysis of data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that focuses on reproductive rights. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June of 2022, it became harder for women to access reproductive care, but the burden often disproportionately hurt rural women.
About 46% of nonmetropolitan, or rural, Americans live in states with either ‘most restrictive’ or ‘very restrictive’ abortion legislation, representing 21.3 million people. Approximately 35% of metro Americans live in these states, representing roughly 99.1 million people.
State-level abortion legislation is complex; it’s rarely as simple as an outright ban or permit. Abortion policies can include stipulations like waiting periods, ultrasound requirements, gestational duration bans, insurance coverage bans, telehealth bans, and more. To deal with some of this complexity, the Guttmacher dataset groups states into one of seven categories that broadly captures the state’s access to abortion:

Most restrictive
Very restrictive
Restrictive
Some restrictions/protections
Protective
Very protective
Most protective


Click here for the interactive map.
Seventeen states make up the ‘Most restrictive’ category, and 13 of those states have enacted full bans with few exceptions. Those states include Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Dakota, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. The rural population in those states equals about 15.8 million people.
 Rurality exacerbates access challenges

In the post-Roe landscape, pre-existing rural challenges are exacerbated by restrictive abortion legislation, a change that has led to increased maternal mortality, particularly for women of color. The new state of abortion in America means people often have to travel much further to get the care they need, often out of state.
An ABC special that featured women who had to travel for abortions highlighted the story of Idaho resident Jennifer Adkins, who was excited when she found out she was pregnant with her first baby. But a 12-week ultrasound showed that continuing her pregnancy would put her life in danger. With financial help from family and friends, Adkins had to travel to the nearest clinic in Oregon to receive the care she needed.
My previous analysis of abortion data showed that rural travel to abortion clinics increased from 103 miles on average in 2021 to 159 miles on average after Roe v. Wade was overturned. But travel distance varies by state, with women in parts of rural South Texas having to travel up to almost 800 miles to receive care.
In rural Louisiana, where all the bordering states have also issued abortion bans, the distance to a clinic has increased by almost 400 miles since Roe was overturned. The average rural Louisianan is about 492 miles away from the nearest abortion clinic. The data for that analysis came from the Myers Abortion Facility Database.
In 2024, approximately 12,000 Texans traveled to New Mexico to receive an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute data. Nearly 7,000 Texans traveled to Kansas, and another 4,000 traveled to Colorado. Texas enacted a near total ban on abortions in July of 2022.
In Idaho, which enacted an abortion ban in August of 2022, 440 people travel to Washington and 140 travel to Oregon for abortions in 2024. (Visit the Guttmacher’s interactive map of abortion travel by state to explore the topic in more detail.)
 Abortion and rural voters: More complex than you might think

Every time I write something about how rural people suffer from GOP policies, I get comments and emails from readers saying some version of, “They voted for this.” I take issue with this response for many reasons. It’s unkind, and it erases the thousands of rural voters who don’t support these policies. While some people are going to say you get what you deserve, here’s another way to look at it.
In a previous analysis of voting data from the nine states that had abortion on a ballot measure in 2024, I found that support for Trump didn’t always line up with support for abortion restriction. In 2024, approximately 73% of rural voters supported Trump, but only 61% voted to restrict abortion access.
While 61% is still a majority vote, the 12-point gap between support for Trump and support for abortion restriction demonstrates that abortion access is a complicated issue for many Americans across the geographic spectrum. This data shows a rural voting base that is willing to split with the broader Republican platform on key issues.
“All voters are complex,” said Nicholas Jacobs, rural sociologist. “People voted for [Trump], even if they wanted more access to reproductive care or were disappointed that a national standard was lifted by the courts.”

Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach is heading into the 2026 election cycle with one of the most precarious political balancing acts in the country, as her strong support for the Department of Government Efficiency collides with new doubts about the program — and the realities of representing a district heavily reliant on federal jobs.
The challenge sharpened last week when Elon Musk, the billionaire tech executive who helped architect DOGE, told GOP podcaster Katie Miller that the initiative had been only “somewhat successful” and said bluntly that he would not do it again. 
In the interview, Musk acknowledged the political and practical blowback from DOGE, which was launched early in President Donald Trump’s second term with the stated goal of slashing government spending and reshaping the federal workforce.
For Kiggans, who represents Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, Musk’s comments land at a sensitive moment. 
The district — centered in Virginia Beach and home to thousands of federal employees, military personnel and veterans — is widely considered one of the most competitive House seats nationwide, and among the most vulnerable held by Republicans in Virginia.
Inside Elections, a nonpartisan political race rater, has placed Kiggans’ seat among roughly a dozen “toss-up” races across the country for 2026, making it the only such district in Virginia. 
The designation underscores why Democrats view Kiggans as a prime target and why her record, particularly on DOGE, is likely to draw heightened scrutiny as the campaign approaches.
The Virginia Mercury reached out to Kiggans to request an interview for this story, but a spokeswoman said the congresswoman was not available. The Mercury also sent Kiggans a list of detailed questions about her support for DOGE and the program’s impact on her district, but she did not respond.
 From early praise to public defense, Kiggans backs DOGE cuts

DOGE, which became a signature initiative of Trump’s second-term agenda, aimed to dramatically reduce federal spending through layoffs, canceled contracts and terminated grants. 
Kiggans embraced the program from the outset. 
In December 2024, as DOGE was just getting off the ground, she publicly praised her participation in an early gathering with Musk and DOGE co-leader Vivek Ramaswamy, describing it as a “productive first meeting” with House Republicans to discuss the new Department of Government Efficiency.
As DOGE’s cuts began to ripple through the federal workforce, Kiggans continued to defend the effort. 
In February, amid mass firings that disproportionately affected Virginia — home to one of the largest concentrations of federal employees in the nation — Kiggans described the cuts as “so necessary” as displaced workers struggled to find new employment.
Later in the year, during continued fallout from DOGE-related layoffs, Kiggans drew further criticism after telling laid-off federal workers on the John Fredericks Show that there were other jobs available and that they needed to “go out and get them.” 
The remarks echoed comments made by other Virginia Republicans during the same period — including Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, then the presumptive GOP gubernatorial nominee, who was recorded downplaying the impact of federal layoffs on Virginia’s workforce. 
Comments like these fueled Democratic claims that GOP leaders were out of touch with the economic realities facing federal workers and veterans.
 DOGE funding losses land in veteran-heavy district

Beyond rhetoric, DOGE’s impact on Virginia’s 2nd District has been tangible. 
The effort resulted in the termination of more than $8.3 million in grants and leases tied to the district, including funding streams connected to veterans services and facilities, according to nonpartisan policy think tank Center for American Progress. Several of the canceled grants directly affected programs serving military families and veterans — a core constituency in the Hampton Roads region.
Those cuts stand in sharp contrast to the political direction Virginia voters took in 2025, when Democrats won decisive victories statewide. 
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger centered her campaign on affordability and economic stability, repeatedly criticizing DOGE cuts and warning that they were undermining Virginia’s economy. Her message resonated with voters in a state where federal employment plays an outsized role, and Democrats now argue that Kiggans’ alignment with DOGE leaves her exposed.
Veteran Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth said Kiggans’ situation reflects both structural and political headwinds that are unlikely to ease before 2026.
“If these districts stay as they are — and I can’t imagine hers getting any better in redistricting — then it will only get worse,” Holsworth said. Even without changes to the district lines, he added, Kiggans “certainly could be very vulnerable.”
 Tight races underscore swing nature of 2nd District

But Holsworth also noted that Kiggans has historically been a strong candidate, having won competitive races in both the General Assembly and Congress, and described her as “a pretty good campaigner.” 
Kiggans’ rise to Congress came through a series of close elections that underscored the swing nature of Virginia’s 2nd District well before DOGE entered the picture. 
A former Navy helicopter pilot and nurse practitioner, Kiggans first won the seat in 2022, narrowly defeating Democratic incumbent Elaine Luria in one of the most closely watched House races in the country. 
Kiggans captured about 51.6% of the vote to Luria’s 48.2%, flipping the district after two terms of Democratic control amid a national midterm environment that favored Republicans.
Two years later, the margin remained tight. 
In 2024, Kiggans won reelection with just over 51% of the vote, fending off Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal in a race that once again highlighted the district’s evenly divided electorate and its sensitivity to national political currents. 
The back-to-back close contests reinforced the district’s reputation as one of the most competitive House seats in the country.
That competitiveness has already attracted a growing field of Democratic challengers for 2026, even before redistricting questions are resolved. Several Democrats have announced campaigns for the seat — including Luria, who is seeking a rematch.
And Holsworth said that this time around, broader forces are working against Republicans holding swing seats in Virginia.
“First and foremost is the fact that you have the president who’s underwater by double digits in Virginia,” he said, pointing to Trump’s poor standing in the state. 
“You saw how that played out in the November election with people losing seats that were unimaginable two years ago. The results in 2025 really pose a tremendous challenge for the person holding the most competitive Republican seat in Virginia right now.”
DOGE, Holsworth added, compounds the problem.
“The support for DOGE is a significant problem because of the way DOGE was handled by Musk and Trump,” he said. “The image of Musk taking a chainsaw to the federal workforce I think was just seared in people’s minds.”
Holsworth said there is a political difference between a measured effort to improve government efficiency and the abrupt mass layoffs associated with DOGE. 
“It’s one thing if you had a commission to look for efficiency in government,” he said, “but a different thing is when people are losing their jobs, because the person in charge of it was wielding a chainsaw to do so.”
 Democratic attacks, redistricting fears tighten squeeze

Democrats have seized on that imagery. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Eli Cousin said Kiggans’ record ties her directly to the fallout.
“Congresswoman Jen Kiggans was a day-one supporter of DOGE and fully enabled the chaos and destruction that it brought on Virginia’s economy,” Cousin said. He pointed specifically to her comments telling laid-off workers to find new jobs and her praise for DOGE even as veterans’ services were affected.
Kiggans has sought to soften some vulnerabilities by emphasizing her work on health care, including support for efforts aimed at extending Affordable Care Act premium subsidies. 
Holsworth said those moves suggest an awareness of the political risks she faces, particularly on kitchen-table issues that cut across party lines.
“She clearly is trying to work on the health care front, by at least supporting some measures to perhaps extend the Obamacare subsidies and to try to minimize her vulnerability there,” Holsworth said.
Still, the broader picture remains daunting. 
Virginia Democrats are openly pushing redistricting changes ahead of the 2026 elections, and if successful, those plans could make Kiggans’ path even steeper by reshaping the already competitive 2nd District to favor Democrats.
“This is a very vulnerable seat,” Holsworth said. “Kiggans has to be very seriously worried about it. This is the most vulnerable time, the most vulnerable moment that she’s running in.”

(Photo courtesy of Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail)A plan to purchase a historic Shenandoah Valley rail line that includes developing a trail moved forward on Tuesday, after the state’s authority on passenger rail agreed to a potential budget amendment to fund the project. 
The move has drawn mixed reactions from the public and lawmakers representing the area, who have questioned the cost and feasibility of a rail-with-trail versus a trail-only project.
The decision comes as leaders from multiple localities, businesses, and nonprofits in the surrounding area are anxious to learn what will become of the dilapidated 50-mile Shenandoah rail corridor, which has been inactive for 36 years. Some want to boost the region’s economy and promote healthy lifestyles by turning it into a multi-use trail, while others see similar possibilities by restoring the Manassas Gap rail line and building a parallel trail.
Va. considers nearly $700 million rail and trail plan in Shenandoah Valley

 Project funded but questions remain

On Tuesday, the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority’s Board of Directors voted to authorize Executive Director DJ Stadtler to revise the authority’s budget to accept the $30 million in funding from the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB). The plan would involve the authority administering $35 million, which was set aside by the General Assembly, as a grant to the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation. 
The foundation would serve as the buyer of the rail line from Norfolk Southern. The remaining funds will be used for trail construction, meeting the criteria set by state lawmakers for the funds.
Under the agreement, the foundation commits to building the trail within established deadlines, and the authority will preserve the corridor for potential future passenger rail use. The foundation would maintain the right-of-way and be liable for any risk.
One member abstained from Tuesday’s vote, concerned about how quickly the plan —  proposed publicly by the Virginia Department of Transportation less than two weeks ago — is moving forward. Another member questioned if the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation will live up to its commitment to build the trail as part of the agreement.
“The foundation has committed to building the trail,”  Stadtler responded. “Additionally, part of why (Virginia Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller) decided to bring us in is there would be provisions in the agreement that if, for some reason, the foundation failed to build a trail or didn’t fulfill their commitments, we would have the right to then bring the right of way back to us and into our ownerships.”
Stadtler said that if the foundation were to default on the agreement, the authority would then take back the right-of-way at a “nominal” cost.
Board member Charles Payne, who voted in support of the budget amendment, said “I like the concept of basically reserving the ability to extend rail in the future, which gives us lots of flexibility and a minimum, the benefit to the community is the trail will be built.” 

Board Member Sandy Bushue abstained from the vote, but did not specifically state why afterwards. Earlier in the 20-minute discussion on the amendment, Bushue said that when she learned Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, and other elected officials were “blindsided” by the proposal, she became concerned as well. 
“I’m a little bothered by that,” Bushue said. “I know that’s a CTB issue, not the VPRA, but I just think we need more information about what this is really about.” 
She also pointed out the project’s price, which is “pretty costly,” and said she was confused about “how it went from a trail to a rail, and the CTB taking it out.”
Projections indicate that converting the corridor into a recreational trail would cost $164 million, compared to the $687 million to restore the rail line and add an adjacent trail, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation. 
The rail corridor, first established in the 1850s, runs from Front Royal to the town of Broadway in Rockingham County.
 Passenger rail? Not so fast

Stadtler tempered any immediate expectations of passenger rail in the Shenandoah area, but did not rule out the possibility in the future. He said this is one of the key reasons why the authority was considered to manage the project. 
Last year, the authority purchased the 24-mile Manassas Line from Norfolk Southern Corporation to be used by the commuter rail service, Virginia Railway Express, between Alexandria and Manassas as a larger part of the transit service’s operations. The parties agreed to a deal costing approximately $155 million.
“I want to be very clear that ‘future’ is not 2032, the ‘future’ is probably not 2042,” Stadtler said. “No time soon, but … as you know, we purchased the Manassas line that goes out to Broad Run. There have been people clamoring for continued service west of (Virginia Railway Express) out to Gainesville, out to Front Royal.” 
If that were to come to fruition, he said  “this could be an opportunity for passenger rail then to be extended through New Market, down to Broadway, down a little bit further, to Harrisonburg, which would be a hugely underserved market.”
“Let me say it again,” Stadtler added, “this isn’t in the next 10 years, probably not in the next 20 years, but moving forward, this transaction would allow the commonwealth to preserve the opportunity for rail in that area.”
The authority received support for a rail-with-trail concept from several businesses and leaders, including the Shenandoah County Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors, Valley Railroad Company, Virginia Rail Policy Institute, Larae Caverns, Holtzman Propane and Oil and Shenandoah County Farm Bureau.
Staff summarized that supporters believe the plan would include constructing a trail, restoring freight rail service, and promoting tourism.
However, 54% of the public comments received about the project were in opposition to the rail-with-trail plan.
Staff said some commenters questioned the decision-making process and the selection of a more expensive rail-with-trail option over the option to develop a trail, including state Dels. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, and Delores Oates, R-Warren, the Alliance for Shenandoah Valley, the town of Timberville, and several mayors.
Staff said public comments were not made at the meeting itself due to the authority’s virtual meeting policy. 
The Commonwealth Transportation Board will meet in January to transfer the funds to VPRA. 
Tiffany Robinson, director of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation, said if the CTB agrees to transfer the project, then public meetings will begin along with the development of a term sheet and agreement.
“So for that reason, I believe there’s going to be a lot of transparency going forward in the process,” she said.
The board’s next workshop and action meeting is scheduled for Jan. 6, 2026.

The plan has ruffled feathers among researchers and Chesapeake Bay area conservationists. 
DWR’s public information officer, Shelby Crouch, stated in an email that the proposal was developed in response to concerns that “Virginia specific data to support previous guidance was incomplete and that more research is needed to support that earlier guidance and the resulting costs.” 
A Virginia Office of Regulatory Management review form for the guidance change also cited lower costs to current and potential water intake operators as a benefit, stating that “the updated parameters are consistent with requirements of the federal Environmental Protection Agency and a relaxation of prior DWR guidance to permitting agencies and applicants.”
The agency is now accepting public comments on the proposal, which Crouch said are also “more in line with the standards of many nearby states.” 
Dec. 17 is the last day to submit public comments on the proposal before the agency decides whether or not to adopt the changes. 
Charles Gowan, professor of environmental studies at Randolph-Macon College, was the lead author of the 1999 report that is now under scrutiny. 
Gowan said nothing has changed to warrant the new proposal over the 25-plus years that DWR has utilized the report in its guidance for surface water intakes. 
In a written public comment submitted to DWR, Gowan stated the proposal relaxes existing standards “to the point that almost no protection will be afforded to fish encountering water withdrawal facilities in Virginia.” 
But Crouch said that “While these newly drafted standards may not be as stringent as previous guidance, they are generally accepted as appropriately protective and minimize economic burden on those who rely upon surface water to generate energy, operate commercial industry, and provide water to their citizens.”
Daniel Royster, a North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) resource specialist, commented on DWR’s guidance proposal stating that the decision will have impacts that stretch beyond Virginia’s waterways: “These species do not respect political boundaries.” 
Despite DWR’s claim that the change is being proposed to align more closely with nearby states, Royster argued on behalf of DMF in favor of keeping the existing protections due to a lack of evidence demonstrating “… mortality risk does not increase when comparing the current and proposed guidelines.”
 Filtering out wildlife

DWR’s new guidance proposal recommends doubling the size of the screen openings that filter out organisms before they get pulled into surface water intakes. It also recommends doubling the approach velocity, or the speed at which intakes can suck in water and organisms.

Surface water intakes can be especially harmful to fish eggs and larvae, which are “essentially neutrally buoyant particles, kind of bouncing along with the flow,” Gowan said in an interview this week.
The eggs and larvae can be killed by water intakes in two ways. They can get sucked into the underwater intake pipe, a term called entrainment, or they can become physically trapped against the filter of the intake, called impingement. 
The size of the screen openings that filter out organisms before entering an intake and the velocity of the water being sucked past it are the two key protective measures that are used to protect vulnerable species. 
Researchers believe protections at water intakes are critically important in the Chesapeake Bay watershed because it is used as a nursery ground, or spawning ground, for such a wide range of aquatic animals. 
“Aquatic fauna use the water column to grow and mature, and when they’re very small, they’re very vulnerable,” said Lyle Varnell, associate director for advisory services at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS). Varnell also submitted comments to DWR on behalf of VIMS urging against the adoption of the proposed guidance and reminding the public that VIMS will continue recommending the more stringent standards.
Many of Virginia’s most threatened fish species, like river herring, American shad, Atlantic sturgeon and striped bass, have “incredibly small eggs and larvae,” and the larvae are “very weak-swimming,” said Gowan, adding that he is not aware of any new information that indicates the fish are bigger or faster than researchers thought they were in 1999. 
The eggs and larvae are often so small that even the current one millimeter screen openings that DWR is now proposing to double in size allow a large percentage of eggs and larvae of different species to still pass through it, Gowan said.

The current recommendation of a 0.25 foot per second intake velocity is also faster than most of the larvae of concern in Virginia’s tidal waters can swim. “So again the recommendations were based on the limits of technology at the time,” said Gowan. 
“We were hopeful that over the last 25 years or so that some better technology would come along and the criteria could be strengthened,” Gowan said. “That didn’t happen, so I’m really perplexed, concerned that they’re actually relaxing the criteria.”
 A growing reliance on surface water

The demand for surface water, or water that is not trapped underground, is rising in Virginia as municipalities struggle to meet growing water demands amidst drying aquifers. 
A surface water withdrawal from the Rappahannock River in Caroline County of 1.8 million gallons per year was recently approved as part of the state’s broader Coastal Plain Groundwater Initiative. The plan is to reduce permitted withdrawals of the Coastal Plain’s “over-allocated“ aquifer system, according to the water protection permit issued for the project by DEQ. 
The new Caroline County surface water withdrawal, which will be used for municipal public water supply, was approved using the current smaller guidelines for screen openings and slower maximum velocities for intake. An evaluation of aquatic life submitted as part of the permitting process for the project states: “Potential impacts of the intake on fish eggs and larvae are determined by the size of the openings in the intake screen and the velocity of the intake.” 
But the project adds to a long, largely unregulated list of withdrawal structures hidden beneath the depths of Virginia’s tidal waterways. 
Approximately 77% of surface water withdrawn in Virginia during 2017 was found to be excluded from permitting requirements because of a rule that grandfathered in withdrawals that were in place before 1989, according to a 2024 surface water supply report.
These underwater intakes, out of sight from the human eye, pump water from tidal rivers for consumptive uses like drinking water and irrigation or for temporary uses in pass-through systems for cooling and power generation, which return much of the water back into the ecosystem. 
Intakes for large pass-through systems like power plants can have the staggering ability to suck in the majority of water flowing through a river depending on the time of year, said Gowan. 
When the Surry Nuclear Power Station is operating at full power, eight pumps intake over 1.6 million gallons of water per minute from the James River and later output it approximately six miles upriver, according to a 2001 environmental report. 
A study at the smaller Chesterfield Power Station on the James River, which intakes about 12% of the total water volume in the vicinity of the station, estimated that its water intakes resulted in the annual total entrainment of approximately 1.3 billion fin fish and 86 million shell fish between 2016-2020. The majority of fin fish entrained were from the herring and shad family.  
The American shad recovery plan for the James River highlighted that there are more than 20 water intakes in the portions of the river identified as the peak spawning grounds for American shad. 
“In light of the fact that such a great proportion of these surface water intakes already are unregulated, and it’s not clear what if any protections for these fish there are in place, it is astounding to me that we’re proposing making them less protective right now,” said Tom Dunlap, the James River Association’s riverkeeper. 
Researchers are still looking into the cumulative impacts of multiple water intakes on tidal rivers that naturally sweep organisms back and forth “like a washing machine cycle,” said Gowan. 
According to Varnell, water supply will be a running issue in Virginia’s portion of Chesapeake Bay for years to come.
Gowan agreed that “water management is a huge issue” but views protecting fish at water withdrawals as a separate problem. 
“If we are going to take this water out, how can we protect aquatic resources?” Gowan asked.

(Library of Virginia)On Tuesday, the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol got its newest addition. Civil rights icon Barbara Rose Johns now represents Virginia, filling a vacancy that’s been open since 2020, when the commonwealth removed Robert E. Lee’s statue.
As secretary of natural and historic resources under Gov. Ralph Northam, I helped lead the charge for this long overdue change, working with General Assembly leaders, prominent Virginia historians and others to create the Commission for Historical Statues in the United States Capitol and supporting the commission’s incredible work.
Governor Northam rolled replacement of the Lee statue into a broader initiative to correct historic injustice, much of which would run through my office. “When we tell a fuller, more inclusive story of our past,” he said, “we can better address how that past affects our present. We have to understand where we come from to know where we are going.”
The initiative went beyond monuments and was driven by a host of dedicated organizations and individuals from across the commonwealth. We created a grant program for historic African American cemeteries that had been neglected for generations. We leaned into the history of Fort Monroe as Freedom’s Fortress, commemorating the 1619 African Landing at Point Comfort, the 1861 Contraband Decision, and restoration of the Tucker Family Cemetery in Hampton’s historic Aberdeen Gardens neighborhood. 
We funded expansions at the Freedom House Museum in Alexandria and exhibitions at Maymont in Richmond telling the stories of enslaved people and of Black service workers under Jim Crow. We restored Green Pastures in Alleghany County, a recreation area built during segregation as one of the few gathering places for Black families on federal land. And we launched the Black History Month marker contest through the Virginia Department of Historic Resources.
The marker contest brought an unexpected letter. 
Fourth-graders from Fairfax County wanted to know: why doesn’t Barbara Johns have a state historical marker? They’d just learned about her — the student strike she led, how it became part of Brown v. Board of Education. They couldn’t figure out why there were countless monuments to the Lost Cause while there was not a single marker noting Johns’ accomplishments. Those kids sent us 55 different submissions, all making the case for Johns.
We dedicated her marker in February 2021, on the grounds of Robert Russa Moton High School — now the Moton Museum and a National Historic Landmark — in Farmville. Speaking on the same stage where Johns addressed her fellow students and led the walkout that helped end racial segregation in our country was one of the most moving and humbling experiences of my life.
What really got me about those kids was how straightforward they were about fairness. 
Barbara Johns did something that mattered. She should be recognized. Simple as that. They spotted an imbalance and wanted it fixed. For a little while, Virginia was doing the same thing. Standing up. Fixing what was broken. Choosing fairness. You don’t see that kind of clarity often these days.
Tuesday, Johns took her place in the Capitol. A Black teenager who looked at injustice and said no. It’s worth remembering, and not just because it’s history. It’s a reminder of what happens when leaders stand up for what’s right and people come together driven by purpose and courage. 
We could use that reminder right about now.

Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison), who has long advocated for a bill to create a task force on to examine the issue of missing and murdered Black women and girls, read testimony on behalf of Tanesha Howard, the grieving mother of Joniah Walker. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)At a Tuesday hearing, Wisconsin Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison), who has long advocated   creating a task force on missing and murdered Black women and girls, read testimony on behalf of Tanesha Howard, the grieving mother of Joniah Walker.
Walker went missing in 2022 at the age of 15 in Milwaukee and has not been found.
“They refused to issue an Amber Alert to allow the community to help search for her. They were telling me Joniah did not fit the requirement of anything,” Stubbs said. Howard sat next to her with her eyes closed. “What are the requirements to get help from your local police department when your Black… daughter [is] missing?”
SB 404, coauthored by Stubbs (D-Madison), Rep. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston) and Sens. Jesse James (R-Thorp) and LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee), would establish a 17-member task force to examine the issue of missing and murdered Black women and girls and produce a report.
“To help prevent other families from experiencing what my family and countless other families endured … this bill for missing and murdered African–American women and girls … needs to be passed into state law,” Stubbs read on behalf of Howard. “Help us. Find us. Give our families closure. We matter.” 
This is the third legislative session in a row that Stubbs has introduced legislation to create the task force. She was inspired in part by the Department of Justice’s task force on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, which was established in 2020 by Attorney General Josh Kaul after the Legislature failed to pass a bill to create that task force. Kaul has said that the funds don’t exist to take a similar path with this task force. 
Stubbs said during the hearing in the Senate Mental Health, Substance Abuse Prevention, Children & Families committee that the bill is “necessary to improve the mechanisms for preventing, investigating and healing for all forms of gender-based violence in our state, which impacts women and kids of all racial backgrounds, but which affect Black women and girls at the highest rate.”
Members of the task force would include four lawmakers and other stakeholders, including law enforcement representatives and representatives from advocacy or legal organizations that focus on Black women and girls.
The task force would be responsible for examining a number of issues related to the violence that Black women and girls face including systemic causes, the appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data, policing related to investigating and prosecuting crimes, measures that could reduce violence and ways to support victims and their families.
Under the bill, a final report would be due by 2027. It would need to recommend policies and practices that would be effective in reducing gender violence and increasing the safety of Black women and girls and help victims and communities to heal from violence.
Stubbs highlighted a 2022 report from the Guardian that found that in 2020 five Black women and girls were killed every day in the U.S. Wisconsin had the worst homicide rate for Black women and girls in the nation that year. Stubbs said data on the extent of the issue is incomplete, and the task force could help fill in the picture. 
“We are lacking crucial data, especially in Wisconsin,” Stubbs said. “The data already gathered is insufficient and lacks critical detail to understand the circumstances of violence.”
Johnson said the bill is a “necessary step toward understanding why African-American women and girls are so vulnerable to violence and disappearance and where our public safety systems are falling short.”
Sheena Scarborough, mother of 19-year-old Sade Robinson, who was murdered last year, also testified at the hearing. Johnson noted that both mothers are from her district.
“I think that speaks volumes to how serious the issue is and how it impacts communities, not just in the city of Milwaukee but across the state, but disproportionately it affects African-American women, especially in the city of Milwaukee,” Johnson said. 
The bill would provide one position in the Department of Justice to support the task force as well as $80,200 in 2025-26 and $99,500 in 2026-27 to fund it.
Last session, the bill passed the Assembly but never received a vote on the Senate floor. It received a public hearing but not without encountering roadblocks due to opposition from former Sen. Duey Stroebel (R-Saukville). Stroebel said he didn’t support the legislation because he didn’t support passing laws based on race or gender. 
Snyder, who described himself as “the Republican who likes to do what is right” said the bill is “the right thing to do,” and expressed frustration with the bill getting hung up last session. 
“I get really irritated when one person thinks that because they don’t like it, that they can kill it. That bugs me a lot,” Snyder said. 
Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) asked the lawmakers if there are other groups, noting Hmong and Indigenous groups, that face disproportionate amounts of violence and suggested changing the bill to include them. 
“Instead of focusing on just one specific group… I would really love to see each one of these groups kind of meld together, so there’s representation so information can be shared,” Wanggaard said. 
James, who is the only member of the Legislature actively serving in law enforcement, answered Wanggaard’s question by pulling from his own experience. 
“Back at home, I mean, we have a high Hmong population. I don’t recall ever taking any cases involving any missing Hmong individuals to be honest with you. …I’ve had more white and African-American missing type cases,” James said. He said that a “caveat” to the issue is that “the data collection hasn’t always been prevalent and adequate… especially if we have agencies where they’re not even taking cases on missing persons, that data is not going to be collected.”
“My concern is that if they’re targeting young women — just young women in general, I’m not concerned what race they are — if they’re targeting these young women, is there a connection between some of the missing… say on the Menominee reservation as opposed to Milwaukee County,” Wanggaard said. “I’m just thinking about getting the most information to as many people as we can to help the process.”
Supporters of the bill addressed questions about why it was important to have a task force specifically focused on Black women and girls. 
Madison Police Chief John Patterson was asked whether he saw any value in creating one big task force.
“We shouldn’t be afraid to be surgical at times when it comes to disparities that we’ve identified in our system and, certainly, I believe this is one,” Patterson said. “In my almost three decades, I can tell you work that started off being very focused and surgical in nature to try to address a disparate impact in our community has led to greater communication, greater collaboration across all communities.”
Barbara Sella, executive director of the Wisconsin Catholic Conference, said it’s “so important to understand dynamics within communities and different communities have different dynamics.” 
“To just say, well let’s include everybody — could make the task almost impossible… It’s really important to have a laser focus,” Sella said.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)High visitation has taken a toll on the unique and fragile alpine ecosystem atop the Northeast’s highest peak, where erosion, trampling, and invasive species are challenging the ability of native plants to thrive.
That’s one finding of a preliminary summit assessment, prepared by consulting firm Tighe & Bond, that outlines the condition of the natural and built environment atop the 6,288-foot mountain. It’s one of the most in-depth studies of the immediate area that’s ever been undertaken, according to Mount Washington State Park Manager Patrick Hummel. 
The new understanding of the summit environment contained in the report, he said, will inform discussions about how to make Mount Washington’s built infrastructure more welcoming and resilient while also protecting surrounding wildlife. 
“I view this as a very important and thorough snapshot in time,” Hummel said.
Taking stock
The summit assessment originated with the 2022 Mount Washington Master Plan, which called for a third-party report assessing the facilities and environmental conditions at and around the mountain’s summit.
In November, Tighe & Bond presented a preliminary summary of the assessment before the Mount Washington Commission, which advises the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources on summit management. In addition to evaluating the impact of high foot traffic on sensitive alpine species, the presentation pointed to gaps in knowledge about possible chemical contamination legacies at the sites of former buildings on the summit, proposed safety and durability improvements for existing buildings, and suggested ways to improve visitor and staff experiences while protecting the integrity of the mountain itself.
Once the report is finalized, expected by the end of this year, “it will be up to our mountain community and summit partners to really talk about what the future of the summit looks like, and how we get there,” Hummel said.
Seeking wilderness, crowds imperil rare plants
The ecosystem found on Mount Washington’s summit, called northern Appalachian alpine tundra, is rare in the United States, existing only at high elevations in a few Northeastern states. It is home to rare and endangered plants and animals, some of which, like the White Mountain fritillary, are not found outside the White Mountains region.
But invasive species, erosion, trampling, and climate change-driven shifts in weather patterns are limiting the success of native plant communities and wildlife at the summit, according to the presentation.
Assisted by the Department of Natural and Cultural Resource’s Natural Heritage Bureau, the consultants catalogued and documented plant and animal species found at the summit. The group also used wildlife cameras and assessed the impacts of climate stress on the summit, using the findings to generate an “ecological integrity” score for different zones of the park. 
Eight zones around the summit itself received a grade of B-minus, while the area along the highest portion of the Mount Washington Auto Road scored C-plus and the summit itself, including the area immediately surrounding the buildings, received a score of C-minus.
Factors in these scores included a high prevalence of invasive plant species, according to the report. About 1 in 5 plant species the group identified within the entire state park area were non-native. Invasive plants can out-compete and encroach on native species, about half of which found on the summit are considered critically imperiled or vulnerable, according to the report. 
The report linked the presence of non-native plants to that of human visitors, describing that non-native species are often brought to the summit on “vectors” including people and their vehicles. The consultants called for use of boot brushes, which can remove seeds from visitors’ shoes, and vehicle inspections to remove hitchhiking plants. 
Visitors can also unwittingly harm native communities when they stray from marked trails, contributing to erosion and compaction of the already-limited patches of soil atop the mountain and crushing delicate alpine plants. These species are especially hardy to many types of mountaintop adversity, from the short growing season to extra ultraviolet radiation and harsh temperatures. But they also tend to grow slowly, and that makes it especially hard for them to overcome crushing and trampling, researchers have found.
This poses a challenge in an environment like Mount Washington’s summit, where rare and vulnerable plants coexist with the more than 250,000 visitors who pass through each year, according to an estimate by the Mount Washington Observatory. 
“There is, to some extent, only so much room” on the summit, said Hummel. Trails are marked, and signs warn visitors not to stray off them. Yet, he said, “people tend to just wander. Naturally, you can’t keep everyone exactly where you want them.”
The administrative rules of the New Hampshire State Parks don’t explicitly forbid going off-trail, but the rules do prohibit damaging or disturbing natural structures and wildlife, and introducing any wildlife or object — both things that can happen when hikers stray from the path, according to the report. The report recommended that the park explore new ways to keep visitors corralled, including boardwalks, overlooks, railings, and additional educational signage. 
The plants present in this landscape are also sensitive to small changes in temperature and precipitation, making them uniquely vulnerable to climate change and compounding other stressors, the report noted.

Problems with built infrastructure
The assessment also identified issues with the infrastructure at the summit, including several buildings, stormwater and traffic infrastructure, and the pathways and platforms that visitors travel to explore the site. 
These included needed maintenance at the largest building on the summit, which houses state park and Mount Washington Observatory staff, as well as visitor facilities. The building can become congested with growing crowds, according to the report. It also has some leaks and safety hazards, like uneven flooring, according to the presentation. From implementing self-checkout at the cafeteria to improving and clarifying egress routes, the report contains recommendations for improving conditions inside the building. 
The presentation also outlined deficiencies in other summit structures, like the historic “Tip-Top House,” originally constructed in 1853, and the Yankee building, which houses communications equipment and is currently in “poor condition,” according to the report. 
Fuel spills and chemical contamination also exist (or are thought to be possible, but yet unconfirmed) at different locations on the summit, according to the presentation. This includes debris from previous fires and coal dust that may be released along the Cog Railway. 
One location about which information is lacking was once home to a U.S. Air Force research facility where military research on aircraft icing once took place, according to the presentation. Some known “potential hazards” remain on the site, including foundations and debris, but a full assessment of any chemicals and potential contaminants released during the facility’s operations is still incomplete. 
The report also recommended ways to improve accessibility and decrease crowds and congestion on the summit.
As a whole, these recommendations and realizations validated much of what the Mount Washington State Park staff has observed anecdotally atop the mountain, where some employees spend multiple days at a time year-round, Hummel said.
“There’s a lot of people who depend on the summit, beyond the people who come to visit,” he said. “… It’s recognizing the people who live there and work there all the time, and how better we can really do our job up there.”
Preserving a unique experience
Mount Washington’s extreme environment and high traffic exacerbate many of the challenges outlined in the assessment, Hummel acknowledged. But those realities are also what make the mountain so special, and Hummel wouldn’t have it any other way.
On a nice day, thousands of people may pass through the state park. For most of them, Hummel noted, the experience is highly anticipated and will become a lasting memory. 
“People are wowed by the weather, wowed by the views,” he said. “… They’re able to come up and be wowed by the mountain and share that experience directly with state park staff, who are there because we love the place — and we get to share that excitement with one another.”
Though high volumes of visitors require attentive management, they also reflect the way that Mount Washington’s infrastructure makes the wonder of New Hampshire’s White Mountains accessible. The park draws visitors from far and wide: Hummel said visitors from 93 countries outside the U.S. and Canada had signed the park’s voluntary visitor log in 2025. 
To Hummel, this is a sign that the state park is succeeding with one of its central goals.
“We are charged with … providing the access and the recreational opportunities and educational components and all of those things that link our lands to our visitors and our communities,” he said. 
But overseeing such high visitation while also protecting a beloved landscape is a challenge, and the assessment shows that the summit ecosystem has borne some of that burden. Preserving the integrity of the peak while welcoming more visitors into the future, Hummel said, will take adaptation.
“The summit, obviously, is ever-evolving. It’s always changing,” he said. 
This won’t necessarily involve expanding the footprint of development on the summit, said Hummel, who noted that the report identified opportunities for more space efficiency. 
“In fact, there’s been some discussions about, you know, what do we do at the summit that allows us to abandon some developed areas and give it back to the mountain. Are there opportunities to do that?” he said.
But more development is also a possibility and has been floated in recent years, such as a proposal for a mountaintop train-car hotel that previously riled some members of the Mount Washington community. (Reached by email in September, Cog Railway Marketing Director Rob Arey said the project was “somewhat delayed,” but that the Cog still intended to move ahead.)
Of all the possibilities for the evolving summit’s future, the details will be determined by the Mount Washington Commission, the Division of Natural and Cultural Resources, the Coös County Planning Board, and entities like the Cog and Mount Washington Observatory that share space on the mountain’s peak.
Hummel said he believed those involved would strike a balance between conservation, education, and visitation, newly armed by the findings of the summit assessment. Conversations about future directions for summit infrastructure and ecology will begin in the new year, at public meetings of the Mount Washington Commission, he said.
“It gets to be, you know, difficult to do both,” he said. “I think we’re able to do it. We’re able to do it well, and we want to make sure we continue to do it.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/William_Skipworth_mtwashington_1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-17 05:56:35.981794

(Photo courtesy of the Alabama Department of Corrections)When Yraida Faneite was on trial for drug-related charges, the judge had to halt proceedings at one point because her period was so heavy that blood was running down her legs.
The same struggle followed her into a federal prison in Florida after she was convicted. For about a decade, officials allowed her only a small ration of menstrual products, and she couldn’t afford extra pads from the commissary. She bartered with other women. On her worst days, she tore up her own T-shirts and used them as makeshift pads.
When she told officers she needed to see a doctor and couldn’t safely continue a mandatory kitchen shift, she said, she was placed in solitary confinement. She eventually found out that her heavy bleeding was caused by cysts.
“I didn’t have enough napkins to use during my period. … No matter what you say, they don’t care,” recalled Faneite, who was released from prison in 2006 and went on to found the prison reentry nonprofit YG Institute.
Her experience echoes what researchers, advocates and formerly incarcerated people describe across prisons and jails nationwide: Even where menstrual products are available, limited supplies, low-quality products, strict disciplinary rules and delays in medical care can result in incarcerated people facing potentially avoidable health issues or disciplinary write-ups.
Access to menstrual products also has been a persistent issue in immigration detention centers, with recent reports and lawsuits alleging that women in some facilities have been unable to obtain or outright denied feminine hygiene products despite federal standards and law requiring sufficient and timely access.
New report urges more individualized justice system responses for women

A new report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a research and advocacy organization, says that menstruation is still regularly treated as a disciplinary matter — through contraband rules, work violations and sanitation write-ups — even in prisons and jails that provide free products.
These disciplinary actions can affect everything from parole eligibility to access to programming and services.
Women make up a growing share of the state prison population, which rose about 5% nationwide from 2022 to 2023, according to the latest data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.
In recent years, more states have begun taking steps to improve access to menstrual products in jails and prisons, and to address the overall conditions that shape incarcerated women’s experiences.
The Ohio legislature last month passed legislation to strengthen access to period products for incarcerated people in jails and prisons. The bill is awaiting the governor’s signature. And Wisconsin lawmakers introduced a bill on the issue this month.
At least 24 states and Washington, D.C., require that people in state prisons or local jails have free access to menstrual products, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Federal correctional facilities have provided free products since 2017.
More than a dozen states have passed versions of the Dignity of Incarcerated Women Act, which includes provisions to improve basic conditions, such as access to and the quality of period products and pregnancy care.
Still, in most of the country, access depends on a patchwork of laws and corrections department policies. Nearly every state has a rule on the books about providing menstrual products, but the specifics, implementation and enforcement vary widely. Advocates say that leaves many incarcerated people without the consistent access they need.
Lawmakers Tackle ‘Period Poverty’ With Tax Cuts, School Supplies

“In the system that we have where there’s very little oversight, accountability, transparency, you have no easy way of enforcement,” said Miriam Vishniac, the founder and director of the Prison Flow Project, a database tracking access to menstrual products in U.S. jails and prisons.
In Alabama, the state Department of Corrections says it provides menstrual products — pads and tampons — free of charge. People can choose a monthly allotment of 30 pads, 30 tampons or a mix of both. Housing unit staff keep small supplemental supplies on hand and can issue additional products as needed, according to Rand Champion, the agency’s chief of communications.
In Colorado, corrections officials said staff are prohibited from using access to menstrual products as a behavior-management tool, and facilities are required to keep products stocked and available regardless of an individual’s financial status.
Maryland’s policy requires correctional facilities to provide menstrual products at no cost during admission or transfer, on a monthly basis and upon request. The state says it offers tampons, winged pads, and both light- and heavy-flow pads. The products must be provided in quantities appropriate to each person’s health needs. Corrections officials told Stateline there have been no recent challenges with implementation.
In the months after a Maryland law requiring correctional facilities to provide free menstrual products and maintain a sufficient supply took effect in 2018, advocates said women at the Correctional Institution for Women were still paying for tampons and relying on flimsy pads handed out each month. State officials acknowledged the policy was not being implemented consistently systemwide.
Rules and restrictions
The new report from the Prison Policy Initiative outlines several ways that prison and jail rules can indirectly penalize people who menstruate.
Data privacy after Dobbs: Is period tracking safe?

Some facilities classify having more pads or tampons than the allowed number as contraband, which can lead to confiscation or formal disciplinary actions. Rules on property and hygiene mean that leaking through uniforms or bedding may be treated as a violation.
Asking for additional menstrual products can sometimes be interpreted as abusing medical rules or “feigning illness.” And trading or sharing products with other incarcerated people may also be prohibited under unauthorized exchange rules, the report said.
“It’s just another reminder that they have no autonomy over themselves, over their bodies, over their lives,” said Alycia Welch, the associate director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin.
Access is further complicated by shower schedules and clothing allocations, which can make it difficult to change products regularly. Items available for purchase at the commissary — including pads, tampons and pain relief — are often costly.
Transgender men, nonbinary people and older women who menstruate or experience irregular cycles may face additional scrutiny or confusion from staff when requesting menstrual products, creating further barriers, according to prison policy experts.
Disciplinary actions can include fines, loss of commissary privileges, restrictions on phone or visitation access or placement in segregation units.










It's just another reminder that they have no autonomy over themselves, over their bodies, over their lives.


– Alycia Welch, associate director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab


Many advocates and formerly incarcerated people say that even in facilities that provide free menstrual products, the supplies are often of poor quality, with thin pads and low-absorbency tampons.
“We can’t just stop at creating these rules that mandate that people have access to these products,” Vishniac, of the Prison Flow Project, said. “There needs to be some kind of way of ensuring that it’s actually happening.”
Strengthening access in Ohio
The bill Ohio lawmakers unanimously passed would require that all incarcerated women in state or local correctional facilities have free access to feminine hygiene products. It also would mandate that facilities allow incarcerated women to shower once per day while menstruating.
The bill also would require safe, designated disposal containers for used menstrual products and prohibit denial of products based on race, sex, income, charge, disability or other protected traits and identities.
In 2022, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction adopted a new policy requiring state prisons (but not jails) to provide free menstrual products; advocates, however, say there’s no mechanism to hold staff or facilities accountable.
While the bill does not lay out an explicit oversight mechanism, its language would give incarcerated women a clear legal standard they can reference if access is denied, said Kayelin Tiggs, an advocate who helped author the bill’s language. Tiggs created the Ohio Coalition for Menstrual Equity.
“The fact that we were able to pass it here with that anti-discrimination language is a good sign,” Tiggs said. “I feel like we could take this nationally.”

(Stock photo by Justin Sullivan | Getty Images.)Every election, in almost every Ohio county, absentee ballots show up at county boards a few days after Election Day. And in many counties, some of those otherwise valid ballots don’t wind up counting for reasons outside the voter’s control. In the 2024 presidential election, at least 1,059 of those ballots got thrown out.
Thousands more late-arriving ballots did get counted. But they wouldn’t under a bill awaiting Gov. Mike DeWine’s signature.
Under that proposal, Ohio Senate Bill 293, every one of the at least 7,793 ballots that arrived after Election Day in 2024 would have been rejected.
The measure’s supporters downplay the changes. Two-thirds of other states have a similar deadline. Late-arriving ballots make up a tiny fraction of the overall electorate. Voters will adapt to the changes.
There’s some merit to each one of those arguments, but critics contend they offer an incomplete picture.
Many states with Election Day deadlines go to great lengths to make voting more convenient. Unlike Ohio, for instance, many of them allow counties to set up multiple drop boxes.
While it’s true that a couple thousand votes don’t often swing a race, supporters’ efforts to minimize the disenfranchisement of those voters rings hollow. When it comes to other voting restrictions the same lawmakers insist a single fraudulent or damaged ballot is unacceptable.
“Just one ballot destroyed could make the difference in an election,” state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, said in April as he presented a different bill that would prohibit drop boxes and required proof of citizenship to register.
“Imagine if trash was thrown into a drop box in a county that came down to a single vote,” he said.
Ohio Republican senators propose eliminating drop boxes, requiring proof of citizenship for voting

Brenner’s co-sponsor, state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, regularly asks witnesses, “how many cases of voter fraud are okay?”
In an October hearing for the same measure, she referenced recent tie vote in a Wood County primary.
“And there were eight other cases that either were even or within one vote where a case of a noncitizen voting could have made the difference in those elections,” she pressed a witness. “Are you okay with that?”
Should DeWine sign S.B. 293 into law, voters may respond by sending their ballots in sooner.
In 2024, Ohio’s grace period went from 10 days to four, and fewer ballots arrived late. But voter advocates note that was the result of a lot of work and outreach.
Secretary of State Frank LaRose has committed to do “everything we can to inform voters of the change,” but lawmakers aren’t appropriating any money to help county boards to publicize the changes.
“We’re looking at a major election next year that will have high turnout and unprecedented cuts in federal funding for boards of elections,” League of Women Voters Executive Director Jen Miller said.
“If this General Assembly was really serious about election security and integrity, they would be funding boards of elections for every policy they pass,” she continued. “And once again, they didn’t do that.”
How we parsed the data
After each election, the Secretary of State compiles a report on absentee ballots.
The Ohio Capital Journal requested the information used in that report from all 88 counties.
Additionally, many counties use an absentee ballot reporting tool, which details voter-by-voter the date a ballot was requested, returned, and whether it was counted.
Between those two sources, the Ohio Capital Journal was able to collect data from 87 of 88 counties. Hancock County is the only one not represented in this research.
There are two kinds of absentee ballots — domestic civilian ballots and those for uniformed and overseas citizens. Ohio Senate Bill 293 retains a four-day grace period for military and overseas voters, so those ballots were not included.
The initial scope of the request included the last five federal elections, but the further back you go, the shaggier the data get.
The 88 county boards operate independently, and there’s significant variability in how they document ballots in the absentee reporting tool.
Was that ballot marked “uncountable,” for instance, because it was late or because the voter didn’t fill it out properly?
Similarly, the reports prepared for the Secretary in 2016 and 2018 lump all “late” ballots into the same category — whether they were postmarked on time, late, or not at all.
The report in 2020 distinguishes them but doesn’t include the number of late-arriving ballots that ended up counting.
In 2022, those reports changed again and began including more information about post-Election Day ballots.
Starting in 2024, the absentee ballot reporting tool includes a new column with specific categories for a ballot’s treatment which are used consistently across counties.
This analysis has focused on these two most recent federal elections because those data are more granular than those in previous elections.
When a voter sends in an absentee ballot, there’s a lot that can go wrong.
They might not fill out the envelope properly or not include the envelope at all. They might not sign their ballot, or their signature might not match. None of those deficiencies are included in this research.
There are also multiple ways a ballot can arrive late, all of which revolve around the postmark.
The central questions for this story are how many ballots arrived late, and how many got turned away at no fault of the voter?
So, ballots postmarked on time but arriving after the grace period are included, as are those that were never postmarked by the post office at all.
Ballots postmarked on Election Day or after wouldn’t be counted regardless of Ohio’s grace period and so weren’t included in this research. But it’s worth pausing for a moment to consider them.
Starting in 2024, the U.S. Postal Service began a Regional Transportation Optimization initiative.
In short, to cut costs and improve efficiency, at post offices more than 50 miles from a regional processing facility, outgoing mail no longer gets collected in the afternoon. Instead, it gets picked up the next morning when incoming mail arrives.
Unless a sender takes their ballot to the post office counter and asks for a postmark, that typically happens at the processing facility.
Earlier this year, the postal service even filed a rule in the Federal Register noting a postmark “does not inherently or necessarily align” with the date the post office received a piece of mail.
It’s not clear how many (or if any) Ohio ballots postmarked on Election Day or after got their postmark late because they were waiting at a local post office.
But if you were to include them, the number of late-arriving ballots in the 2024 election jumps to at least 9,461.
The share that didn’t get counted more than doubles — rising to at least 2,727.
What we found
In the 2024 election, roughly 7,800 ballots arrived at county boards after Election Day.
A little more than 1,000 of those did not count because they arrived too late. Only two counties, Fayette and Pike, received no ballots after Election Day.
Twenty-eight counties didn’t wind up rejecting otherwise eligible ballots because they lacked a postmark or were too late.
Those figures are based on data produced by county boards of elections and, in many cases, submitted to the Secretary of State.
However, Ohio Capital Journal’s count is a bit higher than the one Sec. LaRose shared with state lawmakers.
In a November hearing, he said the exact number of domestic absentee ballots arriving after Election Day was 7,579.
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to LaRose’s office about how he arrived at that figure but got no response.
Although some races do get decided by a handful of votes, it’s rare for a thousand ballots spread across the state to swing a contest.
Still, there’s nothing to indicate those voters did anything wrong when they submitted their ballot: They either got their ballot in by the deadline laid out in state law or the postal service didn’t postmark their ballot.
During that November hearing, LaRose defended imposing an Election Day deadline.
Ohio lawmakers clear absentee ballot, citizenship restrictions for House floor vote

“Human behavior is not static, it’s dynamic,” he said. “When people know that they have to have their ballot in by Election Day, they are going to respond to that.”
In 2022, mail ballots arriving up to ten days after Election Day still got counted.
In that election, 10,208 ballots arrived after election day, and of those, 1,279 were too late to be counted.
In the 2024 election, Ohio’s grace period shrunk to four days, and the number of late-arriving ballots declined as well.
That shift from 2022 to 2024 lends some credence to LaRose’s argument. But at the same time, Jen Miller from Ohio’s League of Women Voters noted presidential campaigns have a bigger door-to-door effort.
“People get their information about elections and how to participate in them by whether candidates are knocking on their doors,” she said.
Also, her organization and others spent 2024 campaigning for an anti-gerrymandering ballot issue, emphasizing the importance of getting ballots in early.
What to make of it
The potential changes didn’t really move voters contacted for this story.
Joe Holtom voted absentee in Athens County in 2016, and his ballot arrived after Election Day.
“If it’s legal and you’re registered and you do all the proper things your vote should count,” he said.
But he added, “Obviously you’ve got to look at the numbers and see if those absentee ballots would even matter.”
“I don’t think that in anything that I voted for my vote would’ve really changed anything,” Holtom said. “So, I don’t really have any strong opinions on it not counting.”
Michael Lemley voted absentee in Delaware County in 2022, and he chalked up his ballot’s late arrival to postal delays.
He wouldn’t have been happy if his vote didn’t count, but said he would’ve accepted it if an Election Day deadline had been in place.
“I would’ve been disappointed, especially because it was circumstances outside of my control,” he said. “However, I understand the need for making sure the ballots are and the voting is kept as clean as possible.”
But Bob McCollister, a member of the Lawrence County Board of Elections takes a dim view of the proposal.
While LaRose and other backers point to the small share of impacted voters as a reason to go forward with a tighter deadline, McCollister reaches the opposite conclusion.
“It’s not a huge amount of votes,” McCollister acknowledged, “So why are we trying to solve a problem that’s not a problem?”
McCollister sees it as a “death by a thousand cuts” strategy of voter suppression, and links it with partisan gerrymandering and the so-called voter purges where Ohio regularly removes inactive voters from the rolls.

The impetus for an Election Day deadline, LaRose acknowledged in October, was pressure from the Trump administration.
In a March executive order, the president simply asserted any ballot arriving after Election Day is invalid.
The U.S. Department of Justice contacted officials in Ohio warning it might sue the state if lawmakers didn’t change the law.
“These are legitimate votes that people cast. Why make it harder? What are we trying to do?” McCollister asked.
“Because a ballot is cast before Election Day and arrives a little late through the vagaries of the post office? Why should that not be counted? I don’t understand the reasoning.”
In committee hearings, Miller, from the League of Women Voters, criticized the idea of rejecting valid ballots because the mail didn’t arrive as quickly politicians want.
She noted in some regions, ballots and other mail leave the state for processing before returning to their destination.
The Ohio Capital Journal asked the U.S. Postal Service to quantify the amount mail goes out of state for processing.
In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman explained Ohio has processing centers in Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland, and that most Ohio mail is processed in Cincinnati.
“In Ohio and other states across the country, mail may cross state lines for processing,” she wrote. “The Postal Service’s network is nationwide and determinations of where mail is processed are made based on efficiency and service.”
She added the postal services is “committed to the secure, timely delivery” of election mail, but did not elaborate on how much election mail crosses state lines.
If S.B. 293 gets signed into law, it will mark the third successive federal election in which the absentee ballot grace period has been shortened.
Miller contends those constant changes create confusion.
“Confusion about election logistics is the number one enemy of turnout,” she said.
“In general, we want every eligible Ohioan to vote,” Miller continued.
“Especially those folks who are on the margins that maybe they don’t participate every election, or they’re a person with a disability or a senior citizen. And every time the rules change, we make it harder for those folks to participate in the process and have their voices heard.”
What’s next
The bill was delivered to DeWine last Wednesday.
Under state law, he has 10 days, not including Sundays, to either sign it into law or veto the measure. If he does nothing it will take effect without his signature.
After he signed a sweeping photo voter ID measure into law in early 2023, the governor said he considered the election integrity issue settled.
“I do not expect to see any further statutory changes to Ohio voting procedures while I am governor,” he added.
Asked about how he’s weighing the new proposal in light of that past statement, DeWine said simply, “I’m weighing it.”

(Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)When she was a small child growing up in her native Dominican Republic, Joseline Peña-Melnyk would frequently return home from school at midday to find a house packed with relatives, but not a morsel of food.
The Peña family’s home was “tiny,” she recalls, a one-bedroom wooden structure with holes in the roof and a latrine in the yard. She frequently lived with as many as 17 aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents. They were too embarrassed to ask the proprietor of the local bodega for food on credit.
Young Joseline had no such qualms.
“I would go to the bodega,” the just-elected speaker of the House of Delegates said in a recent interview. “And I would tell the lady, ‘Muneca, my grandmother said if you can let us fiao’ — it’s a slang term, meaning to buy on credit — ‘can you give us 2 pounds of rice, a pound of beans, and some tomato paste and some cilantro and some salt? My mom, when she sends money, will pay you.’”
The shopkeeper said yes. “And then I would come home and we would eat!”
The story, which Peña-Melnyk tells now with relish, reflects the confidence that has fueled her improbable rise in politics, from election to the College Park City Council at age 37 to her unanimous choice Tuesday as House speaker.
“From early on, I was just fearless,” she told Maryland Matters. “Not ashamed. Not ashamed at all that someone would see me go [to the bodega] after other families had already eaten. So I would do that.”
The future legislator also watched her mother, the oldest of 14 children, labor to provide for her children, siblings and parents. Being around folks who worked hard but struggled to meet even their most basic needs instilled in her a strong sense of compassion.
Peña-Melnyk one step closer to House speaker’s rostrum, history

“I learned to have empathy and to care about the things that really matter,” she said.
Peña-Melnyk first came to New York at age 7 with her mother and sister, before returning to the Dominican Republic at age 11 with her sister, while her mother stayed behind, working jobs in the garment district and sending money home. When she was 14, she returned to the U.S. for good.
Money was always tight. In the DR, her family used corn husks and newspaper for toilet paper. Uncles would pawn small appliances for cash. In New York, they relied on food stamps and other public assistance to supplement her mother’s wages. “We were very, very, very poor, and went through a lot of struggles — but we had a lot of love,” she recalled.
Peña-Melnyk began to learn English in school and from watching “Sesame Street” and “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” When her mother needed help navigating the welfare system, her oldest daughter would help translate, soon translating for other Spanish-speaking mothers.
“[My mother] would volunteer me to translate for everybody that was waiting” in the welfare office, Peña-Melnyk said. “I had no business knowing people’s grown-up business. But what I did learn was that I did not want to be treated like these women — it was mostly women, women of color — were treated. [Clerks] would ask them questions that were really offensive.”
Peña-Melnyk’s mother began to refer to her daughter as “’abogadita,’ which means the little lawyer. I wouldn’t stay quiet…. At that age I knew that I wanted to do something with my life.”
In high school, Peña-Melnyk told her guidance counselor she wanted to go to college, despite having no idea what that meant. She attended Buffalo State College (a school she chose site unseen) and the State University of New York at Buffalo Law School. After a stint as a public defender in Philadelphia, she became a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington, D.C.
Law school was “transformational,” said Peña-Melnyk. Working with accused persons who struggled with disadvantaged upbringings became a particular passion. “I was like, ‘Wow, look at this law here. I can apply it. I can try to fight for fairness and justice. And I used the law to back me up — and my mouth. And my grit. [I learned] to leave it all out there.”

Elected to the House in 2006, she landed on the Health and Government Operations Committee, where she became steeped in issues ranging from abortion to long-term care, same-sex marriage to insurance to the pharmaceuticals industry. She grew close to Del. Shane Pendergrass (D-Howard), the long-serving committee chair whom she succeeded when Pendergrass retired in 2023.
In an interview last week, Pendergrass lavished praise on her former colleague, whom she considers a sister.
“She is the kindest, most generous, smartest and hardest-working person I have ever dealt with,” Pendergrass said. “She was my equal partner when I chaired HGO. I invited her into everything because I needed her help.
“It’s a very big job to be a chair of a committee,” Pendergrass said. “Nothing compared to being the speaker of the House, but still a big job. And I wanted her to be as educated about every issue that she could be so that she could help me make decisions. And she did.”
Peña-Melnyk was always “over-prepared” when it was her turn to defend a committee bill on the floor, Pendergrass recalled. She expects her to approach her role as speaker in the same manner.
The new speaker isn’t afraid to engage in the rough and tumble of politics. She ran against a slate of Democratic incumbents in District 21 in 2006. After publicly criticizing former Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D) for not having any Hispanics in her Cabinet, Peña-Melnyk endorsed her rival, David Trone, in the 2024 U.S. Senate primary.
Pendergrass said that when a state senator was killing House bills in large number out of apparent pique, Peña-Melnyk pressed for killing his bills in retribution. Pendergrass resisted at first, but then relented. The unnamed senator got the message, she said.
“She gets politics much more than I did,” Pendergrass said last week.
When Peña-Melnyk became chair of HGO, some Republicans on the panel considered a transfer to a new committee, perhaps concerned that the new boss  would be too liberal or not as fair. Pendergrass said that one member — Del. Nik Kipke (R-Anne Arundel) — later stopped her in the hallway.
“We’re really glad we stayed,” Kipke told her. “We really like her. She’s [even] better than you are.”










She’s a liberal, I’m a conservative, but I do believe she is a good person who cares deeply about people — and she has a tremendous work ethic. She’s a workaholic. She’s just trying to get good things done for people.”


– Del. Nik Kipke (R-Anne Arundel), on working with Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel)


Kipke said he and Peña-Melnyk both arrived in Annapolis in 2007, and have served on the same committee the entire time. He estimates they’ve spent thousands of hours together.
“She’s a liberal, I’m a conservative, but I do believe she is a good person who cares deeply about people — and she has a tremendous work ethic. She’s a workaholic,” Kipke said. “She’s just trying to get good things done for people.”
He and Pendergrass both said they could recall numerous times when they overheard Peña-Melnyk on the phone, trying to arrange help for a constituent in need, often someone who didn’t live in her legislative district. “Not all politicians spend their time on those types of issues,” Kipke said.
Kipke said Peña-Melnyk has been particularly helpful expanding access to health care in Republican parts of Maryland.
“We’ve all talked about her being in this role, and the thing I’ve heard over and over again is you feel really welcome to disagree, to share your opinion,” he said. “She’s been very respectful to the Republicans on our committee.”
Pendergrass expects the new speaker to remember “people who have the least and need the most help…. She helps people. That’s who she is.”
Peña-Melnyk said she spent a lot of time in the lead-up to Tuesday’s vote reflecting on the many mentors she’s had over her 59 years — her mother and other relatives, that high school guidance counselor and numerous Annapolis figures, including Pendergrass, former Speaker Adrienne Jones and former lawmakers Shirley Nathan-Pulliam (the first African-Caribbean woman elected to the General Assembly), Peter Hammen, Delores Kelley and Gwendolyn Britt among them.
As one of the first Afro-Latina legislators in the nation to become a presiding officer, at a time when the federal government is targeting immigrants, Peña-Melnyk could become a go-to for national journalists. But she said her focus will remain on Maryland — and conducting herself as she always has, by doing her homework, listening with compassion and searching for consensus.
“I am famous for sitting everyone around a table, and just going around and listening. And I don’t speak,” she said. “After I have listened to everyone attentively, the answer comes to me.
“And I think that I am ready to do a good job — and to learn.”

Suzanne Prentiss, a Lebanon Democrat (left) and Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican, at a meeting of the Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee on Dec. 16, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A draft version of a Republican oversight report on education freedom accounts concludes the program is “popular and successful” and pushes back at Democratic arguments that it detracts from public schools. 
“There is no evidence that increased participation in the EFA program has reduced state support for local school districts across New Hampshire,” the report states, addressing the program that allows New Hampshire families to use state funds to pay for private and home schooling expenses. 
“Earlier this year, EdChoice determined that ‘New Hampshire’s success in implementing the expansive Education Freedom Account program is a model for states across the nation,’” the report states elsewhere.
The draft report, written by Republican Sen. Ruth Ward of Stoddard, dismisses some of Democrats’ attempts to pare back the program.
“After five years of growth and success, it is obvious that opponents of school choice will never accept the value of giving New Hampshire parents discretion to use state education funds in the manner they believe would best benefit their children,” the report reads. 
But the report does call for the Department of Education to propose a process to aggregate EFA student assessment data in order to better measure the program’s academic outcomes. 
And it says the Legislature should clarify whether the state is allowed to contract with “more than one organization to administer EFA funds.” Currently one nonprofit organization, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, administers all EFA accounts using the state adequacy funds. 
Return to meeting
The process to create the Republican report — and the reaction to it by Democrats — showcased deep partisan divisions over the voucher-like program. 
Ward released the report during a meeting of the Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee Tuesday morning, its first in more than a year. The committee, which met regularly in 2024 to discuss EFA program data and hear from officials, stopped meeting in November of that year. 
Democrats have criticized the lack of meetings, arguing it undermined oversight of the EFA program at a time when the program nearly doubled its enrollment this year after lawmakers removed income eligibility limits. Ward has said she tried scheduling meetings in 2025 but struggled to get enough members of the House to attend to achieve a quorum. 
Due to the absence of meetings, Ward’s draft majority report was assembled without Democratic input. And Democrats produced a minority report Tuesday that was written without Republican input. 
According to official numbers released by the Department of Education in November, the EFA program had 10,510 students at the start of the 2025-26 school year, up from 5,321 last year. That increase comes after the Legislature passed a law this year lifting the previous income limits and imposing a 10,000-student cap, with some exceptions. 
Clashing reports
In their minority EFA oversight report, Democrats on the committee castigated the lack of meetings. “No oversight has been conducted in any capacity,” they wrote. 
Democrats criticized the Children’s Scholarship Fund for removing records from its website that detailed the amount of money each vendor received in EFA funds. Kate Baker Demers, executive director of the Children’s Scholarship Fund, says that was done to prevent harassment of the vendors by critics of the programs; she has since vowed to return the records by the end of December with some redactions for small programs. 
“The legislature should be taking steps for greater accountability for this program which serves less than 5% of New Hampshire’s students,” Democrats wrote. 
The Democrats also argued the EFA program has strayed from its original stated goal to help students struggling in public schools to have the means to leave those schools. This school year, 3.3% of EFA recipients were in public schools the year before, Democrats noted.
“The number of EFA/voucher recipients continues to grow yet the number of students switching out of public schools to alternative programs does not. This is a clear indication that the program is not meeting its purported intended goals and instead has created a taxpayer-funded subsidy for financially thriving parents.”
But the Republican report did highlight a rare potential area for common ground: assessment data. Currently, EFA recipients are required to provide the Children’s Scholarship Fund with either report cards; a review of the student’s academic portfolio by a working New Hampshire teacher; results from the New Hampshire statewide assessment; or the results from another standardized test such as the SAT. But that information is shared only with the student’s parents and is not available to the public. 
Speaking to the committee Tuesday, Senate Deputy Chief of Staff Grant Bosse, who helped write the report, said any release of an aggregation of assessment data would have to overcome privacy concerns. That might mean excluding schools with small numbers of EFA recipients whose EFA students might be identifiable. 
“Sen. Ward has had conversations with (Department of Education) Commissioner (Caitlin) Davis and we think it could be possible to aggregate the data (in a way) that does not impede on privacy of individual students, and we think that would be very helpful to know as a group how these students are doing,” Bosse said. 
The reports are not final; Ward said the committee would meet again in the coming weeks to make final alterations.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC165200-Ruth-Ward-EFA-Oversight-Committee-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-12-17 05:56:35.981794

(Ohio Capital journal file photo.)Members of the Columbus Metropolitan Library submitted union cards to the Ohio State Employment Relations Board on Friday, officially initiating their intent to hold a union election.
Workers with the library system announced the move as CML United, adding that the number workers with union cards represents a “supermajority” of workers at Columbus Metropolitan Library.
Members of the union told the Capital Journal in November that they were in the process of asking fellow employees to join in the effort, and had been doing so for nearly a year.
Workers have cited a need for improvements to paid time off policies, wages, and health care packages as reasons to unionize. Some also said the evolution of library staff roles within the system has been understated, as workers attempt to help customers get to safety net programs like housing and food assistance, and also face threats and violence at times.
“In order to keep helping our communities to the best of our abilities, we need to protect and support our library workers by securing safe levels of staffing and worker input on library policies,” Zydeco Lamaze, an employee at the system’s Dublin branch, said in a statement announcing the union election campaign.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe new union would include more than 600 workers, according to organizers with the Ohio Federation of Teachers, the union under which CML United will be held.
“CML workers are joining a regional movement of library workers who are uniting not just for rights and respect in the workplace, but also to protect the libraries they love from political interference,” said the federation’s president, Melissa Cropper, in a statement.
The federation has five other library systems in their organization, including those in Worthington, Grandview Heights, Pickerington, Upper Arlington, Delaware County and Athens County.
Earlier this year, the Akron-Summit County Public Library workers unionized with the Service Employees International Union, demanding the ability to negotiate for improved benefits.
The Columbus union members are now awaiting the State Employment Relations Board’s approval of the proposed bargaining unit. If approved, the union will schedule a mail-in secret ballot election. Organizers said they have asked that leadership with the library system “remain neutral throughout this process and not take any steps that would delay or block a union election.”
A spokesperson for the library system confirmed to the Capital Journal that the system was notified on Friday of the move to file with the employment relations board, and said the library’s board of trustees “will review the petition.”
“We respect the rights of our employees who are for or against unionization and will comply with the law,” the library said in a statement.
The statement further added that the system “is proud to offer competitive wages” and a “comprehensive benefits package and paid time off,” all of which “serve as a benchmark for libraries in our region and throughout Ohio.”
The next meeting of the State Employment Relations Board is scheduled for Jan. 8, 2026.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The majority of Ohio Republican leaders have rallied around businessman Vivek Ramaswamy as the next governor, but Attorney General Dave Yost said it’s the wrong choice.
“You have had a pretty big year, haven’t you?” I said to Yost as we got seated in his Rhodes Tower office right outside the Ohio Statehouse.
“It has been a busy year,” he responded.
Yost had his future planned out — launch his bid for governor, finish his term as the top cop, and then run the state.
“Did you ever think the race would look like how it does now?” I asked.
“No,” he said. “Life and the future are unpredictable.”
It was long expected that after Gov. Mike DeWine finished his term, Yost would run against former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted.
“That didn’t work out, did it?” Yost said.
Instead, DeWine appointed Husted to the U.S. Senate after J.D. Vance got tapped for vice president.



Yost has been loyal to the party for decades, serving in both statewide and local roles. But in May, the Ohio Republican Party endorsed Ramaswamy, the political newcomer. Within days, the AG suspended his campaign.
In a one-on-one interview, he spoke about the loss.
“Do you feel that the GOP made the wrong decision?” I asked Yost.
“Yes,” he responded.
He had spoken with members at length before the endorsement meeting, but they disagreed with him.
“How do you move on from that?” I asked.
“I’m still alive,” he said.
Republicans told us they wanted someone fresh and new; also, Ramaswamy got the coveted endorsement from President Donald Trump.
Back in February, Yost told us that Ramaswamy wasn’t experienced enough to lead Ohio.
“I have a proven track record,” Yost told us nearly a year ago. “He’s got a couple of books and some speeches.”
Now, he and DeWine are some of the only party leaders who haven’t endorsed Ramaswamy.
DeWine wanted the voters to choose the Republican nominee, not the party. Or, at least, he wanted the GOP to wait several more months instead of their very early endorsement process. Yost wasn’t DeWine’s choice, either, though. He first preferred Husted, then wanted his new lieutenant governor — Jim Tressel — to run.
“Is it bad for Ohio that there is really no primary?” I asked the governor on Friday during a one-on-one interview.
“It is what it is. I’ve been in politics a long time, and I’ve been in many races, and most of the time, many times, I had a contest in the primary. I usually did. That’s sort of the norm, it would appear at least,” DeWine responded. “And we haven’t hit the filing deadline yet, maybe somebody comes out and runs, but it appears that we pretty much now know who the Republican nominee is going to be and who the Democratic nominee is. That’s unusual.”
The Democratic frontrunner is COVID-era health director Amy Acton, who worked closely with DeWine. Due to former Congressman Tim Ryan sitting out the race, she likely won’t have a competitive primary.
Ramaswamy has previously told us that having a primary opponent may show division.
“We are more united as a Republican Party than we’ve ever been,” Ramaswamy said in an interview earlier this year.
Although Ramaswamy was neither DeWine’s nor Yost’s choice, both say they will end up supporting whoever the party’s nominee is.
We asked Ramaswamy’s team for comment, but didn’t hear back.
“Do you think that the Republican Party will regret this decision?” I asked Yost.
“Well, I hope not… I think the statist approach to governance that Amy Acton represents, not to mention her lack of experience, is going to be detrimental to Ohio and Ohioans,” he responded.
As for Yost? He is back to the drawing board.
“I am talking with other people who may or may not be people that I can work with in the future, and we’ll just wait and see what happens,” the AG said. “I’ve got a whole year.”

But attempts to […]","Topeka police shot and killed Taylor Lowery on Oct. 13, 2022, in a Kwik Shop parking lot. His family has refiled a wrongful death lawsuit against the city. (Submitted)The estate of Taylor Lowery, the Topeka man shot 34 times while backing away from officers while holding a wrench, has refiled its wrongful death lawsuit against the city.
The family had temporarily dropped the lawsuit because it said city officials indicated they couldn’t move on reform requests with the lawsuit pending. But attempts to secure those reforms, according to the family’s legal team, have been met with continued indifference.
They filed again Nov. 30, just within the 120-day window.
“The family is tired,” said lawyer LaRonna Lassiter Saunders. “It’s taken an emotional toll, especially with his daughter, who has constantly heard about how his life was taken. I could see it weighing on her. It could’ve been addressed and corrected.” 
The suit names officers Justin Good, Bradley Netherton, Sgt. Scott McIntire, and Detective Alex Wall as defendants and Da’Mabrius Duncan, a special administrator for Lowery’s estate and the representative of Lowery’s daughter, who is still a minor.
City spokesman Dan Garrett said Topeka has no comment regarding negotiations on legal settlement claims, but he added that city manager Robert Perez and public safety leadership have met multiple times with advocates who requested discussions on Topeka police policies.
“During the public advocate meetings, input was received on issues such as the release of body camera footage, use of force, and community oversight, and from those meetings, action steps, including City Council’s approval of a contract with Lexipol, which is reviewing the department’s policies to ensure alignment with best practices of policing and state law, have been taken,” Garrett said an email. “The community should expect rollout of the first of the policy reforms in the first quarter of 2026.”
According to the lawsuit: “Each officer at the scene was carrying non-lethal force including, but not limited to, pepper sprays and tasers but no officer attempted to use nonlethal force prior to fatally shooting Taylor Lowery. ... The offense Taylor Lowery committed on Oct. 13, 2022, was running from police.”
The lawsuit stems from the 2022 police shooting of the 33-year-old Lowery in a convenience store parking lot. Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay issued a report indicating Lowery had charged police while holding a knife over his head.
The release of video after a two-year fight with the city showed Lowery backing away from officers after picking up a wrench. Kagay has continued to defend his version of events. Some community advocates have called for Kagay to resign.
“It would be poetic if the jury came back with $100,000 for every shot police fired into Lowery,” Lassiter Saunders said. “They (the family) deserve nothing less.”
The lawsuit said that the defendants moved to deadly force without taking appropriate assessment measures.
“In … shooting and killing Taylor Lowery, the Officer Defendants used more force than was necessary,” the lawsuit said. “The conduct of the Officer Defendants was reckless, malicious, wanton, willful and violated Taylor Lowery’s constitutional rights.”
In footage following the shooting, when Lowery’s family arrived at the scene, police said Lowery had charged them with a knife. That claim is not supported by video evidence.
“The scary part to me is how easily they (the police) do it,” Lassiter Saunders said. “No stuttering. No fumbling. Almost like second nature. That just makes me wonder how many more crimes they’ve committed and covered up?”
Lassiter Saunders said the family made a good-faith effort at negotiating reforms so that no other family would have to experience what they have had to endure.
“We gave the city manager and the city council a chance to do the right thing,” she said. “I hope the citizens are paying attention to how (the city manager and some members of the city council) choose complacency over courage and choosing to be silent instead of speaking up the way the community deserves.”
Lassiter Saunders also criticized Perez, who was approved by the city council in May of last year. 
“The city deserves someone who cares about all the residents. He does not,” she said. “He turned out not to be the city manager we thought the city was hiring.”
Lassiter Saunders said the bulk of her work in this case has been pro bono and done out of concern. Were the family to prevail in the case, her portion would pale in comparison of the number of hours and the amount of energy she devoted to the case.
“It’s not about money,” she said. “It never has been. It’s about how disgusting and dismissive this whole process has been, including the coverup. The city council should not be sleeping well. I need their sleep to be disrupted.”

The amount of electricity data centers use in the U.S. in the coming years is expected to be significant. But regular reports of proposals for new ones and cancellations of planned ones mean that it’s difficult to know exactly how many data centers will actually be built and how much electricity might be required to run them.
As a researcher of energy policy who has studied the cost challenges associated with new utility infrastructure, I know that uncertainty comes with a cost. In the electricity sector, it is the challenge of state utility regulators to decide who pays what shares of the costs associated with generating and serving these types of operations, sometimes broadly called “large load centers.”
States are exploring different approaches, each with strengths, weaknesses, and potential drawbacks.
 A new type of customer?

For years, large electricity customers such as textile mills and refineries have used enough electricity to power a small city.
Moreover, their construction timelines were more aligned with the development time of new electricity infrastructure. If a company wanted to build a new textile mill and the utility needed to build a new gas-fired power plant to serve it, the construction on both could start around the same time. Both could be ready in two and a half to three years, and the textile mill could start paying for the costs necessary to serve it.
Modern data centers use a similar amount of electricity but can be built in nine to 12 months. To meet that projected demand, construction of a new gas-fired power plant, or a solar farm with battery storage, must begin a year – maybe two – before the data center breaks ground.
During the time spent building the electrical supply, computing technology advances, including both the capabilities and the efficiency of the kinds of calculations artificial intelligence systems require. Both factors affect how much electricity a data center will use once it is built.
Technological, logistical and planning changes mean there is a lot of uncertainty about how much electricity a data center will ultimately use. So it’s very hard for a utility company to know how much generating capacity to start building.
 Handling the risks of development

This uncertainty costs money: A power plant could be built in advance, only to find out that some or all of its capacity isn’t needed. Or no power plant is built, and a data center pops up, competing for a limited supply of electricity.
Either way, someone needs to pay – for the excess capacity or for the increased price of what power is available. There are three possible groups that might pay: the utilities that provide electricity, the data center customers, and the rest of the customers on the system.
However, utility companies have largely ensured their risk is minimal. Under most state utility-regulation processes, state officials review spending proposals from utility companies to determine what expenses can be passed on to customers. That includes operating expenses such as salaries and fuel costs, as well as capital investments, such as new power plants and other equipment.
Regulators typically examine whether proposed expenses are useful for providing service to customers and reasonable for the utility to expect to incur. Utilities have been very careful to provide their regulators with evidence about the costs and effects of proposed data centers to justify passing the costs of proposed investments in new power plants along to whomever the customers happen to be.
Regulators, then, are left to equitably allocate the costs to the prospective data center customers and the rest of the ratepayers, including homes and businesses. In different states, this is playing out differently.
 Kentucky’s approach to usefulness

Kentucky is attempting to address the demand uncertainty by conditionally approving two new natural gas-fired generators in the state. However, the utility companies – Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities – must demonstrate that those plants will actually be needed and used. But it’s not clear how they could do that, especially considering the time frames involved.
For instance, suppose the utility has a letter of agreement or even a contract with a new data center or other large customer. That might be sufficient proof for the regulator to approve charging customers for the costs of building a new power plant.
But it’s not clear what would happen if the data center ends up not being built, or needing much less power than expected. If the utility can’t get the money from the data center company – because they bill customers based on actual usage – that leaves regular consumers on the hook.
 Ohio’s ‘demand ratchet’ and credit guarantee

In Ohio, the major power company AEP has a specific rate plan for data centers and other large electricity customers.
One element, called a “demand ratchet,” is designed to mitigate month-to-month uncertainty in electricity consumption by data centers. The data center’s monthly bill is based on the current month’s demand or 85% of the highest monthly demand from the previous 11 months – whichever is higher.
The benefit is that it protects against a data center using huge amounts of electricity one month and very little the next, which would otherwise yield a much lower bill. The ratchet helps ensure that the data center is paying a significant share of the cost of providing enough electricity, even if it doesn’t use as much as was expected.
This ratchet effectively locks in the data center’s payments for 12 months, but regulators might expect a longer commitment from the center. For instance, Florida’s utilities regulator has approved an agreement that would require a data center company to pay for 70% of the agreed-upon demand in their entire electricity contract, even if the company didn’t use the power.
Another aspect of Ohio’s approach addresses the risk of changing business plans or technology. AEP requires a credit guarantee, like a deposit, letter of credit or parent company guarantee of payment, equal to 50% of the customer’s expected minimum bill under the contract. While this theoretically reduces the risk borne by other customers, it also raises concerns.
For example, a utility may not end up signing contracts directly with a large, well-known, wealthy technology company but with a subsidiary corporation with a more generic name – imagine something like “Westside Data Center LLC” – created solely to build and operate one data center. If the data center’s plans or technology changes, that subsidiary could declare bankruptcy, leaving the other customers with the remaining costs.
 Harnessing strength in flexibility

A key advantage to these new types of customers is that they are extremely nimble in the way they use electricity.
If data centers can make money based on their flexibility, as they have in Texas, then a portion of those profits can be returned to the other customers that shared the investment risk. A similar mechanism is being implemented in Missouri: If the utility makes extra money from large customers, then 65% of that revenue increase is returned to the other customers.
Change is coming to the U.S. electricity system, but nobody is sure how much. The methods by which states are trying to allocate the cost of that uncertainty vary, but the critical element is understanding their respective strengths and weaknesses to craft a system that is fair for everyone.

Everyone but him wore a lapel pin that read ​“I  Fossil Fuels.”
“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”
Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.
But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in U.S. waters.
The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​“The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.
Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”
And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.
The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.
Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes” — not wind development — were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.
At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power — the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance — appeared to be on the downswing, with many U.S. facilities having recently shuttered.
We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.
I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.
The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the U.S. seems impossible.
The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.
Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.
A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.
“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved. … I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.
Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own — namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.
“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction … and tactics that delay action.”

Stevenson, now 75, describes himself as ​“a lifelong conservationist.”
In the driveway of his Lewes, Delaware, home sits the hybrid vehicle he often drives to a nearby beach. Solar panels glint atop the roof, which Stevenson custom-designed in 2013 to be at the ​“optimum angle” to soak up the sun. A framed newspaper article about one of his cross-country bike rides hangs on the wall of his home office, nestled alongside photos of his seven children and 19grandchildren.
His career has intersected with clean energy — and even wind — at various points.
While working for DuPont in the 1980s, Stevenson helped the chemical giant develop the long-lasting coatings used to make first-generation solar panels and wind turbine blades. In 1999, after leaving the company, he started his own construction business and acquired certifications in energy efficiency and home weatherization. He said he eventually co-founded the Delaware Green Building Council to promote this kind of work.
But despite Stevenson’s environmentally minded career and interests, he’s built a reputation as someone dedicated to preventing, rather than enabling, renewable energy.

After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”
According to the D.C.-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.
For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centersand solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.
It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.
Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm — a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware — were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”
The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.
“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”
At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration — first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.
Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.
He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.
The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”
Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.
Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”
In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone — ​“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.
He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.
Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them — as the Brown University researchers put it — was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.
His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.
There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the east coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.
Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.
Maine AG praises ruling declaring Trump’s offshore wind halt unlawful

In January 2023, right-wing media took an interest in whales. There had been a slew of marine mammal deaths along the east coast of the U.S. in prior weeks — and conservative media put the blame on seismic surveys for the future offshore wind developments ramping up along the New Jersey coast. Fox News host Jesse Watters interviewed a leader of Protect Our Coasts NJ, a founding coalition member that Stevenson had helped become a nonprofit.
This wasn’t the first time the media had amplified baseless speculation about wind power killing whales. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, had run a similar story in 2017. But in early 2023, the claims were getting attention from Fox, local news, and even the Associated Press.
Stevenson was in near disbelief when he heard Tucker Carlson, then a commentator on Fox News, mention offshore wind and whales in multiple segments.


Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.
I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”
But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted that the campaign prompted a U.S. General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)
Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms.
Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”
The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the U.S. — during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities — and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.
Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.
As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”
In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”
In this ongoing phenomena, 40% of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.
I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”

Trump wasted no time coming after offshore wind when he took office in January 2025. On day one, he issued an anti-wind executive order that paused all permitting activity and derided the installations as ​“big” and ​“ugly” to an indoor stadium full of supporters.
For Stevenson and a dozen others in his influential cohort, the executive order was a good step — but it wasn’t enough to simply block new projects from advancing. In February, they petitioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue stop-work orders to the installations already being built, alleging that the projects posed a risk to whales. This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.
And it wasn’t long before the Trump administration tried to give the Stevenson-led coalition what it wanted. All five of the offshore wind projects under construction in America either have been delayed by recent stop-work orders or are reportedly under threat of receiving one.
Some in the coalition opposed such moves, recognizing that stopping projects already underway would raise energy costs. Steve Haner, a senior fellow at the Virginia-based conservative think tank Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, refused to endorse Stevenson’s petition to pause the five projects under construction — objecting especially to halting America’s largest project, a 2.5-gigawatt wind farm being built off the Virginia coast.
Under a hypothetical cancellation, according to Haner, ​“the ratepayers are on the hook” for the billions in sunk costs.
Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction — but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings” — an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf” — which helped secure a reversal from Trump.
Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.
At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.
Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built in America for the next decade — save for the five already under construction.
Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term.
“They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.
It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.
Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives — ones that go beyond whales — for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the U.S. vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)

Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”
The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change — and what to do about it — evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”
“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’ … A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”
These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”
Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​“Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment.” The book came out in early fall — just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life with a decade-long delay of U.S. offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.
Nowadays, Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.
“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”
All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas — which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal — was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.
Republican moderates in Washington have expressed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, utility bills, which Stevenson called his ​“primary motivation” for his anti-wind work, have skyrocketed in the Northeast and are projected to only climb higher if Trump’s policies continue to strangle the offshore wind sector.
Stevenson has increasingly drifted from the direction that other coalition members are taking. Protect Our Coast NJ — which first fanned the flames of misleading claims about whales — has embarked on a different disinformation campaign: spreading the false idea that offshore wind cables cause cancer. Embracing outlandish claims — whether it’s whale-killing ​“windmills” or cancer-causing cables — is a broader trend among Republicans who buy into conspiracy theories with their party’s rise to power.
Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32% jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.
“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy. … You don’t want 100% believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Madison-Wisconsin who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the U.S. is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.
Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seemed relieved to be doing so.
On our most recent call, in late November, Stevenson told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)
He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” Stevenson told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry — and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.
Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed offshore wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.
Stevenson also told me on the phone that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. Exxon Mobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.
I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.
I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view — that readers might see it that way.
“I don’t care if people hate me or not,” he said. ​“I’m doing what I think is right.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Stevenson-hero-uncropped-scaled-e1765823991299-1024x598.jpg,,,2025-12-17 04:57:57.234623

That’s because of a criminal justice reform law passed in 2020, allowing judges to effectively erase a misdemeanor case from existence. It shields people accused of “low-level” crimes from the stigma of having a conviction on their record, something that can limit work and housing opportunities. 
But an ongoing CalMatters investigation found that the new misdemeanor diversion program has also had an unintended consequence: It allows some people charged with vehicular manslaughter to keep the case off of their driving record. 
That means you could face more penalties for a speeding ticket than for running someone over.
Allison Lyman first heard about misdemeanor diversion from a Sacramento County prosecutor. In April, her 23-year-old son, Connor Lopez, was riding his motorcycle in Elk Grove when an oncoming car made a left turn and collided with him. 
Lopez, a piano teacher, died in the roadway. The district attorney’s office charged the driver, Harjit Kaur, with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter — alleging that her failure to yield to oncoming traffic caused the fatal crash, court records show. 
Then the prosecutor told Lyman to brace herself: The case could be wiped off Kaur’s record and sealed from view if Kaur asks for diversion and a judge grants it. 
“I’m 43 and I will have to live the rest of my life without my son. But there’ll be no record of it for her?” Lyman said.

It’s part of a larger anger and frustration Lyman has at how the system is treating her son’s death. She said she was talking to police and one of the officers kept referring to the case as “low-level.”
“She took my son’s life, but that’s how they’re seen — low-level,” Lyman said.

Diversion programs have been around for decades nationwide. They essentially let a judge pause a case and order a defendant to meet certain requirements over a specified period of time — like going to rehab and doing community service. If the defendant successfully completes the terms, their case is dismissed. Some diversion programs focus on certain types of criminal defendants, such as military veterans or people with mental health issues. A prosecutor often had to agree to diversion.
But the 2020 law lets judges in California order diversion for almost all misdemeanors, with few, if any, requirements that defendants have to fulfill, and over the objection of a prosecutor. Five years later, court records show defense attorneys are routinely requesting diversion not just for offenses such as shoplifting and drug possession but also for cases in which someone died. 
Rochelle Beardsley, assistant chief deputy district attorney in Sacramento County, said that’s like telling a victim’s family that their loved one’s life meant nothing. 
“That’s unfair to folks that have suffered greatly already,” she said.
CalMatters identified about three dozen drivers who have avoided a vehicular manslaughter conviction through the misdemeanor diversion law.
The actual number could be much higher because such cases are often sealed and scrubbed from searchable databases at county courthouses. CalMatters was able to identify instances in which diversion was granted by visiting courthouses around the state. In some cases, the files weren’t sealed because the defendant hadn’t yet completed the terms of the diversion program and the case was still active. Other times, we found cases where diversion was successfully completed but the records were still visible in court databases.
Vehicular manslaughter can be charged as a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the circumstances. Prosecutors typically charge a misdemeanor if the driver wasn’t intoxicated or driving in an extremely dangerous manner – like excessive speeding. 
In court, prosecutors and victims’ families often make emotional pleas for justice in arguing against letting the drivers off. Sometimes the judges listen and deny diversion. When they don’t, there’s a clear practical impact: The defendant keeps a clean driving record. That’s because diversion isn’t considered a conviction, and only violations for which a motorist is convicted are listed on a person’s DMV record.
That means the law isn’t just allowing the defendants to escape criminal penalties. It can allow them to avoid DMV punishments, too. Manslaughter typically counts as two points on a driver’s record and can lead to higher insurance premiums, traffic school and even a license suspension if the driver racks up additional points for things such as speeding or running a red light.
Of the three dozen drivers we identified who were granted diversion, there’s no indication of the manslaughter case on any of their driving records. (Some of the records do show the driver was in a collision. But the DMV records the agency released don’t reveal who was at fault or the crash’s severity.) Most currently have a valid license. Nearly a third of the drivers have gotten a traffic ticket or been involved in another collision after having been involved in a fatal crash, their DMV records show.
That includes a young man in Los Angeles who fell asleep at the wheel and ran over a bicyclist. He got a red-light ticket just a few months after the judge granted diversion and a speeding ticket this summer, shortly after his case was dismissed. In Alameda County, a driver who was in a fatal 2022 crash that killed his passenger got a speeding ticket just two months before a judge granted diversion. In Butte County, a driver who was in a fatal 2020 crash got two traffic tickets last year shortly before a judge granted him diversion and then promptly got a speeding ticket.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Lowenthal helped craft the 2020 legislation. He said he’s “very protective of diversion” because he’s seen it work so well and that it could be appropriate in some vehicular manslaughter cases.
“Might a court think it appropriate to divert so they don’t lose their job and suffer the draconian collateral consequences? Potentially,” Lowenthal said.
However, he said, it would be fair for the state to ensure that the diversion still ended up on a driver’s DMV record.
Kaur, the woman charged in Connor Lopez’s death, was arraigned on Monday in Sacramento County Superior Court. Because it’s a misdemeanor case, she didn’t need to show up. After the brief proceedings, her attorney, Hendrick Crowell, declined to comment. At such an early stage in the court process, there’s no indication Kaur’s attorney will even seek diversion. Still, Allison Lyman is already meeting with lawmakers and hoping to get the possibility of such an outcome taken off the table.
For now, every Wednesday she goes to the site of her son’s death along with her mom and sister, and sometimes her daughter, she said. They stand along the side of the road holding signs with Lopez’s picture, urging drivers to be safe.
“If there was some consequence, maybe — maybe — people would think about the responsibility when they get behind the wheel of a car,” Lyman said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/111625_Traffic-Vigil_FG_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-17 17:01:57.603254

Mike Flood, R-Neb., and a16z crypto's Brian Quintenz chat during part of the ""Flyover Fintech"" conference in Lincoln in 2023. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., recently suggested at a financial technology conference that stablecoins could be a lifeline for community banks, saying we have no choice but to be in the stablecoin business if we want to survive.
While I respect his commitment to innovation, this argument is misguided and risks diverting attention from the real challenges facing community banks today.
To be clear, Flood and the rest of the Nebraska delegation have consistently supported policies, such as reducing regulatory burden and ensuring a level playing field, which help the community bank industry continue to thrive with longevity. We are greatly appreciative of their support and Nebraska banks know that when push comes to shove our delegation will be in our corner because they understand the importance of community banks to our state.
Community banks make 80% of agricultural loans within the banking sector and 60% of small business loans under $1 million. It is clear that in a state like Nebraska, our economy and our communities rely on community banks.

We keep deposits local by lending locally, with lending decisions made locally by those who have relationships with customers that extend beyond the bank branch. Community bank survival does not hinge on the implementation of a crypto strategy.
Rather, it hinges on policies that address regulatory structural issues and strengthen the communities we serve.
If a community bank does choose to be active in the stablecoin space, Flood was correct in pointing out it will take partnerships with fintech companies if we hope to compete with big Wall Street banks and existing stablecoin companies.
Innovation has, and always will be, essential to ensuring our industry remains competitive. However, fair competition also relies on fair regulation.
What is important for community bank survival as technology progresses and interest in stablecoins grows is for Congress to ensure stablecoin companies are subject to a similar regulatory regime as banks, such as consumer protection and anti-money laundering laws.
Furthermore, it is critical that stablecoin companies and big tech companies issuing stablecoins cannot siphon away deposits from banks by offering interest via third parties, profit sharing, rewards or rebates to a consumer or business customer in exchange for bringing their money over to stablecoins.
To put it quite simply, without deposits community banks will not be able to offer the volume of agriculture, small business and mortgage loans that are currently the backbone of Nebraska’s economy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As this once speculative crypto and stablecoin industry grows, it is essential that we are allowed to compete on an even playing field, with the importance of community bank survival to our communities front of mind with policymakers.
Outside of stablecoins, there are other challenges currently threatening community banks today that are of equal importance. Consider the agricultural economy: For our rural communities, farming and ranching are the pillar of local prosperity.
When agricultural markets suffer and our borrowers feel the pain, so do community banks. While markets ebb and flow, our relationship banking model will assist us in working with agricultural customers and our community banks will do all they can to navigate these long-time customers through uncertainty.
Then there’s the overwhelming regulatory burden. Community banks mostly operate under the same framework as trillion-dollar institutions, but without their armies of compliance officers.
Every new rule adds cost and complexity, which takes resources away from technology upgrades, lending programs, and customer service. Policymakers should tailor regulations to reflect our size and risk profile, not push us toward ventures that introduce new operational and cybersecurity risks.
Stablecoins may one day have a role in the broader financial system, but they are not a survival strategy for community banks. Our mission is rooted in trust, relationships and local decision-making, and these will be the principles that continue to guide us into the future.
We aren’t asking for shortcuts to relevance by adopting a technology that has uncertain consumer demand. We’re asking for a fair shot from policymakers to keep doing what we’ve done for generations: serve our communities with integrity, stability and trust.

The fossil fuel industry is pivoting. As demand for gasoline declines, oil and gas companies are betting their future on plastic. What once powered our cars is now being refined, cracked and polymerized into bottles, packaging and single-use products that will outlive us all. 
This shift isn’t just a climate concern — it’s a public health crisis. Plastics are fossil fuels in another form. And the communities most exposed to their production bear the highest health burdens.
A new report from the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation on what defines a plastic-burdened community traces how this expanding plastic economy maps directly onto California’s oil and gas footprint. 
Even as California celebrates its climate leadership, our neighborhoods remain entwined with the legacies of fossil fuel infrastructure.  More than 2.5 million Californians live within a kilometer of an active or idle oil or gas well.
There are pumpjacks in Inglewood, refineries along the Wilmington corridor and wells beside schools in Kern County.  Refinery infrastructure — much of it feeding plastic precursor production — also is heavily concentrated in Los Angeles County, the most populous region in the state.
Unequal exposure
The science is unequivocal: living near oil and gas development is linked to a wide array of health harms: respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, adverse birth outcomes and elevated cancer risk. The higher odds for these conditions persist even when controlling for socioeconomic and environmental factors. 
In California and beyond, research shows pollutants from drilling and refining — such as volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and formaldehyde  — degrade air quality and increase asthma, heart attack and low-birth-weight rates. 
The burden of these exposures falls unevenly, our analysis shows. 
Neighborhoods closest to wells and refineries have far higher proportions of Latino and Black residents, lower incomes and greater health vulnerabilities. On average, for each refinery within 1.5 miles of a community, the median household income is nearly $11,000 lower, poverty rates are 5.5% higher and emergency-room visits for asthma and heart disease are significantly elevated. 
The environmental injustices of the oil age are being repackaged in the plastic economy. Globally, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development projects plastic production will triple by 2060. Petrochemicals already account for roughly 14% of oil use and by mid-century could drive nearly half of global oil demand.
In other words, even as we transition away from burning fossil fuels, we are locking ourselves into new forms of dependence — embedded in the packaging we discard daily.
Recognizing this link is critical as California prepares to implement the Plastic Pollution Mitigation Fund under Senate Bill 54, a plastics recycling and pollution prevention law signed in 2022. The fund will direct hundreds of millions of dollars from the plastics industry to communities harmed by pollution. 
Administered wisely, the fund could be a catalyst for mitigating the adverse health impacts of plastics and could create a transformative shift away from plastic production, use and disposability, building on the plastic reduction efforts required of the industry under SB 54.
Plastic pollution is not just about littered beaches or overflowing landfills; it begins long before a product reaches a store shelf.  If California truly intends to lead on climate and environmental justice, it must see plastic for what it is — the fossil fuel industry’s new frontier — and it must ensure that communities long treated as sacrifice zones become the first to benefit from solutions.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/063022-Plastic-Waste-Recycling-MG-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547
,California,2025-12-17 05:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,The U.S. is committed to cleaning up Tijuana River pollution. Will California follow through?,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/12/trump-administration-tijuana-river-pollution/,San Diego leaders are calling on California  to take stronger action to address the ongoing environmental crisis caused by sewage and industrial pollution flowing from the Tijuana River.,"In summary
San Diego leaders are calling on California  to take stronger action to address the ongoing environmental crisis caused by sewage and industrial pollution flowing from the Tijuana River.


As Tijuana River sewage has contaminated neighborhoods in southern San Diego County, the federal government has pledged two-thirds of a billion to clean it up. 
Now local lawmakers are calling on California to step up the fight against cross-border pollution, and one introduced a bill this week to revisit air quality standards for noxious gas from the river.
State Sen. Catherine Blakespear held a joint hearing of the Senate Environmental Quality Committee and the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee in San Diego Thursday to explore how the state can help solve the problem.
“California has long been a national leader in environmental stewardship and policy making,” Blakespear said at the hearing. “But what is happening in the Tijuana River Valley is an international environmental disaster that undermines everything that California stands for.”
The hearing at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, convened scientists and civic leaders to discuss how failed infrastructure, industrial waste and decades of neglect created the environmental disaster, and what it will take to fix it.
“Due to its international nature, we know the federal government must take the lead,” Blakespear said. “Still, there is much that the state and local governments can do.”
After decades of stalemate, action on Tijuana River pollution is speeding up. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday announced a new agreement with Mexico to plan for wastewater infrastructure to accommodate future population growth in Tijuana.
On Wednesday State Sen. Steve Padilla introduced a bill to update state standards for hydrogen sulfide, a noxious gas with a rotten egg smell that’s produced by sewage in the river. Residents in the area complain of headaches, nausea and other ailments when hydrogen sulfide reaches high concentrations. The bill would require the California Air Resources Board to review the half-century-old standard and tighten it if needed.
State Lawmakers also aim to improve conditions for lifeguards and other workers exposed to pollution, and hold American companies accountable for their role in contamination of the river. County officials will conduct an extensive health study to measure effects of Tijuana River pollution, and are making plans to remove a pollution hot spot in Imperial Beach.
Ongoing, chronic pollution
Sewage spills in south San Diego County became common in the early 2000s, sickening swimmers and surfers at local beaches. Then the aging wastewater plants failed, sending hundreds of millions of gallons of raw sewage into the ocean. Last year Scripps researchers found that the river is harming nearby communities by releasing airborne chemicals including hydrogen sulfide gas, which smells like rotten eggs.
“The sewage flowing into San Diego County’s Coastline is poisoning our air and water, harming public health, closing beaches, and killing marine life,” Blakespear said. 
San Diego officials have successfully lobbied for federal investment to upgrade aging wastewater treatment plants. They also introduced faster water quality testing and surveyed residents to understand health issues. 
Paula Stigler Granados, a professor of public health at San Diego State University, said studies of people living near the Tijuana River found “more scary stuff,”  with 45% experiencing health problems, 63% saying pollution disrupted their work or school and 94% of respondents reporting sewage smells at home. 
“Children are waking up sick in the middle of the night,” she said. “This is an ongoing, chronic exposure, not a one-time event.”

Water samples revealed industrial chemicals, methamphetamine, fentanyl, restricted pesticides, pharmaceuticals and odor-causing sulfur compounds, she said.
“This is absolutely a public health emergency,” Stigler Granados said. “I do think it is the biggest environmental crisis we have in the country right now.”
That sense of urgency isn’t universal. Last year Gov. Gavin Newsom declined requests by San Diego officials to declare a state of emergency over the border pollution problem, saying it “would have meant nothing.”
Over the last two years State Sen. Steve Padilla has introduced legislation to fund improvements to wastewater treatment, limit landfill construction in the Tijuana River Valley and require California companies to report waste discharges that affect water quality in the state, but those bills failed. He said the problem is overlooked in this border area, with its low-income and working class population.
“This is one of the most unique and acute environmental crises in all of North America,” Padilla said. “It is underappreciated simply because of where it is occurring.” 
Tijuana River solutions
This year the U.S. repaired the failing South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant and expanded its capacity from 25 million to 35 million gallons of wastewater per day. In April, Mexico repaired its Punta Bandera plant near the border, reducing sewage flows into the ocean.
But the Imperial Beach shoreline has remained closed for three years, and residents still complain of headaches, nausea, eye irritation and respiratory ailments from airborne pollution. That problem is worst at a point known as the Saturn Blvd. hot spot in Imperial Beach, where flood control culverts churn sewage-tainted water into foam, spraying contaminants into the air.
“When the water is polluted you can close the beach,” said Kim Prather, an atmospheric chemist at Scripps, who identified the airborne toxins. “But you can’t tell people not to breathe.”
Community members feel forgotten by state leaders as they face chronic air pollution and years of closed beaches because of contaminated wastewater from the Tijuana River, said Serge Dedina, executive director of the environmental organization WildCoast and former Imperial Beach mayor.
“What they say is ‘how come California doesn’t care about us?’” Dedina said.
As federal authorities plan expansions to the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant that will boost its capacity to 50 million gallons per day, local and state leaders have their own action plan.
A top priority for Aguirre is removing culverts at the Saturn Blvd. hot spot that cause airborne pollution.
“That’s low hanging fruit that we don’t need to depend on the federal government to fix,” Aguirre said.
She hopes to get funding for that project from Proposition 4, the state environmental bond that voters passed earlier this year. It dedicates $50 million to cleaning up degraded waterways, including the Tijuana River and New River, which flows into the Salton Sea. 
The county is also planning a health study that would include physiological measurements to determine the health effects of Tijuana River pollution.
“What we’re working on is how are we going to take real, hard medical data and follow a cohort of people who live in this environment, so we can understand what is happening in their bodies,” Aguirre said. “What is happening to children and seniors? What is in their bloodstreams?”
San Diego County has distributed about 10,000 home air purifiers to households near the Tijuana River, but Aguirre wants to provide devices to all 40,000 homes in the affected area.
Dedina said his organization is removing waste tires that are exported to Mexico and wash back into the Tijuana River Valley.
“My lesson here is we need to stop the sediment, the tires, the trash, the toxic waste, the sewage,” he said.
In addition to his bill updating hydrogen sulfide standards, Padilla said he’s exploring legislation to regulate pollution created by California companies operating through maquiladoras in Mexico. He wants to work with Mexico “to put some pressure on them to basically clamp down on American companies that are licensed to do business here in California.
Blakespear said she wants to protect lifeguards and other public workers exposed to pollution.
Whether the solution is creating environmental standards for international businesses or funding costly infrastructure, lawmakers acknowledge that the binational nature of the problem makes it tough to solve.
“The complexity around it being an international issue and being a federal issue has added to the difficulties about who should act,” Blakespear said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/112125_Paloma-Aguirre_AH_CM_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-17 08:57:49.549547

If Miami’s mayoral race is an indicator of the national mood, color that mood surly.
The ripple effect of widespread dissatisfaction felt by Americans because of the high cost of food, appliances, rent, and mortgages is reflected in political races this year during Donald Trump’s second presidential term. In almost every case, voters have delivered beatings on Republican candidates.
Last week, the trend continued when former Miami-Dade County Commissioner Eileen Higgins trounced her conservative opponent, former city manager Emilio González. Higgins, who also broke the glass ceiling for women, garnered 59.5% of the vote.
“Tonight, the people of Miami made history. Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city – one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people. I am deeply honored by the trust voters have placed in me to serve as the next Mayor of Miami,” Higgins said in a statement.
“As Mayor, I will lead a government that works for everyone — one that listens, acts, and delivers. From safe neighborhoods and affordable housing to clean parks, thriving small businesses, and a City Hall that finally earns the public’s trust, we’re ready to get to work. Tonight, we celebrate not just a victory, but a new beginning for Miami — a city that belongs to all of us, and a future we will build together. ¡Vamos a trabajar!”
Political shift
Higgins spoke powerfully against the dubious DeSantis-Trump-powered immigration crackdown that has upended the lives of undocumented and documented immigrants, including U.S. citizens.
“This is the first year ever where residents have told me they’re afraid, right?” Higgins said in an earlier interview with CNN. “I can’t go an hour when I am at community events without meeting someone whose brother, sister, aunt, uncle, was either taken to Alligator Alcatraz or who knows where? They don’t even know where they are.”
In the aftermath, political pundits muse that Miami’s mayoral runoff likely illustrates a broader national political shift, with Democrats not only breaking lengthy Republican stranglehold on the seat, but also because it is the latest momentum boost ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Seats have flipped blue in West Palm Beach as well as in Georgia, Mississippi, Iowa, and several mayoral seats in Connecticut.
It is not lost on Republicans, MAGA and otherwise, that González lost despite being endorsed by President Trump, Gov. DeSantis, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, and U.S. Sens. Rick Scott and Ted Cruz.
In the back of Republican and MAGA minds, what’s concerning to them — even as they try to mask their fears with bravado — is the potential for an unsettling Democratic sweep in next year’s midterm elections.
This year, Democratic candidates secured:

Gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia.
The surprise election of a young, bold Democratic Socialist candidate powered by young, multi-ethnic, disaffected voters in New York.
Passage of Proposition 50, a measure that gives California legislators room to redistrict congressional seats and give Democrats the opportunity to potentially capture five additional U.S. House seats.
Defeat of a measure in Maine that would have restricted voting.
Re-election of three Pennsylvania Supreme Court judges to retain a Democratic majority.

‘Dehumanizing and cruel’
Just about all the races revolved around affordability issues, analysts said. They noted that voters responded positively to Higgins’ criticisms of the DeSantis-driven policies allowing ICE agents to arbitrarily stop, harass, detain, and deport immigrants and U.S. citizens, plus her calls for affordable housing in an area of the country struggling with soaring housing costs.
“We are facing rhetoric from elected officials that is so dehumanizing and cruel, especially against immigrant populations. The residents of Miami were ready to be done with that,” Higgins said in an Associated Press interview following her victory speech Tuesday night.
Interestingly enough, Trump, during a swing through Pennsylvania to discuss Republicans’ steps toward countering inflation, assured the audience that his policies were driving down prices even as he characterized the “affordability issue” as a “Democratic hoax.”
Florida Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman, of Boca Raton, said during a recent news conference in the Capitol: “I’m hopeful that, as this session goes on, we in the House and the Senate in both parties are able to work together and do things that really do affect affordability and that affect peoples’ lives.”
Berman described affordability as her caucus’ top priority next session.
“Prices are rising, period. And we are seeing Republican politicians pander to D.C. and squabble amongst themselves instead of fixing the problem, so Democrats are offering ideas,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell, of Tampa, added.
Moneywise, WalletHub, Forbes, and Yahoo Finance reported recently that Florida is the second most-distressed state in the union in terms of its residents’ debt obligations, with a 23% increase in the share of people with distressed bank accounts between 2024 and 2025. In addition, Florida holds the sixth-highest overall share of people with accounts in distress, at 7.3%.
Economic distress
In human terms, this reflects a sharp increase in bankruptcy filings; residents with accounts in forbearance or deferred payments; America’s lowest average credit scores; and higher prices for groceries, rent, mortgages, gasoline, and health care.
Americans are struggling to pay their bills, even turning to credit to pay for essentials. A recent LendingTree survey found that one-quarter of buy-now-pay-later users have used these loans to buy groceries.
“The last few years have been a whirlwind for Americans’ finances, with inflation, fluctuating unemployment, public health crises and natural disasters making it hard for people across the country to pay their bills,” the WalletHub website says.
In the last presidential election, Americans voted for Donald Trump because of their deepening anxiety and escalating frustration with the cost of everything.
Democrats have finally figured out a winning message and have been relentlessly hammering Republicans on affordability.
Author and political consultant Avis Jones-DeWeever told me in a recent interview she is elated at the prospects.
“These wins were critical because it showed that people will fight back even though the Democratic Party is spineless. It was a powerful rejection in multiple states in multiple ways. It was a full-fledged rejection of (the Trump administration’s) autocratic ways,” Jones-DeWeever said.
The comprehensive wins across the country, she said, illustrate that “we are still a two-party system. We can’t allow these criminals to maintain power.”
Power of pragmatism
DNC finance chair Chris Korge, a Florida resident and major donor and volunteer for Higgins’ campaign, agreed.
Higgins’ “victory is proof that a pragmatic Democratic leader who addresses the electorate’s everyday concerns can rewrite electoral history,” he said.
In a sensible move designed to position themselves competitively, Florida Democrats offered Higgins support and national Democrats also showed up to campaign for her. This includes former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who encouraged voters in a video to make a plan to vote for Higgins; U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who joined her Sunday for early voting stops; and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who appeared at a Higgins rally the Monday before the election.
Higgins’ win is a well-placed boot in the backside of MAGA Republicans who focus on culture wars; continue to ignore the crucial needs of ordinary Floridians; bully and try to intimidate opponents; exhibit poor leadership; and reward their friends and punish their enemies.
For people tired of DeSantis’ and Republicans’ abuse of power and unlawful and immoral activities, these Democratic wins are a welcome breath of fresh air.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2251217464-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-17 00:59:32.736847

(File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A new poll finds Maryland residents roughly split on how officials should resolve a budget shortfall, and highlights growing pessimism about the rebuilding of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
The poll released Wednesday by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County suggests the governor and legislature “shouldn’t lead with tax cuts” as they cope with a projected $1.5 billion budget shortfall in the 2026 legislative session, said Mileah Kromer, director of the survey.
By and large, those surveyed said they wanted to see cuts to government spending — at least to some degree. Four in 10 said they wanted a solution that combined spending cuts with increases in taxes and fees. Another 41% said the budget gap should be closed “only or mostly” with spending cuts.
Only 10% of those surveyed said the hole should be filled “only or mostly with increasing taxes and fees.”
“Marylanders don’t want the budget deficit fixed or addressed only through some taxes and fees, that is what they don’t want now,” Kromer said. “Now, how it breaks down — the only, or mostly, with spending cuts, or the combination of spending cuts with increases — I think that is very much up for debate between most Marylanders.”
The poll surveyed 801 Maryland adults, including 769 registered voters, from Dec. 2-6. The margin of error for both pools of respondents is plus or minus 3.5%.
Marylanders say congressional maps unfair, but they have higher priorities than redistricting

Part one of the university survey gauged support for midcycle congressional redistricting.
The state’s looming budget problem comes on heels of a $3.3 billion structural deficit in the last legislative session, when Gov. Wes Moore (D) and lawmakers agreed to a budget that used one-time transfers, some budget cuts and $1.6 billion in tax and fee increases to close that gap.
The session ended with analysts projecting a $300 million surplus.
Now, the governor and key lawmakers say taxes are off the table as a solution this year — the last session before the 2026 elections.
Optimism over bridge rebuild fades
Marylanders in the poll are also expressing fading optimism that the Frances Scott Key Bridge can be quickly replaced.
The bridge collapsed into the Patapsco River in March 2024 after it was stuck by the container ship Dali. Six road maintenance workers who were on the span at the time were killed in the early morning crash.
Nearly two years later, more than seven in 10 of those surveyed think the loss of the bridge has had a “great deal” or “some” impact on life in the Baltimore area. Just 12% said it had no impact.
That is a sharp change from the days immediately following the incident: In a poll one week after the collapse of the bridge, just 21% of those asked said it would have a great deal of impact on life in the area, while nearly 40% said it would have no effect at all.
And those surveyed in the current UMBC poll are skeptical that a fix is coming soon. A quarter said they believe the bridge will be rebuilt in less than five years, while 54% said they believe it will take five to 10 years. Another 12% said they expected a replacement between 11 and 20 years, and 3% said the bridge would take 20 years or longer to rebuild.
In the days after the collapse, Moore vowed that the bridge would be rebuilt by 2028. Preliminary replacement costs were estimated at $1.7. At the time, President Joe Biden (D) vowed the costs would be covered by the federal government.
But President Donald Trump (R) and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have cast doubt on federal reimbursement, and that was before the state acknowledged the cost of a replacement is now between $4.3 and $5.2 billion. A replacement is unlikely to open before 2030, according to new state estimates.
“Folks are reacting to the most recent tranche of news about this,” Kromer said. “None of the reporting has been good. None of the reporting suggests a quick timeline at this point. I would say the public has set their expectations. It doesn’t look like they’re tremendously optimistic for a quick turnaround.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-17 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Transparency in schools was never optional and now the law confirms it,Maria Naughton,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/17/transparency-in-ct-schools-not-optional/,The public’s right to know isn’t just about process—it’s about trust. And trust in Connecticut's schools begins with transparency.,"Transparency in public education isn’t optional. It never was. The Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission just made that crystal clear.
In October, the Commission ruled that New Canaan Public Schools and the Board of Education violated the law by holding Curriculum Leadership Council (CLC) meetings behind closed doors. The district has been ordered to open them to the public, as state law requires.
This ruling should serve as a wake-up call to all school districts across Connecticut. State statute requires every district to have a curriculum committee to “recommend, develop, review and approve curriculum.” And those meetings must be public. For too long, New Canaan’s committee has met privately, keeping families and taxpayers in the dark about decisions that shape what our students learn, only unveiling programs well after implementation.
When curriculum decisions happen behind closed doors, problems are inevitable. Last year, New Canaan required a reading selection that many parents found inappropriate for its racist and sexual references leading to an after-the-fact review by the administration. Another example involved a Brown University program where students created Nazi propaganda posters as part of a classroom unit, which was later removed after complaints. These controversies might have been avoided if curriculum work had been done in public from the start.
In 2020, I filed a complaint with the Freedom of Information Commission arguing that the CLC was violating the open-meetings law. The Superintendent and Board of Education disagreed, hiring two attorneys and a retired Connecticut Supreme Court justice to make their case. After hearings, testimony and years of delay due to COVID and legal maneuvering, the Commission ruled decisively: the law requires transparency.
This decision isn’t just a win for one person or one town. It’s a victory for the public’s right to know. Open meetings give families the ability to understand and comment on what’s being taught. They also give Boards of Education the tools to manage costs tied to curriculum such as staffing, training, materials, and space before programs are implemented, not after.
There are good examples to follow. Despite New Canaan’s testimony that an open process is very unusual, and is not followed in other towns in Connecticut, it has been a practice in Greenwich for years. It can even be found right in nearby Darien where the curriculum committee meets publicly and evaluates new courses holistically by looking at content, cost, and logistics before adoption. This practice is just common sense.
The law requires New Canaan’s CLC to operate with transparency. In short, the curriculum committee must post agendas and minutes, hold meetings in public, and discuss curriculum plans openly before Board of Education adoption, not after. This level of transparency isn’t a burden; it’s accountability in action.
Every district in Connecticut should take note. Curriculum decisions must be made in the open. Parents and taxpayers deserve to see how programs are developed and to weigh in before they’re finalized.
The public’s right to know isn’t just about process—it’s about trust. And trust in our schools begins with transparency.

(Photo by Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its annual Arctic Report Card on Tuesday, which documents the way rising temperatures, diminished ice, thawing permafrost, melting glaciers and vegetation shifts are transforming the region and affecting its people. The agency has released the report for 20 years as a way to track changes in the Arctic.
“The Arctic continues to warm faster than the global average, with the 10 years that comprise the last decade marking the 10 warmest years on record,” Steve Thur, NOAA’s acting administrator for oceanic and atmospheric research and the agency’s acting chief scientist, said at a news conference Tuesday.
The report card is a peer-reviewed collaboration of more than 100 scientists from 13 countries, with numerous coauthors from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It was officially released at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in New Orleans, where Thur and other officials held the news conference.
The report is the first under the second Trump administration, at a time when the federal government’s commitment to documenting Arctic climate change has diminished: The president has repeatedly called climate change a hoax and federal departments are cancelling climate change-related research and projects, as well as scrubbing climate information from public view.
Under directives from the Trump administration, NOAA no longer provides information that the National Snow and Ice Data Center once used to monitor sea ice and snow cover, for example. The Colorado-based center now relies on satellite information from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency for its sea ice reports, and it has reduced its analysis.
A national dataset about the melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet has also been lost to the Trump administration’s cutbacks, said Rick Thoman of the UAF’s Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness, one of the report’s main editors. The ice sheet is still being monitored by European satellites, but the data is not equivalent, he said.
Government entities like NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which regularly provides scientific information that goes into the Arctic Report Card, have endured deep budget cuts and staff firings.
On Tuesday, Russel Vought, President Donald Trump’s Office of Management and Budget Director, said the administration plans to close the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a Colorado research facility that has operated since 1960. The facility “is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought said in a post on the social media site X.
And this year, unlike the other years since 2006 when NOAA published the first Arctic Report Card, the agency declined to issue a news release about it.
Thur, asked if NOAA will continue to publish report cards in the future, said the agency will continue the work that goes into the annual documents.
“What I would say in response to that question, is that we’re here today and that we have released the 2025 version,” he said. NOAA has continued its long-term environmental observations in the Arctic, both with satellite observations, he said. “So I think one of the things that the community can rely upon is that our efforts to continue to observe the planet will remain present,” he said.

	Thur also demurred when asked whether NOAA still stands by the statements about fossil fuels made by the agency’s prior administrator, Rick Spinrad. When last year’s report was issued at the end of the Biden administration, Spinrad said the changes in the Arctic were directly related to fossil-fuel emissions. Thur did not mention fossil fuels.
“What I would say in response to that question is that we recognize that the planet is changing dramatically,” he said during the news conference. “Our role within NOAA is to try to predict what’s going to occur in the future by documenting what’s occurring today,” he said. “There is a human role, as our administrator currently, Dr. Neil Jacobs, said during his congressional confirmation hearing, for humans in influencing those changes.”
Matthew Druckenmiller of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, another lead editor of the report, made no such equivocations.
“Let us start by first acknowledging that the warming of our planet driven by human greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere is amplified in the Arctic,” he said near the start of the news conference. “The Arctic continues to warm much faster than the globe overall, amplified by the loss of reflective sea ice and snow, causing more of the sun’s heat to penetrate into land and ocean.”
Druckenmiller also said the Trump administration did not interfere with drafting of the report.
“I can say that in producing the Arctic report card in 2025, we did not receive any political interference with our results,” he said.
Lower sea ice, more  precipitation, more melt and thaw
Some of the main messages in this report concern superlatives, while others describe a continuation of long-term changes.
It was the Arctic’s hottest year in a record dating back to 1900, the report said. The past year’s winter sea ice maximum was the lowest in the satellite record, which dates back to the late 1970s, and sea ice is much thinner and younger than it was in the past, the report said.
The region set a record for precipitation for the 12 months that ended in September, despite an unusually dry summer in parts of northern Canada and Eurasia. Warmer air holds more moisture, and a long-term trend of higher precipitation continues, the report said.
Across the Arctic, June snow cover extent has declined by 50% over the past six decades, since the 1960s. “Even though you’re starting out in season with more snow, it’s melting faster,” Thoman said.
For rain, there is another pattern: more heavy rain events. Those included last January’s powerful, northward pushing “atmospheric river” that stretched from the Aleutian Islands through mainland Alaska, bringing midwinter rain and flood conditions to Anchorage and elsewhere.
Alaska figures prominently in this year’s report card, as it has in past years’ reports.

	One chapter is devoted to changing conditions in the Northern Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea, where a warming-related process termed “borealization” is ongoing. That refers to the transition from an Arctic ecosystem to a more southern ecosystem.
In both seas, the report said, boreal species ranging from commercially important fish like Alaska pollock and Pacific cod to tiny organisms that make up the base of the food web, have been pushing out the more cold-adapted Arctic species like Arctic cod, saffron cod and snow crab. There are impacts to people and marine mammals, the report noted.
“Warming temperatures, declining sea ice, and shifting productivity in the Chukchi and northern Bering Seas drive ecosystem changes with significant implications for fisheries, food security, and Indigenous subsistence,” the report said.
In both seas, about a third of the boreal species groups examined over time increased, while about a third of the Arctic species groups decreased. Some of those boreal species populations spiked in recent years. That long-term trend is evident despite a lot of year-to-year variation and anomalously cold conditions in the Chukchi over the past year.
A chapter about mountain glaciers, a major contributor to global sea level rise, highlights this summer’s glacial outburst flood in Juneau, a phenomenon that has become an annual occurrence in Alaska’s capital city. Glacial outburst floods are increasing in frequency and severity in certain parts of the Arctic and subarctic, said Gabriel Wolken of UAF at the news conference.
Glacial melt is also tied to another extreme event that happened this summer in Southeast Alaska: the collapse of a mountainside along narrow Tracy Arm, which generated a local tsunami that rose nearly 1,600 feet up the opposite side.
“Glacier retreat combined with slope instability can lead to landslides,” Wolken said, adding that those slides can lead to far-reaching tsunamis. “The August 10th, 2025 landslide in Southeast Alaska’s Tracey Arm illustrates the sheer power of these hazards,” he said.
A chapter in the report is devoted to “rusting rivers,” a permafrost-related phenomenon documented throughout the Arctic but especially in Northwestern Alaska. The name comes from the conversion of clear streams to rust-colored waterways, the product of iron and other chemicals that leech out from rocks because of permafrost thaw. There are more than 200 such rusting watersheds in Alaska, said Abagael Pruitt, a University of California, Davis scientist studying the subject.
Another chapter in the report describes the Indigenous science monitoring being done at the community level. That includes work by the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, a tribal government that has established its own lab to screen traditional foods for mercury contents.
While much of the report was devoted to impacts within the Arctic and to people living in the region, its coauthors pointed out that rapid climate change in the far north affects latitudes far to the south. Sea level rise, disrupted weather patterns and shocks to commercial fisheries that are important global food sources are among the far-ranging effects of melt, thaw and other changes, they said.
Wolken, at the news conference, put it this way:
“From the deep oceans to the highest peaks, the Arctic cryosphere is undergoing rapid, interconnected and unprecedented change, and those changes matter far beyond the Arctic.”

C. Anthony Muse (D- Prince George's) applauds after the Maryland Senate Tuesday voted to override Gov. Wes Moore's (D) veto of a bill to study reparations for African Americans in Maryland. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)It took years to pass — and another eight months to override the governor’s veto — but lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that creates a Maryland Reparations Commission.
The bill establishes a 23-member voluntary commission to assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, and to examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from policies that led to discrimination. The commission is also charged with recommending appropriate reparations, from a statement of apology to monetary compensation or social service assistance.
The bill had been a priority of the Legislative Black Caucus and its veto in May  by Gov. Wes Moore (D), the first Black governor of Maryland, stunned many lawmakers and advocates, in Maryland and nationwide. Legislators immediately vowed an override, which they did by comfortable margins during Tuesday’s special session.
“It’s been a long time coming, and I’m so very grateful that this body saw fit to do that,” Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), the lead Senate sponsor, said in a brief interview after the vote. “I think the study will go a long way in revealing some of the things that we’re talking about. I’m happy that it’s happened.”
Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford) voted with all 13 Senate Republicans to sustain the governor’s veto. But 31 Democrats voted to override it, more than the 29 needed.
In terms of disagreeing with the governor, Muse said, “The governor is a friend of everyone here, so we disagree, but we disagree in friendship.”
Moore said in his May 16 veto message that it was a “difficult decision” but that “now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.”
But Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), who voted for the veto override Tuesday, said creating a commission must be done. Sydnor, the only person to speak on the Seante floor on the bill gave a more than 10-minute speech mixed with a history lesson that included how Baltimore County did not provide Black students with a high school education in the 1940s.
“Let’s be clear: Slavery may have ended 150 years ago, but segregation, redlining, discrimination, stretched well into our own lifetime,” Sydnor said. “The laboring effects are real, and we cannot prepare [for] what we refuse to acknowledge. Mission is not about blaming individuals. It’s about fixing systems.”
While the Senate took about 15 minutes for its debate and overrided the vote on the reparations bill, debate in the House lasted slightly more than an hour before delegates voted 93-35 to reverse the governor’s veto.

House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany), who voted to sustain the governor’s veto, was the first of seven delegates to speak on the bill, who were followed by another five who rose to explain their votes. Buckel reminded his colleagues that it was “the actions of the majority of the people of the United States of America, Black and white at the time, who said enough is enough and we will change the system,” and shed their blood to do so
But prior to his vote in support of the governor’s veto, Del. Matthew Morgan (R-St. Mary’s) said the commission is set up to offer “race bait handouts.”
Del. Terri Hill (D-Howard), who voted to override the veto, said the bill “requires us as an arm of the Maryland government to look at the things that government policy allowed to happen and enable.”
Hill praised the legislator who sponsored the House version that passed the chamber but didn’t advance in the Senate. Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), who didn’t speak on the House floor about the bill Tuesday, received congratulatory hugs from several of her House colleagues.
After the House adjourned, McCaskill thanked her colleagues, community leaders and advocates who spoke out in support of a commission.
“I’m so overwhelmed right now, but I am grateful. This is such a historical moment not only for Maryland, but literally for this country,” McCaskill said in a brief interview after the vote. “It is time to move and seek this commission and support the commission for the work that needs to be done.”
The Legislative Black Caucus said in a statement Tuesday the reparations commission “will now become law in our state. At a time of growing attacks on diversity and equity, today’s action reaffirms our shared commitment to truth-telling, accountability, and meaningful progress for Black Marylanders.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC02552-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-16 22:57:44.458010

Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) as speaker, the first Afro-Latina to hold the position.
By the end of the day, the General Assembly had overridden more than a dozen vetoes of bills ranging from creation of a workgroup to boost health care cybersecurity, to developing a technology and social media resource guide for youth and increasing state funds to help schools purchase locally grown food.
Legislature overrides Moore’s veto, approves creation of reparations commission

One override came even though Moore made a last-minute reversal Friday and announced he would fund a climate change study that was in the bill he vetoed. The study will assess the costs of mitigating the effects of climate change in the state, but it will also evaluate whether large fossil fuel companies should be compellee to foot some of the bill. The bill, as originally introduced was named the RENEW Act — for Responding to Emergency Needs From Extreme Weather.
“I am really grateful that the governor and the comptroller decided to go ahead with the study. It is absolutely the right thing to do,” said bill sponsor Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D- Howard & Montgomery) in an interview Friday. “The RENEW Act is a ratepayer protection bill. It’s based on the premise that if you make a mess, you clean it up.”
But Hester noted some uncertainties about the memorandum of understanding announced by the governor last week. For instance, it apportioned an initial $270,000 for the study in fiscal 2026, but required the comptroller’s office, which is performing the study, to request additional funds as needed in fiscal 2027. The vetoed bill, by comparison, allots $500,000 for the study all at once.




Veto overrides:

SB116/HB270: Data Center Impact Study
SB909/HB1037: Energy Resource Adequacy Planning Act
HB384/SB157: Disability Service Animal Program
HB56/SB177: Local Food Purchasing
SB691/HB333: Healthcare Ecosystem Cyber Work Group
HB1316: Primary and Secondary Education – Youth-Centric Technology and Social Media Resource Guide
SB149/HB128: “RENEW Study” Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation – Total Assessed Cost of Greenhouse Gas Emissions – Study and Reports
HB0328: State Lottery – Instant Ticket Lottery Machines – Veterans’ and Fraternal Organizations
SB587: State Government – Maryland Reparations Commission





“The RENEW Act calls for the $500,000. It ensures full completion,” Hester said. “No other state has done this work for less than $500K.”
In the House, Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said the veto should be sustained, because the bill sends the wrong message to fossil fuel companies.
“We’re telling them: ‘Screw off. Maryland doesn’t like you. We don’t want you. We’re going to search for ways to hurt you,’” Buckel said. “And that’s not a symbol and a sign in today’s times that we should be sending.”
Climate groups, who were infuriated by Moore’s veto in May, were buoyed by Tuesday’s news.
Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund dubbed Tuesday “a great day for the fight against climate change in Maryland.”
Maryland now joins other states, including Vermont and New York, that have passed similar legislation to study climate change costs with the goal of making fossil fuel energy companies chip in.
As the RENEW study — due next December — gets rolling, so, too, will a new study on the “likely environmental, energy, and economic impacts” of data center development in Maryland.
Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County) called for an override of the governor’s veto of the data center study bill. He cited a new data center proposal in Woodlawn, in his district, which has drawn concerns from his constituents.
“The experts are adamant that across the country, and here in Maryland, we are currently rushing to approve data center projects through a poorly planned, chaotic process that lacks a foolproof and regulatory framework to protect our communities from harm,” Sydnor said. “Naturally, my constituents responded with deep concern, fear and even outrage.”

The study — to be performed by the Department of the Environment, the Maryland Energy Administration and the University of Maryland School of Business, in coordination with the Department of Legislative Services — is due on Sept. 1, 2026.
“My constituents are entitled to answers, not false promises. Providing those answers starts with a comprehensive study,” Sydnor said.
The data center bill received bipartisan support in the Senate, where an override passed unanimously.
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) said Tuesday was “one of the few times” he would stand with Democrats from his county like Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick), who sponsored the data center study. Frederick County has a data center campus under development, he noted, with homes and a school in close proximity.
“This is a very real impact. Frederick County is the first that has really started to develop our data center platforms, and right now we’re looking at a 2,200-acre parcel,” Folden said.
House Republicans, however, were split on overriding the data center veto. Del. Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel) said the data center study would be a waste of taxpayer dollars and that the economic boost from new data centers is needed as soon as possible.
“Yes, data centers may be a problem for us,” Chisholm said. “Are they going to be a problem because they have the ability to bring thousands of jobs, thousands of opportunities and real economic growth? No, that’s not the problem. The problem is we do not have enough supply.”
Ultimately, the veto was overridden 111-24.
Tuesday’s veto overrides also revived a bill to create a Strategic Energy Planning Office, to produce forecasts about the regional electricity grid and its impact on Maryland.

“Affordability is like the defining issue for Maryland families, and energy costs are … the growing part of that pressure,” said Hester, the bill’s sponsor. “SB 909, gives the state a way to plan responsibly, avoid costly emergencies and make decisions based on shared data rather than siloed reactions.”
In the House and Senate, some Republicans opposed the creation of the new energy office, which was a part of the energy package passed by General Assembly leadership in the spring.
“If this is truly about energy resource adequacy and planning, then there would be a few more players in the game,” Del. Wayne A. Hartman (R-Wicomico and Worcester) said. “If we were real about this, we would include representatives of fossil fuels and the nuclear industry.”
The new office must collaborate with the Maryland Energy Administration, the Maryland Public Service Commission, the Power Plant Research Program, the Maryland Clean Energy Center and the Maryland Department of the Environment.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderDemocrat Jaha Howard, a dentist and former Cobb County School Board member, is headed to the state Capitol after narrowly defeating fellow Democrat and former state Rep. Roger Bruce during a special election runoff. He will represent a metro Atlanta district that includes portions of Cobb and Fulton counties.
Howard and Bruce beat out four other candidates during a six-way special election earlier this month, but neither managed to secure the majority needed to win the election outright. Howard will replace former state Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat who resigned from the state Senate in September to focus on his campaign for governor.
Ahead of the special election, much of the Democratic establishment coalesced behind Bruce, who was first sworn in as a state representative in 2003 and served for 22 years, until his retirement in 2024. But Howard, who has also been a candidate for state school superintendent and ran for a seat on the Cobb County commission earlier this year, received the most votes during the special election and maintained his lead in the runoff. He won Tuesday by roughly 235 votes, according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s office.
Howard previously ran for state Senate in 2017, but came under fire after sexist and homophobic comments he posted on Facebook between 2011 and 2014 were unearthed. He later apologized for the comments, and eventually lost that race to attorney Jen Jordan. 
During this year’s campaign, he said, he has worked to gain voters’ trust in his commitment to LGBTQ and women’s rights.
“I’m talking to constituents all the time, and they believe me when I say that we’re going to fight for our freedoms, including our freedom to choose, our freedom to marry who we choose, and freedom to vote,” he said in a phone interview Tuesday night.
He also received an endorsement from state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, one of the two openly gay lawmakers in the chamber.
As he prepares to take office, Howard said, “I’m doing my best to love God and love people for real, and not in the way that we see in the public square.” 
“I look forward to serving with integrity and fighting for justice,” he said.
Howard will be up for reelection next year alongside all Georgia lawmakers.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dome-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-12-16 22:57:44.458010

Freshman David Novogrodsky had planned to be in the building where the shooting took place, but went to a math study session instead.
The post Laramie grad, yards away from Brown shooting, now home and safe appeared first on WyoFile .","Brown University freshman David Novogrodsky had planned to be in the seven-story Barus and Holley engineering and physics building on the Providence, Rhode Island campus Saturday when a gunman burst into a room, killed two students and injured nine others.
The Laramie High School graduate and mechanical engineering major is in the building almost every day, he said in an interview Tuesday. He had received an invitation to be there on Saturday to work on the pedals of a Formula race car being designed for a college competition.
Instead, he went with friends to a math study session in his dorm.
“I just got lucky,” Novogrodsky said. “I would have been there from like 10 to five o’clock.”
Shortly after 4 p.m., a person opened fire on students in an economics review session in a room on the building’s first floor, according to news reports. Police have released video footage of a man, who remains at large, whom they believe is connected to the incident.
Novogrodsky was about four blocks away at a Shake Shack, chomping on a burger with a buddy. After, he planned to meet another friend at the Science Library, right next to Barus and Holley. It was about 4:15 p.m.
“This happens when you let gun control be as lax as it has been.” David Novogrodsky
“My [other] friend … because I told him I was there … came, like, sprinting into the Shake Shack,” Novogrodsky said. That fellow student had been in Barus and Holley.
“And he was like, ‘Dude! I just heard like, 12 shots fired in this building!’
“He was super-rattled,” Novogrodsky said. “I could see the fear in his eyes. He told me what was going on, and then ran back to his dorm.”
Novogrodsky and his buddy at Shake Shack were perhaps 300 yards away from the shooting. “We saw 20 cop cars go down the street,” he said.
The two ran into another friend who had an apartment nearby, and they all fled there. Eating the Shake Shack burger was crucial.
“We sheltered a place for the rest of the night,” he said. “Sixteen hours.”
Away from risk?
When Novogrodsky left Laramie and a state full of firearms this summer for nearly all-blue Providence, he thought he had left gun culture behind. “I actually felt coming from Wyoming, I’ve gotten away from a lot of that risk,” he said.
“It’s always felt like a very safe campus,” he said of Brown. “I’ve walked back from libraries at 4:30 in the morning — haven’t had any issues.”
He learned about active shooter dangers in Laramie.
“Every year, we go through drills,” he said. “Hide at the corner first, then run. As a last resort, throw chairs or whatever you have to.
“But there wasn’t any training like that, at least not enough for it to be memorable for me, from Brown.”
Novogrodsky knew of Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, one of the two students who was murdered. Ella Cook also died in the shooting. Novogrodsky’s friend, who rushed into Shake Shack, is tight with a student who was wounded.
“He’s one of the nine who survived,” Novogrodsky said. “That was just scary to think … three inches … slightly different condition[s] and the guy who I had lunch with three weeks ago wouldn’t be with us anymore.”
Novogrodsky and his friends hunkered down in the apartment, blocks from the shooting. He didn’t notice anything amiss on the way to his lockdown. The shooter is believed to have left Barus and Holley to the east. Shake Shack is to the west.
“I was frantically checking my Instagram stories,” Novogrodsky said. “The first people to say there’s shots fired on campus [were] on Slack, so everybody was checking that.”

He messaged friends. Officials were warning students not to phone one another in case a call set off a hidden student’s ringtone that a shooter might hear.
“They were texting us saying ‘silence your phones, turn off lights, keep doors locked.’”
Messages went out. Students shared group chats. Novogrodsky’s club hockey coach messaged the team.
“Almost immediately, people were rallying to each other, trying to support each other, making sure everyone was OK.”
Then they waited.
“We heard all the news helicopters above us all night, cops and reporters down on the street and everything.”
Every person was smarter
As a junior at Laramie, Novogrodsky was ready to go to college.
“I was so excited, and it did not disappoint when I got there,” he said of Brown. “The whole New England atmosphere is just so different.”
In Wyoming, there were a couple of students in his class who were dedicated to learning. “I was one of a smaller percentage of kids who, like, truly cared about school,” he said.
“Getting to Brown, every single person was there to push themselves, learn as much as they can,” he said. “It’s so nice getting to the environment where I felt like everyone just had the same kind of drive and motivation. I felt like every person was smarter than the next.”

It was, he said, “one of the best five months of my life.”
When the students emerged from their shelters after the lockdown, there was an eerie silence across the campus and town. Students united.
“Everybody had the same mindset — if you need anything, I’m here for you,” Novogrodsky said, “and we still need to get through this together.”
Security on campus is going to increase a lot, he predicted.
“We’re probably gonna have to swipe in [to] every building, into almost every room,” he said. “I hope that Brown takes those initiatives pretty proactively in this winter break, because anybody could walk into Barus and Holley.”
In the aftermath, he has a message for Wyoming.
“This happens when you let gun control be as lax as it has been,” he said. “There’s a difference between the guns that people use for hunting and keep in their safe the rest of the year,” he said, and handguns and other firearms.
“It’s clear that gun control needs to change,” he said. “Whoever did this didn’t realize they just poked the bear on the most socially active campus in the country.”

(Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)BILLINGS —More than a week ago, the rainbow-colored banner that proclaimed “God is Still Speaking” on the west side of Mayflower Congregational Church was torn down.
The church didn’t worry because the banner had been there for awhile, signaling that it was a welcoming congregation for all people, including LGBTQ+ persons, and winter had begun with wind and rain.
But sometime late last Friday or early Saturday morning, vandals had replaced the rainbow flag with six red swastikas and a message containing a swearing and an LGBTQ-slur. Rev. Amy Carter was alerted to the graffiti and message on Saturday morning.

“I was both angry and really sad,” Carter said. “The response, though, was that we had a lot of people said, ‘How can I help?’ I am so grateful that we are not alone in all of this.”
The congregation’s welcoming and progressive stance is nothing new, Carter said. And it’s not just a matter of yard signs or banners on buildings. Instead, Mayflower Congregational said it’s not hiding its beliefs — they’re on the website, including the proclamation the congregation adopted on April 25, 1999, when it became “open and affirming,” a statement welcoming diversity of ages, backgrounds, and sexuality, while refusing to let labels be used to lessen people’s sacred value.
Carter said occasionally the church gets calls or messages from the community because of its messaging, but not threats.
She said that while some members of the congregation felt angry or sad or even scared after the vandalism, the pastor said it’s also been an opportunity to empathize with those who are targeted routinely.
“We have chosen to create safe space for people who are seeking safe space and deal with this daily,” Carter said. “People who deal with this harassment — people of color, or women and so there’s this sense of stepping into someone else’s vulnerability. What does it mean to be Jewish in a place where there are swastikas in our community?”
Carter contacted the Billings Police Department on Saturday. The police are investigating the incident as a hate crime. Lt. Samantha Puckett told the Daily Montanan that since the church did not have cameras monitoring the area, they’re asking for neighbors or anyone who saw people there to contact investigators. Police officers canvassed the neighborhood, searching for the identity of those responsible.
The congregation, nestled in a residential area in the center of Billings, began putting out notices of the incident so that church members wouldn’t be shocked the next day, as they arrived for Sunday services during the Christian season of Advent. Meanwhile, some neighbors contacted the church, wondering what would be done with offensive message and symbols.
Most paint-strippers and other chemical treatments to remove the message couldn’t be applied during the cold weather, which stayed at below freezing for several days. But some old hospital sheets were placed on the side of the building, and other community members came to help, including Downtown Billings, which uses a product to remove graffiti from downtown walls and buildings.
The message is now off the building, and any difference is hard to notice unless someone stands right next to the exterior walls. One church member power washed the “Elephant Snot” graffiti remover off the building Tuesday. Another community member has offered to paint the building when the weather gets warm enough.
It’s not the first time the faith community in Billings has confronted hateful means or the message — more than 30 years ago, the city pushed back when a Jewish family’s home was vandalized by anti-Semitic perpetrators who smashed a window containing a menorah during Hanukkah. Prior to that crime, Native Americans in the community had also been targeted, and swastikas left on the Rims, the sandstone cliffs that cradle the city.
The town responded by putting menorahs in windows throughout the community, thanks in part to The Billings Gazette, the state’s largest newspaper, printing menorahs to put on windows as an act of solidarity. That incident, and the community’s response, spurred on a national movement, “Not In Our Town,” which included children’s books and resources for communities to combat hate and bigotry in a peaceful, nonviolent way.
For Billings, Montana’s largest city, the town that spurred on the movement is still trying to finish what it started decades ago, with Mayflower Congregational being just the latest target.
Earlier this year, Grace United Methodist was targeted because of its support of the LGBTQ+ community, according to Carter. And the small Wayman Chapel, an African Methodist Episcopal congregation on the city’s south side, which has historically served the Black community, had three of its windows vandalized, another act the city has considered a crime motivated by bigotry.
Earlier this year in Missoula, a Jewish man was beaten in the downtown area there, targeted for what police say was a hate-crime because of his religion. And residents in Evergreen had houses targeted with pamphlets endorsing white supremacy.
Billings Police Chief Rich St. John issued a letter about the incident on Monday afternoon.
“Hate-fueled crimes are not expressions of free speech — they are deliberate attempts to threaten and divide,” St. John said. “We will not allow that to stand.”

Carter said that while the incident is upsetting, it hasn’t upset the church’s ministry. Signs still line both sides of the corner-lot church, inviting everyone to worship. Even with the swastikas covered by old bedsheets, Carter said the annual children’s Christmas pageant still went on.
On Tuesday, Carter told the Daily Montanan that there were still eight more services the congregation would hold before the end of Christmas and 2025, including a “blue Christmas” service, which caters to those struggling with sadness or loss during holiday season.
And as word of the incident started to get out, she said the initial feeling of vulnerability was replaced by a feeling of community — as faith leaders from around the area consider how to respond, and people of the Jewish faith inquire about how to stand together.
Other groups responded to the incident, including 406 Pride, a resource center for the LGBTQ+ community in Billings:


        “406 Pride denounces these violent words and White Supremacist symbols intended to spread fear among marginalized populations in our city. We stand steadfast with Billings’ affirming churches in the shared work of building inclusive communities of support, and advocating for the rights of people of all identities, races, and backgrounds. In a spirit of queer joy, we urge our local LGBTQ+ community to resist the call to fear, and remember: You matter. You are loved. You belong.”    
The incident has even caught the attention of other nationwide groups.
“A bias-motivated attack on any house of worship is an attack on the fundamental American values of religious freedom and human dignity. We strongly condemn this neo-Nazi vandalism and commend law enforcement for investigating this incident as a potential hate crime. Those responsible must be held fully accountable,” said a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mayflower-Congregational-cleaned-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-16 20:56:20.992304

The Montana Public Service Commission will take up a fine amount against the private utility in July 2025. PSC President Brad Molnar said a fine requires court action. (Duane Schlabach for the Daily Montanan)After persistent complaints about poor water service from residents of the North Star subdivision outside Helena, the Montana Public Service Commission approved Tuesday a settlement with the utility that imposes monetary penalties and sets other requirements.
However, the Public Service Commission backed off of an $86,700 fine it preliminarily adopted in August in favor of the settlement, which makes $37,000 worth of monetary demands on the utility plus other requirements.
PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder said she expects the utility, North Star Development LLC, to “very diligently take care of this system,” although she said she was skeptical.
Fielder also said the commission’s patience had worn thin, and she did not want to hear problems of inadequate water supply continuing.
“I think the owner is getting off fairly light,” Fielder said.
Residents of the North Star subdivision have raised concerns about poor water supply and impacts on lawns, vegetable gardens and other uses since at least 2020.
They have reported unreliable service and an apparent shutoff. The subdivision has roughly 300 households.
The North Star Development LLC owner, however, has said the utility fixes problems as soon as they’re reported, but residents overuse water and ignore restrictions.
At a Public Service Commission meeting Tuesday, regulatory staff person Sam Harworth said he would have expected North Star to be more responsive to at least one recent problem, especially given the pending settlement.
However, Harworth also said customers contribute to the problems as well by not allowing North Star entry into their homes to fix issues and by “blatantly” ignoring watering restrictions.
“The fault here is not just the water system. It is also the customers,” Harworth said.
In August, the Public Service Commission adopted a fine it said was a preliminary step toward inviting the North Star utility to negotiate infrastructure improvements.
North Star opted to negotiate, and Public Service Commission staff presented the settlement at the Tuesday meeting.
In the settlement, North Star utility owner Doug Boutilier agrees to put $15,000 into a reserve account by the end of 2025 to ensure adequate funds for maintenance and improvements.
North Star also agrees not to file a rate application asking the Public Service Commission to approve $21,680 it spent to repair underground wiring as a cost customers should pay.
The settlement notes Boutilier is contributing more than $100,000 for improvements to the system prior to the 2026 irrigation season, although it may ask the commission to recover those costs.
Fielder, who led the meeting, said she would have wanted to see an outcome where the original fine amount would benefit customers, but that wasn’t an option.
On the one hand, she said, commissioners could approve the negotiated settlement — with a portion of the monetary demands helping residents plus additional non-monetary arrangements, including an increase in reporting requirements.
On the other hand, she said, commissioners could impose their original full penalty — but watch all the money go to the general fund, as statute requires, rather than to help customers.
PSC staff attorney Terisa Oomens said the idea with the settlement was that at least some of the money would go toward providing better service to customers, and Fielder agreed that was the goal.
“Because that’s what they really want. They want reliable, adequate water service,” Fielder said.
Commissioner Annie Bukacek described the settlement as “masterful,” and she said it reflects a compromise between North Star and the commission.
Bukacek also said the Public Service Commission has “deep empathy” for the inadequate service North Star residents have experienced, and the settlement respects their position.
“They’ve been heard,” Bukacek said.
The settlement said North Star will complete a water assessment and system upgrade proposed at $135,000. However, Harworth said the proposal’s lack of specificity meant it might result in a fix to some faults in the system but wouldn’t provide a full solution.
In the settlement, North Star also agrees to randomly monitor customers’ lawn sprinkling when restrictions are in place to determine any violations; investigate lawn sprinkling violations within 10 days; impose fees within five days of identifying a violation; take specific steps to ensure working meters; communicate about rate applications, system updates and other issues with customers; and provide specific monthly reports to the Public Service Commission, among other requirements.
North Star also agreed its operators would wear “company identifiable clothing” so residents could recognize them.
In return, the Public Service Commission agreed to not impose the penalty it contemplated in August, and to help North Star gain access to properties for inspecting, maintaining and replacing meters.
North Star owner Boutilier could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but he signed the proposed settlement.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/4592507317832170039-1024x473.jpg,,,2025-12-16 20:56:20.992304

The U.S. economy has struggled to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought record unemployment, supply chain disruptions and production shutdowns. Global uncertainty associated with the war in Ukraine, worker shortages and stimulus spending helped continue to push up prices as the pandemic abated. 
The Trump administration has been in office nearly 11 months and economists say the administration’s economic policies are not helping.
While Vance touted wage growth and foreign investment in American industry, Tuesday’s November jobs report, delayed by this fall’s 43-day government shutdown, showed stagnant growth. Experts attributed the trend to the effects of Trump’s tariffs, stubborn inflation and global instability.
According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. employers added 64,000 jobs in November. But, the unemployment rate increased to 4.6% last month, which is the highest it’s been in four years. 
Earlier this month, the agency reported the median weekly earnings of U.S. workers increased 4.2% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier.
“That means we’re seeing the fastest private sector wage growth that we have seen in this country in many, many years, and we’re doing it by having a president and an administration that believes in you and fights for you,” Vance said.
But the report included revisions charting a loss of 105,000 jobs in October, largely reflecting the termination of tens of thousands of government workers who accepted a deferred resignation package offered as part of the administration’s effort to reduce the federal workforce. The report’s revisions also showed net losses of 108,000 jobs in September and 26,000 in August.
The event Tuesday had the same message and branding — “Lower Costs, Larger Paychecks” — as when Trump spoke a week earlier and 60 miles away at a casino in the Poconos. 
During a question and answer session with reporters, Vance responded to a Vanity Fair interview published Tuesday in which Trump Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said Vance has been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.”
“Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,” Vance said, citing as examples that he believes it was wrong to mask young children during the COVID-19 pandemic and, without offering evidence, that Democrats and the media covered up “the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job.”
In September 2024, Vance repeated false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating cats and dogs and later said, “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do.”

The rally also included remarks by two of the GOP’s top Pennsylvania candidates in the 2026 election: U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District), who is running for reelection in a competitive district, and Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who plans to challenge popular Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro.
Garrity’s mention of Shapiro drew boos from the crowd of about 500 people. She criticized the governor, who is considered a 2028 presidential candidate, for having his sights set more “on Pennsylvania Avenue than Pennsylvania families.”
“Rather than working with the Trump-Vance administration, Josh Shapiro is fighting them,” Garrity said.
Speaking at a Harrisburg firehouse Tuesday, Shapiro responded to Vance’s remarks painting a rosy picture of the economy by saying that the vice president is out of touch with what Pennsylvanians are feeling. He said Vance was afraid to tell the truth because “it’ll upset his boss.”
“So, instead, he came to Pennsylvania and lied like his boss did when he was in northeastern Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting the cost of supermarket essentials has increased during the first year of the Trump administration.
Trump’s tariffs on imports have led to retaliatory taxes that closed markets to American farmers and increased the prices of materials such as fertilizer.
“I think we can understand the president’s tariffs as a failed policy. A failed policy. All he has proven is that he knows how to raise prices on the American people. We are worse off because of Donald Trump’s and J.D. Vance’s economic policies,” Shapiro said, 
Shapiro noted the vice president spoke a few miles from the Allentown Mack Trucks plant where the commercial vehicle builder laid off between 250 and 350 workers last spring, blaming economic uncertainty due to Trump’s tariffs. 
Asked by a reporter how long it might take before consumers experience lower costs, Vance repeated a claim that Biden era inflation was equivalent to $3,000 taken from the pockets of every American. 
“It’s going to take a little bit of time where they really feel like that money’s been put back in their pocket. That just takes a lot of time. It’s a lot of work,” Vance said.
Vance responded to a question about health care costs and the effort to extend tax credits in the Affordable Care Act. Some Republican lawmakers, especially those in battleground districts where Democrats hope to take back seats next year including Mackenzie, have pushed for inclusion of the extension in bipartisan healthcare reform bills. 
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said Tuesday he will not allow a floor vote this week on a bipartisan amendment that would extend the tax credits.
Vance noted the Trump administration has negotiated lower costs for some high-priced pharmaceuticals but said health care reform is up to Congress.

“We’re working with Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, to come up with a solution,” Vance said. “The Obamacare system was broken. Donald J Trump wants to fix it, but Congress has got to step up here.”
Polling released Tuesday shows Trump’s approval rating at 39%, near the lowest during his second term. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, only 33% of respondents said they approved of Trump’s handling of the economy.
Vance said he’s not concerned that continued worry about affordability will translate to vulnerability for Republicans in the midterm election. 
“I believe the American people are going to reward us, because the American people are smart,” he said. “They know Rome wasn’t built in a day. They know what Joe Biden broke is not going to get fixed in a week.”

Gov. Greg Gianforte on Tuesday requested President Donald Trump issue a presidential major disaster declaration due to flooding in northwestern Montana, saying “immediate federal assistance is essential.”
The governor’s request is for Lincoln and Sanders counties and the Blackfeet Nation.
Rain and warm temperatures in a system that started Dec. 8 led to widespread flooding in Lincoln and Sanders counties, Gianforte wrote in a letter to Trump.
“These extreme conditions led to infrastructure damage, including the failure of the Lower Flower Creek Dam, threatening water distribution for the City of Libby and prompting immediate emergency response actions,” Gianforte said in the letter, requesting help from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Montana’s U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke also signed onto a letter to Trump urging him to approve the request for an emergency declaration.
In a social media post, the Lincoln County Health Department said a significant cold front is expected to hit western Montana on Tuesday night and Wednesday, with rain and potentially damaging winds, including wind gusts of up to 100 mph in the mountains.
It said Libby schools would be closed Wednesday.
In his letter, the governor highlighted the known impacts of the disaster on Montana communities as well as potential issues in the future.
“This severe storm event has not only compromised critical infrastructure but has also placed the health and safety of the affected population at serious risk. Immediate federal assistance is essential to stabilize the situation, support recovery efforts, and prevent further harm to the community,” the governor wrote.
The letter noted the availability of sustainable drinking water as a critical need, and it said 4,000 residents are served by the Libby water system, challenged from the floods despite a temporary solution.
It said a concern about elevated levels of metals in reservoir water being collected for treatment is compounding the water crisis, samples have been submitted for analysis, and a plan for water distribution is already underway.
“The scale and urgency of the situation have exceeded the City of Libby and State of Montana’s capacity to respond effectively,” the letter said.
Specifically, the letter requested engineering support for the dam to prevent catastrophic failure or loss of the reservoir; assistance to ensure safe, reliable potable water; and financial assistance to offset the costs of the emergency.
“Continued federal assistance will be necessary to ensure a sustainable drinking water delivery system for the city of Libby while a permanent repair to the dam is developed and implemented,” the letter said.
The letter also outlined the work already taking place, including contractors implementing flood-fighting measures, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation conducting dam monitoring and emergency repairs, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers offering technical assistance.
In advance of the cold front, the Lincoln County Health Department advised people to secure loose items on their lawns, including holiday ornaments, prepare for power outages, check on elderly neighbors and people with disabilities, and plan to hunker down and avoid unnecessary travel. It reminded people to keep their pets inside and ensure livestock have shelter.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos09-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 19:57:24.054792

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Testimony from federal agents continued into the second day of Milwaukee Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan’s federal trial, where Dugan faces charges of obstructing immigration officers and concealing a man they were trying to arrest outside her courtroom in April. Prosecutors repeatedly asked agents about Dugan’s tone when she spoke with them, which they described as upset, angry, direct and stern. A colleague of Dugan’s, Judge Kristela Cervera, who was with Dugan when she confronted agents in the hallway outside her courtroom, also testified that Dugan’s demeanor during the encounter made her uncomfortable.
On Tuesday, FBI agent Jeffrey Baker testified about his encounter with Dugan as part of the six-man arrest team that entered the Milwaukee County Courthouse in April in search of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican-born man who was in the country without legal authorization.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
During Baker’s testimony, details emerged about a woman the agents encountered in the hallway whom they believed was a public defender and who noticed them and began taking  pictures of the agents before Dugan arrived and spoke with them. Images of a Signal Chat used by the arrest team which had been named the “Frozen Water Group,” a reference to ICE, revealed that agents texted that the woman had “been around for more than one of these before.” Another message stated “she was talking sh*t about us with another attorney about how we are not very covert.” 
The prior arrests the agents were referring to had occurred at the courthouse from late March to early April, fueling concern among Milwaukee County judges about how to ensure the courthouse remained a safe and orderly place to conduct business. Testimony and text messages suggest that the prior arrests had all been made by the same team Dugan spoke with on April 18. 
Defense attorneys highlighted the agent’s choice of profile images for the “Frozen Water Group” chat. One agent had chosen an image of a skull over a pill bottle crossed by two syringes with a thin blue line flag in the background. Brian Ayers, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, who said that this was his account in the Signal chat, testified Tuesday that the logo belonged to the DEA opioid task force. Another showed a man licking the barrel of a handgun. Ayers testified that he followed Flores-Ruiz down the hall, and rode the elevator down with him and his lawyer without revealing that he was a federal agent. 
FBI agents Phillip Jackling, Customs and Border Protection agent Joseph Zurao, and ICE deportation officer Joseph Vasconcellos, who were all part of that Signal chat, described Dugan coming out to ask whether they were there to attend court hearings, and pointing them down the hall to Chief Judge Carl Ashley’s office. Jackling described Dugan as “very direct, and she seemed upset,” and said that leaving the rest of the arrest team in the hall “caused me to have a little bit of uncertainty about what was going to happen next.” Zurao said that Dugan told the agents to “get out” or “leave”. 
Vasconcellos said that he was unnerved by the attorney photographing them, and that because he’d been stabbed, shot, and suffered nerve damage in his neck over the course of  his career, he had concerns that their plan to use the courthouse as a “safe place” to arrest people had gone south. “I was honestly concerned that we had had our pictures taken and the staff knew who we were,” Vasconcellos testified. He’d texted in the group chat, speaking of the public defender photographing them, “this is going to be a pain in the d-ck.”

Vasconcellos described Dugan as “very stern and upset,” and said when Dugan told them to leave the hall and go to Ashley’s office, “I told her no.” Vasconcellos eventually went into the chief judge’s office, where he and other agents waited to get connected to Ashley over the phone. Ashley discussed the courthouse draft policy governing immigration enforcement in and around the building at length with the agents. When Vasconcellos left Ashley’s office, the rest of the arrest team had already followed Flores-Ruiz outside and arrested him. 
Vasconcellos testified that he was aware that judges could speak  sternly and that he was not familiar with Dugan and didn’t know if that tone was normal for her. Defense attorneys highlighted that only DEA Special Agent Ayers told FBI investigators that he heard Dugan yelling at the team, something none of the other task force agents described in their testimony. Ayers also refuted testimony from Zuaro, who claimed to have told Ayers to “get your ass out in the hallway in case he comes out,” an assertion that was not  documented in reports and interviews conducted by investigators. Nile Hendrix-Whitmore, a victim witness advocate with the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office, also testified that she did not hear any yelling or arguing when Dugan spoke with the agents. 
Judge testifies about discomfort with Dugan
Later in the day, Judge Cervera took the stand. Cervera recalled that she had a busy schedule on April 18, and had arrived to court early to begin working on her cases. She’d left the building to move her car and as she walked back she ran into Dugan who was presumably doing the same. Not long after she arrived back to her courtroom, Cervera testified that Dugan came in and beckoned her over. “I thought something bad had happened,” said Cervera. “It was embarrassing to be summoned in that way.”
Cervera testified that Dugan gave the impression that  “it was urgent” and that Dugan “seemed irritated.” When Cervera began to remove her robes, she testified that Dugan told her to keep them on, which she did because Dugan was a more senior judge. “I didn’t want to walk into the hallway with my robe,” Cervera testified, though she said she didn’t tell Dugan that she was uncomfortable. 
When the two approached the agents and Dugan asked whether they had a judicial warrant, Cervera said that “her irritation seemed to progress into anger.” Cervera said that Dugan was “expressing her views to the officer” and that she thought Dugan “could have been a little more diplomatic.” Nevertheless, Cervera testified that the interaction was “pretty straightforward and quick,” and that she had her own questions about the kind of warrant the agents had. Dugan told them that a judicial warrant signed by a judge, not an administrative warrant signed by an ICE officer, would be needed, Cervera testified.
Cervera escorted the agents to Ashley’s office and recalled looking back and not seeing Dugan follow them. “I felt abandoned,” she said on the stand. “I thought she left me.” As Cervera looked over the warrant herself, she noticed other agents coming into the hall leading to the chief judge’s office. When Cervera took a short cut through Dugan’s court to get back to her own room, Cervera noticed that Dugan was hearing cases. “I was irritated at that point,” she said, repeating that she felt “abandoned” by her fellow judge. 
Bits and pieces of what happened then made it to Cervera, including Flores-Ruiz being arrested outside, and attorneys pumping their fists telling her, “You go, Judge,” and saying, “Judge, you’re ‘goated’ now,” a reference to the term “Greatest Of All Time.” Cervera testified that one attorney, the same who took pictures of agents in the hall, told her, “We knew what you guys were trying to do.” The next day, she heard that the FBI would be getting involved. “I was shocked” and “mortified,” she testified. “Judges shouldn’t be helping defendants avoid arrest.”
Sometime after April 18, Cervera recalled running into Dugan in an elevator. “I didn’t want to run into her at this point,” Cervera testified. Dugan allegedly told Cervera that she was “in the dog house with Carl,” referring to the chief judge. “She seemed eager to tell me about what happened on Friday,” Cervera said. 
Defense attorneys questioned Cervera about whether she knew ICE agents were waiting outside her courtroom as well, which she denied. When she got home on April 18, she Googled Vasconcellos’ name, and warned her sister — who is also an attorney who had cases with clients at the Milwaukee courthouse coming up — that ICE was more active in the building. Defense attorneys noted that when she was called to a grand jury, Cervera did not reveal that she had warned her sister about the federal operations. 
Cervera said on the stand that she was talking to her sister about what appeared to be “sweeping arrests” happening around the country, and that she’d never heard of ICE arrests at the courthouse prior to March. Multiple members of the arrest team testified that they had only been transferred to ICE Emergency Removal Operations (ERO) duties in early 2025, after President Donald Trump took office.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Controversial academic standards for social studies are unenforceable because Oklahoma’s top school board violated state open meeting laws when approving them, the state Supreme Court decided Tuesday.
Five of the Court’s nine justices decided to permanently nullify the social studies standards, which had sought to require public schools to teach Bible stories and highly questioned claims about the 2020 presidential election and COVID-19. The standards were already on hold because of a temporary stay from the Court in September.
Members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the public didn’t receive adequate notice from a meeting agenda that the board’s Feb. 27 vote would involve standards that were “fundamentally different” from an earlier draft, according to the opinion written by Justice James E. Edmondson. This violated the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act, the Court decided.
Half of the state board members who voted on the standards later said they were unaware at the time of the vote that new content had been added to the final version. The board members received meeting materials only 17 hours in advance, which the Court deemed another violation of state law.
Neither State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who led the standards’ development, nor any Oklahoma State Department of Education staff acknowledged during the Feb. 27 meeting they had added new content. Walters’ administration didn’t publicly post the updated version of the standards until weeks after the board vote.

Among the last-minute changes were the inclusion of language casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election and a disputed claim that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab.
The fact that the state Legislature permitted the social studies standards to take effect despite the controversy doesn’t cure the Open Meeting Act violation, the Court decided.
Social studies standards approved in 2019 will remain in effect while the state Education Department develops a new version, under the Court’s order.
New state Superintendent Lindel Fields already has announced his administration intends to rewrite the social studies standards. Fields was appointed to finish Walters’ term after the former state superintendent resigned early from office to lead a conservative nonprofit.
Fields’ administration did not immediately return a request for comment on the ruling Tuesday evening.
The Supreme Court made its decision in response to a lawsuit filed on behalf of 33 Oklahoma plaintiffs. The Court declined to rule on the plaintiffs’ claims that the standards would violate students’ constitutional religious freedoms and the Administrative Procedures Act.
The plaintiffs include parents, teachers and faith leaders living in the state. Attorneys from the national organization Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the local Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice are representing them.
“This is a victory for transparency, fairness, and the constitutional rights of all Oklahomans,” Oklahoma Appleseed legal director Brent Rowland said in a statement. “The authority to govern comes with accountability for making decisions in the full view of the people the government serves. Public school classrooms may not be used to endorse religious doctrine — no matter what the religion is or how many people follow it.”
Justices James R. Winchester, Douglas L. Combs, Noma Gurich and Richard Darby concurred with Edmondson’s opinion. 
Chief Justice Dustin P. Rowe and Justice M. John Kane dissented. It should require fact finding by a trial court, not a ruling from the Supreme Court, to determine whether a willful violation of the Open Meeting Act took place, they contended.
Vice Chief Justice Dana Kuehn and Justice Travis Jett recused.
Two judges from the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals, Thomas E. Prince and Timothy Downing, also wrote separate dissenting opinions.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-17 00:36:20+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Tax ballot questions emerging as Beacon Hill boogeyman,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/tax-ballot-questions-emerging-as-beacon-hill-boogeyman/,House budget chief takes aim at ‘irresponsible’ proposal to slash income tax rate,"STATE FINANCES are treading water, and there’s growing fear on Beacon Hill that voters could soon yank Massachusetts below the surface.
The annual fiscal check-up that state budget-writers convened Tuesday featured the same calls for caution and warnings about a volatile environment that have dominated conversations for the past year-plus. But this time around, the 2026 election also emerged as a point of concern.
That’s because influential business groups are pushing a pair of ballot questions that would trim the state’s income tax rate by one-fifth and make it much more likely for the state to owe refunds to taxpayers.
If the proposals earn a spot on the ballot and secure enough support from voters, they could carve billions of dollars out of the revenue foundations on which lawmakers have built their quickly growing spending plans.
House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz went out of his way at Tuesday’s hearing to lament the potential impacts, warning that they could compound the already-potent stress of federal funding cuts and a wobbly economy.
“Given these realities and the funding priorities that Massachusetts needs to realize in order to continue to be a top-tier state, now is not the time for irresponsible ballot questions,” Michlewitz said during his opening remarks. “These questions would only benefit high-end earners and would require either dramatic spending cuts or other tax increases in order to maintain the Commonwealth’s fiscal stability.”
Michlewitz did not explicitly identify which of the dozen prospective questions are giving him agita, but he almost certainly was referencing the two backed by the Massachusetts High Technology Council, the Pioneer Institute, and the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, which together launched a group called the Massachusetts Opportunity Alliance.
One of the coalition’s questions would gradually reduce the state’s income tax rate from 5 percent to 4 percent, and the other would overhaul the voter-approved cap on allowable state tax collections, forcing more frequent returns of tax dollars.
Proponents say the measures could reduce the burden on Bay Staters, who face a notoriously steep cost of living.
“People who leave Massachusetts cite high costs, and taxes are the top of that list,” Mass. High-Tech Council president Chris Anderson said last month.
But tax relief always requires a tradeoff by the state.
Kazim Ozyurt, the chief economist in the Department of Revenue, said Tuesday that cutting the income tax rate by a percentage point would be “really costly,” forecasting it could trim $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion in annual revenue once fully implemented.
The impacts could hit immediately, too. The measure would lower the rate over a three-year period starting in tax year 2027 — just a few weeks after the election and halfway through a state budget cycle.
Evan Horowitz, executive director of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University, estimated the state could face a loss of $800 million to $1 billion in tax revenue in fiscal year 2027 if the measure passes.
Horowitz told lawmakers cutting the income tax rate to 4 percent could have “a bigger effect than even a prolonged recession.”
With campaign season already underway, Michlewitz’s comments quickly drew a rebuke from Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy.
“The only thing ‘irresponsible’ here is Beacon Hill’s addiction to overspending,” said Kennealy, who worked as housing and economic development secretary for former governor Charlie Baker.
It’s not just the tax-related proposals that could upend government finances. Horowitz argued that a ballot question seeking to cap rent increases at no more than inflation in many apartments across the state “could really shake the real estate market and upend local tax systems.”
“The potential impact on municipal finance of the rent control ballot question is large and underappreciated as yet,” he said.
Even without accounting for massive mid-cycle changes to state tax policy, economic experts on Tuesday described the Massachusetts fiscal outlook as unsteady. The words “slow” and “sluggish” were deployed multiple times each in describing the state’s economy, and several speakers pointed out that job growth over the past two years is essentially flat.
Still, some speakers counterbalanced that with a glass-half-full outlook.
“I think of when we were here back in April, and there were a lot of concerns that we were going to have to downgrade revenues in [fiscal year] ‘26 by billions of dollars,” said Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation president Doug Howgate. “Slow and sluggish growth — right now, it could be worse.”
Revenue Commissioner Geoffrey Snyder forecast that state tax collections this fiscal year will land anywhere from $155 million below the “benchmark” forecast to $563 million above the benchmark. In fiscal 2027, which starts July 1, Snyder projected tax collections will grow 1.2 percent to 3.1 percent over the current year.
Some of that growth is tempered by the effects of the federal reconciliation megalaw, whose combined tax code changes are set to cost Massachusetts $664 million in fiscal 2026 and another $282 million in fiscal 2027, according to Snyder.
Robust collections from the voter-approved surtax on wealthy earners have managed to soften a lot of strain in recent years, but Snyder warned the boom might soon begin to ebb.
The revenue department expects another massive surplus of unallocated surtax revenue by the end of this fiscal year. Next year, Snyder cautioned, surtax collections will fall off from the updated fiscal 2026 forecast, with a slight decline or a more than 10 percent plunge both possible.
He pitched the more pessimistic outlook as a level-headed approach after a stretch of robust market performance, which drove up capital gains that make up an outsize share of surtax revenue.
“We’re going to need everything to be firing the right way to see [that performance] again in ‘27,” Snyder said.
Tuesday’s hearing, jointly led by the two Ways and Means Committee chairs and Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz, represents a routine step toward development of the next state budget. The trio will use information shared to develop a “consensus revenue” forecast for fiscal 2027 in the coming weeks, and then Gov. Maura Healey must file her spending proposal for that cycle by January 28, 2026.
State leaders in the past couple of years have already scrounged under most of the metaphorical couch cushions to find spare change, including by diverting funds intended to mitigate the impact of casinos.
They’ve largely resisted calls from activists to dip into the record $8.6 billion in the state’s long-term savings account, a maneuver that Howgate cautioned would not be “a good use” of the reserves. 
“It’s a tool that’s best used for temporary shocks that we don’t see coming, that we think we need to stabilize in a short period of time and then get to the other side,” he said of the rainy-day fund. “It is not an effective tool to backfill permanent federal policy changes [or] to prop up levels of overall spending that aren’t supported by ongoing revenues. Doing so is simply going to create a bigger budget challenge, whether it’s in ‘27 or ‘28 or going forward.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-17_Michlewitz_Rodrigues_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 19:57:24.054792

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)With the Affordable Care Act subsidies on the chopping block in the Republican-controlled Congress, it’s no surprise the Lee newspapers did an interview with Montana’s former senator Max Baucus.  As the chairman of the Senate’s powerful Finance Committee, Baucus “was chief architect of the Affordable Care Act known as “Obamacare.”
According to Baucus: “For 15 months, I had the committee work on health care, and it was totally nonpolitical. I had several rules. One is if anybody gets political, I’m cutting them off at the knees. We’re trying to address something here, honestly. Second, if anybody has a problem, they’ve got to bring a solution. Third, nothing is off the table. We’re going to consider everything.”
It’s not unusual for politicians to attempt to rewrite history to smooth over the blemishes and polish the successes.  That’s what politicians generally do.  A couple great examples, “the 2020 election was stolen” and on Jan. 6, 2021 the mob that stormed Congress and sent Representatives and Senators fleeing for their lives were merely “tourists.”
To be kind, perhaps at Baucus’ age of 84 some details of the past aren’t quite remembered correctly. And things definitely look different from Washington, D.C., than they do here in Montana.  But the fact is, Baucus’ rendition of history is lacking some very significant details about the formulation of Obamacare, namely what got considered and what did not, and who did the considering.
Many of the Montanans who were actively involved in attempting to provide their input to Baucus have passed on, including Eric Feaver, who was the head of Montana’s largest union at the time and who would certainly dispute Baucus’ claim that “nothing is off the table, we’re going to consider everything” when it came to formulating the legislation.
The fact is Feaver, and the union he led as well as unions nationwide and thousands of Montanans, did not support Baucus’ plan to stick the insurance industry squarely between patients and their health care providers.  What they did support wholeheartedly was a single-payer system – which did not include the rapacious health insurance industry and assured citizens they would be covered for their treatments by a single public system without ever-rising premiums, co-pays and out-of-pocket costs.  Baucus, however, said single payer was “off the table.”
Make no mistake, Feaver, his union members, and hundreds of Montanans didn’t just send emails or phone calls to Baucus’ office, they demonstrated all over the state, gave speeches, and marched en masse to his Helena office to protest his plan and support single payer —not just once, but many times, including once when the large crowd arrived to find the doors to Baucus’ Helena office locked in mid-day presumably because Baucus didn’t want to hear what they had to say.
In the meantime, back in D.C., Baucus had hired Liz Fowler, a former insurance industry executive, as his chief health counsel on the Finance Committee.  As noted in an interesting interview with Fowler, she admits that President Obama did not support Baucus’ mandate that individuals must purchase health insurance.  Unfortunately, Obama got the same reception we Montanans got — and the bill included the insurance mandate, putting the insurance industry firmly in charge of Americans’ health care.
Were it not for that mandate, the current concern over millions of citizens losing their health coverage because Congress won’t extend the subsidies wouldn’t exist.
Moreover, Democrats controlled majorities in both chambers of Congress and had Obama in the White House.  They didn’t need to appease Republicans and they could have passed real health care, not increasingly expensive health insurance in the misnamed “Affordable Care Act” — which isn’t affordable.

Driving them from classrooms is a moral failure, but also an economic one: It makes the next generation smaller, less educated, and less able to compete in a global economy that depends on talent and drive. We are shooting ourselves in the foot.","RECENTLY, the Boston Globe reported that enrollment in the Chelsea Public Schools is down roughly 350 students from last year, a decrease that school leaders say is driven in part by fear of immigration enforcement and deportation. 
Years of real strides made by the district in improving attendance have been shaken by raids and by the rumors that follow them. Similar patterns are emerging elsewhere in Massachusetts, as immigration fears ripple into classrooms and families keep children home. 
But even alongside this bad news, there is hope. For every policy that pushes families into hiding, there are schools and community programs pulling students toward opportunity. They recognize what immigrant ambition brings to this country. Two Americas are on display at once: one scaring kids away from classrooms, the other investing in their futures. 
What’s at stake doesn’t matter only to places like Chelsea. When raids and deportation fears keep young people out of school, we are not just disrupting individual lives, we are weakening the country’s future.  
These students are tomorrow’s nurses, engineers, teachers, artists, and entrepreneurs. Driving them from classrooms is a moral failure, but also an economic one: It makes the next generation smaller, less educated, and less able to compete in a global economy that depends on talent and drive. We are shooting ourselves in the foot. 
Yet there is resilience. Two Chelsea High seniors, Jasmine and Rochelly (I’m not using their real names), born in the US to Guatemalan and Mexican parents, go to school every day excited about their Early College and AP courses. They have already picked Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Pratt Institute in New York as top choices, and are on track to be the first in their families to attend college. 
In their homes, getting food on the table has sometimes meant standing in bread lines. One family counts on government assistance after the death of the father; the other depends on a brother’s income while the dad drives a taxi. Both families have friends or relatives who have been picked up by ICE. Despite this, Jasmine and Rochelly earn good grades, enjoy school, and are involved in after-school activities, like singing in a church choir. 
They’ve stayed on track with college in their future for two reasons: their own ambition and support from La Vida Scholars, a free college-prep program founded in 2009 and now operating in Lynn and Chelsea. La Vida provides advising, academic support, and hands-on help with college and financial aid applications, and builds a cohort culture where students and families push one another forward.  
Programs like La Vida exist across Massachusetts and the country. What makes the difference is the ambition students bring with them, and the way these programs protect it, give it structure, and keep it alive when life tries to snuff it out.  
That ambition is hard to erase. It can be tested by grief, poverty, instability, even deportation, but it rarely disappears. The very act of migration demands resilience, and families carry that determination with them. Studies of migrants constantly show that they carry more ambition across the border than they find in their new communities. 
What’s happening in Chelsea is not just a local enrollment story. It is a slow civic injury. When families are too afraid to send children to school, raids don’t only remove people; they remove trust, stability, and time. They interrupt learning, derail college plans, and threaten to dash the dreams of students like Jasmine and Rochelly, young, ambitious people who, in every generation, have helped make the United States stronger. 
Is it that ambition that scares ICE? No matter how hard they try, they can’t stamp out the impact it has on the rest of us. While America sleeps tonight, Jasmine and Rochelly will be studying for their AP exams with dreams of what colleges await them and the kind of future they can build beyond that.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)New research by the Utah Women & Leadership Project and Utah State University unpacks rising homelessness trends on the state and national levels. It also breaks down how many women are experiencing homelessness in Utah and the factors contributing to their loss of housing. 
While men made up 60% of people experiencing homelessness across the U.S. in 2024, the number of women experiencing homelessness “is quickly growing,” according to the research brief published Tuesday. 
In 2024, 18 of every 10,000 women (up from 13 in 2020) and 28 of every 10,000 men (up from 22 in 2020) experienced homelessness nationally, according to the report. Women experiencing homelessness also rose 19% from 2023 to 2024, compared to 15% for men. 
Utah homelessness rose 18% in 2025, state report says

In Utah, the increase isn’t as dramatic, but more women are becoming homeless compared to past years. From 2023 to 2024, the number of Utah women experiencing homelessness rose from 1,385 to 1,420, roughly a 3% increase, according to the report. 
In 2023, 18% of those women were unsheltered. That figure rose slightly to 18.8% in 2024. 
Both nationally and in Utah, “trends continue to show that homeless services serve more men than women,” the report says. 
In total, 30,578 people accessed homeless services in Utah sometime in 2025, the report says. Of those, women made up nearly 42% (12,823), which was up 2.9% from 39% in 2021. 
Among those women, 27.3% (3,503) were under the age of 18, up from 23% (2,153) in 2021, a 4.3% increase. 
In total, 4,454 women were sheltered and 1,325 were unsheltered in Utah in 2025, according to the report. And 6,478 of these women were in households of adults and children, while 161 were unaccompanied girls. 
The report also detailed possible “influencing factors” that Utah girls and women reported in 2025 as “barriers to securing housing.” Nearly 23% reported mental health disorders, 18.4% reported chronic health conditions, 13.9% reported physical disabilities, 10.2% reported developmental disabilities, 7.6% reported substance use, and 0.5% reported HIV or AIDS.

Additionally, of the women who accessed homeless services this year, 1,103 women (8.6%) had experienced domestic violence, according to the report. Of those, 329 (2.6%) were currently fleeing domestic violence. 
The report also cites Utah’s high housing costs as a key contributor to the state’s rising homeless population. 
“To reduce homelessness in Utah, housing affordability should be made a priority,” the report says. “More state and local resources should be allocated to help Utahns facing high rent and home prices, such as increasing funding for rental assistance and promoting zoning decisions and development approvals that benefit cost-burdened individuals and families.” 
Researchers also called on policymakers to focus “these resources on Utah’s most vulnerable populations and those disproportionately affected by homelessness, such as women, children, seniors, veterans, and racial minorities.” 
“Now is the time to respond to the increasing needs of women and all of the at-risk populations before homelessness issues worsen,” the report says.
While addressing both short- and long-term housing needs, researchers also said “sufficient mental health resources and substance use disorder treatment are also imperative to helping individuals find and keep permanent housing.” 
“Furthermore, state and national efforts must increase to meet the needs of Utahns who are experiencing homelessness at unprecedented rates,” the report says. “Many individuals and families are on the brink of becoming homeless as financial pressures (especially high rent and housing costs) continue to burden them.” 
Efforts to reduce homelessness for “Utah girls, women and families will increase their ability to thrive and will strengthen our communities,” the report said.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The lawyer who has represented the Arkansas Board of Corrections in lawsuits over who controls the state’s prison system still hasn’t been paid despite a judge’s order, the board learned Tuesday.
The board voted to try to pay him during a special-called meeting after facing bureaucratic hurdles. The vote to pay Abtin Mehdizadegan and the law firm where he works was 4-2, with board members Lona McCastlain and Grant Hodges voting no.
The move is the second time in a month the panel has voted to pay the attorney. It owes him $307,193.55, though board member Lee Watson noted Mehdizadegan continues to represent the board and that amount will increase.
The vote was necessary after Department of Corrections staff said they needed the board to specify the method it would like the department to use for the payment.
Mehdizadegan is representing the board in lawsuits centered around two 2023 measures signed by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders that would have given her the authority to hire and fire the head of the corrections department and directors of its divisions. The board sued two years ago, arguing the laws violated the state constitution, and a state judge blocked the laws.
Attorney General Tim Griffin then filed a lawsuit alleging the board violated the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act when it hired Mehdizadegan.
A state circuit judge ordered the firm be paid for its work and barred the state of Arkansas from preventing the payment of the invoices in a court order, after she declared both laws unconstitutional in a summary judgment earlier this year.
Mehdizadegan has been asked for comment.
Board member Lee Watson said that, given the holdup, he wouldn’t blame Mehdizadegan from pursuing a contempt citation “against any and everybody that’s involved in this, that’s not working rapidly to get paid,” adding that he “would have already done so.”
Wade Hodges, the department’s chief of staff, took exception.
“The staff over here has beat their head against the wall trying to figure out how to get this done, and so I take offense to any indications that we should be held in contempt of court,” Hodges said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5355-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-16 19:57:24.054792

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Newly released, enhanced video footage and photos build out the description of suspected Brown University mass shooter: his gait, his pacing, appearance.
But the identity of the man seen pacing the residential neighborhood as early as 10:30 a.m. the day of the shooting remains unknown. Local and federal investigators continue to ask for information, including photo and video evidence, as the search for the person responsible for killing two students and injuring nine people stretches into a fourth day. 
“We’re looking for a moment that is short, shorter than a person taking a breath,” Col. Oscar Perez, Providence Police chief, said during a press conference late Tuesday afternoon. “It’s incredibly hard work to do that and so we’re asking the public to assist with that.”
More than 200 “credible” tips have poured into city and federal tip lines, along with terabytes of video and photo footage from residential properties surrounding the Ivy League campus. Yet there is no video from inside the Barus and Holley engineering building that shows the gunman.
“The only video of that presumed, anticipated, suspected however you want to define it person of interest — you have it,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said Tuesday. 

Nor have investigators been able to trace the person of interest’s movements a few blocks beyond Governor Street, a few blocks east of the engineering building.
“What’s really critical first, is that we identify who the person is,” Neronha said. “Once we identify who the person is, I believe we’ll be able to locate them. It’s very hard to hide in this country.”
Neronha continued, “Once we’ve identified him, we’ll know more information about where he’s from, and who his friends are, and where he might have gone.” 
The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward to anyone with information that leads to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible. 
Casing the area
Besides a rough description of a 5-foot-8, stocky man wearing various shades of dark clothing, a satchel strapped across his body in some of the video segments, officials were reluctant to comment on any more facets of his identity, including an age, motive or connection to the university. 
Perez said he appears to be casing the area in preparation for the shooting, noting it was a common practice among criminals who take days, sometimes weeks, to ready themselves before committing a crime.
Even the behavior exhibited in the video, strolling down the sidewalk, then later standing with hands clasped behind his back, looking out the street, was not enough to draw firm conclusions from, said Ted Docks, special agent in charge for the FBI’s Boston field office.
“To get into the mind of an individual that would commit such a heinous act, that’s a place I don’t want to go right now,” Docks said. 
Perez said the mid-morning walk Saturday suggests the suspect was casing the neighborhood, familiarizing himself with the setting in preparation for the crime.










What’s really critical first, is that we identify who the person is. Once we identify who the person is, I believe we’ll be able to locate them. It’s very hard to hide in this country.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


Several reporters asked questions about student and faculty pages that have allegedly been taken down since the shooting, along with conflicting reports that the gunman shouted something before opening fire.
But Perez and Christina Paxson, Brown University president, denied any knowledge of university pages being scrubbed. The words spoken, if any, remain unknown, Perez said.
The ever-outspoken Neronha again jumped in with another word of caution.
“It’s easy to jump from words that were spoken to what those words are, to a name that reflects a motive, targeting a particular person,” he said. “That’s a really dangerous road to go down.”
Investigators already ran into one dead end after detaining a person found at a Coventry hotel early Sunday morning, only to release him less than 24 hours later because there was no evidence tying him to the crime. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley described the initial, incorrect suspect as a “setback” in an interview with the Boston Globe’s Rhode Island Report podcast released Monday.
Neronha, however, said Tuesday that while disappointing, it was not unusual for investigations to generate multiple leads that don’t always result in an arrest. Investigators continue to canvass the East Side neighborhood around the scene of the shooting Tuesday in search of additional clues, but the search may expand beyond the neighborhood, or the city limits, in the coming days, Neronha said.
Providence police are also working with law enforcement across the state, and in Massachusetts and Connecticut, Perez said.



Report a tip
Anyone with information regarding the Brown University shooting can submit an anonymous tip by phone to the FBI at 1 (800) 225-5324 or the Providence Police Department at (401) 272-3121. 
Information, including photo and video evidence, can also be submitted online via the FBI website. 



As the flowers and memorials amass outside the engineering building, the campus is slowly emptying of students headed home for winter break. Yet the university remains committed to helping restore a sense of safety, with 60 security officers stationed throughout the campus Tuesday, Paxson said.
Across the city, police officers have increased their patrols in neighborhoods and elementary and secondary schools as a community struggles to return to normal. Smiley recounted a visit to a city elementary school earlier Tuesday morning, where he joined teachers holding a meeting before the students arrived.
One teacher told him, “It’s hard, but I’m putting on a good face for the kids. We need to be there for them,” Smiley recalled.
A stark contrast: the joyful second-grade student Smiley watched skipping to the front door “because he’s a second-grader and he doesn’t know everything that’s going on in this scary world right now.”
Seven victims, still unidentified publicly, remain in treatment at Rhode Island Hospital, one of whom remains in critical status. Two others were released.
Officials do not expect to provide additional updates Tuesday night.

(Photo by Zoe Schacht/Colorado Newsline)Though legal experts say President Donald Trump’s pardon for Tina Peters carries no legal weight, her lawyers have invoked it to launch new efforts to secure her release from a Colorado prison.
These include a visit to the prison and a letter to Andre Stancil, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections. But one of her lawyers, John Case, disavows a threat among some of her supporters to break Peters out of prison.
Peters, the 70-year-old former Mesa County clerk, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury for her role in a security breach of her own election equipment that was part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. A judge in October 2024 sentenced her to nine years in prison.
Case visited La Vista Correctional Facility on Friday, the day her legal team obtained a copy of the pardon, Case said.

“At the doorway were three armed corrections officers wearing camos instead of the usual dark blue uniform. And I hadn’t seen these gentlemen before,” Case said during an interview with Newsline.
He presented the pardon and asked for Peters’ immediate release. A person who identified herself to Case as Melissa Smith, deputy executive director of operations of the Department of Corrections, came out and read to him from a typewritten statement, Case said.
“The gist of it was that Colorado, the prison, is not going to release Tina Peters because President Trump’s pardon is not valid,” Case said.
Smith then asked him to leave.
Case said he assumes the group of men in camouflage “has something to do with Tina.”
“She told me that there’s a detail of four of them that accompany her wherever she goes,” he said.
Newsline asked the Department of Corrections and the office of Gov. Jared Polis for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.
Trump has repeatedly demanded that Colorado officials release Peters, threatening “harsh measures” if they refuse. On Friday Trump released a signed pardon for Peters for “those offenses she has or may have committed or taken part in related to election integrity and security.”
Presidential pardons have universally been understood to apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes.
“One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,” Phil Weiser, Colorado’s Democratic attorney general, said in a statement earlier this month, adding the pardon “will not hold up.”
Peters’ legal team, while acknowledging that the validity of a pardon for state crimes has never come up in an American court, argues that the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole, and that Trump has the right to pardon Peters since in making copies of election system data she was performing a required federal duty.
There is no credible evidence that the 2020 election results were compromised or that Peters’ prosecution, which was led by a Republican district attorney, was flawed.
State officials have rebuffed other efforts by the Trump administration to free Peters from state prison. In recent weeks they refused to relinquish Peters to the administration after the Federal Bureau of Prisons requested that the state transfer Peters to federal custody.
Case blasted messages on social media in which supporters of Peters say they’ll break her out if the state does not release her by Jan. 31.
“US MARSHALS & JANUARY 6ERS PATRIOTS WILL BE STORMING IN TO FREE TINA!!” one post says.
“Some really irresponsible people have been posting on social media that there’s going to be a violent attempt to remove Tina from prison, and Tina and her legal team condemn this message,” Case said. “Tina has never advocated violence and never been guilty of violence, so this is just completely irresponsible.”
Peter Ticktin, a Florida-based attorney who also represents Peters, has said the Trump administration could be justified in deploying military units to free Peters if Colorado is found to be violating federal law. 
In an email to Stancil, Case said the prison’s refusal to release Peters on Friday was “categorically unlawful.”
Peters has appealed her conviction, and the pardon might have bearing on her case before the Colorado Court of Appeals, Ticktin told Newsline last week. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Jan. 14.

A new structure for the LSU System was unveiled last week and approved by its Board of Supervisors. It calls for making LSU’s medical schools in Shreveport and New Orleans, the Pennington Biomedical Research Center and the LSU AgCenter part of its main campus, creating a singular university that can immediately shoot higher in rankings for research spending. 
This reconfiguration is the next step toward achieving LSU’s goal of becoming a top 50 public research university and joining the prestigious Association of American Universities. But to get that boost, the medical schools and research institutions have to give up their autonomous leadership. Their current leaders have been demoted, and none were consulted on the change. 
Pennington Executive Director John Kirwan has since announced he would step down from his position and join the faculty. When asked if Kirwan’s step down was related to the restructuring, Pennington spokesman Ernie Ballard said Kirwan’s contract is expiring, and he was told it would not be renewed.

The move to demote the chancellors was met with sharp rebukes from two state lawmakers representing Shreveport. Republican Sen. Thomas Pressly and Democratic Sen. Sam Jenkins, believe the change violates state law. They issued a joint news release earlier this week stating their shared viewpoint. 
Pressly referenced decisions lawmakers made in 2000 to provide independence to LSU’s medical schools.
“(T)he Legislature clearly said that decisions about the future direction of the Health Sciences Center in Shreveport should be made here in Shreveport,” Pressly said. “Instead of reclassifying leadership in the pursuit of higher rankings, we should be discussing bringing more research, students, and resources to this campus.”
“With such a community-driven purpose driving this institution, we expect the university’s leadership to engage with both stakeholders and the public before undertaking massive changes and restructuring to ensure that everyone remains focused on the mission,” Jenkins said. 
LSU president, chancellor can earn millions in incentives 

LSU General Counsel Trey Jones said he doesn’t believe legislation is necessary to combine the campuses, though he said it might require some wording changes in various statutes. 
Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, who represents LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans, could not be reached for comment before publication.
LSU Faculty Senate President Dan Tirone, who chairs the LSU Council of Faculty Advisors, which is meant to advise the system president and the Board of Supervisors, said he had not been consulted on any of the restructuring changes. 
“I would hope that as we get to things that end up more at a campus-level operation, as opposed to sort of system-level operation, that there’ll be more communication with the campus faculty,” Tirone said.
When asked about the lack of input on the plan, Woodward said the restructuring discussion has been going on for months. However, specifics on the strategy were unveiled just two days before the board voted on them and had largely not been publicly discussed for a year prior to that.
“As the governing body of the university, the [Board of Supervisors] considers the opinions of all stakeholders but believed that we could no longer delay as we work to elevate the LSU System,” Woodward said. 
LSU President Wade Rousse and Chancellor Jim Dalton did not respond to a request for comment on this report. LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard left after last week’s board meeting after committing to take questions from reporters. He has not made himself available for questions since then. 
How we got here
Though details of the restructuring plan were unveiled last week, the idea to consolidate LSU System institutions to jump in research rankings was first floated in early 2024. Then-President William Tate unveiled a strategy that had been in the works since shortly after he became president in 2021. 
Tate’s plan envisioned LSU as a “statewide university” that would combine the entire system, which is made up of six distinct universities, into a singular research engine. The current plan does not include LSU’s campuses in Shreveport, Alexandria and Eunice. 
In 2023, when LSU spent $384 million on research, it was 83rd in the National Science Foundation’s national rankings. That rating included the main campus, LSU Ag Center and Pennington Biomedical Research Center, all based in Baton Rouge. By comparison, the 50th-ranked institution, the University of Colorado’s Anschutz medical campus, spent $686 million. 
Adding the two medical schools boosts LSU to $488 million, raising it to 69th place. Moving higher would require much more spending on research, which has been more difficult as President Donald Trump’s administration has slowed down federal grants for higher education. 
From the beginning, LSU’s proposal drew criticism. 
Pressly questioned Tate in March 2024 about the plan at an unrelated legislative hearing, raising concerns it could lead to a loss of autonomy for the campuses. 
Tate assured him that was not part of the plan. 
Somewhere along the way, the plan changed. For over a year after that hearing, there was little talk or movement on creating a statewide university. 
Tate resigned from his position in June of this year to accept the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Since then, observers have questioned LSU’s commitment to a vision of a president no longer in charge, appointed by board members who have largely been replaced. 
Louisiana Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson named community college system president 

Throughout his interview process with LSU, Rousse, who was selected as Tate’s successor Nov. 4, questioned whether pursuing membership in the Association of American Universities should be a priority for the institution or its faculty, though he later walked back his skepticism. 
Rousse has since been awarded a contract through which he can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars for meeting certain research funding and association membership benchmarks. 
After he was hired, Rousse announced LSU would unveil its new system structure within 30 days. Changes to bylaws that authorized the restructure included some that LSU board members were not involved in crafting. 
Supervisor James Williams, a former board chairman, pushed back on a change that gave Rousse, as system president, sole authority to fire and hire top administrators, a power that previously resided with the board. In response, Rousse agreed to amend the bylaws to say the president should consult the board before firing anybody. 
A rapid timeline for such a significant shift in governance, especially with so little input, is unusual. 
The University of Louisiana System Board of Supervisors recently announced its intention to restructure its system. But unlike the LSU System, UL will undertake a months-long process that includes town halls at each of its eight campuses and a website for public input on the restructuring plan.

Push for faculty productivity
The restructuring plan is not the first time LSU has rankled its faculty in its quest for association membership. 
Last year, LSU administrators informed librarians across the system their campuses would not hire any more tenure-track librarians. Those who are on the tenure track or have attained tenure were given one year to decide if they want to maintain their status, which would require them to have their research published more often.
The change was made to boost the average number of citations per tenured faculty member, another Association of American Universities membership criteria. 
LSU lags significantly behind association members in citations, with its organizations being cited an average of 208 times per faculty member over five years. LSU’s average count over the same period was 82, according to a report from LSU’s Office of Data and Strategic Analysis. 
Woodward, LSU’s spokesman, did not respond when asked if librarians at universities that will not be folded into the main campus can regain their tenure. 
In addition to boosting citations and research spending, LSU faculty will also have to nearly double the number of books they publish annually to catch up with Association of American Universities institutions and triple the average number of awards, fellowships and academic organization memberships per faculty member.
What about UNO?
Though the University of New Orleans is in process of transferring to the LSU System from the University of Louisiana System, it will not be folded into the main campus. 
“Incorporating UNO into the LSU System is a substantial undertaking with far-reaching implications,” Woodward said. “Dr. Rousse has been adamant that the incorporation of UNO will not pull resources from other campuses — and he, as President, will ensure the transition is done in a fiscally responsible way that protects the system, while providing UNO with a clear mission and 
Like LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, UNO has “Research 2” status from the Carnegie Classifications of Institutes, meaning it has high levels of research activity and doctoral degree production. 
Adding these figures into LSU’s would be an additional boost for attaining membership in the American Association of Universities and move the restructured school six spots higher in National Science Foundation rankings.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-20-23_LSU_MP-17-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 18:58:28.359223

On Dec. 11, a day after Gov. Tate Reeves commuted the sentence of Marcus Taylor, the attorney general’s office asked the Court of Appeals to vacate its Nov. 18 opinion and dismiss Taylor’s post-conviction appeal, arguing clemency rendered them moot.
Taylor was convicted in 2015 for a drug sale charge that was meant to have a five-year maximum sentence. Instead, he received 15 years. 
The 43-year-old father of two was released from prison last week, according to his attorney, Joe Hemleben. 
On Tuesday, Hemleben said the court’s decision could create a path to relief for those in prison serving illegal sentences, even while there is a time limit to filing post-conviction relief claims. 
In court filings opposing the attorney general’s motion, he argued that dismissing Taylor’s case would have left Reeves’ clemency order without legal basis. Reeves cited the appeals court decision in granting Taylor’s clemency.
“The State’s motion effectively asks this Court to subordinate the Judicial Branch to post-decision action by the Executive Branch,” the response in opposition states. “That position is incompatible with fundamental separation-of-powers principles. Executive clemency does not divest the judiciary of its authority to decide cases, issue opinions, or preserve precedent.” 
A dismissal could have also prevented Taylor from being able to seek compensation for his wrongful sentencing, his attorney argued. 
The attorney general’s office has 14 days to file an appeal of the Tuesday decision with the Mississippi Supreme Court.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10095411/RenderedImage.jpeg,,,2025-12-16 18:58:28.359223

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado co-led a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the Trump administration over its halting of two federal grant programs that support electric vehicle infrastructure in several states. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation suspended two five-year programs Congress passed in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2022 without notice or congressional approval, according to the lawsuit. The department has refused to commit new funds from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program since the spring, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office. 
Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, led the lawsuit alongside California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, asks a judge to declare the administration’s actions unlawful and reinstate the funding.

“The USDOT appears to have implemented a de facto freeze of charging and fueling infrastructure funds, in violation of Congress’s directive to fund this program,” Weiser said in a statement. “This is not necessarily a new tactic, and the courts have stopped similar efforts by this administration to freeze funds while conducting vague policy reviews.”
Funding previously committed to Colorado has not been distributed and has put certain projects at risk, according to Weiser’s office. That includes just under $9 million awarded to Colorado State University to install public hydrogen fueling stations near CSU campuses along Interstate 25. 
Weiser joined a lawsuit in May challenging the administration’s move to freeze electric vehicle infrastructure funding from a different program. A judge blocked the freeze in June. 
The latest lawsuit is the 47th Colorado has filed against the second Trump administration. Weiser said his legal actions against the administration have secured over $1 billion dollars for Colorado. 
“I wish we lived in a world where the president was following the law, but we’re not,” Weiser said in a press conference Tuesday. “This president seems to act as if he thinks he’s above the law. He’s not. That’s why we have to file this lawsuit.”

,DC,2025-12-16 23:44:27+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate Democrats warn of fallout from Trump Education Department transfers,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-democrats-warn-fallout-trump-education-department-transfers,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday blasted ongoing efforts from President Donald Trump’s administration to dismantle the Department of Education, including plans to shift several of its responsibilities to other Cabinet-level agencies.  Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono hosted a forum on the issue with several Democratic colleagues. The lawmakers, joined by education leaders, advocates and leading labor union voices, said the restructuring would lead to a loss of expertise, create more bureaucracy and weaken support for students and families. The administration announced six agreements in November with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State as part of a larger effort from the administration to dismantle the 46-year-old Education Department. Trump has sought to axe the agency in his quest to send education “back to the states” and tapped Education Secretary Linda McMahon to fulfill that mission. Much of the funding and oversight of schools already occurs at the state and local levels.Losing expertiseSen. Elizabeth Warren slammed the transfers as “illegal” because of federal laws assigning specific responsibilities to the Education Department.“Congress already passed the laws on this,” she said. “Every one of the programs that’s moving out of the Department of Education specifically says we have allocated the money for a program in the Department of Education, not in whatever random other place Secretary McMahon decides to put it.” The Massachusetts Democrat said that if the transfers go through, “we’ve got now four federal agencies that have no experience with education suddenly in charge of more than 50 different educational programs, including ones that fund literacy, education for veterans, kids in rural school districts — you name it, it’s moving somewhere else.” Even before the announcements of interagency agreements, the Education Department had seen several changes since Trump took office, including layoffs of hundreds of employees that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July could temporarily proceed.In a late Tuesday statement to States Newsroom, department spokesperson Madi Biedermann said the transfers were part of a wider effort to initiate a sorely needed overhaul of the federal education bureaucracy.“The opposition is protecting a system that produces dismal results for our students,” she said. “The Trump Administration demands better than the status quo.”‘Nothing but chaos’Under one of the agreements, the Education Department said the Labor Department would take on a “greater role” in administering elementary and secondary education programs currently managed under the Education Department’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. Rachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education Department workers, said “nobody wins, the least of all, students and educators,” when the Labor Department takes on massive education programs, noting the current workforce at Education has the right experience.“Our staff have decades of experience with the complicated programs we’re talking about today,” Gittleman said. “These moves will cause nothing but chaos and harm for the people they’re intended to help.” In general, the agreements “swap a highly efficient system for a chaotic, underfunded one spread across multiple agencies,” Gittleman said.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, also rebuked the administration’s efforts to gut the agency.“What is happening here is not simply the dismantlement of the Department of Education,” she said. “It is taking away — it is abandoning the federal role in education.” Weingarten, who leads one of the largest teachers unions in the country, added that “we should be, as a nation, expanding the federal role in public education, not supplanting states.” Rhode Island commissioner condemns Brown shootingAngélica Infante-Green, Rhode Island’s commissioner of elementary and secondary education, said the administration’s attempts to gut the agency are “already putting our nation’s education system and our students at a disadvantage.”Communication from the Department of Education “lacks detail,” she added.“We get these one or two sentences with edicts that often conflict with state and federal law. What do we do? The chaos has resulted in protracted legal battles across the country, raising serious constitutional questions,” she said. At the top of her remarks, Infante-Green also expressed her condolences for the victims, their families and the entire Brown University community after two students were killed and nine others were injured in a shooting on campus over the weekend.",,,,2025-12-16 18:58:28.359223

Andy Beshear delivers his 2025 State of the Commonwealth speech to a joint session of the House and Senate on Jan. 8, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)FRANKFORT — The committee of economists that forecasts state government revenues slightly upgraded its outlook on Tuesday, but still anticipates a revenue shortfall this fiscal year and only modest revenue growth through the middle of 2028.
The committee, called the Consensus Forecasting Group, officially predicted that Kentucky’s General Fund will take in $15.5 billion for the fiscal year that ends June 30, 2026.
That’s down a bit from actual revenues of $15.7 billion taken in by the General Fund in the fiscal year that ended on June 30. But it’s about $150 million more than the Consensus Forecasting Group predicted three months ago in a preliminary forecast for the current fiscal year. Also Tuesday, the group predicted sluggish revenue growth for the next two fiscal years — 2.5% in 2026-27 to about $15.9 billion and then 2.2% in 2027-28 to about $16.2 billion.
Tuesday’s forecast will be the foundation upon which the 2026 Kentucky General Assembly will build Kentucky’s budget covering the two-year period beginning July 1, 2026 and ending June 30, 2028.
Gov. Andy Beshear, whose concerns about downward revenue trends caused him to ask for the preliminary forecast in September, released a statement later Tuesday saying he will announce a plan for dealing with the shortfall later this week.
“After a strong couple of months for our Kentucky economy, the Consensus Forecasting Group has reduced the commonwealth’s projected revenue shortfall from $305 million to $156 million,” Beshear said. “Kentucky law still requires a budget reduction, which I will announce this Thursday during our Team Kentucky Update at 12 noon ET. Overall, we will be able to manage the shortfall and still provide necessary services to Kentuckians.”

But Sen. Chris McDaniel, a Ryland Heights Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee, had a different take on Tuesday’s forecast. “What’s clear is that this forecast appears far less severe than what the governor projected in September. His earlier outlook was extremely pessimistic and today’s data suggests a more measured and realistic picture of Kentucky’s fiscal position.”
The Kentucky House’s majority Republican leadership office did not respond to a request by the Lantern for a comment.
Tuesday’s forecast comes as the impact of soaring revenues for nearly all states triggered by Covid-era stimulus spending by the federal government continues to fade. (Annual revenue growth for the Kentucky General Fund was 10.9% in 2021 and 14.6% in 2022.) Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly responded to the windfall in part by reducing the state’s income tax rate, a priority for Republican lawmakers. It also socked away savings into Kentucky’s Budget Reserve Trust Fund, more commonly known as the “rainy day” fund.
The rainy day fund is expected to have a balance of about $3.1 billion at the end of this fiscal year. Beshear could propose to cover the entire $156 million shortfall with money from the rainy day fund, or he could decide it’s more prudent to order immediate spending cuts to meet the shortfall.
Jason Bailey, executive director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy said, “While the forecast is a little better, the outlook is not good. … Overall the outlook is poor because of the impact of big cuts to the income tax rate, plus a weakening of the economy.”
The Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, a progressive group headquartered in Berea, has opposed the income tax-reduction approach taken by the legislature’s Republican supermajorities.
In 2022 the legislature enacted a low that allows lawmakers to reduce Kentucky’s income tax rate by one-half of a percentage point per year — but only during years when the state’s fiscal condition is healthy enough to withstand the rate cut. The goal of that law is to eventually reduce the Kentucky income tax rate — which was 5% in 2022 — to zero.
Tht law allows for a reduction in the rate by one-half of one percentage point if two conditions are met at the end of a fiscal year. First, the balance in the rainy day fund must be at least 10% of General Fund revenues in that prior year. The second and more difficult condition is that revenue in the just-ended fiscal year would have exceeded spending in that year even had the income tax rate been a full percentage point lower.
Both conditions have been met in some years, most recently at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, which opened the door for the General Assembly early this year to cut the rate down to 3.5%. (That new reduced rate does not take effect until Jan. 1, 2026.)
But the second condition was not met (by the tiniest of margins: $7.5 million) when the 2025 fiscal year ended this summer, according to the Office of State Budget Director. Nonetheless, some Republican lawmakers, particularly on the House side, have indicated they may push for a tax cut by the 2026 legislature.
Bailey said a further tax cut would be disastrous for Kentucky’s ability to fund public schools and all other state government programs. In addition to low revenue growth predicted Tuesday, he said Kentucky’s 2026-28 budget will need to fund new obligations to pay for hefty administrative costs shifted by the federal government to states, especially for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

This story by by Cassandra Hemenway and Carla Occaso was first published in The Bridge on Dec. 16.
Following several nights of below-zero temperatures and the death of a man who had been sleeping outside in minus-17-degree-Fahrenheit weather in Barre, those without shelter will have a warm bed when it dips below 10 degrees in Montpelier. Montpelier City Council members voted unanimously on Dec. 10 to commit up to $20,000 toward minor upgrades to the city hall basement so it can be used as an extreme weather emergency winter shelter this year. 
This shelter is activated only when the temperatures are below 10 degrees and is not available every night.
A new organization, the Montpelier Emergency Cold Weather Shelter (Montpelier Cold), a registered nonprofit with the state of Vermont, requested the use of the space from the city, noting in a memo to the council that the organization would staff the shelter, with 15 beds available. The organization formed out of a group of local churches that have provided such shelter in the past.

“The Montpelier Cold Board of Directors (who are all residents of Montpelier) believe that the first priority of city government is to maximize the safety and well-being of its residents — all of its residents — which includes those without shelter on the coldest nights of the year,” the group wrote in its memo. “In the last week, we have already provided two very cold nights of shelter for 11 people, including a woman in her second trimester of pregnancy, a gentleman with significant chronic medical problems, a woman requiring use of a walker and oxygen concentrator, and a veteran who has lost digits from frostbite in the past. And we know of those who have died as a result of being outside in the cold.”
The group’s memo also noted “In the winter of 2023/24, local churches provided shelter for 14 nights. Last winter’s harsher weather required that we be open 45 nights. While weather predictions are uncertain, we can safely assume that the need remains.” Montpelier Cold also requested the city provide an insurance rider and a staff liaison for the shelter.
Compounding the problem, noted Montpelier Cold Treasurer Nancy Reid (who also serves as board president of The Bridge), is that the nightly emergency shelter that had operated out of the former Elks Club in Montpelier does not exist this winter.

“The biggest program is the nightly shelter that happens between Dec. 1 and the end of March that used to be at the Elks Club is no longer,” Reid told The Bridge. “… It has not been replaced.”
Reid said the Unitarian Church of Montpelier has been providing a cold weather emergency shelter as a temporary measure until the city space is up and running. It does not replace the nightly shelter that had housed up to 25 people in the last few years, however, she said. 
According to reporting in VTDigger, the Office of Economic Opportunity at the Department for Children and Families has recently created a new Extreme Cold Weather Shelter Program, in partnership with Vermont Interfaith Action, to support people experiencing homelessness during periods of extreme cold.
“The program will operate from Dec. 1 to April 1, when temperatures reach at least −10 degrees, with projects in Bennington, Burlington, Newport, Rutland, Barre, Montpelier, and Brattleboro, Lily Sojourner, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, said,” according to the VTDigger story reported by Alice Finno.

Reid noted that a grant from Vermont Interfaith Action for Montpelier Cold to operate the extreme weather shelter originally only paid for those nights when temperatures drop to minus 10 F. She said the group negotiated that temperature guideline to 0 F, but “we’re saying 10 degrees. Period. And we’ll pay for it. Ten degrees is our metric, but we really are only officially paid for zero or below.”
Murphy expressed concerns some people had about using the city hall basement because of past adverse experiences, staff unease, and the required cleanup. Some carpentry/electrical work would need to be done first, said Sustainability and Facilities Coordinator Chris Lumbra. He estimated the cost to be in the “upper teens” of thousands of dollars.
Murphy also said the police station is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and could be used in a life-or-death situation. Reverend Beth Ann Maier (deacon at Christ Church) and others emphasized the urgency, needing space within a week.
After some discussion, the city council voted to make the basement area of city hall fit to be an emergency shelter and allocated up to $20,000. 
An extreme cold weather shelter in Barre is located at the Barre Congregational Church at 35 Church Street in Barre, according to the Department for Children and Families website. 
On Dec. 9, Dan Barlow, executive director of the People’s Health and Wellness Clinic in Barre, wrote about a woman who came into the clinic on Dec. 9, after spending a night in her car in  minus 14 degree weather.
“She arrived half-frozen, tears streaming, barely able to breathe — it sounded like she was dying. It was as painfully real as homelessness can get,” Barlow wrote on his Facebook page. 
Clinic medical staff were able to help the person. Barlow said the woman did not know about the Barre Congregational Church shelter. The incident occurred the same night that Richard Govea, 51, was found dead after sleeping outdoors in the 400 block of North Main Street, according to WCAX.
Barlow ended his post with a plea: “If you know of resources — warming shelters, clothes, winter-ready housing, community connections — please share. And if you’re able to help, please do. These warming shelters are staffed by volunteers. Because for one woman today, your kindness might have meant the difference between life and death.”

(Photo: U.S. Forest Service) Three environmental organizations have dropped a lawsuit challenging proposed logging in North Carolina’s Pisgah National Forest after the federal government canceled the project.
Forest Service crews began a salvage logging project near Poplar, North Carolina without undergoing necessary permitting processes. The work violated federal law and the agency’s own Nantahala-Pisgah Forest Plan, plaintiffs claimed.
Prior to carrying out projects like this one, federal law requires the Forest Service to notify the public and to study environmental impacts.
The Center for Biological Diversity, Southern Environmental Law Center and MountainTrue filed a lawsuit last month in the Western District of North Carolina to stop the logging, arguing it would harm wildlife and damage the ecosystem.
The proposed project was to take place in a designated North Carolina Natural Heritage Natural Area containing rare plants and sitting above the Nolichucky River — a popular whitewater rafting destination.
Days after the lawsuit was filed, the U.S. Forest Service cancelled the project and removed logging equipment from the site, leading the groups to withdraw their legal challenge, according to an announcement Monday.
“One of the country’s wildest gorges was spared additional harm because local communities spoke up,” said Will Harlan, Southeast director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “They saved an exceptional forest, imperiled wildlife, and a world-class river.”
Sam Evans, leader of SELC’s National Forests and Parks program, said North Carolina’s forests are full of natural wonders that support local economies and are sources of “immense” pride for neighboring communities.
“Public notice, transparency, and accountability are the absolute bare minimum of what the Forest Service owes our communities before it opens these forests for logging,” Evans said. “As long as the Forest Service refuses to do even that bare minimum, we are going to continue to haul them into court.”
Harlan called the decision a major victory for both the wildlife species who live in the Pisgah and humans who cherish the forest.
Despite the outcome, environmentalists cautioned against similar situations in the future due to the current political climate. Harlan emphasized unity to protect forests and waterways amid mounting pressure on public lands.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March directing federal administrators to immediately increase logging in national forests.
“Unfortunately, wild places will continue to be targeted by this administration, so we’ll continue standing shoulder to shoulder with communities to protect our beloved forests and rivers,” Harlan said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said operations concluded because crews lost access to the site, not because of the now-withdrawn lawsuit. The crews relied on a temporary bridge over the Nolichucky River installed for railroad recovery, which was required to be removed by Nov. 17.
The project targeted an estimated 40 to 50 tons of dead or dying trees per acre, which created significant fuel loads on steep slopes near an active railroad and adjacent communities, the spokesperson said in a statement. 
“Throughout the litigation, the plaintiffs repeatedly characterized work at Annie’s Cove as commercial logging, without acknowledging that the project was part of post-Hurricane Helene salvage operations to remove hazardous trees killed, damaged or destabilized by the storm. The project did not target healthy timber,” the statement read.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Nantahala-Forest.jpg,,,2025-12-17 10:58:39.751982

(Photo: U.S. Forest Service) Three environmental organizations have dropped a lawsuit challenging proposed logging in North Carolina’s Pisgah National Forest after the federal government canceled the project.
Forest Service crews began a salvage logging project near Poplar, North Carolina without undergoing necessary permitting processes. The work violated federal law and the agency’s own Nantahala-Pisgah Forest Plan, plaintiffs claimed.
Prior to carrying out projects like this one, federal law requires the Forest Service to notify the public and to study environmental impacts.
The Center for Biological Diversity, Southern Environmental Law Center and MountainTrue filed a lawsuit last month in the Western District of North Carolina to stop the logging, arguing it would harm wildlife and damage the ecosystem.

(Photo courtesy of WSDOT)Parts of U.S. 2, an important road cutting across Washington’s Cascade mountains, will likely remain closed for months due to flood and slide damage, Gov. Bob Ferguson and the state’s top transportation official said Tuesday.
A 49-mile stretch of the highway between Skykomish and Leavenworth has been shut down since last week, blocking travel over Stevens Pass. It’s one of the most significant road outages the state is dealing with after days of heavy rain and widespread flooding.
Ferguson described the road as “severely damaged” and said it’s very difficult to know how long repairs will take. “We anticipate that Highway 2 will be closed for months,” he said.
“We’re going to do everything we possibly can to repair it as quickly as possible,” he added.
Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith said areas along the highway are washed out to the point where the road is no longer there.
“We will need to rebuild those sections,” she said. 
A bridge near milepost 54, Meredith said, is covered in several feet of debris, with active landslides still happening nearby.
Meredith said there is no estimated time for when the highway could reopen and that it’s too soon to know whether it might be possible to open some segments earlier. 
Ferguson said he pushed in a recent meeting to see if the highway could be repaired faster, then saw photos of the damage. 
“It’s a very volatile situation,” he said.
Other major roads were also badly damaged during the past week.
In Naches, about 200 feet of U.S. 12 was swept away by the Naches River. There is a local detour around that closure. The state transportation department is hoping to have this part of U.S. 12 reopened in the next few weeks, Meredith said.

A section of State Route 410, between Enumclaw and Greenwater, also washed out. The road reopened Tuesday afternoon for one-lane, alternating traffic.
Meredith said the road in this area is still actively eroding and that it is not clear how long repairs to State Route 410 could take.
Tuesday saw the state’s first report of a fatality tied to the flood event. A man in Snohomish County died after he drove around road closure signs and into a ditch with about 6 feet of water.
The transportation department has reopened 60 roads that had closed due to the flood event, according to Meredith. She thanked the National Guard for providing aerial images of damaged routes, including U.S. 2.
“It’s important to remember that these roads could close again with the more rain and the continuing landslide risk that we have coming,” Meredith said. “We’re not out of the woods yet.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-2-debris-slide-December-2025-floods.jpg,,,2025-12-16 18:58:28.359223

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A week after its initial pitch, the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) won approval Tuesday morning from the State Properties Committee to purchase a former psychiatric treatment facility for youth which closed in August 2024 after a year embroiled in controversy. 
Under the purchase and sale agreement approved Tuesday, the tentative purchase price for the former St. Mary’s Home for Children in North Providence is $760,848, roughly equivalent to the money needed for the nonprofit St. Mary’s to conclude its legal existence, a process known as dissolution. On Dec. 10, DCYF first presented its detailed plans to purchase the campus to renovate and reopen as a 16-bed psychiatric facility for teenage girls.
“The state is expected to deposit, by wire, that amount to the seller’s escrow tomorrow,” summarized committee member Rebecca Webber near the meeting’s conclusion.
Lisa Martinelli, the executive legal counsel for DCYF’s parent agency, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, reaffirmed that amount, which she said “is good until March 31, 2026” and represents the current projected cost St. Mary’s needs to dissolve.
The agreement allowed for the state to pay up to $1.5 million.
The acquisition is not the only bill DCYF will need to pay. Separate from the purchase price are renovation and environmental remediation costs needed for the approximately 8.7 acre-Fruit Hill Avenue campus.
As part of its acquisition, DCYF agrees to continue offering the services formerly rendered by St. Mary’s — specifically, a level of care which meets the federal standard for a psychiatric residential treatment facility (PRTF), a longer-term, Medicaid-payable form of residential care which sits just below hospitalization in terms of intensity. Since St. Mary’s closed in August 2024, Rhode Island has had no PRTFs, which means some youths are sent out of state for long-term residential care.
DCYF looks to buy St. Mary’s Home for Children at a discount but costly upgrades needed

DCYF’s new project already has $10 million budgeted for fiscal year 2026, Dane Kwiatkowski of the Division of Capital Asset Management & Maintenance told the Properties Committee. While that will cover the purchase, the state will likely need an additional $15 million to $20 million for the renovations, plus $1 million to $5 million for environmental work.
“The total project costs are not captured within the budget, hence the DCYF capital request for those funds,” Kwiatkowski said. 
The environmental work will need to address soil contamination found in several spots on the campus, including a former fruit orchard, where prior testing found elevated lead, arsenic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the ground. 
“Obviously, the safety and care of our kids is paramount, so you’ll certainly oversee and make sure that those things are being done accordingly,” DCYF Director Ashley Deckert told the committee. 
Webber noted before the committee’s two-part vote that DCYF will need to put in a capital request to the General Assembly to secure the extra funds.
Four committee members — Robert Donovan, Melissa Horne, Rachel Rebello and Webber — voted “yes” on both a purchase and sale agreement and a warranty deed. Webber filled in as chair for Marco Schiappa, the post’s regular occupant, who was absent. Non-voting member Wilder Arboleta, who represents the treasurer’s office, was also present at Tuesday’s meeting.
Rebello, who sits on the panel as a designee of Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office, said before the vote that she would endorse the deal, partly because “there is no facility of this type” in Rhode Island.

The accelerated timeline was less ideal, Rebello offered: “I want to note that this is a very significant and complex item, and that moving forward, items of this type be provided to the committee with a bit more lead time, so we can also have enough time to go through and see the diligence that the agency have done and the parties putting this transaction together.” 
As Horne, also an attorney, pointed out during Tuesday’s discussion, the purchase and sale agreement includes a provision for liquidated damages, or a preset penalty if the deal isn’t approved in time. The agreement bundles in $120,000 worth of liquidated damages if State Properties did not approve the deal’s execution by Wednesday, Horne noted. 
Stephen Del Sesto, an attorney representing the St. Mary’s Board of Directors, sat in the audience Tuesday and answered questions. He said that $120,000 equates to about four months’ worth of carrying costs before the nonprofit St. Mary’s dissolves. 
“St. Mary’s had to pay to get that building going, and that’s just a way to basically hit the reset button for them so that they can market and won’t run out of cash before the building is sold,” Del Sesto said. 
The contract permits St. Mary’s to draw funds from the state’s escrow deposit to cover these carrying costs — which often comprise expenses like things utilities or insurance — through closing.
Del Sesto also confirmed that if the dissolution costs less than $760,848, the remaining balance goes to the state. The purchase and sale agreement shows that if the final dissolution costs go up, the state will need to pay the remaining balance.
The deed itself has no restrictions, or legal parameters for how the state can use the land. The state’s obligations are instead nested inside the purchase and sale agreement, which dictates that the state must continue St. Mary’s mission by offering the same or similar services. 
Should the state sell the property later on, any resulting funds would still be earmarked for residential treatment for youth, “so long as the sale proceeds…are exclusively used to acquire and develop another property or properties in the State,” according to the contract. 
The purchase and sale agreement set a 90-day inspection period which started on Sept. 11 and allowed the state to walk away from the transaction if it found the campus truly unsuitable.  
Kwiatkowski added that the testing the state performed was helpful in predicting remediation costs down the line, and that a “supplemental site survey” also found some asbestos in some of the old buildings.   
“There was sort of a limited hazmat survey that was done just because of the fact that we don’t want to do destructive testing and sampling at this stage,” Kwiatkowski said.

Charitable contributions could benefit the state
Before St. Mary’s can legally dissolve for good, it needs to evacuate its two major assets: the North Providence land, and leftover charitable contributions it has received over the years.  
Central to the selloff of both assets is that the campus’ new landlord and the leftover gifts are used in ways aligned with the donors’ original intentions.  
“They’re not necessarily related ultimately,” Martinelli said, but the charitable contributions may end up benefiting the state also.
The charitable contributions they “were donated to St Mary’s with the mission that these assets be utilized for a specific purpose,” Martinelli said — specifically, “youth residential treatment at St Mary’s.”
“So a different way of looking at it is that’s kind of a bonus amount of money that the state may now be eligible to receive in furtherance of running a residential treatment facility for youth,” Martinelli said.
When committee member Horne, an attorney by trade, asked why the purchase and sale agreement had no hard date for the dissolution, Del Sesto explained from the audience that the final date “is going to depend largely on the charitable assets and whether or not the Attorney General’s office is comfortable with the transfer of those assets to the state.”  
The Attorney General will need to approve the transfer of the charitable assets to the state, the process of which falls under the cy-prés doctrine, which directs charitable funds to the most closely comparable recipient when the original recipient no longer exists or can’t use them. If the state cannot meet the contributions’ original intentions — which might differ slightly from donor to donor — DCYF would need to petition the AG and Rhode Island Superior Court to find an alternative recipient.   
“We’ve tried to make it so that it’s easier, so that the state can utilize the charitable assets, but that ultimately is determination that needs to go before the Attorney General, and if they believe it necessary, then the court under a cy-prés petition,” Del Sesto said.

Dec. 16, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAs local governments across the state unveil new data center projects, Michigan residents have grown increasingly concerned on how these developments will impact their community, demanding additional protections and transparency in how they are developed, if not a full stop to the effort entirely. 
Tech companies are pouring billions into building up data centers across the country to fuel the development of artificial intelligence, and a sales and use tax break for data centers approved by the Legislature in 2024 has courted more of these facilities to come set up shop.
On Tuesday, a few hundred people from across the state gathered outside the Michigan Capitol to speak out against the proliferation of data center projects, while elected officials called for better protections for the communities targeted for development, a rollback of the tax incentives drawing them to the state, and an end to political contributions from Michigan’s regulated energy companies.
Data centers house information technology equipment including servers, storage systems, networking equipment and other hardware for storing and distributing data. However, these facilities demand large amounts of energy to keep them running and large amounts of water to cool the equipment, prompting push back from environmental organizations and residents concerned about whether their energy rates will increase or their wells will run dry.

While residents in some communities have managed to secure at least a temporary pause on the development of some projects, efforts like ChatGPT creator Open AI and tech giant Oracle’s stargate project in Saline Township continue to move forward despite resistance from local officials and residents.
As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?

The Saline Township project was top of mind at Tuesday’s rally, as DTE Energy, one of the largest energy companies in the state, pushes for state energy regulators to move forward and approve its contracts to supply 1.4 gigawatts to the facility. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has criticized the company for pursuing ex parte approval of its contracts with the Michigan Public Service Commission, which would allow the effort to move forward without additional parties intervening to present evidence, offer testimony and conduct legal discovery on the deal.
While DTE maintains the project will not bring higher costs to its customers, and that its decision to apply for ex parte approval is proper procedure under these circumstances, Nessel argued in her request for a contested case matter that the company fails to support its arguments that customers will not be on the hook for higher costs later on.
“In these contested cases, we have witnesses. We have experts. People are cross examined, and the public gets to know. We deserve that right, don’t we?” Nessel said, while addressing the crowd at the rally “But now here, in the biggest case in the history of the state involving these two giant billionaire tech AI companies, they don’t want us to know anything about it.They just want us to accept their word, DTE’s word, that this is not going to impact our rates.”
She held up a poster board containing sections from the contracts made available to the public, which have been heavily redacted. 
“We just want to know what the hell is going on and what that’s going to mean for the people of our state,” Nessel said. “The Michigan Public Service Commission is there to protect all of us, not just to protect these regulated monopolies, not just to protect the AI billionaires, but to protect us, all of us, people of the state of Michigan, and I don’t think that’s too much to ask for.”

The commission is slated to meet Thursday, though it’s unclear whether the regulatory body will address DTE’s contracts, as meeting agendas are not typically shared until the day prior.
Kathryn Haushalter, a Saline Township resident who lives near the proposed site for the data center, filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit between the Saline Township Board and the owners and developers of the site, prompted by the board’s decision to vote against rezoning the land.
The board later voted to settle the case, despite intense opposition to the project from Saline Township residents.
“If an idea’s so great, AI is so great, so beneficial to our community, you don’t have to sue your way in,” Haushalter said. “You don’t have to force it.”

Rep. Jim DeSana (R-Carleton) also took the podium to discuss a package of bills he’d introduced alongside state Reps. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) and Erin Byrnes (D-Dearborn), to eliminate the tax breaks the legislature had approved just a year earlier. 
“The flood of these data centers came in shortly after we passed the bill giving them the sales tax breaks.” DeSana said. “Corporate welfare should end in the state of Michigan now.” 
Wegela emphasized that these concerns cut across both sides of the aisle, endorsing efforts to keep Michigan’s energy companies from donating to politicians. 
During a press conference on Wednesday, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) showed some interest in the legislation, noting that he had voted against the sales and use tax exemption.
“I’m open to that,” Hall told reporters. “I voted against [the incentives] because I didn’t think data centers were the industry that we should be trying to attract. I actually think a lot of data centers would locate here without the incentive. But when we gave them the sales and use tax cut, that’s incentivizing it, now they’re all coming at once and it’s overwhelming people.”

Alongside concerns about environmental harms and the lack of transparency around data center projects throughout the state, several speakers called for attendees to give their support to the Michiganders for Money Out of Politics ballot initiative, which would bar regulated monopoly companies and government contractors from making political contributions, arguing these companies are using their resources to bring about favorable political outcomes.
“The monopoly utilities in Lansing have the best representation that their money can buy, while we the people who are supposed to be represented by our state elected officials are literally and metaphorically left out in the cold,” said Sean McBrearty, the Michigan State director for Clean Water Action.
Energy companies have a vested interest in supporting these projects due to their high demand for energy, McBrearty argued, calling on residents of all political persuasions to sign their petition to have the issue placed on the 2026 ballot.

ICE arrested more than 1,800 people in New Mexico in the first 10 months of 2025, according to new data. (Douglas Rissing/Getty Images)New data shows Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested more than 1,800 immigrants in New Mexico in the first 10 months of 2025, more than 12 times as many as the same period last year.
The Deportation Data Project, a team of academics and researchers, compiled national ICE arrest data from records they received from the agency via public records requests between Sept. 1, 2023 and Oct. 15, 2025. That period covers the final year of President Joe Biden’s term, as well as Trump’s inauguration and approval of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July, a bill that greatly increased ICE’s funding.
According to the researchers, ICE reported arresting 128 people in New Mexico by Oct. 15 of 2024. In comparison, ICE reported 1,853 arrests in New Mexico during that period this year.
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

The number of daily arrests started rising after Trump’s inauguration earlier this year and exploded after July, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. 
The increase in the number of arrests here is among the nation’s highest, according to a Stateline analysis, which found the largest year-over-year increases in New Mexico, Virginia, Oregon and Idaho, along with the District of Columbia.
Zoe Bowman, managing attorney for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said the numbers Source presented to her were “shocking,” but also plausible given what her organization has seen over the last year. 
“It completely maps the complete shift in the type of calls and the volume of calls that we’ve been responding to of local folks who are getting picked up by ICE,” she said.
While the data offers new insight into the magnitude of often-secretive ICE operations in the state, it also raises numerous questions, including about the manner and location of the arrests. For example, more than half of the arrest locations ICE provided for 2025 arrests say “EPC general area – non specific,” a potential reference to the El Paso Processing Center, as well hundreds of other arrests that occurred in “general areas” in Las Cruces and Albuquerque. 
ICE reported about 400 of the arrests this year as “non-custodial” or “located,” which researchers say often refers to ICE arrests that take place in public, like outside a home or workplace. 
The immigrants ICE arrested this year in New Mexico hailed from 28 different countries, including for the first time people from Turkey, Nepal, India, Saudi Arabia and China. The vast majority of those arrested were from Mexico and Guatemala, according to the data.
Resentment against Albuquerque ‘deliveristas’ may have sparked viral Walmart ICE arrest

And the data shows that a greater share of the arrestees this year had no criminal convictions than in past years, which is true across the country. In 2025 in New Mexico, a little under half of arrestees had criminal convictions, compared with roughly 60% in 2024, according to the data.
As of Oct. 15 of this year, 27% of those arrested had pending criminal charges, and about 25% had never been charged with a crime.  
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source New Mexico’s questions about the data. 
Graeme Blair, a professor and researcher at the Deportation Data Project, told Source New Mexico in an email that the data likely also undercounts the total number of arrests in New Mexico. That’s because 15% of all ICE records the researchers received had no state-level data. Also, he said it would not capture arrests of New Mexico residents that occur outside the state. 
That means a potentially huge undercount, Bowman said, because ICE arrests many of her clients in El Paso after regular immigration court appearances. 
She also said the new data reflects a broader change in the profile of  ICE arrestees who seek her legal help. Her caseload last year was mostly recently arrived asylum seekers. These days, her clients have lived in New Mexico for a decade or longer and had families and jobs until ICE arrested them, people who were “living and working and participating in community life in the state and around the country,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICEGettyImages-2208112423-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 18:58:28.359223

More than 5 feet of snow currently blanket Vermont’s tallest peak — the deepest powder in recorded history for Mount Mansfield on this date.
The Mount Mansfield snow stake hit 63 inches Thursday, said Burlington-based National Weather Service meteorologist Adrianna Kremer, more than 3 feet deeper than the average 22-inch depth expected this time of year. As of Tuesday, the snow depth at the stake was 61 inches, falling 2 inches due to compaction, Kremer added. 
“We do have such a good snow pack early in the season,” Kremer said. “But, as always, there’s a lot of variability as the season goes on.”
Vermont has seen significant snowfall so far this winter, with over 3 feet recorded in November in some areas of the northern Green Mountains, Kremer said. 
With 192 inches of overall snowfall Tuesday, Jay Peak has been graced with the most snow of any ski mountain in the U.S. so far this season, surpassing West Coast ski resorts in powder.
Northern Vermont ski resorts Smuggler’s Notch and Stowe are also keeping pace, with overall snowfall hitting 116 inches and 108 inches, respectively, as of Tuesday.
But warmer temperatures this Thursday will spur some snow melt. While that may bring modest river rise, Kremer said the service does not expect flooding, as the increase in temperature is predicted to be short-lived and this year’s powdery snow is less dense with liquid. 
Hazardous travel conditions could arrive Friday, though, Kremer warned, as the snap back to colder temperatures brings the potential for a flash freeze and bursts of snow.

An environmental group filed a lawsuit Tuesday against a Vermont dairy farm, alleging that the farm has dumped toxic chemicals into waterways feeding Lake Champlain at levels far exceeding federal and state standards.  
Vorsteveld, LLP, an Addison County milking operation with more than 2,300 cows, was sued by the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group in New England, and the Vermont Natural Resources Council, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting Vermont’s environment, for discharging pollution into tributaries feeding Lake Champlain. 
The lawsuit claims that numerous pipes on the Vorsteveld farm pour pesticides into tributaries like Dead Creek without a permit to do so. Testing showed some toxic chemicals exceeded state and federal safety standards, some as much as 50 times higher.

“What we’re asking them to do is apply for a federal Clean Water Act permit which would cover the 11 outflows shown to be spewing alarming levels of pesticides into water that people recreate in,” Elena Mihaly, attorney and vice president at the Conservation Law Foundation said on Tuesday afternoon. 
The lawsuit came at the end of a 60-day notice period of an intent to sue filed by the pair of non-profits in October. The plaintiffs met with Vorsteveld’s attorney during that period, but that meeting did not resolve the group’s issues, according to Mihaly. Over the two month period the Vorsteveld’s did not provide any evidence that their dumping practices had changed, Mihaly said. 
“We know farmers deeply care about the impact they have on the community,” Mihaly said. “This is a situation where there are subsurface drainage outfalls not being monitored by the farm, and this is an opportunity to change course once presented with the evidence.” 
Under federal law, farms are allowed to send runoff into local waterways if the farm is monitored under a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation, or CAFO, permit under the Clean Water Act. The Vorstevelds are defined as a large CAFO, or one housing 700 or more mature dairy cows for more than 45 days.

Adopting such a permit could require the farm to measure contaminants that are coming out of their pipes. The farm could then implement best management practices like better design of their subsurface drains, better crop selection or better pesticide application across their fields.
The lawsuit comes on the heels of Vermont’s own violations of the Clean Water Act. Last summer, the Environmental Protection Agency determined the state had failed to properly administer the federal rule on its agricultural lands after the Conservation Law Foundation, the Vermont Natural Resources Council and the Lake Champlain Committee filed a complaint. 
Now, the Agency of Natural Resources, the state agency that oversees the federal law, has to come into compliance by inspecting farms and issuing permits to protect water quality. As of June, the state had issued zero CAFO permits in the more than 50-year history of the Clean Water Act.
Julie Moore, secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, said her office needed more time to review the allegations against the Vorsteveld farm.

“Specifically, as far as we know, the complaint is the first citizen suit filed in Vermont under the Clean Water Act,” Moore said in a text. She said the suit raised a number of new issues related to the agency’s regulatory jurisdiction.
The Conservation Law Foundation is not monitoring any other farms for similar levels of pollution, Mihaly said. The organization focused on the Vorstevelds because the contamination was so visible from the outfall pipes, she added.
“They jut out directly into Dead Creek, which is a waterway where lots of people are recreating, like fishing and birdwatching,” Mihaly said. “We started taking some samples and seeing the alarmingly high levels of some of the pollutants piqued our interest.” 
Since April 2024, the nonprofits worked with Burlington-based engineering firm VHB to collect 92 water samples from public access points to the Vorsteveld’s pipes; the lawsuit named 16 pesticides the farmers applied to their fields. 
Those included atrazine, an herbicide banned in Europe and linked to birth defects and cancers, was found in concentrations 50 times higher than what the EPA considers safe for drinking water, according to the lawsuit. Clothianidin, a neonicotinoid insecticide that can hurt pollinator populations, was found in 99 percent of samples at concentrations exceeding the EPA’s safety benchmark. 
“No polluter should be allowed to discharge pesticides and other harmful pollution at these excessively high levels,” Lauren Hierl, executive director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, said in a media statement. 
The Vorstevelds could still settle with the environmental groups. The next step is for the farm owners to answer the complaint admitting to or denying the allegations. 
Gerard Vorsteveld, one of three brothers who runs the farm, did not reply to a phone call by the time of publication. 
VTDigger reached out to Vorsteveld attorney Claudine Safar who texted back, “Leave me alone.” The Monaghan Safar law firm did not provide an additional statement.

Patrick Morrisey announces an update on his foster care reform initiatives Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey wants the state to pay for more in-state group homes for foster children with the goal of bringing hundreds of kids home who are currently in out-of-state institutions across the country. 
At a news conference on Tuesday, Morrisey said foster children living out of state was “a terrible problem.”
“We need to bring our kids home,” he said at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia. 
The governor said he’ll request $6 million in state funding for a new fund aimed at renovating current state-owned buildings with the goal of opening beds for foster children who need acute mental and behavioral health services. 
Morrisey wants to nearly eliminate the use of out-of-state placements.
“We’ve talked about the fact that the state has failed a lot of the children that are in the care of the state. To me, that’s unacceptable,” he said.
There are currently 543 children in out-of-state institutions in states including California, Florida, Texas and Utah, according to data from the state Department of Human Services.

West Virginia doesn’t have enough beds in the kinds of facilities that can serve children with acute behavioral or mental health needs. One of the state’s remaining psychiatric facilities for children — a 24/7 treatment facility in Cabell County — recently announced it will close. The lack of in-state options has led to a reliance on out-of-state providers for foster children. 
Last year, the state spent $70 million sending foster children to out-of-state facilities, including some with abuse allegations. The price tag includes the children’s education. 
Republican lawmakers recently proposed the idea of creating the fund aimed at increasing in-state options for foster children, and Morrisey said he’ll work with the Legislature to accomplish the goal.
“Those dollars are going to be used to renovate (and) repair existing state properties by providing high acuity psychiatric, neural, developmental and trauma services for kids in West Virginia,” Morrisey said.
He continued, “We’re trying to think through how we take advantage of the savings that are going to be generated by bringing people home, and use that to continually invest in the facilities repair or renovation.”
Lawmakers heard testimony last week from the leader of Burlington United Methodist Family Services, which operates 82 residential beds for children, group foster homes and more, that DoHS was still struggling to pay providers on time. This has led to some in-state providers being hesitant to open up more beds for higher-needs children. 
In response, DoHS leaders told lawmakers that payments are going out and may be delayed by a week. Additionally, the department is auditing some child welfare providers after finding overpayments to make sure funds are being used appropriately for children. 
Morrisey touts foster care improvements in his first year
Morrisey and Alex Mayer, secretary of DoHS, touted other improvements in the state’s foster care system that serves more than 5,900 children. 
The state has reduced its backlog of referrals to Child Protective Services by over 50%, Morrisey said. 
Mayer, who stepped into his role at the start of the year, has been focused on improving CPS by implementing a statewide practice model to ensure workers’ decisions are consistent and trauma-informed. 
He had already begun that work when a recent federal audit showed that the West Virginia’s CPS workers failed to properly investigate the bulk of child abuse and neglect referrals in a time period spanning from 2023 to 2024. The audit reviewed the handling of child abuse and neglect cases prior to Mayer’s appointment. 
“By examining patterns and data that were previously siloed or underutilized, we can more intentionally identify where foster families are needed, what supports help them succeed, and how to reduce placement disruption before occurs,” Mayer said, adding the state is improving early intervention to prevent kids from coming into foster care. 
The state has seen fewer removals of kids from homes this year, according to Morrisey.
“We need to drop that number a lot more, I think that’s critical,” he said.
Mayer emphasized that the progress didn’t mean the work was finished. 
“The challenges facing children and families and frontline staff have disappeared. What the progress does mean is that we have begun to lay a foundation strong enough to support sustained change,” he said. 
State lawmakers have said they’ll introduce at least 15 other foster care bills — along with the funding for in-state beds — aimed at improving the system, including one that would require CPS workers to wear a body camera while investigating reports of child abuse and neglect. 
When Morrisey was asked if he’d support lawmakers’ child welfare proposals, he replied, “I’ll say this, we’re in the process of finalizing our legislative agenda now, and we look forward to working with the Legislature on a lot of different issues.”
“There’s a lot more work that needs to be done with respect to CPS and foster care, and you should expect a lot of collaboration with the Legislature on that issue,” Morrisey continued. 
The 60-day legislative session begins Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. Morrisey will deliver his second State of the State address that evening.

Bob Ferguson said Tuesday that the state will look to spend $3.5 million on immediate assistance to those affected by the historic flooding of the past week. 
The money is intended as a bridge to help Washingtonians before the state can access federal disaster aid, which could take months. It’ll help pay for things like hotel stays for evacuees, groceries and other short-term needs. It’s unclear how quickly the state dollars will get out the door.
“A lot of folks are working very hard to make sure we’re breaking down any bureaucracy to make those dollars available,” the governor said at a press conference in Seattle on Tuesday. “We’re trying to help folks navigate a really, really challenging time.”
The money comes from emergency funding earmarked for the governor’s office in the state budget. King County is also investing $1.5 million in shelter assistance and debris removal, County Executive Girmay Zahilay said.
It’s too early to put an estimate on the flood damage, though Ferguson said it will be “profound.”
A levee failure on the White River in the south King County city of Pacific led to evacuations early Tuesday. Washington National Guard members were going there to help secure the breach with sandbags. It came a day after another levee failed near Tukwila, prompting orders for residents to leave. That levee, on the Green River, was patched.
“It’s feeling a lot like Groundhog Day,” said state Adjutant General Gent Welsh, who commands the state’s National Guard. “Every morning we wake up, we pull our phones out, and we look to see for some improvement out there, but Mother Nature seems to keep throwing us another curveball.”
One person has been reported dead in the flooding. A man near Snohomish drove past road closure signs and into a ditch with six feet of water, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office. Rescue swimmers got the man, 33, out of the car, but he was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. 
Several highways remain closed, including U.S. 2 between Skykomish and Leavenworth, where washouts and slides have destroyed and damaged parts of the highway. 
The major highway could stay closed for months, Ferguson said. Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith noted the state will have a better sense in the next couple days if stretches of the east-west route can open sooner.
Meanwhile, significant rain and heavy wind are in the forecast for western Washington through at least Wednesday, renewing fears of flooding, but likely not to the level of last week’s inundation. The wind could be dangerous, with saturated soil raising the risk of falling trees.
Ferguson, who’s been in office almost a year, also said he’s working with state House and Senate leadership on a measure the Legislature can pass quickly in its next session to increase immediate state funding assistance in the flooding’s wake. The legislative session begins Jan. 12. 
And Ferguson expects to propose flooding help in his supplemental budget plans, which are due in the next week. 
“For example, you will undoubtedly see in my proposed budget significant investment in infrastructure. That was always the plan,” he said. “It’s fair to say that this disaster has only underscored how important those investments are.”

Federal Emergency Management Agency officials joined Tuesday’s press conference in a King County office building in Seattle, but didn’t speak. FEMA has been helping since President Donald Trump signed off on Ferguson’s request for an emergency declaration to open up immediate assistance. That declaration does not provide direct financial assistance to residents.
FEMA has been partnering in the preliminary damage assessment with state officials.
“They’ve been great partners in this whole thing,” said Robert Ezelle, director of the Military Department’s Emergency Management Division. 
The next step with the feds will be requesting a major disaster declaration to unlock federal funding for individuals, local governments and the state. Ferguson is confident the state will make a “compelling case” for the aid. 
“This natural disaster is undoubtedly one of the most devastating in our state’s history,” he said, noting authorities have conducted over 1,200 rescues across 10 counties.
The state is also working with the U.S. Small Business Administration for a separate declaration to allow access to low-interest loans. The federal agency made these loans available after the bomb cyclone last year, while FEMA denied the state’s request for more expansive aid. 
On the private front, Amazon has announced a $3 million donation to support relief efforts, and Boeing on Tuesday said it was giving $250,000 each to the American Red Cross and the Community Foundation of Snohomish County.
As of October, only about 45,000 homes in Washington had flood insurance, with two-thirds of those through FEMA and the other third being privately insured, said Aaron Van Tuyl, spokesperson for the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner. Flood insurance claims to FEMA are expected to take four to eight weeks, he said.
Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer urged homeowners to take pictures of damage to their flooded homes and make their properties available for insurance inspection as soon as possible. She specifically warned of mold hazards if wet property is allowed to sit.
Some counties, including King, Snohomish and Pierce, have opened up surveys for residents to report damage to help make the case for federal aid.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/flood-damage-december-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 17:57:55.083546

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A group of community leaders from Nebraska’s largest urban area met Tuesday to voice support and seek donations to help with pressing needs of thousands of rural “brothers and sisters” losing jobs as Tyson Foods’ meatpacking plant closes in Lexington.
“We will not be forgetting nor letting our brothers and sisters in a smaller community in Nebraska go through this alone,” said Douglas County Board chair Roger Garcia. 
Noting that he grew up in Columbus, Nebraska, Garcia added: “We knew our neighbors, we helped our neighbors. Regardless of ethnicity or background, we were there for each other. And those are the values that we carry across the entire state.”

Garcia was among a panel of speakers requesting that people donate to the Lexington Community Foundation at lexfoundation.org. Beth Roberts, foundation executive director, attended the media event at Omaha’s Latino Center of the Midlands, and said proceeds would be used to help workers and families with day-to-day needs as they navigate next steps.
About 3,200 Tyson workers who live in the Lexington area of about 11,000 — many of them immigrants and refugees — will lose their jobs when Tyson shutters its longtime beef plant in mid-January. 
Roberts said this is the most challenging time the town has faced and said the relief fund should help with immediate needs including food, rent and utility assistance. She said the foundation is assembling a team of grassroots community advocacy agencies to meet with workers and to help determine the direction of donations.
“We have a lot of people in crisis right now,” said Mark Martinez, a former U.S. Marshal for Nebraska and community advocate who helped organize the event.
Other speakers included Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the Heartland Workers Center and Albert Varas, CEO of Latino Center of the Midlands. Several offered comments in Spanish.
 Ripple effects

Traslaviña said her Omaha-headquartered nonprofit, which has statewide offices and reach, visited with Tyson workers during recent job fairs in Lexington. Representatives of various industries were recruiting, she said, including packing plants from towns such as Gibbon and North Platte.
But worker needs are complex and stretch beyond finding new jobs, Traslaviña said. Many came from Spanish-speaking countries and have invested decades in the Tyson plant. They’re dealing with mortgages, child care and the anxiety of uncertainty.
Laras said his team at the Omaha-based Latino Center of the Midlands stands in solidarity with families of Lexington and will donate as well. “When one Nebraska community is in crisis, it touches us all,” he said.  
In addition to the personal toll on families, speakers spoke of ripple effects expected to hit schools, restaurants and other businesses that over the past decades had been lifted by the Tyson workforce. They fear the loss of teachers, talent and tax base.

Roberts noted that more than 70 different national flags are represented at Lexington High School. The town created a Welcome Center that helps families access resources. 
“We want to keep that going. We know that’s going to be challenging, but we want to keep that spirit alive,” she said.
People can help in ways beyond financial donations, including volunteer and services as interpreters. Roberts said multiple languages are spoken in the Tyson plant. She suggested calling the foundation for more information. 
Martinez and others suggested reaching out to elected officials, nationally and statewide, to question what is being done for Lexington.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The popular gaming platform Roblox already faces lawsuits from at least four states alleging it doesn’t protect children from sexual predators — and now South Carolina’s chief prosecutor is pursuing his own investigation.
Attorney General Alan Wilson announced Tuesday he’s seeking answers from California-based Roblox Corp. ahead of potentially adding South Carolina to the list of suing states.
Questions asked in the administrative subpoena — officially called a civil investigative demand — include how many South Carolina children use the site, how it moderates content, and whether sellers can advertise directly to children.
“Roblox markets itself as the No. 1 gaming site for kids and teens,” Wilson said in a news release. “But ensuring the safety of our children online is a top priority for me, and if Roblox is deceiving parents on their safety protocols, they deserve to be held accountable.”
Matt Kaufman, Roblox’ chief safety officer, said the company shares Wilson’s “commitment to helping keep children safe online.
“As a space specifically designed with children in mind, Roblox has advanced safeguards that monitor the platform for harmful content and communications,” he continued in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette.
That includes eliminating users’ ability to send or receive images via chat, which Kaufman called one of the most prevalent opportunities for misuse.
By first filing a civil demand for information, Wilson took a different approach than his fellow GOP attorneys general in Kentucky, Texas, and Louisiana, who sued the platform earlier this year. Florida’s GOP attorney general issued a civil subpoena to Roblox in April before filing a lawsuit in state court last week.
Also last week, a federal judicial panel combined nearly 80 lawsuits accusing Roblox of knowingly facilitating child sexual exploitation to be heard together before a San Francisco court, according to Reuters. An Iowa family who sued the platform in July alleged their 13-year-old daughter was kidnapped and raped by an adult man she met and began messaging on Roblox, the Des Moines Register reported.
Roblox is a free online gaming platform that boasts 150 million daily active users and offers a customizable virtual universe along with the opportunity for users to message and chat with each other. It allows users as young as 5 years old, unlike sites like Instagram or Discord, and says it uses chat monitoring and filters to block users from sharing personal information like phone numbers.
Last month, a California judge ruled against Roblox in one of the many lawsuits it now faces. A father had sued the platform, alleging it misled him about its safety features and was liable for his son’s sexual abuse. The platform had sought to force the case into private arbitration, citing its terms of service. The judge rejected its request.
A week later, the company announced new safeguards for its young users. In January, it will begin requiring users in the United States to verify their age through either an ID or a face scan and limiting users’ ability to chat with others outside of their age group. Users under 9 years old will need parental permission to chat with other users while playing games.
Kaufman encouraged parents to visit the company’s safety center webpage to learn more about how it’s keeping children safe online.
“As a dad, I know there is no finish line when it comes to protecting kids, which is why we continue to evolve and strengthen our protections every day,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/roblox-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 17:57:55.083546

(Photo by Samantha Laurey/Argus Leader)For the fourth year in a row, Native American children made up more than 70% of children in the South Dakota foster care system at the end of the state’s fiscal year.
That’s six times higher than Indigenous children’s representation in the state’s population. White children, by comparison, make up 70% of the state’s population and 23% of the state’s foster care population.
South Dakota officials have known Native American children are overrepresented in the foster care system for nearly half a century. Children who are removed from their homes and placed in foster care are more likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorders, to be involved in the criminal justice system or homeless, and to have their own children removed from their care, studies indicate.
The state Department of Social Services recently released its annual Child Protection Services report, detailing the number of children in foster care, how they’re cared for and where they’re discharged.
Of the state’s 1,709 foster care children at the end of fiscal year 2025, according to the department, 1,201 were Native American.
State works to increase kinship care numbers
About 32% of children, regardless of their race, were placed in kinship care with relatives or close family friends, while 86% were placed in a “family setting” with a foster family. Kinship care falls within family settings.
Kinship care is up from 30% the year before, when the state first began releasing the data point. 
 

 The Lost Children

South Dakota Searchlight and the Argus Leader investigated the overrepresentation of Native American children in the state’s foster care system — its causes, effects and potential solutions — in the 2023 series The Lost Children.



The number of registered foster homes in the state for the 2025 fiscal year was 793 — the fewest since 2020. Of those homes, 93 — or nearly 12% — were Native American, up from 11% the prior year.
When children have to be removed from their homes, prioritizing kinship care (placing them with a relative or close family friend) can improve academic, behavioral and mental health outcomes, and allow the child to stay within their culture and community, according to Child Trends, a research organization focused on child welfare.
Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff told South Dakota Searchlight in an emailed statement that kinship care is “a priority.” The department implemented new licensed kinship foster home standards in June, meant to remove barriers that kept potential kinship families from registering with the state.
“This permits kinship families to become licensed and receive financial support more quickly to meet the children’s needs,” Althoff said.
At-home intervention decreases by 13%
At-home intervention, without a child’s removal or the court’s involvement, decreased by 95 children this year. 
Just under 500 children received at-home intervention services through the state Child Protection Services, including parental training and home management, according to a Searchlight data request answered by the department.


Interventions can include a “safety plan,” which is a strategy created by a social worker to address safety concerns of at-risk families while a case is being investigated, and a “present danger plan,” which involves families voluntarily letting a child live with another caregiver or having a person accused of maltreatment leave the home.
Another 122 children received other types of at-home interventions, such as a referral to counseling or other assistance, without further Child Protection Services involvement.
More children aging out of foster care system
Of the 984 children who left the child welfare system during the 2025 fiscal year:

423 were reunited with their families.
254 were adopted (54% by a foster parent and 36% by a relative).
72 were transferred to a tribal program.
108 were placed into a formal guardianship agreement.
34 were placed with a relative without guardianship or kinship licensure.
Five were transferred to the Department of Corrections or another agency.

Eighty-five children aged out of the system during fiscal year 2025, up by 20 from fiscal year 2024.


The state reported that 58% of children in the child welfare system are reunited with their families within a year — a gradual decrease each year from a 75% reunification rate in fiscal year 2020, the oldest data available on the department website.
Althoff said the department tracks reunification data to “ensure that efforts remain focused on child well-being and family stability.” He added that many factors influence reunification timelines.
“These can include the willingness on the part of the birth parents to conform to behavioral changes described by the court, the complexity of family circumstances, availability of services, court scheduling, and the time needed to ensure a safe and stable environment for the child,” Althoff said.
Two children ran away, both cases reported as 15-year-old females who were found, and one child died in state care. The child was a 15-year-old male who died “unrelated to child abuse and neglect,” according to the department. The department did not disclose the cause of death.

Richard Hutto’s last day in office will be Jan. 2, 2026, the agency announced.
Hutto has led SC Housing as executive director since 2023, taking over after the previous director, Bonita Shopshire, resigned, according to agency spokesman Matt McColl.
“Richard stepped into this role at a crucial moment and helped steer the agency with transparency, strategy and an honest dedication to the mission,” SC Housing Board Chairman Todd Latiff said in a statement. “He has never viewed this job as merely work. He sees it as a responsibility to the people of this state. His leadership has made a difference for thousands of families, and it will continue to shape this agency long after his retirement.”
Hutto’s past roles with the housing agency, where he’s worked since 1994, include stints as a deputy director, contract director and a financial underwriter.
During Hutto’s tenure as housing chief the agency set multiple records for both the amount of financial assistance granted to first-time homebuyers and the number of residents aided by the home buying program, McColl said.

The agency went from granting $289 million worth of aid to some 1,400 home buyers during the state budget year that ended June 30, 2023, to $465 million worth of aid to 1,990 buyers in the budget year that ended this past June.
Hutto also helped pilot a new program incentivizing home builders to construct 130 affordable homes in the state in an effort to boost the housing supply.
As Hutto retires, agency leadership declared SC Housing to be on “solid footing” and “financially strong.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Roblox, the popular online gaming company, for allegedly putting Iowa children in danger of sexual exploitation.
Roblox, an online game platform, has over 80 million daily users, “many of those are Iowans and most of whom are children under the age of 18,” according to a news release from the attorney general’s office. Despite having a large base of child users, Bird said the company had taken insufficient action to address problems with sexual exploitation and stop the distribution of child sex abuse material on the platform.
In the petition filed Tuesday, Bird wrote Roblox had promised parents the platform was safe for children and equipped with safety measures “while knowing that the platform lacked necessary guardrails and facilitated the sexual exploitation of teen and preteen children and the distribution of child sexual abuse material.”

There are several lawsuits filed against the Roblox Corporation alleging the company has facilitated child sex crimes. One of the lawsuits was filed by an Iowa family, who claims their 13-year-old daughter was found in Tennessee after being taken from her grandmother’s house and sexually abused by a person she met in a Roblox chat room.
“This tragic example is indicative of a pattern of grooming and predatory behavior on Roblox, of which Roblox has long been aware,” the petition states.
The lawsuit is seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction to enjoin Roblox from engaging in “deceptive and unfair acts” by either banning them from doing business in Iowa or requiring the company places “additional safeguards and child protection requirements on the Roblox platform.” The lawsuit also seeks injunctive relief, as well as reimbursement and other costs related to the allegations under the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act.
“We will fight for our children. Roblox created a breeding ground for sexual predators, and Iowa’s children are paying the price,” Bird said in a statement. “Roblox must either make their game a safe place for children or stop doing business in our state. Parents must be told the truth so they can protect their children online from inappropriate material, grooming, exploitation, and other predatory practices.”
Roblox Chief Safety Officer Matt Kaufman said in a statement the newly filed lawsuit “contains patently false claims about our platform,” saying Roblox has taken many steps to protect minors from sexual exploitation.
“Roblox is built with safety at its core,” Kaufman said in a statement. “We have advanced safeguards that monitor our platform for harmful content and communications. Users cannot send or receive images via chat, eliminating one of the most prevalent opportunities for misuse seen elsewhere online. Safety is a constant and consistent focus of our work, and we are currently rolling out additional measures to further limit who users can chat with. We take swift action against anyone found to violate our safety rules and work closely with law enforcement to support investigations and help hold bad actors accountable.”
Kaufman said the company continues to “evolve and strengthen our protections every day” and encouraged parents to visit Roblox’s webpage on safety measures to get more information.

Only the heads were removed and the rest of the meat was left to waste, a Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks press release stated. It’s against state law to waste any part of an animal that’s suitable for food and it’s also against the law to dump animal parts. Additionally, FWP said, three turkey carcasses were found nearby.
The deer were found in the Cub Creek area on Dec. 6 and the bucks were believed to have been killed near the end of hunting season, a FWP release said.
Additionally, in Region 1, FWP wardens are investigating the shooting of a white-tailed deer along Eastside Road west of Troy in Lincoln County. It was believed to have been shot on Dec. 5, after the end of the general hunting season.
And in Region 3, near Toston, wardens are investigating a bull elk killed on Nov. 30.
“Game wardens are looking for information about a hunting party who harvested and removed a bull elk on Sunday, Nov. 30, which was the last day of the general season,” an FWP press release said. “In the same area, wardens found an untouched carcass of a second bull elk. FWP game wardens believe the hunting party that harvested and removed the elk on Nov. 30 may have information related to the unclaimed elk.”
The untouched elk was found in an area adjacent to large Bonneville Power Administration transmission lines near the Bureau of Land Management access road referred to as Dandy Road, a press release said. It’s also between two county roads, Johnny’s Gulch Road and North Fork of Lone Mountain Road, the release added.

Richard Blumenthal said he left a closed-door meeting with top Trump officials on Tuesday with 'more questions than answers.',"U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he left a closed-door meeting with top Trump officials on Tuesday with “more questions than answers” about their rationale for the ongoing strikes on alleged drug boats.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio came to Capitol Hill to provide separate classified briefings for the entire House and Senate as scrutiny mounts over the Sept. 2 “double tap” strikes. 
But lawmakers weren’t shown the full unedited video of that operation during the briefings. And Hegseth confirmed Tuesday that the Pentagon will not release it to the American public.
But as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Blumenthal expects to view the video this week. The initial strike by U.S. forces killed all but two people on a boat near Venezuela. A second strike killed the survivors.
Blumenthal said he still wants the video to be released to the public, arguing there’s “no legal or policy reason for limiting” who can see it. He said Tuesday’s briefing didn’t offer much new information, and he still wasn’t given a sense about the rationale behind the strikes or the goals of the administration in pursuing this strategy.
“It was abjectly inadequate in providing any detailed rationale for the kind of strikes that are ongoing but also for whatever the end game or strategy is in amassing this armada in the Caribbean,” Blumenthal said in an interview after Tuesday’s briefing. “I left the briefing with no clear idea as to what the plan is, if there is one.”
Speaking to reporters after the Senate’s briefing, Rubio and Hegseth defended the ongoing “counter-drug mission” as successful.
The administration will continue to provide updates on the mission, “which is focused on dismantling the infrastructure of these terrorist organizations that are operating in our hemisphere undermining the security of Americans, killing Americans, poisoning Americans,” Rubio said Tuesday.
The U.S. military has carried out about two dozen strikes against alleged drug boats, which have killed more than 90 people, as part of the administration’s ongoing effort against drug cartels. On Monday, the U.S. Southern Command said it launched another three strikes in the eastern Pacific Ocean that killed a total of eight people.
While Democrats and Republicans are offering different accounts about either the contents of the video or the briefings by Trump officials, there’s still a bipartisan push for the public release of the footage amid questions about whether the strikes were carried out legally.
But Hegseth told reporters Tuesday his agency won’t release the full video to the general public. The two Armed Services Committees, he said, will have the opportunity to view them Wednesday alongside Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley, who commanded the operation.
“In keeping with longstanding Department of War policy, Department of Defense policy, of course we’re not going to release a top secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,” Hegseth said Tuesday after the Senate briefing.
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, would have been permitted to view the video as a member of the House Armed Services Committee. But he will be out of town as he recovers from knee surgery. Courtney’s office said the scheduled surgery on Tuesday was successful and he’ll remain at the hospital overnight. He will then spend the rest of the week recovering at home.
Courtney and other Democrats on that committee had also requested that Hegseth release all audio and video footage of the strikes. They cited reporting from The Washington Post that Hegseth issued a “kill everybody” order. Hegseth has disputed that account, saying he left the room after the first strike. But in a recent interview, he said, “I would have made the same call myself” about the follow-up strike.
As the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, was one of only a handful of lawmakers initially authorized to view the classified video of deadly boat strikes in the Caribbean.
Himes had described parts of the video, which he says showed two survivors “clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under” after the first strike.
He said the people on the boat were “almost certainly running drugs” but that it was unclear if they were headed to the U.S. or elsewhere. He disputed characterizations that all 11 people on the boat were high-level targets or that they knew the identifies of everyone on board.
“I’ve spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context, and this video was profoundly shaking, and I think it’s important for Americans to see it,” Himes said in a recent interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “It’s not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines. And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself.”
As Blumenthal prepares to see the video this week, he wants the Senate Armed Services Committee to issue a subpoena for all the video, orders and documents related to the strikes.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25350607541595-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 17:57:55.083546

Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s afternoon stop at West Pelzer Elementary School — in an Upstate town of about 1,000 people — was the fifth on a nationwide tour ahead of next year’s 250th birthday of the country’s founding with the Declaration of Independence. Previous stops included schools in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey.

The tour, called History Rocks!, is sponsored by a coalition of about 40 organizations, most of them conservative. That includes Turning Point USA, the nonprofit founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated on a Utah campus in September; and PragerU, a conservative nonprofit that creates videos teachers are allowed to show in South Carolina classrooms.
Joining McMahon on Tuesday was Mike Noriega, chief of outreach for the American Journey Experience, a Texas-based museum created by conservative media personality Glenn Beck. Students toured a traveling exhibit from the museum ahead of McMahon’s assembly, Noriega said.
For the most part, politics took a backseat during the assembly, as elementary school students competed in a history trivia tournament and waved signs with the American flag printed on one side and the Palmetto flag on the other.
“This is the Trump administration. But the 250th birthday of our country is not political,” McMahon told reporters in response to a question about the event’s political ties.
Occasionally, however, politics surfaced in the celebration in ruby red Anderson County, which Trump won last year with 73% of the vote.
State Superintendent Ellen Weaver pointed to recent improvements in students’ performance on state-standardized tests as a reason for the federal government to give states total control over their schools.
This year, third- through eighth graders’ reading scores reached at least a 10-year high, with 60% statewide reading on grade level. However, more than half of those students still couldn’t do grade-level math by the end of last school year.
Weaver touted that the number of teacher vacancies dropped for the second consecutive year — a first for this decade — as legislators continue to increase teachers’ minimum salaries. She pointed to the state’s policy prohibiting cellphones during school hours as another win.
“All of this represents our really fundamental belief that I know is very near and dear to the heart of our special guest today, (McMahon),” Weaver told a gymnasium full of elementary school students. “That’s the simple belief that the states can lead, and South Carolina is proving that every single day.”
McMahon agreed, she told reporters, pointing to the same successes Weaver mentioned. The Trump administration has made moves toward putting control back in the hands of the state by dismantling the federal Department of Education, which supporters say will reduce bureaucracy and critics say will jeopardize essential education programs.
McMahon pledged that the federal government would continue to fund programs for children with disabilities, as covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act first passed by Congress in 1975. The Department of Education has handed off some of its biggest grant programs to other federal agencies. That includes the Title I program that dates to 1965 and provides funding to schools with a high number of students living in poverty.
The U.S. Department of Education itself was created by Congress in 1979. A complete dismantling would likely require congressional action also.
“Before there was a Department of Education, IDEA funding happened. Title I funding happened,” McMahon told reporters. “It continued to flow and happen without interruptions.”

Anderson School District One, which includes the school McMahon visited Tuesday, received nearly $1.9 million in Title I funding during the most recent fiscal year. At West Pelzer Elementary School, almost 80% of students live in poverty, according to state Department of Education data.
Weaver and McMahon pointed to the 360-student school as an example of success in the face of challenges.
Despite its high poverty rate, 77% of third- through fifth-graders showed on end-of-year state-standardized tests that they could read on grade level and 70% could do math on grade level. That’s far above the state average, according to agency data.
The students had a chance to show off how much they’d learned Tuesday, answering questions about state and national history. Two at a time, a group of students competed to be the first to get the right answer as the school’s current and former state teachers of the year asked multiple-choice questions.
Among them: Which state had more Revolutionary battles than any other? Both students standing in front of microphones raised their hands to give the answer: South Carolina.
“South Carolina has been central to the American story,” McMahon told students.
McMahon opened her questions up to the room. For example: How old was John Rutledge when he became the youngest person to sign the U.S. Constitution? (He was 26). And what was Revolutionary War Gen. Francis Marion’s nickname?
“Swamp Fox,” the room of children shouted back.
“For America to stay great in the future, we must build upon our past,” McMahon said. “In order to do that, we must learn about our past. By the looks of this room, you are all ready to carry the torch and to lead America into the golden age.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_5708-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 17:57:55.083546

Utility regulators expanded eligibility, increased funding and made other changes to the statewide program Thursday, according to a news release. The changes, which are slated to take effect next October, are meant to make the assistance program more accessible while also making it more effective.
Public Advocate Heather Sanborn praised the changes, saying that they will provide critical support to ratepayers. 
“Maine is finally building an assistance program that meets the real needs of low-income ratepayers,” Sanborn said in a statement. 
These changes come a month after the Public Utilities Commission announced new electricity prices for 2026. Both Central Maine Power and Versant customers can expect to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
With the changes the commission approved this week, annual funding for the Low-Income Assistance Program, also known as LIAP, will jump to $33 million — a nearly 50% increase from the current level. 
Lawmakers across parties eyeing tax credits to lower Mainers’ energy bills

Phil Bartlett, chair of the Public Utilities Commission, said in the news release that the boost in funding reflects the current affordability challenges, as well as the uptick in participation that is expected with these new rules. 
Under the changes, households with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty level who participate in other means-tested programs with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services will now be eligible to participate. The commission is also moving to an automatic enrollment system for customers who meet the requirements. 
Additionally, the program will no longer provide ratepayers a lump-sum but instead will offer a more predictable, ongoing discount to monthly electric bills.
Each year, each utility company will establish discount rates for LIAP customers with guidance from the commission to encourage consistency across the state. The discounts will be tiered and based on income eligibility rather than electricity consumption thresholds. 
Last month, the commission also rejected a proposal from Central Maine Power that would have significantly raised rates over the next five years after it received pushback from Sanborn and the public who said ratepayers, especially seniors and low-income households, couldn’t afford another increase when the cost of living is already so high.
The average CMP residential customer paid roughly $155 in August, up from $140 last year. Customers in Versant’s Bangor Hydro District saw their bills go up just over $20 this past year, from $148 to $169, while the average Versant Maine Public District consumer saw their bill increase from about $144 to $162.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1934748893-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-16 17:57:55.083546

(Courtesy of Duke Rodriguez)It was 1 a.m. on Valentine’s Day, 2024, when a police officer wrote the ticket. A grey BMW with expired tags was parked at Albuquerque International Sunport, and the citation was subsequently mailed to an Albuquerque home address for Duke Rodriguez, a former state cabinet secretary and CEO of Ultra Health Cannabis who on Sunday announced his candidacy in the 2026 Republican primary election for New Mexico governor.
The envelope came back to court a month later, marked with a sticker that read: “Return to sender. Vacant. Unable to forward.” In April, the court requested a judge sign a non-arrestable parking warrant because Rodriguez had failed to schedule a court date or pay the parking fine. A judge signed the warrant on May 2, 2024. In June, the court noted again that correspondence to Rodriguez’s Albuquerque home address had been returned.
Rodriguez’s New Mexico residency came into question in November after a Santa Fe New Mexican columnist wrote that Rodriguez mostly voted in Arizona elections. An Albuquerque Journal story, following Rodriguez’s campaign announcement, also detailed his voting history in New Mexico. Court records show that parking tickets mailed to his Albuquerque address have been repeatedly returned and that, in at least one 2019 lawsuit, he identified as “a resident of Scottsdale, Arizona.” 
Under New Mexico law, the constitutional residency requirement for candidates mandates that they “have been continuously registered to vote here for five years” and “have maintained a residence here,” a New Mexico Secretary of State spokesperson wrote in an email to Source NM. Online records show Rodriguez participated in the November general election and the December mayoral runoff in Albuquerque, but Rodriguez did not respond to a request asking when he registered to vote in New Mexico. A New Mexican columnist previously wrote that Rodriguez registered this year, in January, and an Albuquerque Journal story noted he first registered to vote in Arizona in 2001 and voted in that state’s general elections in 2022 and 2024.
In an interview with Source NM, Rodriguez maintained that his Albuquerque house is his primary residence. He said he couldn’t explain why his parking tickets were often marked “return to sender,” other than noting that he doesn’t check his mail every day. As for the 2019 lawsuit, he said that was years in the past and would not answer questions about why he identified as a Scottsdale resident at the time.
The 2024 parking ticket was one of seven Rodriguez accrued at the airport’s parking facilities since 2022, court records show. Court officials had trouble reaching him in at least five of those cases, according to court documents. Routinely in 2022 and 2023, his mail was marked “return to sender. Unclaimed.” In October of 2023, an envelope returned to court was marked for the first time as, “Return to sender. Vacant.”
Rodriguez acknowledged to Source that he often travels out of state, including to Scottsdale, Arizona, where he said he assists family undergoing medical treatment, but said that shouldn’t affect his candidacy.
Rodriguez said that even though court officials spent months trying to reach him over the 2024 ticket, he “continuously resided throughout that period in New Mexico.” When asked how often he left the state in that timeframe, he said, “I travel regularly. Did I spend a majority of time in New Mexico? Absolutely.” He would not specify further.
Rodriguez would not clarify how much of the year he spends in New Mexico.
“I try to spend as much time wherever I need to be to conduct business, take care of my property,” he said. “I’m not going to sit here and calculate: is it 51% or 99%.”
Court records show parking tickets sent to Duke Rodriguez were marked “return to sender. Vacant. Unable to forward.” (Courtesy of Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court)
Rodriguez also dismissed the ticketing at Sunport as evidence that he often leaves the state. The vehicle is simply “used by multiple people and they let it sit for different amounts of time,” he said. The car is at the airport if he needs it, he said, but “usually I have people picking me up and driving me.”
In the June 2, 2026 Republican primary,Rodriguez is set to face Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull and freshman state Sen. Steve Lanier of Aztec. Democratic primary candidates are former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman and former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima.
The parking tickets are not the first time government officials have had a difficult time delivering legal documents to Rodriguez.
In a 2016 Lea County lawsuit, a sheriff’s deputy was unable to serve Rodriguez with papers, court records show. “Never made contact!” the deputy wrote. “Mr. Rodriguez lives in Arizona.”
Asked Tuesday why a deputy would have written that, Rodriguez said, “I don’t know” and said he was not previously aware of the lawsuit.
“I think this house was built in 2017 or 2018. I have lived continuously here,” Rodriguez said. “I have nothing to hide about where my life is built and I certainly, absolutely, 100% meet the constitutional standard to be elected governor.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/V2_RodriguezDuke-9798-scaled-e1765922072436-1024x938.jpg,,,2025-12-16 17:57:55.083546

(Photo:  Brandon Bell/Getty Images)North Carolina’s infant mortality rate, already one of the worst in the nation, will continue to rise with the expiration of tax credits that kept ACA insurance coverage affordable, an OBGYN said Tuesday. 
Black babies in North Carolina die at three times the rate of white infants, a key factor that drives the state’s high overall infant death rate. 
“Losing health insurance means that we’re going to see an increase in the racial disparities among maternal mortality and infant mortality,” said Dr. Makunda Abdul-Mbacke, who practices in Rockingham County and southwestern Virginia. 
Abdul-Mbacke spoke to reporters Tuesday in a news conference organized by the Committee to Protect Health Care. 
Federal tax credits approved in 2022 that subsided Affordable Care Act premiums are expiring, and ACA health insurance marketplace premiums are rising. The tax credits made health insurance affordable for millions of Americans. Now, millions are expected to drop their health insurance because they can’t afford it. 
More than 975,000 North Carolinians have health insurance through an ACA marketplace health plan this year, compared to 670,223 in 2022, according to KFF.
A U.S. Senate vote to extend the subsidies failed last week. House Speaker Mike Johnson has scotched a vote in his chamber on extending ACA subsidies, States Newsroom reported. Republican leaders have said the subsidies are too expensive to continue.
Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care and an emergency physician in west Michigan, said he blames leaders in Washington for failing to help people keep their coverage. 
“They voted to let premiums skyrocket,” he said, rather than ensuring their constituents could continue to see their doctors. 
Abdul-Mbacke also anticipates worsening health care disparities in cancer and heart disease. 
“Access to care is the very basic first step in dealing with any of these health equity issues,” she said. “You can’t have equity if you have no access.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mom-and-infant-Getty2025.jpg,,,2025-12-16 17:57:55.083546
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-16 21:53:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Women at York Correctional were abused by officers,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/16/report-doc-fails-to-protect-women-at-york-from-sexual-abuse-by-correction-officers/,Disability Rights Connecticut found that DOC failed to protect women with mental illness from sexual abuse.,"A four-year investigation into sexual abuse at York Correctional Institution found that the Department of Correction failed to protect women in custody with mental illness from sexual abuse by correction officers, and was slow to review whether changes in security or policy could prevent further abuse.
Disability Rights Connecticut, the organization that published the report, began investigating the facility in November 2021, after receiving and investigating multiple complaints. 
“DRCT received additional information while investigating the complaints which gave rise to the reasonable belief of probable cause that multiple women with mental illness had been sexually abused,” the report said. “As a result, DRCT expanded its investigation into systemic allegations of sexual abuse for individuals with mental illness at YCI.” The investigation concluded last month.
Since 2021, six correction officers have been either charged with or convicted of sexual assault. Two more resigned after being investigated by the Connecticut State Police but were never charged. Another was fired by the Department of Correction in 2021.
Three additional officers are currently under investigation for sexual abuse. Two are banned from having contact with inmates and one is restricted to a specifica area. 
According to the report, DOC knew of multiple areas of the prison that were not covered by security cameras, which could have made it possible for correction officers to assault female prisoners without being seen. 
In one case, an unnamed incarcerated woman was assaulted by an officer in the laundry room at York multiple times. She said the officer told her that he loved her, and she believed they were in a relationship. The Department of Correction’s own investigation into the allegations — which is ongoing — found that wardens had been asking for cameras in the laundry room as far back as 2016, in response to earlier investigations into sexual assaults by correction officers in the same area. 
When the officer, who is still under investigation, was confronted, he pointed to the fact that there were no cameras in the laundry room, saying that “it was his word against that of [the unnamed woman],” according to DOC’s investigation and the DRCT report.
In 2023, a DOC contractor recommended replacing 10 cameras and installing 63 additional cameras at York. Those cameras have yet to be installed. Since the company made the recommendation, only two cameras have been added and one was replaced, according to the Disability Rights CT report. 
Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward said in a statement that he’d heard concerns about camera coverage and blind spots from both department staff and incarcerated people, and that the lapses “continue to present significant safety and accountability concerns.” 
The report also noted that many of the alleged assaults took place during the overnight shift, when there were fewer officers on duty. 
The report criticized the department for delays in completing sexual abuse incident reviews — documents that produce recommendations for how DOC might modify its policies or enhance security to prevent future sexual abuse. According to the report, there were no incident reviews produced in five of the seven allegations that the organization reviewed that were substantiated. 
None of the incident reviews for the seven substantiated cases included a recommendation that victims receive mental health treatment from providers experienced in treating victims of sexual abuse — despite this being included in both the department’s policy and the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act, which passed in 2003. 
One of the cases included in DRCT’s report was that of Lashanda Gregory, who filed a claim for $2.5 million with the state claims commissioner in June 2023 alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by two correction officers in 2022. She was granted permission to sue the state. 
Gregory’s lawyer, Alexander Taubes, alleged in a letter to Attorney General William Tong in November that Tong’s office had engaged in a pattern of “victim-blaming” toward Gregory after Assistant Attorney General Matthew Beizer, in an email to Taubes, said Gregory was “the instigator/willing participant in the incidents” of sexual assault, making her “contributorily negligent.” 
The DRCT report said one of the incidents involving Gregory likely took place in a mop closet, another blind spot out of sight of the cameras that DOC had flagged in its own reports. It also said Gregory never received mental health services from experts who had training in working with victims of sexual assault. 
Taubes told the Connecticut Mirror in a text message that the report’s findings about Gregory — including the lack of mental health treatment she received and the fact the department didn’t complete a sexual abuse incident review in her case — revealed systemic failures. 
“This report demands more than damage control. It demands accountability, independent oversight, and an honest reckoning with how women in state custody were treated — and how their abuse was minimized when it mattered most,” Taubes said. 
In three cases outlined in DRCT’s report, the Department of Corrections hadn’t conducted its own investigations. In one case, a woman reported in 2023 that she had been raped by two correction officers in 2014. Both officers had already left the department — one was arrested for sexual assault and one resigned over sexual misconduct, DRCT found. 
In another case, a woman alleged being raped by two correction officers and claimed that one of them was the father of her child. The officer was still working in the department — he was stationed at Manson Youth Institution — but DOC hadn’t interviewed him or tried to verify that he was the child’s father, according to DRCT. 
In a third case, an unnamed formerly incarcerated woman told a sexual abuse crisis counselor that an officer made “sexually suggestive comments” to her, tried to remove her clothes, and at one point forced her to touch him sexually while she was incarcerated from 2010 to 2014. 
“When asked why she did not tell [the officer] to stop these behaviors or report them to staff, [the woman] stated she laughed it off because these behaviors were part of the DOC culture,” the report read. 
When the woman made the allegation, in July 2022, the officer was on leave for worker’s compensation. He retired a few months later. According to the report, the officer was never interviewed, the investigation by the department was not completed, and nothing was done to remedy what had occurred. 
According to federal regulations, an agency is not authorized to end an investigation simply because the employee in question no longer works there, or the incarcerated individual in question has been released. 
Department of Correction spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said in a statement that the department “has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault / sexual harassment of any individual under its supervision.”
“The agency’s Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Unit thoroughly and objectively investigates allegations of sexual abuse in accordance with Federal standards,” Banevicius said. “If allegations are substantiated, violators are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and/or criminal prosecution.”
Ward, the correction ombuds, also said in his statement that he found the report’s findings “deeply concerning,” adding that they “underscore serious breakdowns in the Department of Correction’s duty to protect incarcerated women from harm.” 
Disability Rights CT recommended that the department provide quarterly reports to the office of the correction ombuds listing any allegations of sexual abuse or harassment, and additional reports listing the status of any investigations into sexual abuse or harassment.
Ward told CT Mirror he supported this recommendation. 
The organization also called on state lawmakers to make it possible for any DOC employee to be charged with sexual assault in the second or fourth degree. The law currently restricts this to employees who have “supervisory or disciplinary authority over prisoners.” DRCT also recommended raising the penalty for second-degree sexual assault from nine months to two years. 
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, the highest ranking Republican on the legislature’s Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that he planned to meet with the department’s leadership to discuss the report and make sure that changes were taking place to prevent further abuses.
“One of the utmost priorities of the Department needs to be ensuring the safety and wellness of all those within our facilities — incarcerated persons, DOC staff, and visitors,” Kissel said.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, said that before submitting legislation to increase penalties, he wanted to look into whether the current penalties for sexual assault were being enforced. 
The state has a duty to protect people it’s holding in custody, he said, adding that he believes DOC must “get its act together” and address the sexual abuse that is occurring, along with the legislature. 
“ At the end of the day, the clear direction forward here is to pull our heads out of the sand and figure out what we’re not doing right and get it done,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

(Photo courtesy of the Office of the Governor) Gov. Tim Walz signed two executive orders Tuesday — one establishing a council and another directing state agencies to make gun violence prevention a priority — after several high-profile shootings over the summer and a subsequent failed effort to get the Legislature to pass new gun control laws.
Walz pledged in August to call a special legislative session to pass a ban on so-called assault weapons and additional school safety measures. The Minnesota Legislature is narrowly split, so Walz needed bipartisan agreement to pass any gun control bills.
Republican — and even some Democratic — lawmakers were not on board, and negotiations broke down in September. Walz and other Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers have been holding town halls to promote gun control in recent months.
Walz’s latest executive orders are modest compared to the action he pledged after the August Church of Annunciation shooting killed two children and wounding more than two dozen others. The governor also wanted to address gun violence after House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed in their homes in June.
The first order establishes a Governor’s Statewide Safety Council that will create an “immediate action plan” to prevent future mass shootings, targeted attacks and domestic terrorism. The council will include members of the governor’s cabinet, law enforcement, school administrators and a representative from the Annunciation Hope Alliance.
The second order includes a broad directive to state agencies to “protect Minnesotans, particularly minors and vulnerable adults, from gun violence.” It also requires the Department of Public Safety to promote and educate Minnesotans about the state’s extreme risk protection order law, also known as the “red flag” law, and to promote the safe storage of firearms.
The Star Tribune reported in October that judges have used the red flag law to bar 281 people from owning guns for at least two weeks, including 10 people who had threatened violence at schools or day care facilities. Gun control advocates say more education about the law will improve its effectiveness.
“These actions today don’t limit your freedoms at all. Being shot dead in your school certainly does. We’re taking the action,” Walz said at a Capitol press conference surrounded by gun control advocates, lawmakers and parents of Annunciation children.
The executive order will also require companies that issue homeowner’s insurance in Minnesota to submit “detailed policy and claims data involving firearms.” The Department of Commerce will then analyze that data to make policy suggestions.
Walz, who is running for a third four-year term, laid the blame for lack of legislative action at the feet of House Speaker Lisa Demuth, who is a frontrunner in the race for the Republican nomination for governor.
“There is one person stopping us from having a vote in the House of Representatives right now to ban assault weapons,” Walz said. “The speaker of the house should … be standing with the parents and those who are up here. She should be standing with law enforcement who knows this is the right thing to do.”
The jab is another preview of what is likely to be a combative relationship between Walz and Demuth during the next legislative session, which begins in February.
Demuth hit back.
“Shame on the governor for politicizing tragedy, and shame on him for ignoring bipartisan safety solutions in favor of mockery and lies,” Demuth said in a statement.
The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said Walz is using the executive orders as “a distraction” from his failure to whip enough votes for his assault weapons ban.
“What we got today were low-impact orders that serve more as political cover than meaningful policy,” Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus Chair Bryan Strawser said in a statement. “It’s a distraction from the fact that the governor couldn’t build support for his agenda within his own party.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54988573698_a2c4565770_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A world-champion Cuban wrestler, Reineri Andreu Ortega, is suing the National Collegiate Athletic Association over rules that he says have unfairly barred him from wrestling for Iowa State University.
The lawsuit was filed this week by lawyers for Ortega, a student and prospective college wrestler at ISU, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. The lawsuit challenges the NCAA’s so-called “Five-Year Eligibility Clock” and the manner in which the NCAA decides when that clock begins running and thus when a student’s eligibility to compete expires.
Attorneys for Ortega argue that the NCAA’s application of the rule violates antitrust laws and unjustifiably restrains the ability of Ortega and other college athletes to “earn meaningful compensation that is now available to (other) NCAA Division I athletes.”
The lawsuit has its origins in a 2021 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that paved the way for college athletes to receive compensation for use of their names, images, and likenesses. Since then, the market for name, image and likeness compensation opportunities available to NCAA Division I athletes has “exploded into a multi-million dollar industry,” the lawsuit claims.
However, the lawsuit adds, that form of compensation is largely available only to NCAA Division I athletes. Athletes who compete outside of what the lawsuit calls “the NCAA monopoly” have no meaningful opportunity to collect revenue-sharing income or profit from their name, image or likeness.
Under NCAA bylaws, an athlete has five years of eligibility to play four seasons of “intercollegiate competition” in his or her chosen sport. This five-year window is known as as the “eligibility clock” and begins to run from the date on which an athlete registers as a full-time student at any “collegiate institution” – regardless of whether the institution is a member of the NCAA and regardless of their participation in sports.
Lawyers for Ortega say this rule has had the effect of barring students from competing in NCAA sports even if they’ve never competed. They say students such as Ortega “can attend a non-NCAA college for three years without playing any sports, take two years off from school for personal reasons, transfer to a four-year NCAA school, and the student will have used all of their eligibility without ever having competed in a college sport for a non-NCAA or NCAA college.”
Ortega studied in Cuba before coming to ISU
The lawsuit claims Ortega completed high school in Cuba in the spring of 2016, and then, beginning in the fall of 2016, he began taking courses at Manuel Fajardo University in Cuba. In 2017, Ortega began training and wrestling for the Cuban National Team, which has no affiliation to a college or university, while continuing to study at Manuel Fajardo University until the spring of 2019.
Ortega is a two-time U23 world champion and two-time Pan American gold medalist, according to USA Wrestling.
In December 2022, Ortega left the Cuban National Team and came to America as a refugee. In the spring of 2023, Ortega enrolled at ISU where he earned a spot on the wrestling team but without competing during the 2022-23 season.
According to the lawsuit, the NCAA has denied Ortega’s request for eligibility beyond the 2022-23 season due to the five-year rule, indicating Ortega’s eligibility clock started while he was attending Manuel Fajardo University, not when he enrolled at ISU.
Counting the years that a student attends a non-NCAA institution as years on their NCAA eligibility clock is arbitrary and capricious, the lawsuit alleges. “Ortega, and other wrestlers or prospective athletes in other sports who are harmed by this illegal restraint have a small window of time to compete in Division I sports and earn the permissible compensation now available to them,” the lawsuit claims.
Ortega claims that the NCAA has effectively excluded him from an NCAA Division I college career, and because, as a 130-pound athlete, he has very limited pro-wresting opportunities open to him after college, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring the continued application of the eligibility rule is necessary.
Lawsuit cites pro athletes’ eligibility 
According to the NCAA, the purpose of the five- year rule is to “move student-athletes toward graduation in a timely manner” – eliminating any incentive to remain in school simply to compete. Lawyers for Ortega, however, contend the rule doesn’t exist “for reasons of competitive balance or it would preclude other older athletes from competing” in Division I NCAA sports.
The lawsuit notes that students who graduate high school and become a professional athlete in one sport can play that other sport for years, then go to college and still have five years of eligibility to play four seasons of some other sport.
“The NCAA rules, therefore, do not limit the ability of the former professional athlete to earn permissible compensation while competing in Division I athletics, even though they have had a chance to physically mature well beyond a typical 18-year-old college freshman,” the lawsuit alleges. “For instance, Chris Weinke entered Florida State University as a freshman following a six-year professional baseball career and ended up winning the Heisman Trophy, awarded annually to the most outstanding player in college football, at 28 years of age.”
The lawsuit claims the NCAA’s application of the five-year rule violates the Sherman Act by restraining the market for NCAA Division I college athletes by barring Ortega and similarly situated athletes from having an opportunity to earn money through revenue sharing and the use of their name, image and likeness.
As part of the lawsuit, lawyers for Ortega also argue that should the court grant their requested injunction against the NCAA, it must also address a separate NCAA rule. That rule says if a student-athlete who is deemed ineligible by the NCAA is permitted to participate in sports in accordance with the terms of a court order that is later vacated or reversed, the NCAA can take punitive action against the school – such as vacating wins or imposing postseason-competition bans and financial penalties.
The lawsuit seeks an immediate temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and then a permanent injunction that will block the NCAA from applying the five-year rule to students such as Ortega.
The NCAA, which is an association of post-secondary institutions that functions as the governing body of college sports, has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
The NCAA includes more than 1,100 member colleges and universities organized into three divisions, with 350 of them in Division I.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/isu-sign.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

(Photo: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)North Carolina ranks near the bottom nationally for teacher pay growth and per-student public school funding, according to a new report by the libertarian think tank Reason Foundation.
The findings about North Carolina are similar to the results of studies by other organizations, including the National Education Association. They are notable, however, because they come from a right-leaning group.
The report found the state ranked 48th in both teacher salary growth and per-pupil funding from 2002 to 2023. While overall education spending increased during that period, inflation and rising benefit costs significantly eroded teachers’ purchasing power, according to the analysis.
Nationwide, per-student funding grew from $14,969 to $20,322 during that period. New York topped all states at $36,976 followed by New Jersey at $30,267. In all, eight states exceeded $25,000 per student in 2023.
Compare that to North Carolina where per-pupil spending in 2023 was just $13,661, ranking 47th in the nation. Idaho, which ranked last, was the only state spending less than $12,000 per student.
North Carolina’s per-student funding grew just 8.5% between 2002 and 2023, ranking 48th in the nation. But it rose slightly in recent years largely because of federal pandemic relief dollars. From 2020 to 2023, per-pupil spending increased 8.7%, slightly above the national average. But those gains may not continue now that federal relief funds have expired.
“With federal pandemic relief funding now expired, combined with rising economic uncertainty, declining public school enrollment, and increased competition from school choice and homeschooling, the era of unrelenting public school funding growth may be coming to an end,” the report says.
Since 2002, student enrollment in North Carolina increased 17.2%, the ninth-highest growth rate in the country. Over the same period, the number of non-teaching staff — including administrators, counselors, and social workers — grew 18.2%, outpacing growth in the teaching workforce.
Nationally, the report found non-teaching staff increased more than three times faster than teacher hiring.
The report comes as the General Assembly has failed to pass a full budget and the North Carolina Supreme Court has yet to resolve the Leandro school funding case, a decades-old legal fight over the state’s obligation to fully fund a “sound, basic education” for all public school students.
NC Newsline sought comment on the report from state Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), state House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell), and state schools superintendent Mo Green (D-North Carolina).

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens will play in their first bowl game as an FBS school against the University of Louisiana Lafayette Ragin’ Cajuns in Mobile, Alabama, Wednesday night.
 
The University of Delaware finished its football season with a dominant win against UTEP in its regular season finale on November 29. The win was UD’s sixth of the season making the Blue Hens bowl eligible in their inaugural season of FBS football, but it was in question whether the Blue Hens would actually play in a bowl game.
The NCAA has a rule for teams making the transition up to the FBS level that requires the transitioning team to sit-out postseason games the first two years of their transition. That meant UD couldn’t participate in the FCS postseason last year and wouldn’t be eligible for a bowl game this season. 
That was until there weren’t enough bowl eligible teams to fill out the available 82 bowl game spots. 
UD and fellow CUSA member Missouri State each received a bowl selection in their first FBS season joining Jacksonville State and UAB as the only schools since 2012 to make a bowl game in its inaugural FBS season. UAB failed to defeat Ohio University in its first bowl game, but Jacksonville State won its initial bowl game in 2023. The Gamecocks’ opponent in that game was the Ragin’ Cajuns whom Delaware faces Wednesday.
Who Are the Ragin’ Cajuns?
Louisiana finished the regular season with a 6-6 record similar to the University of Delaware. The two teams have never met in any sport thus far making this game the two’s first introduction to each other.  
The Ragin’ Cajuns started the season slowly losing three of their first four games before starting their Sun Belt conference slate. The Ragin’ Cajuns lost three straight conference games following a double overtime victory over Marshall to begin conference play. Louisiana’s three losses came against the eventual Sun Belt champions James Madison University, Southern Mississippi, and the west division leader Troy.   
Following the loss to Troy, Louisiana dominated the month of November defeating all four of its conference opponents finishing the season on a four game winning streak to clinch a bowl berth. The Ragin’ Cajuns have made a bowl game in each of their last eight seasons — including this season — and have made a total of 15 bowl game appearances. Two of their 15 bowl appearances were vacated due to NCAA sanctions.
This season Louisiana featured a balanced attack ranking seventh in the Sun Belt in both points per game (27.1) and points allowed per game (30). The Ragin’ Cajuns did most of their offensive damage on the ground rushing for over 2,000 yards this season. Running back Bill Davis paced the attack with a team high 739 rushing yards. Redshirt junior Zylan Perry and quarterback Lunch Winfield each rushed for over 600 yards supplementing Davis’ production. The Louisiana passing game isn’t as dynamic, ranking last in the Sun Belt averaging a little more than 156 air yards per game. 
The Ragin’ Cajun defense ranks slightly better against the passing game than the run game, ending the regular season ranked seventh in the conference against the pass and 11th against the run. Senior linebacker Jaden Dugger and defensive end Jordan Lawson are the names to watch on the unit. Dugger is third in the Sun Belt with 118 total tackles this season and Lawson finished the regular season with 12 tackles for loss and five sacks. 
Where and How to Watch
The game is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. EST Wednesday night and will air on ESPN. This is UD’s first neutral site game since 2011, but that doesn’t mean the UD fandom can’t support from the comforts of Delaware. 
There are three locations in Newark holding watch parties for Blue Hen fans. Grain Craft Bar and Kitchen and Buffalo Wild Wings are hosting watch parties at their Main Street locations and Tommy’s Tavern at Christiana Mall will hold one as well, according to an email from UD’s athletic department. There will also be watch parties at Rehoboth Ale House in Rehoboth, Delaware, and 902 Brewing Co. in Jersey City, New Jersey, for Blue Hen fans closer to those areas.

(West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia education officials have until spring to finish an appeal to the state Supreme Court over a Raleigh County Circuit Judge’s ruling in a case at the center of a debate over religious freedom and the state’s strict school vaccine requirements.
The court issued a scheduling order Tuesday in the case of West Virginia Board of Education, et al v. Miranda G., et al. 
Raleigh Circuit Judge Michael Froble issued a statewide ruling Nov. 26 that enjoined the state and Raleigh County school boards from using the state’s school vaccine law to deny school admission to plaintiffs in the lawsuit and anyone who had requested or been granted a religious or philosophical exemption to the school vaccine requirements. 
Days later the Supreme Court granted a stay in the case that temporarily halted the ruling. 
Raleigh County parents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter filed the lawsuit against the school boards, which have refused to accept religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine requirements. 
States generally require students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases, like measles, polio and whooping cough. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow students to opt out of the requirements because of religious or philosophical objections to the shots. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office. He’s not rescinded the order even though state lawmakers voted down legislation that would have codified the exemptions. His order is based on the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. 
Under the Supreme Court’s order Tuesday, the school boards have until March 26, 2026 to perfect the appeal. After that, attorneys for Guzman and Hunter will have 45 days, until May 11, 2026, to file a respondent’s brief and then the board of education will have until June 1, 2026 to file a reply brief. 
Once the June 1 deadline is passed, the court could decide the case on its merits without oral arguments or set the case for oral arguments and then decide the case on its merits.

Legislators will likely continue to discuss college completion rates and bolstering the workforce during the 2026 legislative session.","State lawmakers and leaders of Mississippi’s public colleges and universities are examining ways to increase the number of adults who complete some form of education after high school, land a job, and earn a living wage. 
The initial conversations, held Wednesday and Thursday during a joint meeting of the state House and Senate committees on universities and colleges, will likely continue during the 2026 legislative session. 
Here are four key takeaways from the committee meetings. 
Some lawmakers want to tie state funding to public universities based on post-graduation student success 
The goal is to get a better value for taxpayers to ensure college students are getting the best benefit of their education and the state is getting a return on investment for them to enter the workforce, said Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford and the Senate committee chair.
Higher education systems in some states, such as Texas, Tennessee and Florida, use a performance-based funding model. Their models reward institutions for graduating students, placing them in jobs with median wage earnings,  and helping high need populations succeed. 
“Effective funding formulas focus on success within a six month period of graduation,” Nathan Oakley, senior policy director for ExcelinEd, a national nonprofit thank tank, asked during a presentation to legislators. The means of success include “whether a student has found employment, enlisted in the military or enrolled at another post-secondary intuition or program.” 
Legislators acknowledge that Mississippi’s eight public universities operate under a broken funding formula. The amount of state funding awarded to the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning has decreased from 35% to 26% in the past decade, said LeAnn Robinson, director of the legislative budget office. Those colleges and universities now rely heavily on tuition to generate revenue. 
The IHL Board of Trustees is working with the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems to review and define metrics of success for each of its public universities, Commissioner Al Rankins said. IHL’s current funding is based on a broad approach that allows universities to receive equal funding regardless of enrollment growth or post-graduation success.  
With a recommendation from NCHEMS, IHL is considering a few formulas including one based on enrollment and tuition revenue in anticipation of an “enrollment cliff” — a decline in the number of high school students applying to state universities, Rankins said. 
Public university enrollment increases overall, but some institutions have seen declines
Overall, the state’s public universities saw a 2.7% increase in student enrollment with more than 81,961 new, first-time students on campuses this fall compared to 79,817 students enrolled in fall 2024, according to an annual report by the IHL board. 
But there’s been a general decline in enrollment for the past decade at  Delta State, Mississippi University for Women, Alcorn State and Mississippi Valley State, Rankins said. 
Some of the state’s research institutions, including University of Southern Mississippi and Jackson State, have also seen a slight decline in enrollment in the past 10 years, Rankins said. 
Mississippi State University and University of Mississippi, the state’s flagship institutions, are the only two institutions that have seen a growth in enrollment in the past decade. Public universities have to be more intentional with the impending challenges of the enrollment cliff in the next few years, Rankins said. 
Legislators are considering offering financial aid to nontraditional students
Al Rankins, Jr. is the Commissioner of the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning. 
Jennifer Rodgers, executive director of the state’s financial aid office, suggested a way to meet the state’s education attainment goals, boost its financial aid system and create job opportunities for working-age adults: creating the Mississippi Workforce Promise Program. 
Boyd and other lawmakers plan to propose legislation in January for an adult workforce grant program, which would be piloted at a few community colleges.
The program would involve providing grants for nontraditional students, including those older than 24 and not enrolled in school full time, who are pursuing a degree or credential.
The state does not currently offer financial aid to nontraditional students,  but they make up a large portion of the state’s post-secondary population, Rodgers said. 
In recent years, the state has also redefined its educational attainment and workforce goals to get more college graduates to stay in Mississippi and contribute to its labor force and economy. In 2022, the state Chamber of Commerce and AccelerateMS, the workforce development office, launched Ascent to 55%, an initiative to get more than half of Mississippi’s workforce college educated by 2030, on par with the national rate. As of January, 48.7% of Mississippians ages 25 to 64 have a degree, credential or industry certification beyond high school.
The state has also outlined a number of job shortages in high-wage, high-demand fields such as nursing and health care technicians, IT and cyber security specialists, welders, electricians and plumbers and manufacturing trades, according to AccelerateMS. By 2035, the state would need to produce an additional 19,000 skilled workers for these in-demand fields. 
The Mississippi Workforce Promise Program could be a chance to tap into a group of students to educate or offer job opportunities or training, Boyd said. Other states such as Tennessee and Michigan have used similar grant programs to expand their workforce and lower barriers for students to get their degrees, training or credentials, Rodgers said. 
Adults who complete the program are students who would likely stay in the state, especially if they’ve established families or work in Mississippi, Rodgers said. 
Empowering Mississippians with financial literacy resources can help the state’s future economy 
Combined with Mississippi’s low median income of $56,820, the average federal student loan debt — $37,552 — creates the worst debt-to-income burden in the nation, said Apryll Washington, deputy director of the Mississippi Office of Student Financial Aid. 
More resources and support are needed to educate college students on financial literacy, said Jean Massey, executive director of Ascent to 55%. 
Mississippi requires high school students to complete a college and career readiness course with a financial literacy component to graduate. The course covers topics including budgeting, saving, credit and completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.
But after high school, many students are then saddled with debt such as rent, credit card and loan payments, Massey said. Requiring first-year students to take a money management course at universities and colleges could be a strategy to improve graduates’ financial future and help Mississippi’s economy. 
“I think we have to empower our students,” Massey said. “We can partner with local credit unions, banks and nonprofits to provide expertise and mentorship. We can give students access to digital tools for how to track, monitor and spend their money.”  
State institutions including the University of Mississippi, Jackson State, University of Southern Mississippi and Mississippi College offer financial literary courses or coaching for students. But state higher education leaders must examine ways to ensure students are set up for success, Massey said. 
“We need to give choices and opportunities for students to move forward,” Massey said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/04192227/Senate-study-group-4.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

Reps. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, and Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, brought forward the “Campus Housing Affordability Act” Tuesday, Nunn announced in a press release. If passed, the legislation would amend current law to allow certain students enrolled in higher education to apply federal housing assistance to their university dwellings.

“College should be about learning and earning a degree, not worrying about where you’re going to sleep at night,” Nunn said in the release. “Housing insecurity undermines academic success, increases the risk of dropping out, and puts a higher education out of reach for too many students. This bipartisan bill gives every student a fair shot at success—regardless of their background or ZIP code.”
According to the release, the bill would let students with Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers use them for campus housing and bar vouchers offered through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development from being counted as income. This will stop students from “being disqualified from additional forms of financial aid,” the release stated.
These changes would also “expand access” to the communities and support systems found on college campuses, which have been shown to strengthen retention and graduation rates. The release stated that close to 48% of U.S. college students face housing insecurity, and 81% of those impacted by housing insecurity report “they would perform better academically if they had access to safe, reliable housing.”
“We can make college way more affordable, and this bill does that for countless Americans,” Landsman said in the release. “In fact, this will be transformative for students who have been historically left out and marginalized. Campus housing is an enormous expense for students, and our bill eliminates that expense for students who are eligible for housing vouchers.”

Police did not say when or where the image was captured.

Local, state, and federal officers continued to search for evidence near the campus Tuesday in their efforts to identify the man responsible for killing two students and wounding nine other people on Saturday around 4 p.m. 
Seven of the nine people treated for gunshot wounds remained at Rhode Island Hospital as of late Tuesday morning. Five were listed in critical stable condition, and one patient was listed in critical condition. One was listed as stable.
Law enforcement officials are relying on the public’s help to collect more information and surveillance recordings of the suspect. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the individual responsible.
Anyone who recognizes this individual, is asked by police to to contact the FBI through its online tip center or to call (401) 272-3121. 
Police released magnified video of the suspect at 4:30 p.m., ahead of press briefing scheduled for 5 p.m. at the Providence Public Safety Complex.
In the first video released Saturday night, a person dressed in dark clothing is seen walking away from the Barus and Holley engineering building from the Hope Street side and rounded the corner heading east on Waterman Street. He vanished into a residential neighborhood adjacent to the Ivy League campus.
FBI investigators early Tuesday afternoon walked along the suspect’s known path, rummaging through bushes, looking over fences, and interviewing residents outside the stately and Victorian-era homes near the crime scene.
 


While Brown University is dotted with cameras, there are few in the Barus and Holley building, multiple students told Rhode Island Current. 
Police were effectively the only people on campus Tuesday afternoon, with streets around Brown quiet as most students have left Providence.
Susan Alpert, who works the deli counter at the Metro Mart on Thayer Street, said the primary commercial hub for the university has effectively become a ghost town since Saturday.

“This is normally an incredibly busy time here,” she said in an interview.
Up the block at the Brown University bookstore, one employee who declined to give her name noted that finals tend to be quiet. The only difference is there’s now a university police officer present at its entrance.
“Rhode Island has long watched the national epidemic of mass gun violence from a painful distance. This weekend, that distance disappeared,” read a joint message to the community released Tuesday from Providence City Council President Rachel Miller, President Pro Tempore Juan M. Pichardo and Majority Leader Pedro J. Espinal. 
“As we grieve, we are now united with communities across the country — Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Orlando, Uvalde, and so many more — who know this kind of loss all too well. In time, we hope to honor the victims not only through remembrance, but by working together toward a safer world for everyone.”

‘They were at the beginning of a lot of things’
Brown University on Tuesday morning officially released the names of the two students who died in Saturday’s shooting in a message from President Christina Paxson. Ella Cook, 19, a sophomore from Mountain Brook, Alabama, and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, 18, of Midlothian, Virginia, a first-year student, were killed when the gunman entered a large auditorium where a review for an economics final was taking place.
Two Brown University students who lost their lives in campus shooting identified

“These were two young people whose amazing promise was extinguished too soon,” Paxson wrote. “Both were at or near the beginning of their Brown journey — actually, they were at the beginning of a lot of things.”
“Before releasing their names, it was important that we give their families some space to grieve, but now it is important that we never forget them,” Paxson continued. “I expect that, like me, many of you have begun reading about Ella and Mukhammad in news reports and on social media. None of those reports, nor anything that I share here, could ever begin to fully capture the totality of who they were, nor the enormity of who they never had the opportunity to become.”
Cook served as vice president of the Republican Club of Brown University and a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. An accomplished competitive pianist and church volunteer leader in her hometown near Birmingham, she was interested in French and Francophone studies.
Umurzokov dreamed of becoming a neurosurgeon and planned to concentrate in biochemistry and molecular biology. He was a U.S. dual citizen from Uzbekistan who graduated from Midlothian High School where he served as president of the school’s Model United Nations chapter and captain of the Scholastic Bowl team. 
“Both were brilliant and beloved — as members of our campus community, but even more by their friends and families,” Paxson wrote. “Our hearts continue to be with them in their profound sorrow.”
Brown support staff in Campus Life and student leaders of the Undergraduate Council of Students among others are contributing ideas for how the campus will join together as a community to memorialize Cook and Umurzokov after classes resume after winter break, Paxson said. Details will become available in the weeks ahead but for now, a virtual interfaith prayer service for Wednesday is planned.
A GoFundMe fundraiser for Umurzokov’s family had raised nearly $437,000 from 9,300 donors as of mid afternoon on Tuesday.

Foresta, a Democrat, is in the third year of his second term as sheriff. But he has been a law enforcement officer in Marion County since 1977.  In 2010, he was appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Indiana, overseeing federal law enforcement across 62 counties.
If elected to the state Senate, Forestal said he would prioritize “pragmatic, values-driven leadership” on issues like public safety and protecting working families from rising costs — including utilities and health care.
Forestal has received some recent criticism for working with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement and holding hundreds of detainees in the county jail.
As sheriff, he has advocated for a “common-sense approach” to public safety that addresses fundamental issues including mental health and addiction services in what many say is Indiana’s largest mental health facility – the Marion County Jail.
Forestal oversees the MCSO’s $150 million budget “with a focus on evidence-based violence prevention that keeps violent criminals behind bars while helping to ensure people can return to society as productive citizens after incarceration,” according to the news release.
The announcement also noted that the sheriff has been recognized for his office’s work on diversity and equity, and he was personally honored with the State Rep. Bill Crawford Legacy Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, in 2025.

The Santa hat is on display at the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson. (Photo submitted by the Cosmosphere)TOPEKA — The science behind Santa’s magical ability to traverse the world in one night to deliver toys and joy may always remain a mystery.
But possibly, the jolly old fellow might have picked up a tip or two when his hat took a flight aboard Space Shuttle Discovery during a Hubble Space Telescope mission, called STS-103, in 1999.
Whether the hat has any real magical vibes is up for debate, but anyone who is interested can visit the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson to check it out. 
“STS-103 holds a unique place in spaceflight history as the only one of NASA’s 135 Space Shuttle missions to take place during the Christmas holiday,” a news release from the Cosmosphere said. “To mark the occasion, the crew found small ways to bring holiday cheer with them into orbit, even as they prepared for one of the most important scientific servicing missions ever conducted.”
The Santa hat on display was worn by astronaut John Grunsfeld during a brief holiday celebration on the Space Shuttle Discovery’s middeck, the release said. 
“Grunsfeld and his fellow mission specialists then began their suit-up procedures to carry out a series of critical spacewalks to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope,” the news release said. 
STS-103 included three spacewalks and the replacement of key components on the telescope.

(Photo via Google Earth)An eastern Iowa veterinary hospital is suing its insurer in a dispute over the definition of an “animal.”
Animal Eye Consultants of Iowa, located in the Linn County town of Hiawatha, is suing Sentinel Insurance Co. in U.S. District Court, alleging breach of contract and bad faith.
According to its website, AECI provides clinical and hospital treatment for animals specifically related to vision and eye health.
The lawsuit alleges that about 8:15 a.m. on Nov. 7, 2024, an adult deer crashed through one of the hospital’s windows and entered the building. “The deer rampaged through the property’s interior spaces, destroying numerous veterinarian specialty equipment, as well as computers, screens, media devices, and other pertinent veterinarian supplies,” the lawsuit claims.
Later that day, AECI’s chief executive, Dr. Sinisa Grozdanic, filed an insurance claim with the hospital’s insurer, Sentinel. The insurance company then sent a hired adjuster to the hospital to assess the damage and prepare an initial financial estimate of the loss.
The insurer later sent an estimate to Grozdanic, who concluded the adjuster did not have the knowledge or expertise to estimate the loss, according to the lawsuit. AECI then contacted actuarial experts in an attempt to secure estimates of what it perceived to be the actual damages sustained by the business.
According to the lawsuit, Sentinel then expressed its view that portions of AECI’s claims were excluded under the supplemental policy that theoretically provided an additional $350,000 in coverage for damage to computers and computer equipment.
That supplemental policy allegedly lists specific exclusions, stating in part, “We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from … insects, birds, rodents, or other animals.”
The lawsuit states that AECI countered with various legal opinions indicating the exclusion was “not meant for large, wild animals causing physical damage to the property, but instead was designed to eliminate liability for the insurer should an infestation of similar nuisance animals be discovered on the property after a mechanical failure.”
The lawsuit cites legal rulings that indicate when “general words follow an enumeration of specific items, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those enumerated.”
Interpreting the insurance policy, as Sentinel has, so that the phrase “other animals” includes a large, noninvasive wild deer to be similar or reasonably similar in nature to insects, birds and rodents is “improper, and Sentinel’s misinterpretation was purposeful, and intended to cause harm to AECI,” the lawsuit alleges.
With the dispute still unresolved, losses at the hospital continue to accrue, the lawsuit claims.
Sentinel has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was originally filed Oct. 31, 2025, in Linn County District Court before being moved to federal court this week.

John William's livestream)John Williams, a Democrat representing Monongalia County in the West Virginia House of Delegates, will run for a seat in the state Senate in 2026, he announced Tuesday.
Williams livestreamed the announcement to run for 13th district made at his kitchen table, a choice he said underscores his focus on the “kitchen table issues” facing West Virginia families:  cost of living, child care, housing, health care costs and other financial decisions that families make.
“At the end of the day, most of the decisions people care about don’t happen in the Capitol — they happen at the kitchen table,” Williams said in a news release. “Families are trying to figure out how to afford groceries, child care, housing, health care, and utilities. My campaign is about meeting people where they actually live — not just geographically, but economically.”
Williams, a financial advisor from Morgantown, was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2016. The 2026 legislative session will be his 10th as a member of the House. 
His decision to run for Senate comes as the Democratic Party plans an aggressive push to win seats in state Legislatures across the country. Democrats currently make up only two members in the 34-member Senate and nine in the House of Delegates, which has 100 members.
The 13th Senate district includes parts of Marion and Monongalia counties and is currently represented by Republican Sen. Mike Oliverio, a longtime lawmaker and a Morgantown financial advisor. During the last election in 2022, he narrowly defeated Democrat candidate Barbara Fleischauer, pulling in 13,459 votes to Fleischauer’s 13,297, according to reporting by the Dominion Post. 
Oliverio has filed as a pre-candidate and announced his intention to run for re-election in 2026. 
“I love this job and I love serving the people of Monongalia and Marion Counties of District 13 as a member of the State Senate,” he wrote on Facebook. “I humbly ask for your vote in the May 2026 primary and hopefully again in the November General Election. I look forward to a productive session in the Senate next January to continue to fight for an even better West Virginia.”
The official candidate filing period for the 2026 election runs from Jan. 12 through 31. There were no other pre-candidates listed for the seat as of Tuesday.

(Photo: Brandon Hull/Office of the Governor)Tennessee farmers and forest owners who suffered agricultural losses due to Hurricane Helene will receive $38.1 million in assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
The funding will cover infrastructure and timber losses, future economic losses and market losses, the USDA announced on Dec. 12. The funds will be administered to eligible farmers by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture.
“This block grant funding recognizes the unique challenges faced by Tennessee’s agricultural producers in the wake of Hurricane Helene and will help cover a wide range of critical current needs as well as setbacks still to come,” Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Andy Holt said in a news release.
The funds come from $30 billion earmarked for disaster relief block grants in 14 states — including Tennessee — under the American Relief Act of 2025. 
Carter, Cocke, Greene, Hamblen, Hawkins, Johnson, Unicoi and Washington counties are covered under the program, according to the state.
Assistance will be distributed to applicants as a lump sum. A minimum of 10 acres under single ownership is required to qualify. Verified damage must exceed a minimum of $1,000. For timber producers, a minimum of 15% of their acreage must be affected.
The amount given to each applicant will depend on funding and applications received, and will be capped at 90% of applicants’ reported loss. Applicants who have received other federal funding for Hurricane Helene relief can still apply for assistance under this program, but only if they haven’t yet reached the 90% cap.
Registration and application dates have yet to be announced. The Tennessee Department of Agriculture and USDA are developing a plan to administer the funds, according to the state. Once the USDA approves Tennessee’s plan, application information will be updated on the Tennessee Department of Agriculture’s website. Applicants will then have 90 days to apply.
Landowners affected by Hurricane Helene can gather documents they will need in the meantime, including proof of ownership or control of land, proof of producer eligibility, documentation of losses and financial and tax documentation.
Farmers seeking future economic or market loss assistance must purchase Federal Crop Insurance or Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) coverage for 2026 and 2027 and confirm with NAP eligibility or Whole Farm Revenue Protection options with their local Farm Service Agency office.
This Tennessee assistance program is in addition to a round of disaster relief announced by the USDA in November for farmers nationwide who suffered losses from natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.
Separately, the USDA on Dec. 8 announced $12 billion in “bridge” payments for farmers hurt by trade disruption and high costs in the 2025 crop year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-16 21:02:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Aquarion to seek 42% rate increase after regulators block sale,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/16/aquarion-rate-increase-1216/,The request comes after PURA regulators blocked a deal that would have transformed Aquarian into a nonprofit quasi-public entity.,"Connecticut’s largest water company, Aquarion, announced its intention to seek a 42% rate increase on Monday after state regulators last month blocked a deal that would have transformed the company into a nonprofit quasi-public entity.
The proposed rate hike, worth $88 million annually, would be first in more than a decade for the company, which serves roughly 209,000 homes and businesses in Connecticut. 
It comes on the heels of last month’s decision by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to reject the proposed sale of Aquarion to the South Central Regional Water Authority, a quasi-public utility based in New Haven. The sale would have created a sister utility, the Aquarion Water Authority, to operate the company’s assets.
While Aquarion’s owner, Eversource, is appealing the ruling, company officials said they’ve been left with no other choice than to raise rates in order to offset rising operating costs.
In a letter to PURA on Monday announcing the company’s plan, Aquarion Chief Operating Officer Lucy Teixiera placed the blame for the proposed rate hike squarely on regulators for rejecting the sale, which, Aquarion said, would have saved customers money.
“Aquarion’s sale to AWA provided PURA with a rare and unique opportunity to shield customers from these increasing costs,” Teixiera’s letter said. “A decision approving the transaction would have enabled AWA to own and operate Aquarion, thereby obviating the need for the immediate filing of this rate amendment with PURA.”
A spokesperson for Eversource declined to provide additional comment on the letter Tuesday.
Critics of the proposed sale — worth a total of $2.4 billion, including debt — argued that it would have saddled both RWA and Aquarion customers with higher costs, as well as the loss of oversight from PURA, which regulates only privately owned utilities. In addition, local officials in many of the towns within Aquarion’s service areas raised concerns about the loss of future tax revenues from the utility’s equipment.
The letter served as formal notice that Aquarion plans to submit an application for a rate increase within 60 days. If approved, the new rates would go into effect on Nov. 1, 2026.
As part of their bid to gain approval for the sale, RWA officials pledged not seek an rate increase on Aquarion’s customers for at least six months. Beginning in 2027, they projected that the utility’s customers would see annual increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade — a far slower pace of increases than the 42% hike sought Monday.
PURA’s decision to reject the sale focused largely on concerns over the new entity’s governing structure, rather than its finances or ability to provide safe, drinkable water to customers. 
In a statement Monday, Attorney General William Tong compared Aquarion’s plans to the company’s last request for a $37 million rate increase in 2022. 
Instead of approving that request, PURA ordered the company to cut its rates by nearly $2 million, a decrease of 11%. After failing to support its “bloated claims,” in that case, Tong said Eversource tried and failed to offload Aquarian.
“PURA was right to reject that bad idea as well,” Tong said. “Now they are back seeking an even bigger rate hike for Aquarion. We’re going to do what we always do — comb through every line and every page of their filings to ensure Connecticut families aren’t paying a penny more than they need to.”
Claire Coleman, the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of state’s utility customers, was also critical of Aquarion’s justification for the proposed rate hike. 
“While OCC understands that ongoing investment is necessary to provide safe, reliable water service, the scale of the increase Aquarion is signaling is significantly above my team’s initial internal analysis as well as the company’s own recent estimates,” Coleman said in a statement. “Once the application is filed, our review will focus solely on what the evidence supports. The notice of intent reads more like a list of grievances than a legal filing, but rates are set by evidence, not indignation.”
In her letter PURA, Teixiera pointed to factors to justify the proposed rate increase, including rising costs related to the treatment of PFAS chemicals and more than $448 million spent on water infrastructure since the company’s last rate case.
The letter made no mention of Marissa Gillett, the former head of PURA, who is at the center of a long-running dispute between the utility companies and their regulators in Connecticut. Gillett led the authority at the time that PURA ordered Aquarion to cut its water rates in 2023.
Later, the company participated in a lawsuit claiming that Gillett had abused her authority by issuing unilateral decisions and boxing out her fellow commissioners. Gillett resigned in October, shortly before attorneys in Tong’s office conceded that many of the utilities’ claims were true.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saugatuck.jpg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

The CAI[...]","Hiba Rahim, interim executive director for CAIR-Florida, speaking in Tampa on Dec. 16, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil-rights organization, has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ executive order issued last week designating the group as a “terrorist organization.” CAIR is asking the court to block the executive order and declare it unconstitutional.
The CAIR-Foundation and CAIR-Florida filed the lawsuit in the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee on Monday.
DeSantis issued his executive order on Dec. 8, designating CAIR a “terrorist organization.” The order directed Florida’s executive and Cabinet agencies, as well as every county and city, to deny local or state contracts, employment, funding, benefits, or privileges to CAIR and anyone known to provide “material support” to CAIR, including “expert advice or assistance.”
The order directs the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) to undertake “all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities in Florida” against terrorist organizations designated in Section 1 of the executive order, which includes the Muslim Brotherhood.
“This executive order does not present facts, it does not cite investigations, it does not point to any criminal findings. It simply declares guilt by proclamation,” said Hiba Rahim, interim executive director for CAIR-Florida, during a press conference at the organization’s Tampa headquarters Tuesday.
“It does not matter whether you agree or disagree with our policies or our advocacy. What should concern every American is the implication of allowing a government official to apply criminal designations without due process. This is not how things work in America. In this country, allegations come with evidence and evidence is tested in court. And it is judges, not politicians, who decide what is lawful.”
CAIR has never been declared a foreign terrorist organization by any federal agency.
In alleging that DeSantis has violated the Constitution, the lawsuit contends that he has:

Illegally usurped the exclusive authority of the federal government to designate American organizations as terrorist groups based on allegations of material support for foreign terrorist groups.
Violated the Constitution’s guarantee of due process by unilaterally designating CAIR a criminal actor and then ordering immediate punitive, discriminatory action against CAIR and its supporters without any chance to appeal that punishment or designation.
Violated the Constitution’s guarantee of free speech by punishing Americans who seek to provide CAIR with material support, including speech in the form “assistance” and “advice,” and retaliating against CAIR for speech he finds objectionable, including the organization’s past lawsuit against him and its activism in support of Palestinian human rights.

CAIR-Florida and DeSantis do have a history in the courts. In November 2023, one month after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas against Israel, CAIR National and CAIR-Florida filed suit against Florida officials including DeSantis, challenging state directives to deactivate Students for Justice in Palestine chapters at Florida public universities. In January 2024, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the case was not valid because the ban had not been enforced.
Florida joins Texas
During Tuesday’s news conference, CAIR officials said that in filing the lawsuit, they weren’t just standing up for Muslim rights, but constitutional rights for others as well, and noted that they have been joined in the lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Muslim Legal Fund of America, and the Michigan law firm Akeel & Valentine.
Saying the executive order calls on the FDLE and FHP to prevent all “unlawful activity” by CAIR, attorney Omar Saleh added that he thought such laws were already in place. “But Gov. DeSantis wants to add additional penalties, just in case you’re Muslim or if you support a Muslim group, and it doesn’t work that way in this country,” he said.
DeSantis’ executive order listing both CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood as “terrorist organizations” came three weeks after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a proclamation prohibiting CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood and its members from purchasing or acquiring land in the state, accusing them of supporting terrorism and undermining Texas laws through harassment, intimidation, and violence.
On Nov. 24, President Trump issued an executive order that sets in motion a process by which certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood “shall be considered for designation as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.” CAIR has previously said that it has no association with the Muslim Brotherhood.
Texas U.S. Republican Sen. John Cornyn announced Monday that he wants to eliminate CAIR’s tax-exempt status as a 501(c)3 nonprofit, saying in a written statement that the group “is a radical group of terrorist sympathizers with a long history of undermining American values.”
CAIR was established in 1994 and now has 25 chapters around the state, including in Tampa and Miami. CAIR officials were asked Tuesday to speculate about why they are now being targeted by two states and a U.S. senator.
“This has been happening much longer than a month ago, but it’s picking up a lot more because public officials are being more brazen in showing what their true thoughts are about Islam and Muslims,” said Saleh. “When Texas happened, we knew Florida would be coming, because we know that’s what the governor’s sentiment is.”
Thania Clevenger, national chief operating officer for CAIR, agreed that negative allegations regarding the organization aren’t new, but said they have been growing steadily since the Hamas attack on Israel two years ago.
“The impact against the community has been growing steadily since Oct. 7 with the Palestinian movement,” she said. “Our work has been effective. We have sued governors across the country who are ‘Israeli First.’ And so that action has brought more scrutiny to CAIR.”
‘Discovery rights’
When asked for comment, the governor’s press office sent the Phoenix previous statements DeSantis has made over the past week on social media and in person regarding his decision to issue the executive order.
“I welcome the lawsuit because what will happen is, that will give the state of Florida discovery rights to be able to subpoena the bank records. … And honestly, it gives us even more reason. … And so this is something that our attorney general is ready, willing and able to fighting on this, DeSantis said on Dec. 9 in North Miami Beach.
“They have every right to sue, and then we’re going to have a right to get the information that we need to make sure. But our agencies are on notice about how any of our programs or any of our operations are impacted, or not impacted, and so to the extent that they can be, then they’re going to have a basis to be able to protect the people and the taxpayers from that.”
DeSantis added in that press conference that “people forget CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation trial, the largest terror financing trial in the history of the United States of America. If there were any other situation where that happened, then people would be up in arms, but somehow that’s something that just gets forgotten.”
“A lot of it is financial,” he went to say. “That’s why I think a lawsuit is something that we very much welcome for that.”
That was a reference to a 2008 federal conviction of five former leaders of a U.S.-based Muslim charity named the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development.
CAIR had been included in the list of un-indicted co-conspirators in the case. The organization was not indicted, however, and on its website CAIR says that “the U.S. Attorney who led the Holy Land Foundation case confirmed decisions to indict were based only on evidence and law — not politics.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-5-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-16 16:57:58.647815

We are moving more quickly than ever before to put new strategies in place to […],"Minnesota Capitol. (Photo by Minnesota House Public Information Services)The Minnesota Department of Human Services announced Tuesday it will soon pause licensing of new adult day care centers as the Walz administration expands its probe of fraud in human services programs.
“We are not just talking about reducing fraud. We are moving more quickly than ever before to put new strategies in place to get ahead of the criminals stealing from taxpayers,” temporary DHS Commissioner Shireen Gandhi said at a Tuesday news conference.
The announcement comes the day before the state House fraud committee is scheduled to hear testimony about adult day care services.
The agency said the licensing pause will likely last for two years — from Feb. 1, 2026 through Jan. 31, 2028 — and will allow regulators to focus on oversight of existing licensed providers. The agency may make exceptions for new providers in working with counties, tribes and managed care organizations.
The number of adult day cares, which provide meals and activities for disabled adults during the day, already have capacity for about 3,000 more people than currently receive services. That capacity has increased by 43% over the past five years even though there was only a 7% increase in the yearly average number of Medicaid participants, Gandhi said.
This is the second time DHS has leveraged its new authority — granted by the Legislature earlier this year — to pause licensing if it finds new applications are growing beyond program needs. More licensing pauses are likely on the way, DHS Inspector General James Clark said.
A rapid increase in demand for services has been a signature feature of human services later found to be rife with fraud. For instance, payments to autism therapy providers increased 3,000% from 2018 to 2023, the Reformer was first to report.
DHS officials initially said they were neither surprised nor disturbed by the rapid growth, noting it was in line with the growth of Housing Stabilization Services, a program Gov. Tim Walz would eventually shut down entirely earlier this year, citing suspicions of widespread fraud.
DHS is also investigating reports of kickbacks in the adult day care program, in which service recipients were allegedly paid to switch from one provider to another, Clark said.
“Kickbacks are a sign that there’s an oversaturation of providers,” Clark said. “When there is not a way to drum up legitimate business, providers try to drum up illegitimate business.”
DHS has recovered “several hundred thousand dollars” from adult day centers in recent years and referred more than 100 providers across Medicaid-funded service programs to law enforcement for criminal investigations this year, Clark said.
Some providers warn the Walz administration’s heavy-handed approach will hurt legitimate services providers and the disabled people they serve.
After years of sluggish response to reported fraud, the issue now hangs heavy over Walz as he seeks an unprecedented third four-year term against a bevy of Republican challengers. Among them: Rep. Kristin Robbins, who chairs the House fraud committee that meets Wednesday.
Recent national coverage has also rocketed the issue beyond Minnesota’s borders, attracting the attention of President Donald Trump and his cabinet.
The Walz administration has responded in recent months with a series of actions aimed at clamping down on the flow of government funds to providers deemed suspicious.
DHS catalogued in a press release the steps they’ve taken to address fraud this year, including terminating Housing Stabilization Services, hiring the health care company Optum to audit billing in 14 “high-risk” services and pausing licenses for Home and Community-based Services, which include group homes for people with disabilities.
The agency has also disenrolled around 800 inactive providers in “high-risk” programs and moved 11 Medicaid benefits into a “high-risk classification,” which allows regulators to increase scrutiny including through unannounced site visits and other oversight actions.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/596812282_1290057636490087_3676829915866584955_n-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-12-16 15:57:50.580616

Laura Kelly predicted Tuesday the 2026 Legislature wouldn’t muster enough political support to implement a new congressional district map splitting Johnson County and making it easier to defeat Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids in the midterm election.
Kelly, the two-term Democrat entering her final year as governor, said the political landscape in Kansas appeared unchanged since House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, conceded in November he lacked enough signatures from Kansas House members to trigger a special session on redistricting.
While Hawkins fell about 10 signatures short of the required supermajority needed to convene in special session, enough Kansas Senate Republicans signed a petition to authorize a special session devoted to congressional mapping. The GOP leadership’s objective has been to implement a Kansas map to oust Davids, the state’s lone Democrat in the federal delegation, without threatening the three incumbent Kansas Republicans in Congress.
The administration of President Donald Trump urged GOP-led states to gerrymander enough districts so Republicans could remain in control of the U.S. House.
Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said their strategy would be to consider redistricting when the 2026 Legislature convened Jan. 12 for its regular session.
“In some ways, I’ll be surprised if they even really bring it up,” Kelly said in an interview with Kansas Reflector. “I don’t think a lot has changed in terms of where legislators stand on the issue.”
Kelly said it was interesting Hawkins couldn’t convince the minimum of 84 House members to sign a special session petition, because her years serving as a state senator demonstrated legislators were more inclined to authorize debate on a topic than to vote for an actual bill. While it would take simple majorities of 63 votes in the House and 21 votes in the Senate to pass a new map, a veto by Kelly would lead to a scramble for 84 votes in the House and 27 votes in the Senate to secure the supermajority required for a veto override of the governor.
“There are times when legislators will vote for a process and then turn around and vote against the action,” Kelly said. “I would be very surprised if they were able to get that passed with the veto-proof majority.”
The governor said the political appetite for mid-decade redistricting in Kansas resembled that of Indiana, where Republicans recently defeated a push by Trump to change that state’s congressional map.
“The people spoke out very loudly there,” Kelly said. “While we haven’t had people in the rotunda discussing redistricting, all the polling has shown that it’s not popular in Kansas. It’s not something people are interested in. People really want the Legislature to deal with the issues that impact them day-to-day.”
In a recent interview at a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council, Masterson said he was confident the Legislature would work through redistricting challenges in the upcoming session.
“We’ll have no trouble for sure passing a new map with majorities,” said Masterson, who is a GOP candidate for governor.
Hawkins, who is seeking the GOP nomination for state insurance commissioner, said he was less confident the Legislature would cobble together the GOP coalition necessary to implement a new congressional map.
Davids, a four-term Democrat serving the Kansas City area, has condemned the attempt by Republicans to cave to special interests demanding mid-decade redistricting in Kansas. The current congressional district boundaries in Kansas were changed in 2022 to reflect population shifts and the GOP’s desire to undercut Davids, but the new approach would seek to weaken Davids’ reelection odds by cutting Johnson County in half.
In anticipation of the remapping battle, the Legislature spent $43,000 to acquire software and training to prepare for redrawing to congressional boundaries.
“It’s outrageous that politicians in Topeka secretly used Kansans’ hard-earned tax dollars to silence the very people footing the bill — all for a map folks haven’t seen and a process they’ve been cut out of,” she said.
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, told KMUW the tradition of amending congressional maps once each decade to comply with population changes should be retained in Kansas.
“There’s a bit of fairness that I think ought to be preserved about this issue,” Moran told KMUW. “We have a practice that we’ve utilized for a long period of time. We reapportion at that census moment, and that makes sense to me.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC160845-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-16 15:57:50.580616

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, challenging the corps’ decision to grant a permit allowing the oil company Enbridge to reroute its Line 5 pipeline around the tribe’s reservation in northern Wisconsin
The lawsuit, filed in the Washington D.C. federal circuit court, is another step in the long legal history of the Enbridge pipeline and the company’s effort to move it from its current route through the tribe’s land. The tribe is asking that the permit approval be vacated. 
In October, the corps approved Enbridge’s permit to reroute the pipeline off the reservation despite significant public opposition. 
The new route moves the pipeline south but it still runs across land on three sides of the reservation and crosses the Bad River upstream of the reservation. The permit was approved as the administration of President Donald Trump has moved to more aggressively support oil and natural gas projects. Earlier in the year, the corps approved a fast-tracked permitting process for Enbridge to construct a tunnel across the Straits of Mackinac so Line 5 can cross from Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to its Lower Peninsula. 
The tribe’s lawsuit alleges that the corps violated the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Water Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by not properly conducting required environmental reviews or following the proper procedures. 
“For hundreds of years, and to this day, the Band’s ancestors and members have lived, hunted, fished, trapped, gathered, and engaged in traditional activities in the wetlands and waters to be crossed by the Project,” the lawsuit states. “The Project would encircle the Reservation on three sides and damage areas the Band highly values for their ecological and cultural significance. The Corps’ failure to properly review and address the Project’s environmental impacts to wetlands and waterways harms the Band’s interest in maintaining its Reservation homeland and resources in the ceded territory.”
The lawsuit alleges that the corps violated the NEPA by not giving proper consideration to the “environmental effects of construction, maintenance, and operation of the Project,” including how it will harm the health of resources on and near the reservation. 
Under the Clean Water Act, the corps cannot approve permits until the state or tribal government responsible for water quality in the project area certifies the project won’t harm the local water. While the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources did previously approve the state permits for the Line 5 reroute, those permits are currently being challenged in a separate legal process. 
The tribe alleges in the lawsuit that the corps should not have moved forward with its permits until after the state process is complete.  
[The corps] violated the Clean Water Act by issuing the Permit without ensuring that construction and maintenance of the Project would not adversely affect Wisconsin and the Band’s water quality,” the lawsuit states. “This includes issuing a … permit while the required … state water quality certification is not yet final, pending state administrative proceedings; without addressing the inadequacies the Band identified with Wisconsin’s Water Quality Certification; or ensuring compliance with the Band’s water quality standards.” 
The lawsuit also states the permit approval does not address how the project construction will affect the tribe’s “ability to exercise treaty-protected rights to hunt, fish, trap, and gather in ceded territory,” “failed to evaluate the risks and impacts of oil spills along the pipeline route” and “failed to evaluate the risks and impacts of blasting as a construction method.” 
In a statement, tribe chairwoman Elizabeth Arbuckle said the tribe would do whatever it can to protect the health of the Bad River, Lake Superior and surrounding watersheds. 
“For more than a decade, we have had to endure the unlawful trespass of a dangerous oil pipeline on our lands and waters,” Arbuckle said. “The reroute only makes matters worse. Enbridge’s history is full of accidents and oil spills. If that happens here, our Tribe and other communities in the Northwoods will suffer unacceptable consequences. From the Bad River to Lake Superior, our waters are the lifeblood of our Reservation. They have fed and nurtured our Tribe for hundreds of years. We will do everything in our power to protect them.”
Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in an email that while the Army Corps made an initial permit decision, it has not been signed by the corps or the company and therefore isn’t a final decision that can be challenged in court. She said the company would intervene in the lawsuit to defend the permit approval. 
“Enbridge submitted permit applications to state and federal regulators in early 2020 to build a new segment of pipeline around the Bad River Reservation,” she said. “Enbridge’s permit applications are supported by thorough and extensive environmental analysis and modeling by leading third-party experts confirming project construction impacts will be temporary and isolated, with no adverse effect to water quality or wetlands.”

Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller said the $68.2 million funding distribution is a record high amount, due to a combination of increased timber sales and low expenses.
“We saw increased revenue from endowment lands this past fiscal year mostly through the increase in our timber harvest level over time,” Miller said. “Also, one thing I am proud of is that while our revenue is going up, expenses are staying relatively flat. This is an added benefit to the beneficiaries.”
The Idaho Constitution requires Idaho to manage state endowment lands so they generate the maximum financial return for beneficiaries. There are nine different endowment fund beneficiaries, the largest of which is the state’s K-12 public school system. Other beneficiaries include colleges and universities, state veteran homes, state hospitals, the Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind and correction facilities. 
While public schools will see $68.2 million in funding, the total funding distribution for all beneficiaries was nearly $110.4 million, the Idaho Department of Lands announced in a press release issued last week.
During ceremonies Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, Miller presented the ceremonial $68.2 million check to Gov. Brad Little and other state officials as the Capital Singers choir from Capital High School performed Christmas carols in the Capitol rotunda.

The $68.2 million is a fraction of the $2.6 billion general fund maintenance budget that Idaho legislators set for K-12 public schools for the current fiscal year. But every dollar counts when the state budget is projected to have a $40 million deficit in the current fiscal year 2026 and a $555 budget deficit for next year in fiscal year 2027.
After the ceremonies, Miller told the Idaho Capital Sun that increases in timber harvests on state endowment lands helped pay for the funding distribution. Miller said revenue has grown by an average of 2.6% a year since 2016, while expenses have grown by just 1.6% over the same time, Miller said. 
“After ramping up to 330 million board feet of volume sold annually, we have begun to realize the increased income from timber,” Miller said. “There has been some increase on the land leasing side, but most of the increase in land income came from timber.”
When Idaho became a state, Congress granted Idaho about 3.6 million acres of state endowment land for the purpose of providing funding for beneficiaries, such as the K-12 public school system. After some land has been sold off and consolidated, Idaho now has about 2.5 million acres of state endowment land. 
The Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners – often simply referred to as the Land Board – manages those endowment lands for the beneficiaries. Sources of revenue generated from state endowment lands include timber harvests and sales, land leases, sales and mineral leases.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota leaders appointed Jared Huibregtse to the North Dakota Ethics Commission on Tuesday, ending a nearly two-month stalemate over who to appoint to an open four-year seat on the commission.
Huibregtse is a Mandan resident and project manager for an engineering firm. 
The selection committee consists of Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan.
Hogue and Hogan supported reappointing commissioner Murray Sagsveen, which Armstrong firmly opposed.
Sagsveen withdrew his name from consideration in a Thursday letter to Armstrong.
Ethics Commission member withdraws application to serve another term

Huibregtse was among seven finalists for the position. Thirty-nine people applied for three open positions. 
Huibregtse said in a Tuesday interview he has accepted the appointment. He plans to attend the Ethics Commission’s next meeting on Wednesday.
“I’m just looking forward to digging in,” he said.
In an interview with the selection committee, Huibregtse said he wants to help the commission find clarity on areas where there is disagreement, like the scope of its authority.
“I don’t have a problem being the only one with a dissenting opinion,” he said.
Huibregtse manages water infrastructure projects at engineering firm Bartlett & West, according to his resume.
“I think we all felt he was fully qualified,” Hogan said during a selection committee meeting on Tuesday.
He formerly worked for the North Dakota Department of Water Resources and was in the North Dakota National Guard.
North Dakota attorney general voids ethics opinion, says agency lacked authority

The committee recently appointed former Office of Management and Budget Director Pam Sharp and Fargo attorney Mark Western to two other open seats on the commission.
Sagsveen’s term ended Aug. 31, but he stayed on the commission while the committee was deciding who would take his position.
Armstrong previously said he opposed reappointing Sagsveen because he feels the Ethics Commission needs a “general reset.” The governor has expressed concerns that the Ethics Commission has overstepped its jurisdiction, and was especially critical of an advisory opinion the commission issued related to campaign finance. The North Dakota Attorney General on Friday voided the advisory opinion, finding that it could not advise on “general questions of law.”
Hogue and Hogan had strongly supported Sagsveen, in part to promote continuity on the five-member commission. Sagsveen had not commented publicly about the process until withdrawing last week.
“It has dragged on for several months and it’s in the best interest of the Ethics Commission that a person be appointed for a full four-year term,” Sagsveen told the North Dakota Monitor on Friday. “It was obvious to me that it was an impasse.”
The selection committee members discussed changing their procedures to make the commissioner appointment process smoother in the future. Armstrong recommended starting the application process earlier, for instance.
All three committee members also thanked Sagsveen for his service.
“I didn’t want this meeting to close without recognizing his extraordinary service,” Hogue said.

Miller and Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/proposition-50-republican-lawsuit-hearing/,"Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping a panel of federal judges in Los Angeles will halt the new Prop. 50 maps from taking effect. But given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling greenlighting Texas’s redrawn maps, their odds are long.","In summary
Republicans and the Trump administration are hoping a panel of federal judges in Los Angeles will halt the new Prop. 50 maps from taking effect. But given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling greenlighting Texas’s redrawn maps, their odds are long.


Just last week California’s secretary of state officially certified that nearly two-thirds of Californians voted to pass Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to temporarily gerrymander the state’s congressional maps in favor of Democrats.
Nevertheless, Republicans and the Trump administration are hopeful that a federal district court panel meeting in Los Angeles this week will intervene to bar the state from using the new maps next year. 
California Republicans, who sued Newsom and Secretary of State Shirley Weber the day after the election, are staking their challenge on the argument that California’s primary mapmaker illegally used race as a factor in drawing district lines, giving Latino and Hispanic voters outsize influence at the expense of other racial and ethnic groups, including white voters. 
This, the Republicans argue, means the maps amount to an illegal racial gerrymander and a violation of the 14th and 15th amendments. Although Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act allows for race-conscious redistricting, they add, case law and judicial precedent have set a strict standard that requires a minority group to prove they have been systematically outvoted by a majority that consistently votes together to deny the minority their chosen candidate. 
But the Prop. 50 opponents’ odds look slim, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority recently blessed Texas’s new maps, overturning a lower court’s finding that Republicans there had engaged in unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. 
“It is indisputable that the impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple,” wrote conservative Justice Samuel Alito in a concurring opinion supported by Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas. 
And then there’s the looming possibility that the Supreme Court, in a separate case, could outlaw entirely the use of race in the redistricting process, which could render California’s new maps — as well as the previous ones drawn by the independent citizens commission — unconstitutional. That would also give Republicans a major advantage in Southern states, where several districts drawn to increase Black Americans’ voting power are currently represented by Democrats. 
Despite the long odds, the ailing California GOP has run out of other options for resistance. The passage of Prop. 50 is likely to mark the beginning of the end for several of California’s Republican House members, who have been forced to decide whether to run in their current, now less favorable Republican districts, switch to new seats or drop out entirely. 
One of them, Rep. Darrell Issa, who represents parts of San Diego County, even considered relocating to Texas and running for a Dallas-area seat that would be more friendly to Republicans, but the president reportedly refused to endorse him for the already contested Texas seat, so he decided to stay. 
The legal challenge claims the Prop. 50 maps cause “stigmatic and representational injury” by placing certain candidates, such as Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, who is Polynesian, into districts drawn with a specific racial or ethnic minority group in mind.
Case is in Los Angeles court this week
The challengers, who include Tangipa, the California Republican Party, several Republican voters and the Trump White House, are asking a three-judge panel for the Central District of California to grant a preliminary injunction on the maps before Dec. 19, the date when candidates can start collecting signatures to get their names on the 2026 primary ballot. A preliminary injunction would temporarily prevent the maps from being used in an election.
On Monday in court, the Republican challengers presented their case, arguing that since supporters of Prop. 50 publicly touted that the maps increased representation for Latino voters, state lawmakers and consultant Paul Mitchell, who was hired to draw the maps, took race into account. Therefore, they must justify how their new districts meet the standard for permissible racial gerrymanders, attorneys argued.
“It is legal to race-based redistrict under the Voter Rights Act. Section 2 protects it. But it also gives you guidelines,” Tangipa told CalMatters in an interview after testifying in court on Monday in Los Angeles. “In Sacramento, they did not follow those guidelines.”
Tangipa asserted that even though Democratic lawmakers intended primarily to increase their party’s ranks based on political ideology, “They used race to justify that end goal.”
The plaintiffs sought to have Mitchell testify, but the court denied a request to force him to take the stand to explain whether he intentionally tried to increase the voting power of specific racial and ethnic groups. Since Mitchell lives more than 100 miles away from the court, he was out of the reach of a subpoena. Still, the judges questioned his blanket use of “legislative privilege” to resist producing documents the plaintiffs requested.
At one point, as a redistricting expert testified, the plaintiffs focused on a line from Democratic former Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire’s public statement after the Legislature passed the package of bills paving the way for the Nov. 4 special election. 
“The new map makes no changes to historic Black districts in Oakland and the Los Angeles area, and retains and expands Voting Rights Act districts that empower Latino voters to elect their candidates of choice,” McGuire’s statement said. 
McGuire announced last month that he will challenge Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa in one of the newly configured Prop. 50 seats.
But proponents of the new maps argue they intended purely to create a partisan advantage for Democrats, and any increase in voting power for certain ethnic or racial groups was incidental. 
Ultimately, ‘it was endorsed by the voters’
Also complicating the GOP’s challenge is that California voters overwhelmingly approved the maps.
“Even if we assume that the Legislature improperly considered race, ultimately it went into effect because it was endorsed by the voters,” Emily Rong Zhang, an assistant professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law, previously told CalMatters. “They would have to show that the voters had the intent to create districts that disproportionately favor the voting power of a racial group over another.”
One unknown is how the Supreme Court will rule on a case that questions whether it’s constitutional to even consider race as a factor when redistricting.
The justices are weighing in another ongoing case, Louisiana v. Callais, whether to strike down a part of the federal Voting Rights Act that requires the creation of districts in which racial and ethnic minorities have a chance to elect their preferred candidate. If the ruling is retroactive, a decision to strike it down could invalidate both California’s old and new maps. 
Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, other states have jumped into the redistricting effort or are contemplating entering the fray. In addition to Texas and California, four other states have already implemented new congressional maps, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Virginia, Maryland and Florida have also taken some steps toward redistricting.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092525-Redistricting-Day-2-LV-CM-30.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 15:57:50.580616

Jeff Landry’s administration confirmed the sudden end of a $4.2 billion Medicaid contract that provides health insurance to more than 330,000 people, state officials backed off their original plan and said they would seek an extension of the arrangement through March instead. (Michelle Liu/Verite)Just a week after Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration confirmed the sudden end of a $4.2 billion Medicaid contract that provides health insurance to more than 330,000 people, state officials backed off their original plan and said they would seek an extension of the arrangement through March instead. 
The state will continue to work with UnitedHealthcare of Louisiana to provide Medicaid coverage if the company agrees to a short-term supplemental contract. The arrangement would be worth approximately $561 million and go through the first 90 days of 2026, Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said.
UnitedHealthcare could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon.  

The extension would mean the 330,000 people with UnitedHealthcare Medicaid plans would not have to be transferred to another insurance provider before the end of the year. 
The Landry administration eased up on the abrupt contract cancellation in response to pressure from several state senators during a hastily called legislative hearing on the arrangement Tuesday. 

The senators questioned whether the Landry administration would be able to shift hundreds of thousands of people from one Medicaid plan to another over the next two weeks without massive disruptions. They worried that Medicaid recipients — as well as hospitals, doctors and other medical providers who treat Medicaid patients — were not prepared for such a massive overhaul during the holiday season. 
The change of course over UnitedHealthcare is the second time this month Landry’s health department has reversed the cancellation of a Medicaid contract worth billions. 

On Dec. 2, the health department sent notices to UnitedHealthcare and Aetna Better Health of Louisiana announcing their contracts would be abruptly terminated at the end of the year. The health department then reinstated a one-year contract extension with Aetna on Dec. 9, a few hours after a news story about the ending of the contracts was published. 

Attorney General Liz Murrill has been behind the push for the state to terminate its relationship with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna. Her office is suing both companies and their affiliated pharmacy benefits managers on behalf of the state over their business practices. 

But she is finalizing a settlement agreement with Aetna worth approximately $50 million that would end that litigation, which is why the Aetna contract was restored. 
Murrill is still at an impasse with UnitedHealthcare, whose potential lawsuit liability is much higher, between $388 million and $768 million, she said Tuesday. 

The health department’s 90-day extension of the UnitedHealthcare contract will give Murrill’s office three more months to negotiate with the company.
If the state and UnitedHealthcare agree to a settlement during that time, its Medicaid contract with the state might be extended through the end of next year, according to the attorney general and Greenstein. 

The Louisiana Department of Health partners with six private companies to provide Medicaid insurance plans to 1.4 million people across the state. The other businesses offering plans include AmeriHealth Caritas, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons and Louisiana Healthcare Connections.

Anthony slammed the disapproval of work project funding as a “sloppy, politically irresponsible and dare I say, corrupt action” by House Republicans in her opening remarks to the committee. 
“It’s bad fiscal policy and terrible governance. What does this say about our reputation as a state?” she said. “Let me be absolutely clear, as the chair of this committee, I will fight and use every tool available, legislation, negotiations, the budget process, to work with my colleagues and the governor to restore these funds and protect the integrity of our budget process.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Breaking with party leadership in the House, Republicans on the committee, especially Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs), criticized the process used to disapprove of these grants, especially one to Rx Kids, a cash payment program for new parents. 
“Basically what happened was a procedural technicality that was exploited to cancel the funds that weren’t spent prior to September 30,” he said.
Damoose told the committee that he worried how this would change spending by grant recipients going forward, saying, “It feels like it creates almost a perverse incentive to blow all the dollars you get immediately.”
Meanwhile, Sen. Jon Bumstead (R-North Muskegon), the committee’s minority vice chair, described the situation as akin to breaking of a contract between Senate Democrats and Republicans. 
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), when asked about the critiques at a press conference Tuesday, didn’t mince words, calling Damoose a “Republican budget traitor” who was “pissed off that their pork got cut,” while asserting Bumstead had “cut deals with Democrats” and was “working against his caucus, working against the voters that trusted Republicans with elections.”

Communities, advocates rally at Capitol over lost funding
While lawmakers were discussing the cuts inside the Capitol, a group of community organizers, Democratic state lawmakers and individuals impacted by the cuts gathered on the Capitol’s west steps, chastising House Republicans for eliminating the funding.
Barbara Winter, a member of the Hazel Park Library Board, said their district library was promised $200,000 to replace its elevator to meet the state’s updated elevator safety standards.
The elevator has already been ordered, and is expected to be delivered in February, Winter said. While the community has invested nearly $170,000 of funding in the project, the decision to eliminate the funding for this program has created more issues for the library. 
“If the funding is pulled, we can’t install the elevator. Our building will not be ADA compliant, and we risk legal troubles,” Winter said. “We’ve been forced to close off top floors and shrink services, meaning fewer programs [and]limited access for people who need it most.”










How do we sit down and negotiate and come to an agreement if I have no trust as to what happens after that?


– Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) on the decision by Michigan House Republicans to retroactively cut nearly $645 million in state work grants.


State Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said Democrats “are fed up and tired of these damn Republican games,” and that they are working on a supplemental budget to replace the cut funding. 
“This is deeper than politics, y’all,” McKinney said. “Our babies are being impacted by this. Our most vulnerable communities are being impacted by this.”

Uncertainty looms over next year’s negotiations
Criticisms of the long-term ramifications of last week’s decision to cancel nearly $645 million in work project spending included concerns about how budget negotiations will play out next year. 
“This was such a betrayal to me that I don’t know how to negotiate next year,” Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) expressed. “How do we sit down and negotiate and come to an agreement if I have no trust as to what happens after that?”
Those concerns were also shared by those testifying. Jason Mellema, the superintendent of the Ingham ISD, said, “This is a failure by government. Passing a budget, allowing projects to get them and retracting funding after obligations are made, undermines the contents of the entire budget process.” 
“I see only one path forward is to honor existing obligations,” he continued. 
Many of the nonprofit and government leaders who testified emphasized that the funding cuts were for projects and spending that was already well under way — and would be devastating to lose midway through these projects. 
“These orders were filled in confidence that the funds would be there and cover the cost of awards. Unfortunately, with the actions taken last week by the House of Representatives, we have lost $56,500,” Maggie Varney, the founder and CEO of Wigs for Kids, which provides wigs to children with cancer, said. “We felt caught in the middle and blindsided by the decision to recapture funds. We have done this work for 23 years, and will continue to do our very best to serve the children and families at no cost.”
“We had already hired staff. We had already completed MOUs [memorandums of understanding] with the health systems and organizations that were working with us,” said Ramona Benkert, Dean of the Wayne State University College of Nursing, which lost funding for a program to develop the nursing workforce in Michigan. 
Those testifying, including Chrissie Kemzier, the director of SRSLY Dexter, a nonprofit that works to prevent youth substance abuse, and Benjamin Shuldiner, the superintendent of the Lansing School District, both said that their organizations had not received any outreach from members of the House Appropriations Committee for updates on their ongoing work prior to the funding disapprovals.
When asked by reporters about the lack of outreach prior to the cuts, Hall indicated that wasn’t their concern.
“I don’t think that our caucus has a responsibility to reach out to these groups,” Hall said.
However, Brandy Johnson, the president of the Michigan Community College Association, told the committee the process was inherently unfair.
“The rules of the game shouldn’t have been changed midstream or applied retroactively,” Johnson said.
Under the same law that House Republicans used to cancel funding, Anthony and her committee could have disapproved further work project funding up until Dec. 14. However, Anthony said in a press conference earlier in the day that she “would never weaponize the Senate Appropriations Committee for retaliation.

Georgia Department of Corrections.The execution of a Georgia man convicted of murdering two Cobb County women in 2003 has been delayed amid questions of conflicts of interest among the state Board of Pardons and Paroles.
In 2007, a jury found Stacey Humphreys, now 52, guilty of the kidnapping, robbery, assault and murder of Cindy Williams and Lori Brown, real estate agents working out of a model home in a new subdivision. Prosecutors said he ordered the women to strip and tell him their PINs before killing them and withdrawing money from their bank accounts.
The trial took place in Glynn County instead of Cobb because of pretrial publicity.
Humphreys’ execution was scheduled for Dec. 17, but on Monday, Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles Chair Joyette Holmes signed an order suspending the execution without setting a new date. Holmes did not give a reason for the suspension in the order.
The current execution warrant expires Dec. 24, so if the stay remains in effect past that date, the state will need to acquire a new warrant.
Holmes’ order came shortly before an emergency hearing before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney over whether two members of the pardons board should be allowed to participate in a clemency hearing that had been scheduled for Tuesday but was also suspended by Holmes.
Board member Kim McCoy was appointed to her position by Gov. Brian Kemp at the beginning of December. Previously, she was director of the victim witness unit for the Cobb County district attorney’s office from 1999 to April 2024, where she helped victims and their families, including the families of Williams and Brown.
McCoy told McBurney she had not discussed her involvement with the Humphreys case with other board members, but she did talk about it with the board’s executive director and legal counsel as well as the office of Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. She said in court that those conversations led her to decide to abstain from Tuesday’s scheduled hearing.
McBurney indicated he did see the potential for an appearance of a conflict of interest in McCoy’s participation.
“A lay person who sat through the trial in Glynn County, day after day, seeing Ms. McCoy do the amazing work that a victim advocate does, not with the defendant, but with the families of the victims, then seeing Ms. McCoy in the room for a clemency hearing, that neutral observer would say, how is this the right way to do things? And it doesn’t impute anything to Ms. McCoy, just on the surface, it speaks of conflict,” he said.
Paroles Board Vice Chair Wayne Bennett previously served as sheriff of Glynn County from 1992 to 2012, including during Humphreys’ trial. Bennett told McBurney his department was involved with managing the jury, housing Humphreys and transporting him to and from the courthouse, but he had no personal interaction with the man.
“At that particular time, we were housing in excess of 400 inmates,” he said. “I had very little one-on-one contact with the inmates, especially the inmates that were in a high custody unit.”
Bennett, who was appointed by the governor in 2024, testified that he had never declared a conflict of interest during his tenure and indicated that he did not intend to in Humphreys’ case.
A grant of commutation requires the approval of three of the five members of the board, and Humphreys’ attorneys argued that he should be entitled to a vote from a full board with no conflicts of interest.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/humphreys-mug-blurred.jpg,,,2025-12-16 14:56:46.687927

This is the second time in as many years that social media restrictions challenged by NetChoice have been halted by a federal judge.
The law blocked Monday, Act 901 of 2025, allows parents to sue social media platforms if exposure to content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, committing or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds.
Internet group files another federal suit over Arkansas social media laws

NetChoice filed a lawsuit against the state in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas in June. The organization’s June lawsuit challenged Act 901 and another law that amended a 2023 social media law that was permanently blocked this year.
The group argued the two laws violated the First Amendment and are preempted by the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online service providers from being sued for content created by users. 
NetChoice filed motion for a preliminary injunction on Act 901 in July, which U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks granted Monday. In the 33-page order, Brooks argued that Act 901’s restrictions on “addictive” algorithms are likely unconstitutional.
“If a social media platform was a library, banning algorithms would be roughly equivalent to requiring books be placed on shelves at random,” Brooks wrote. “Such a prohibition would burden users’ (or library patrons’) First Amendment rights by making it significantly more difficult to access speech a user wishes to receive, so a state probably could not constitutionally ban algorithms for the organization of speech (on social media or elsewhere) altogether.”
NetChoice said in a Tuesday statement that it’s confident the law will be struck down permanently as the case moves forward. Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, called the decision “a win for free speech.”
“It is also a signal to lawmakers across the country—including on Capitol Hill—that laws imposing liability on social media for displaying fully protected speech are unconstitutional,” Taske said in the statement. “To be successful, laws intended to protect Americans online must respect the First Amendment. Otherwise, they will not protect anyone.” 
Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin who is representing the state in the case, said they “are disappointed by the ruling and will continue to vigorously defend Act 901.”
Other states implementing social media laws like Arkansas have also faced legal challenges, including Florida, Georgia and Ohio.

Both of Montana’s U.S. representatives, voted for the bill, which will extend funding through the 2026 fiscal year and provide payments from the last two years, after Congress allowed the program to lapse in 2023.
“Montana’s students and teachers lost out on millions in funding when Congress failed to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools Program,” Rep. Troy Downing said in a statement. “As a former educator, I understand that every penny counts when it comes to the classroom. I was proud to support this measure today that ensures rural communities in central and eastern Montana have the funds they need to provide the best education for our next generation.”
Since 2000, the SRS program has helped rural counties with large swaths of public, tax-exempt federally-owned forest land. The federal government, through the U.S. Forest Service, has a funding formula to share 25% of revenue generated on federal land based on economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary by county, with payments going toward rural schools, road maintenance and other programs that serve the counties.
Earlier this year, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers sent a letter to House leadership seeking urgent reauthorization of the “SRS,” which provided 32 Montana counties with $16 million from the U.S. Forest Service in 2023.
All four members of Montana’s federal delegation signed on to the letter seeking the funding as a standalone measure or attached to broad, year-end funding legislation.
A funding bill co-sponsored by Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, passed the Senate in  June, though the House didn’t take up a vote until last week.
With the passage of the reauthorization bill, counties are expected to receive payments for 2024 and 2025 within 45 days.
“Passage of the Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act is a major win for counties and a milestone in advancing county policy priorities,” Executive Director of the National Association of Counties Matthew Chase said in a statement. “This bill provides critical relief to timber-dependent counties that rely on these funds to maintain essential services and transition toward long-term fiscal stability.”
In Montana, Northwest counties, the heart of the once dominant timber industry, receive the most money.

(Leah Romero for Source New Mexico)Representatives from law enforcement, public schools, state agencies and beyond voiced frustrations Monday about how the state is addressing juvenile crime during legislative Republicans’ latest task force meeting.
GOP lawmakers convened in Las Cruces for the second meeting focused on public safety, this time specifically juvenile crime and the upcoming 30-day regular legislative session. Legislative Republicans recently asked Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to include public safety on her call for the budgetary session starting Jan. 20, and released a report of findings and legislative priorities.
The governor criticized lawmakers at the end of the 2025 session for not adequately addressing crime in the state, particularly juvenile crime. Her comments followed a fatal mass shooting involving teenagers in a public Las Cruces park the evening before the end of the session.
Left to right: State Rep. Nichole Chavez (R-Albuquerque) and Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte). Legislative Republicans held their second public safety task force dec. 15, 2025 in Las Cruces.
“Our responsibility as lawmakers is not to protect a system, but to protect people,” Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte), co-chair of the task force, said during Monday’s meeting. “Let me be clear: Victims must come first. Public safety must matter.”
Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story told the task force that juvenile crime numbers are increasing throughout the state; guns have become like an “accessory” for teens; and attitudes around violence have changed. He went on to say his department has seen increasing trends of minors possessing and “posing” with guns and recording criminal behavior for social media clout; online arguments involving gangs, drugs and money; in-person altercations stemming from “perceived disrespect;” drive-by shootings; and homicides. 
During the task force’s first meeting earlier this month, the governor’s public safety advisor, Benjamin Baker, told attendees that a child or teenager will be arrested and charged with possessing a firearm on three out of four days in New Mexico.
Story added that his department has found that repeat juvenile offenders know they can rig a criminal competency test and the charges against them will likely be dropped. He gave an example of two teens talking over the prison phone, which is recorded, and bragging about purposely failing puzzles and questions posed to them during previous competency tests. 
“There is definitely a separation between what happens in the state competency system and what happens in the federal competency system,” Story said. He added that law enforcement departments are relying now on the federal justice system to hold young people accountable for crimes. “People are malingering and beating the system on the state side.”
Farmington Police Chief Steve Hebbe told the task force that the issues law enforcement faces in holding juveniles accountable stem from the actions of the state Legislature. 
“If we’re responsible for community safety and we’re facing these problems, all we can do is come to the Legislature and say, ‘Here’s what we’re seeing, we need help,’” Hebbe said. “We just haven’t gotten it and it’s been very frustrating.”
Hebbe told Source New Mexico that he believes New Mexico needs to look at what works in the federal competency system and how it can be implemented at the state level to ensure young people are held accountable. He also said he wants to see more collaboration between the Children, Youth and Families Department and law enforcement to identify children and families struggling so they can provide resources.
“By the time we’re seeing them at the police level, the problem’s out of control…Then we’re not holding the kids accountable, so they’re going back into the same environment that got them there in the first place,” Hebbe said. “We need more severe consequences — we need consequences earlier. It begins to change the mentality.”
Brantley said that while touring the two juvenile correctional facilities in the state over the summer, staff told her that children need more time in the facilities to further their rehabilitation and set them up for success outside.
“Instead of keeping them there longer where we can give them the education, put them on workforce track, give them the mental health [support] that they need, the substance abuse, we just open the gates,” Brantley said, “because some people that we serve with don’t believe it’s compassionate to keep these kids behind bars. And I will tell you, it’s inhumane to let them out. You are returning them to a life of violence.”
The task force also agreed on several legislative proposals including addressing chronic absenteeism in school to correct behavior; expanding what falls under serious youthful offenses; updating the tool used to determine whether juveniles should be detained or released prior to  their court appearances; extending the court’s jurisdiction over juvenile offenders to age 25; and allowing juvenile records to be used in pre-sentence detention hearings, disposition hearings and sentencing hearings.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/storyandhebbe-1024x683.png,,,2025-12-16 14:56:46.687927

(Photo by Kevin Mohatt/Colorado Newsline)A measure backed by a conservative dark-money group proposing tougher penalties on fentanyl possession and distribution will appear on Colorado’s 2026 ballot, the secretary of state’s office announced.
Initiative 85 is the first measure to qualify for the 2026 ballot. It’s backed by Advance Colorado, a conservative nonprofit advocacy group that does not disclose its donors. Supporters last month said they had turned in more than 180,000 petition signatures for the measure, and state elections officials confirmed Monday that the group had submitted the 124,238 valid signatures required to place a statutory initiative on the statewide ballot.
The measure would make the possession of any amount of fentanyl a felony, further rolling back a bipartisan drug policy reform passed by Colorado lawmakers in 2019. It would also mandate harsher penalties for the “distribution, manufacturing, dispensing, or sale” of fentanyl.

“Fentanyl remains the single biggest public health issue facing our state,” John Kellner, said in a statement posted to social media by Advance Colorado. “While steps were taken at the state Capitol to try and address the situation, those steps did not go nearly far enough.”
An estimated 790 people died from a synthetic opioid overdose in Colorado in 2024. Consistent with national trends, that figure represented a substantial drop from peak levels in the previous few years, though it’s still higher than the rates of overdose deaths prior to 2020.
Colorado lawmakers in 2019 passed a law, House Bill 19-1263, reducing the possession of less than 4 grams of most controlled substances from a felony to a misdemeanor, a change that supporters, including the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, at the time called a “step toward treating drug use as a matter of public health rather than criminal justice.” The bill was cosponsored by two Republicans, former state Sen. Vicki Marble of Fort Collins and Rep. Shane Sandridge of Colorado Springs.
It was signed into law just as overdoses from synthetic opioids like fentanyl were surging. Public health researchers attribute the surge in large part to the aggressive crackdown on the supply of opioid medications like OxyContin in response to the 2010s opioid crisis, which led dealers and people with substance use disorders to seek alternatives. Because of their high potency in extremely small doses — fentanyl is used in medical settings in amounts measured in micrograms — synthetic opioids are much more dangerous to users of illicit drugs. A counterfeit pill containing as little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can lead to a fatal overdose.
The alarming increase in fentanyl overdoses also gave rise to widespread myths and misconceptions about the drug. Police officers, including some in Colorado, have routinely claimed to have been affected by “passive exposure” to aerosolized fentanyl powder, which toxicologists say is pharmacologically impossible. Law enforcement figures and conservative politicians also frequently make wildly exaggerated claims about the number of fatal fentanyl doses seized in drug busts, by confusing the “compound weights” of seized pills containing fentanyl for pure fentanyl in its powder form. Such misinformation risks harming people in need of emergency treatment by making bystanders and first responders more hesitant to intervene, according to medical experts.
Under pressure from prosecutors and law enforcement officials, state lawmakers in 2022 rolled back HB-1263 and made possession of more than 1 gram of any compound containing fentanyl — roughly as little as 10 counterfeit opioid pills — a felony again.
As a statutory measure, Initiative 85, which will receive a new proposition number when it appears on ballots in November, would need a simple majority to pass.

DMC Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital in Commerce Township was listed by county officials as a potential exposure site, specifically for individuals who were in the emergency department on the evening of Dec. 7.
Oakland County confirmed its first measles case of the year in June. Throughout the state, this marks the 30th case in Michigan in 2025, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. 
Nationally, the United States has seen over 1,900 measles cases, the highest number since 1992. Childhood vaccination rates are continuing to decline, especially as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who, despite saying in April that the measles vaccine was effective, had historically cast doubt on the vaccine and tied it to autism, a link that is not backed up by science and has been repeatedly disproven. 
This has led some governors, including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, to enact policies allowing for state-level officials to issue their own vaccine guidance. 
“Vaccination is the most effective tool we have to prevent the spread of measles,” said Kate Guzman, the Oakland County health officer, in the county’s press release announcing the confirmed case. “The measles (MMR) vaccine helps protect our community’s most vulnerable which includes infants, children with medical conditions, and others who cannot be vaccinated.”

Planning for the future is guided by conversation and the belief that every person deserves a path that works for them. As you connect with others during the winter break, keep in mind that (fortunately) Vermont offers great options to help bring every student’s goals to life.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Honoring all paths: Tips for talking with stude[...]","Winter break offers a welcome chance to slow down, reconnect with friends and family, and—most importantly—rest. These quieter moments often create space for deeper conversations we may not have the time for during busier times, including discussions about interests, goals, and aspirations. 
Those conversations can naturally lead to important reflections on the future. Fortunately, there are many affordable, flexible ways for students of all ages to learn and train for careers after high school. Eligible students can leverage 802Opportunity for free tuition at Community College of Vermont. New this year, Freedom & Unity offers qualifying students free tuition at Vermont State University. And students may also take advantage of VSAC’s workforce development programs, providing free training in the trades and other critical-need jobs in exchange for a work commitment in Vermont. 
Start Conversations with Curiosity 
Often, the most meaningful moments begin with simple curiosity and a willingness to listen. These conversations don’t need to be formal or structured! Whether you’re catching up with a teen, talking with a neighbor who’s exploring a career change, or chatting with a college student who is home for the holidays, your encouragement and interest make a difference.
Consider asking questions that invite reflection and might open the door to deeper understanding. Can you think of questions that invite more than a yes or no answer?

That’s interesting. Tell me more about why you’re curious about that.
You’ve clearly thought about that. How did you get there?
How (or where) did you learn about that?
Who influenced your interest?
What made you explore this?

Self-reflection questions can also inspire deeper conversations:

What are the things you most enjoy doing with family or friends?
When are you working at your best?
What kinds of jobs do the people you admire most have?
What about yourself are you most proud of?
What excites you when you think about what comes next?

As you invite these conversations, engage with intention: listen actively, share authentically, and seek to understand. Your genuine interest can help someone feel seen and supported—and open the door to new possibilities. And if you have a chance, you might also share information about concrete options the student may want to explore.
Highlight Real Options
The sheer number of opportunities out there today for students can feel overwhelming. The great news for students and families is that Vermont offers several exceptional pathways designed to support learners of all ages and interests, and from all backgrounds. 
802Opportunity: Free Tuition at Community College of Vermont
Vermont residents with a family income of $100,000 or less who do not have a bachelor’s degree can attend Community College of Vermont tuition-free with 802Opportunity.  For students seeking flexible learning that fits around work, family, or other commitments, the program offers more than 30 certificate and associate degree programs with day or evening classes, part-time or full-time enrollment, and in-person or online formats.
Freedom & Unity: Free Tuition at Vermont State University 
Freedom & Unity allows Vermont students with a family income of $65,000 or less who do not have a bachelor’s degree to attend Vermont State University tuition-free. With more than 100 campus-based, hybrid, and online programs leading to associate or bachelor’s degrees, it’s a strong option for students interested in fields like education, engineering, or entrepreneurship.
Funding for Workforce Development: Free Skill-Based Training
Vermont’s Workforce Development Funding helps learners pursue high-demand careers across the state. Funding is currently available for training in skilled trades and dental hygiene. Workforce Development Funding also supports certain graduate-level programs, including the Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner and Nurse Faculty pathways.
In addition, the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit Program will pay some or all of the tuition for a student who enrolls in Guard Service while in school.   
These workforce development programs are structured as interest-free loans, but with a big difference: if you complete your program or service and work in Vermont in your field for a set amount of time, your loan will be fully forgiven. No repayment. No interest. Just the support to launch your future. 
All People, All Paths
There is a path for everyone, whether they’re drawn to hands-on work, public service, creative fields, community leadership, graduate-level careers, or stepping-stone programs that help them get started or build on job experience or credits already earned.
As you connect with others during the winter break, remember that planning for the future happens together, over time. It’s an intention kindled by conversation, encouragement, and the shared belief that every person deserves a path that fits who they are and who they aspire to be.
A single conversation could be what helps someone take their next step with confidence. Why not let that spark ignite with you?
The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency. We advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they have the tools they need to achieve their education and training goals. We create opportunities for all Vermont students, but particularly for those—of any age—who believe that the doors to education are closed to them. Growing families save for education with VT529, Vermont’s official 529 savings program. To help Vermonters plan and pay for college or job training, our counselors work with students in nearly every Vermont middle school and high school, and are also available to work with adults.

(Photo by Frank van Manen/USGS)A federal judge halted a large logging project near Yellowstone National Park because he said the United States Forest Service submitted plans that made it impossible to judge how it would affect critical grizzly bear habitat.
The 16,500-acre project located in the Custer Gallatin National Forest would have allowed the U.S. Forest Service to select timber and build roads for logging. But without offering specifics, the project only pledged that its plans would consider the total distance of the roads and not exceed certain parameters in acreage size, designed to protect critical bear habitat.
Interior announces increased new fees on international visitors to national parks

However, Judge Donald W. Molloy said that the plans amounted to giving the Forest Service permission and trusting that it would be compliant later. He also said in a 46-page ruling released Thursday that the plans also made it difficult to judge how the logging project would impact grizzly habitat, and that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said a female grizzly’s minimum range was 10 acres, while not basing that decision on any cited science.
Meanwhile the groups that challenged the logging project, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Wild Earth Guardians and the Western Environmental Law Center, pointed to other research that indicated as many as 2,500 acres were needed.

 Judge rules Forest Service project doesn’t comply with National Forest Management Act

Molloy also vacated the Forest Service’s project because it failed to comply with several different portions of federal law, including the National Forest Management Act.
“(The groups) argue that this approach conflates a promise of future statutory compliance with actual compliance. (They) insist that it is impossible to assess the true environmental impacts of the project under the National Environmental Policy Act, or determine whether it meets statutory or forest plan protections for grizzly bears and lynx under the Endangered Species Act and the NFMA,” Molloy said.
The judge agreed the Forest Service failed to properly consider the impacts of the logging project on the grizzly bears. While the Forest Service, in its plans, said that it would be approving 56.8 miles of temporary roads associated with the project, it said those would be determined during the project, based on other conditions.
However, the groups had argued one of the biggest factors in grizzly bear habitats is their proximity to roads. Grizzly bears, according to the scientific testimony presented in the case, tend to avoid and settle in habitats far away from roads, and that humans are the largest threat to grizzly bear survival.
In the lawsuit, the groups argued it wasn’t just the total number or length of the roads that mattered, but also the placement. Because the Forest Service plans gave no specifics on the location of the roads, Molloy said it was impossible to judge the impacts on the bears.
“Essentially while the Forest Service’s math check out, it is unclear how the Forest Service can calculate the amount of secure habitat that will be lost without first determining where the temporary roads will be routed,” Molloy said in his ruling.
 Environmental groups celebrate ruling on logging project

Furthermore, the judge agreed that approving the project would have meant the true extent of the project could not be calculated until after the project, leaving the groups with few legal remedies.
“Here, however in the context of grizzly bear secure habitation, the lack of specific road mapping prevents such informed decision making,” Molloy said. “The Forest Service avowing that future activities will comply with NFMA falls far short of showing that those actives do so.”
The court also said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relied on using a grizzly 10-acre patch size for habitat was consistent, but officials provided no science or basis for that size, while the groups cited other scientific research that calls for much more, and highlights the importance of that land in relation to roads for motorized vehicles.
“The U.S. Forest Service identify no specific explanation of why 10 acres, as opposed to 1 acre, 5 acres or 50 acres is an appropriate metric,” Molloy said.
The conservation groups cheered the ruling.
“This ruling makes it clear that agencies can’t just rubber-stamp massive logging projects and promise to sort out the details later,” said Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director and senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The court saw right through the Forest Service’s vague plans and determined that moving targets aren’t good enough, especially when threatened animals and treasured public lands are at stake.”

So we're proud of what we're doing.”

Dems decry edited videoSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Hegseth again refused to show unedited footage, which Schumer described as “deeply troubling,” of a second strike on Sept. 2 that killed two people who survived the initial strike. “The administration came to this briefing empty handed,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said. “If they can't be transparent on this, how can you trust their transparency on all the other issues swirling about in the Caribbean? Every senator is entitled to see it. There is no problem with (revealing) sources and methods” because the senators will view it in the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, a secure area of the Capitol where classified information is generally shared.Schumer added that an “appropriate version” of the video should be disclosed to the public.Senate Republicans downplayed loud concerns from Democrats, pointing to former President Barack Obama’s numerous counterterrorism drone strikes in the Middle East.“We've been using the same technique for 24 years, and nothing has changed except the hemisphere,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.Public release called forHegseth told reporters the unedited video will be shown to members of the Senate and House committees on the Armed Services Wednesday, alongside Admiral Frank Bradley, commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, who oversaw the strikes.Hegseth did not address why the department declined to show the unedited video to all 100 senators. He did say, “Of course, we're not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public.”Several Democratic senators have called for the video to be publicly released.Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said he was told during the meeting that the video won’t be released because of “classification concerns.”“It is hard to square the widespread, routine, prompt posting of detailed videos of every strike, with a concern that posting a portion of the video of the first strike would violate a variety of classification concerns,” Coons said.Coons added “it’s increasingly important that the national security team of the Trump administration increasingly respect and recognize the role and power of Congress.” He highlighted a provision in Congress’s annual defense authorization bill that compels Hegseth to release the video or lose 25% of his travel budget. The massive defense bill is expected to pass this week.Body count from boat strikes risingU.S. Southern Command posted a video on social media Monday night of the military’s latest strikes on three boats “operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations in international waters” in the eastern Pacific. The strikes killed eight people, according to the post.President Donald Trump has officially promoted his military actions in the Caribbean as a fight against drug trafficking and overdose deaths in the United States, particularly from illicit fentanyl. On Monday Trump issued an order declaring the powerful synthetic opioid as a “Weapon of Mass Destruction.”The smuggling routes for illicit fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it follow the path from China to Mexico to the U.S., and is highlighted as such in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment.The administration has designated several drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, including “Cartel de los Soles,” an alleged Venezuelan group that the Department of State described as spearheaded by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Trump has hinted at a land invasion of the South American country.When asked by States Newsroom on Tuesday whether Hegseth addressed during the meeting what type of drugs were alleged to be in the targeted boats, Mullin and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said cocaine.“We've always heard it’s mainly cocaine. It doesn't matter. It's drugs,” Mullin said.Sullivan said “it’s the same groups” smuggling the cocaine as the ones smuggling fentanyl.Cocaine mixed with illicit fentanyl has become “an increasing public safety concern” over the last eight years, according to the National Drug Threat Assessment. Overall, all U.S. drug overdose deaths have decreased in recent years, according to the assessment and latest data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-16 14:56:46.687927

Sept. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s general fund tax receipts for November grew modestly above recent projections, but it may not help fill the budget hole state lawmakers are tasked with filling in January.
Nebraska’s November tax receipts show a net growth of 3.1% over what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted in October, according to the state Department of Revenue.
That equates to just under $18 million in extra revenue into the state’s coffers. However, Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said those dollars won’t go directly into Nebraska’s general fund.
By state statute, the extra revenue will go into the state’s cash reserve or the School District Property Tax Relief Credit Fund, depending on how much the amount ends up above forecasts.
Nebraska’s projected budget deficit currently stands at $471 million, which lawmakers are tasked with filling before the 2026 legislative session concludes. Lawmakers grappled with a fluctuating budget shortfall that at one point grew to $432 million during the 90-day session this spring.
Most specific tax revenues came in modestly above projections, including individual income taxes, sales and use taxes and miscellaneous taxes. The sole outlier was corporate income taxes, which came in roughly 78% below forecasts.

Patent said she wasn’t sure why corporate income taxes came in low, but noted the corporate tax returns tracked with October’s general fund receipts. She said she expects corporate tax revenues will bounce back in December, as historically the month has brought in high revenues for the state.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who chairs the Nebraska Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said he was “encouraged” by November’s tax receipts, calling it a signal that Neraska’s economy is stable.
As for how the additional revenue will impact the budget deficit, Clements said he is open to using rainy day funds to fill the shortfall, but he expects he and other lawmakers will be stingier with the cash reserve compared to other funds.
Nebraska’s cash reserve is estimated to be at about $669 million by the end of the current budget cycle.
Last year, Gov. Jim Pillen’s budget proposal and state lawmakers swept funding from dozens of different cash funds in order to fill the projected deficit, but Clements said some cash funds were unaffected.
Those may be tapped in 2026, he said.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Seven in 10 North Dakota Farmers Union agriculture producers will be affected by Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year, an official with the organization warned members this month.
Lance Boyer, sales director of financial products for the North Dakota Farmers Union, said the enhanced tax credits that were part of the American Rescue Plan Act approved in 2021 brought down health insurance premiums for members. 
After the tax credits took effect, the North Dakota Farmers Union saw people who had previously been uninsured buy health insurance policies, he said.
With the subsidies set to expire unless Congress votes to extend them, Boyer said federal lawmakers haven’t focused enough on the self-employed farmers who will find it difficult to pay for increased health insurance premiums.
“The bulk of the people that are going to be impacted are hard-working folks,” Boyer said during a breakout session at the organization’s annual convention in Bismarck on Friday. 
No US House vote to extend health care subsidies, Speaker Johnson says

For example, Boyer cited a married couple in their 30s who earn between $50,000 and $60,000 a year and have a daughter. They expect to see health insurance premiums increase $300 per month next year. 
“On $50,000 to $60,000 a year, where do you find $4,000 a year in your budget?” Boyer said. “What are you going to go without?”
In another example, he said a member family of four earning about $150,000 per year pays about $900 for health insurance per month this year. The family expects to see the premium increase to $2,900 per month.
“People are going to walk away from their health insurance,” Boyer said. “I’ve never seen a time in this business like I am seeing today.”
Nationally, 27% of farmers, ranchers and agricultural managers are insured by individual marketplace insurance policies, with the large majority purchased through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, according to health policy outlet KFF.
The North Dakota Farm Bureau has seen an increase in people interested in its health plans as an alternative to the Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance, said Megan Hanson, director of member relations and state health plans manager.
Those plans, offered through a 10-state Farm Bureau group compact, can offer higher deductibles, differing out-of-pocket expenses and lower premiums than typical insurance plans, Hanson said. The plans do not cover people with preexisting conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, and can require people to submit medical records when they apply for coverage, she said.
John Arnold, deputy commissioner for the North Dakota Insurance and Securities Department, advises people to consider the big picture when evaluating different insurance or health coverage plans.
“The monthly premium may be significantly lower, but over the course of the year, am I going to be paying more out-of-pocket, one way or the other?” Arnold said. “Definitely encourage consumers to look beyond the initial sticker price, do all their calculations and figure out what plan is best for them.”
Arnold said the best thing people shopping for health coverage can do is to talk to their local insurance agents to become more informed about their options. He said the agents should be able to explain the policies and options clearly so people don’t fall victim to plans they don’t fully understand.
“There is no alternative to sitting across the desk, face-to-face, talking to somebody who knows the industry inside and out,” he said.
Open enrollment for Affordable Care Act marketplace health insurance plans runs through Jan. 15.

The Choctaw Nation announced the partnership with Rosetta Stone on Tuesday in an effort to preserve the tribal language. 
“When we speak Chahta, our ancestors speak through us. Sharing our language ensures their voices will never fade,” Chief Gary Batton said in a statement. “Each word spoken is the core that strengthens our families and our culture, and secures our identity as the Chahta people. This partnership to share our language is more than a program. It is an act of love for our people and a promise to keep our culture alive for generations to come.” 
The number of fluent speakers has “sharply declined” and this was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a news release. Learning the language will be more accessible to all Choctaw citizens and allow them to stay connected to their roots. 
Chahta anumpa will be part of Rosetta Stone’s Endangered Languages Program which focuses on recording and teaching “at-risk” languages. Over the past 20 years, Rosetta Stone has worked to help preserve several Indigenous languages. 
“Language is deeply personal. It connects us to family, history and place,” said Paul Mishkin, CEO of IXL Learning, Rosetta Stone’s parent company. “Through our Endangered Languages Program, we’re honored to work alongside the Choctaw Nation to protect not just words, but the identities and cultures they carry.”
The program maps the “building blocks” of the language and works with the community to build curriculum, according to the Rosetta Stone website. The partnerships are “multi-year commitments” and the learning programs are available for use by tribal members.

Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) announced Dec. 16, 2025 that he is once again pushing for legislation authorizing up to $14 million annually to help tribes build and expand buffalo herds across the country. 
(Jerry Driendl/Getty Images)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) announced Tuesday he is reintroducing legislation to improve federal support for tribal buffalo herds, an effort he said he hopes will return the buffalo within his lifetime “to the prominent place they once occupied as the keystone species on American shortgrass prairies.” 
Co-sponsored with U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.,), the Indian Buffalo Management Act directs the federal Interior Department to work with tribes to develop, protect and grow buffalo tribes across the country, authorizing up to $14 million annually. The bill seeks to spur more coordination and consistent investment at the Interior Department, which has provided only “nominal” funds over the last 20 years to tribes that want to start or expand buffalo herds, according to a news release from Heinrich’s office. 
The InterTribal Buffalo Council, which has been pushing to return buffalo to tribal land for more than 30 years, endorsed the legislation. The council has 89 tribal members in 22 states, including at least 10 New Mexico tribes and pueblos, according to a recent membership list. 
“Helping Tribes reestablish herds of buffalo on our reservations is a righteous thing for the Congress to do and will be thoroughly welcomed by Tribes and Indian people across the county,” council leaders, including Delbert Chisholm of Taos Pueblo, said in a statement. 
Heinrich introduces a bill to help tribes better manage buffalo herds

At least 60 million buffalo once roamed throughout much of the United States before European settlers and the United States military destroyed all but a few hundred by the end of the 18th century. Indigenous people relied on the buffalo — “culturally and nutritionally” — for thousands of years, according to the council leaders’ statement. 
Versions of the legislation have passed either the House of Representatives or the Senate, but not both, in recent years. Heinrich and Mullin (R-Okla.) also cosponsored the bill last year, and it passed the Senate in December but never received a hearing in the House.
“I’m proud to reintroduce this bipartisan legislation to strengthen federal support for Tribal buffalo programs and continue the growth of Tribal buffalo herds,” Heinrich said in a statement. “I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Mullin to strengthen this federal partnership and secure future funding for this initiative.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BisonGettyImages-200421265-001-1024x816.jpg,,,2025-12-16 13:56:59.066671

FEMA’s new strategy, according to the document, was designed to “accelerate the recovery process” and “ensure accountability” for its sprawling Public Assistance program. It would change how the agency reviews and approves hundreds of millions in disaster recovery money.
Two weeks later, North Carolina’s emergency management director sent a response that raised issues with almost every step of the plan. 
The state had “significant concerns” with FEMA’s new process: it failed to address the most cumbersome aspects of Public Assistance, “lacked clarity” on dates and details, and imposed stricter deadlines on the state and local communities without similar guidelines for the agency itself.
“The proposed strategy seems to prioritize incomplete administrative measures over truly improving recovery efforts,” wrote William Ray, the state’s emergency management director.
The group representing county governments in western North Carolina was even more explicit in its criticisms. In a separate letter, the executive director of the N.C. Association of County Commissioners said the FEMA plan was “unhelpful” and was “tying one hand behind [our] backs.” 
“At a minimum, this news is disappointing,” wrote Kevin Leonard, in a letter to Ray that was also passed on to Rob Ashe, the acting administrator for FEMA’s southeast region. “At a maximum, this news has been received by some as if FEMA leadership at the regional and Washington, D.C. level is tone deaf.”
And in another letter to Ray, the director of the N.C. League of Municipalities said the new guidance would “require the most of the smallest municipalities in the region.”
The correspondence represents the latest point of contention between FEMA and North Carolina leaders as they continue to work on Helene recovery, more than a year after the storm. 
The agency continues to send a steady trickle of aid to North Carolina through the Public Assistance program, now totaling over $1 billion for the storm. But state and local officials alike have repeatedly expressed frustration with new bureaucratic obstacles in FEMA’s process, which have kept governments on uncertain ground and forced delays in other grant programs.
As of this week, FEMA has “not implemented many of those policies” outlined in the memo, an emergency management staffer told Gov. Josh Stein’s advisory committee for western North Carolina on Monday. 
FEMA, asked for comment on the letters, referred NC Newsline to its latest news release that touts more than $1 billion in total Public Assistance grants for Helene recovery.
“These funds are delivered in accordance with federal requirements to ensure accountability and that eligible costs are reimbursed as quickly as possible,” an unnamed spokesperson said in an email.
Changes to FEMA aid focus on small projects, don’t address long-standing points of frustration
FEMA’s changes to Public Assistance aimed to “reduce the number of open … projects” and “reduce the timeline” for both current and future projects, according to the agency’s memo.
That involved a four-step process that included pushing resources to “high-priority” projects, “streamlining” the process to get documents for a project and “expediting” the review of projects.
Over the next two months, the agency would focus particularly on projects that cost less than $100,000, reviewing applications that are already in the pipeline. That would notably exclude everything that requires the personal sign-off by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristin Noem; FEMA rules require her to approve every payment over $100,000.
By the end of January, the agency will have approved an estimated $26.2 million for projects in the southeast region, according to the memo.
Absent from the plan, North Carolina officials noted, was anything that would speed up the biggest pending applications, including payments for debris cleanup. And it appeared that FEMA’s new layers of approval, including personal signoff by Noem, would remain unchanged.
Ray, in his letter, called that process “inefficient and bureaucratic.” He also called FEMA’s “Defend the Spend” effort, a separate step led by DOGE, “administratively redundant.” 
Leonard, with the association of county commissioners, pointed out that the goal of $26.2 million was less than “the outstanding debris requirements for just one (among several) of our hardest hit counties.” 
It wasn’t clear how FEMA workers would “prioritize” projects, Ray wrote, and the new steps to request documents clashed with a prior agreement with the state. 
The agency was putting new strict deadlines in place for applicants that would be a particular crunch for smaller towns and cities, wrote N.C. League of Municipalities director Rose Vaughn Williams.
“The new requirements outlined in the FEMA memo, implemented on short notice and requiring a fast turnaround, may be difficult for these communities to comply with,” she wrote.
The memo does not, however, mention new deadlines for FEMA staff. That contrast contributed to a “trust deficit that has been building for several months” between local leaders and the agency, Leonard wrote.
“This continues a pattern that counties have consistently raised for months, including with Col. Ashe during his recent visits: the goalposts keep moving,” Leonard wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3427-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 13:56:59.066671

The federal agency that manages the New Bedford hurricane barrier — and controls which vessels can go in and out — could throw a potentially costly and time-consuming wrench into Vineyard Wind’s ability to ship its final blades out of port. Vineyard Wind’s permit to send ships through the barrier expires Dec. 31, and the agency is still evaluating whether to extend it.
Several years ago, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued what’s called a Section 408 authorization to Vineyard Wind, allowing the project to send heavy lift boats and wide barges through the barrier’s 150-foot-wide opening — a delicate maneuver that could be catastrophic if it goes wrong. (To date, it hasn’t.)
The original approval had an end date of Dec. 31, 2024, but the project hit significant turbine installation delays due to the July 2024 blade failure. Vineyard Wind filed for an extension from the Army Corps on Sept. 10, 2024, and received approval the following month, on Oct. 21, 2024. The new deadline: Dec. 31, 2025.
With that day a little more than two weeks away, and one tower and several blades left to install or ship out, it’s unlikely Vineyard Wind will meet the cutoff. Sources who spoke with The Light said they expected the final components to be installed by March.
On Aug. 7 — four months ago — the company filed a second extension request with the Army Corps. It’s still pending.
“While Vineyard Wind’s goal is to reach Project completion in 2025, unexpected supply chain, weather, and other unforeseen delays may occur over the next five months that would preclude completion in 2025,” read the August letter from Vineyard Wind to the Army Corps. “The goal is to reach Project completion by the end of December 2025, however, given the unpredictability of issues that may arise, Vineyard Wind is requesting an extension.”
As of Monday, the Army Corps, which falls under the Department of Defense, has not made a decision to approve or deny it.
“Vineyard Wind has requested an extension, which is currently under consideration. We are unable to speculate on future 408 decisions or their timing,” said Adam Stewart, a spokesperson for the Army Corps New England District office, in a Dec. 9 email to The Light.
The processing time of the second extension request has run more than three times as long to date, or twice as long if the 43-day government shutdown is excluded.
An Army Corps spokesperson would not provide further information, including on whether the agency plans to make a determination by Dec. 31.
In its October 2024 extension approval letter, the Army Corps said it determined that the extension “will not impair the usefulness of the New Bedford Hurricane Barrier, and will not be injurious to the public interest.”
Further, the agency wrote, “If you find that you need more time to complete the authorized activity, submit your request for a time extension to this office for consideration at least one month before the above date is reached.”
Vineyard Wind and GE Vernova declined comment.


Chris Matthews, a spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Bill Keating, said by email that Keating’s office is in “regular contact” and working closely with Vineyard Wind, and that Keating is aware of the pending request before the Army Corps.
Amid Trump’s war on wind, and a day-one wind memo that last week was struck down as illegal by a federal judge, all federal permitting for offshore wind projects has frozen, creating uncertainty over the fate of the Army Corps extension request.
Yet, unlike other offshore wind projects, Vineyard Wind has managed to escape attacks and roadblocks from the Trump administration. While its neighbors on the Outer Continental Shelf, Empire Wind and Revolution Wind, received orders to halt construction (since lifted and overturned, respectively), Vineyard Wind received none and quietly continued buildout.
A possible difference between previously authorized transits through the hurricane barrier and the ones most likely to take place in 2026 is the types of components that will be shipped. Vineyard Wind will (weather permitting) likely ship out its final turbine tower and nacelle by the end of the month, leaving only blades to install next year.
About seven towers do not have blades as of Dec. 9, according to satellite images. Beyond that, some towers may still require blade removal and replacement. According to GIS-enthusiast Joel Stocker, who has been closely mapping the project’s progress, 10 blade sets either need removal or installation.

The barges have already passed through the barrier with different combinations of turbine components, including blades only.
The skilled pilots driving the tugs and barges have made at least 100 successful transits through the barrier without incident. They abide by strict weather and visibility conditions. If the winds are too strong, they delay their departure.
The barrier, built in 1966, protects about 1,400 acres of homes and businesses in New Bedford, Fairhaven, and Acushnet from coastal flooding. Its steel doors close on both water and land, like it did for Tropical Storm Henri in 2021.
A source familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there’s been talk that if the request is not approved, Vineyard Wind may utilize a Rhode Island port to send out the remaining blades.
That might require the disassembly of large cranes at the New Bedford terminal — and other pieces of the marshaling apparatus — which would take additional time. The 2,000-ton crane came to the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal by many truckloads.
The project could also have another option: shipping blades to Canada and having one of the installation vessels, Wind Pace, pick them up there, which it has already been doing for the blade removal and replacement work.
“There is so much uncertainty in the industry right now… it’s a whole new playing field,” the source said. “There’s no stability right now, there’s instability.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A new group has formed to represent Oklahoma independents and challenge voter suppression.
The group is called Oklahoma Independents but is not a recognized political party.
The group’s formation comes after it was announced last week that independents would not be allowed to vote in Democratic, Republican or Libertarian primaries. Democrats had allowed independents to vote in their primaries for nearly a decade.
The Oklahoma Democratic Party, which had voted to continue to allow independents to vote in their primaries, is considering its legal options.
The Oklahoma Election Board said the party did not file the proper notice required under state law to open its primaries.
“Independent voters pay taxes, fund public elections, and live with the outcomes of those elections, yet many are locked out of the most consequential contests,” said Andy Moore, a spokesman for the new group. “That’s a modern form of taxation without representation, and it’s a problem worth solving.”
Oklahoma has nearly 2.4 million voters, of which 487,927 are independents.
Emily Hale is an independent from Harrah.
“Most people don’t fit neatly into a red or blue box,” she said. “But our system insists we choose one just to have a voice.”

(Photo courtesy of National Conference of State Legislatures)A new group of bipartisan state legislative leaders issued a declaration at their first meeting calling for a renewed focus on states’ rights and an end to federal intrusion into state laws. 
The Assembly of State Legislative Leaders, which includes more than 40 lawmakers from 30 states, unanimously approved a 449-word declaration on the importance of states’ ability to legislate independently. 
The document, released on Tuesday at the bipartisan group’s inaugural meeting in Columbus, Ohio, noted that the U.S. Constitution did not create the states, “but rather the states created the Constitution, ratifying a framework in which we would both govern collectively and independently.” 
Federalism is a foundational constitutional concept outlining the sharing of power between states and the federal government. 
State lawmakers ask Trump administration to end its review of state regs

The lawmakers’ declaration says federal agency rules, congressional legislation and executive orders must respect the constitutional division of powers and allow states to pass a diverse array of legislation.
The document says adherence to federalism is the key to “restore the balance between the federal government and state legislatures, ensure collaboration that respects state roles and limits unnecessary federal intrusion into state sovereignty.”
It opposes federal preemption of state laws except when “a direct conflict with the Constitution arises or the issue cannot be effectively addressed at the state level.” 
The newly formed group underscores growing tension between the federal government and states. 
Last week, for example, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to override state laws regulating artificial intelligence. State lawmakers of both parties said they will continue to file legislation on the issue and push back on the president’s effort. 
States will keep pushing AI laws despite Trump’s efforts to stop them

The National Conference of State Legislatures, which represents state legislatures and legislative staff across the country, helped organize the new group. NCSL in September wrote to federal leaders, citing bipartisan concern about recent federal actions that the group said attempted to undermine the authority of state governments. It opposed a Trump administration review of state laws believed to be overly burdensome for businesses.
This week in Ohio, state lawmakers discussed a variety of issues related to federalism, including Medicaid, education and land management, according to NCSL. Ohio Republican state House Speaker Matt Huffman was elected as presiding officer of the new assembly, with Hawaii Democratic state Senate President Ron Kouchi elected as recording secretary.
“We have accomplished the first of what I hope is a long list of future declarations from state legislative leaders,” Huffman said in a statement. “This meeting was a first of its kind, and I’m hopeful we will continue these conversations across the nation.”
Kouchi characterized the meeting as “a good beginning.”
“I am pleased the top state legislative leaders from both parties were able to come together and have a candid, practical conversation about how we can better preserve and strengthen the role of the states within our constitutional framework,” he said in the statement.

(Photo by Ryan Murphy/Getty Images)There’s scant evidence that the Trump administration’s intensified immigration enforcement is achieving its objective of removing a significant number of violent criminals. Aside from appealing to the most xenophobic elements of the MAGA crowd, the missions have had negligible practical or symbolic effect. 
In Louisiana, Operation Catahoula Crunch is moving into its third week and appears to be losing steam and support, even among Republicans. Federal authorities have reported nearly 350 arrests, with fewer than 10% of those apprehended having a criminal record. 
Documents the Associated Press obtained ahead of the operation indicated authorities intended to arrest 5,000 people in Southeast Louisiana. At its current pace, the campaign would need six months to reach that goal.
“Is going door to door, pulling people out of their houses and cars, is that the right way to do this?” Lt. Gov. Bill Nungesser told WRKF-FM. “I hope to God it’s not arresting people to reach a quota … I hope that’s not the fact because that has put the fear of God in a lot of people.”
This was Nungesser’s take last week after taking heat from a fellow Republican state leader, Gov. Jeff Landry, for prior comments on the topic of immigration. In a statement to The Times-Picayune, the governor’s office said it was “disappointing” that Nungesser had prioritized concerns for “individuals who enter our country illegally” over American citizens. 
The lieutenant governor, as the state’s top tourism official, said he wants to relay concerns he’s heard from the hospitality industry to Landry.
“I’ve got hotel owners calling me, saying they can’t get the rooms clean because nobody is coming to work. Restaurant staff are not showing up, and these people building buildings can’t complete their projects because nobody’s coming to work,” Nungesser said. “We gotta fix that, and I don’t know how to fix it.”
Sheltering in place through the ICE storm

If creating a climate of fear and crippling certain businesses was Trump’s goal, consider the early results from Catahoula Crunch “mission accomplished.” 
Schools in the area report significant attendance drops since the start of the operation, with Jefferson Parish seeing 3,500 more absences the day after its launch compared to the same day last year, the Times-Picayune reported. The highest rates were at schools with the greatest numbers of English-learner students. 
Reporters with The Lens recently canvassed the city to see how the sweeps were affecting immigrant communities and the businesses that rely on them. 
“We’re a Latin-based store; 80% of our clientele is Hispanic. I want to say at least half of them have stopped coming,” said the owner of a New Orleans grocery-bakery. He asked for his name to be withheld to avoid being targeted. “People left. People are afraid. Nothing positive is coming out of this.”
Similar stories have been reported in other states where the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has conducted immigration crackdowns. And like Louisiana, the number of violent criminals apprehended has been relatively small. 
For example, only 1.5% of the 1,900 arrests in Operation Midway Blitz involved people with violent criminal backgrounds as of early December, with two-thirds having no record of any criminal offense other than an immigration violation, the Chicago Tribune reported. 
Our colleagues at Stateline analyzed immigration arrest data through the first 10 months of the Trump administration and compared it with information for the same period last year under the Biden administration.
The Trump efforts are averaging about 30,000 arrests per month, which includes considerably more criminal apprehensions than recorded under Biden. Yet despite frequent mention of the dangers the undocumented population poses to the U.S., an increasing number of arrests this year are solely for immigration status. 
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

The share of arrested immigrants with violent crime convictions has dropped from 9% in January to less than 5% in October. Under Biden, the rate stayed consistently between 10% and 11% during the same period in 2024. It was to be expected that a dramatic increase in total immigration arrests would water down the rate of violent offenders ensnared in the dragnets.
But what the Trump camp might not have expected was the pushback it would see when so many of its apprehensions involved immigrants with no past criminal concerns.
“All the immigration sweeps will maintain strong support if they are going after criminals,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, told WVUE-TV Fox 8 this week. “I think if they focus on criminals, they are going to have a lot of support. And if they go beyond that, I think people will scratch their head and say, ‘Why are we doing this?’”
Recent polling shows more have soured on U.S. immigration policy.
An Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center survey of more than 1,100 adults conducted Dec. 4-8 showed decreasing support for President Trump’s handling of immigration. 
Nearly half of respondents backed his approach when polled in March, and the approval rate dropped to 38% this month. The decline is also evident among Republicans, falling from 88% to 80%.
In Southeast Louisiana, there is a palpable distaste for Trump’s immigration tactics. It goes deeper than general opposition to tearing families apart and indefinitely detaining people with little to no evidence of wrongdoing. Persons with legal status to be in the United States have been apprehended as well.
It has more to do with the region’s deep history as an international hub of commerce and culture, going back to the state’s mixed colonial roots. Over the ensuing centuries, waves of immigrants have left their distinct, indelible mark on Louisiana: the French, Spanish, Haitian, German, Italian, Croatian, Latin American and Vietnamese make up only a partial list.
More recently, you would be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn’t credit the immigrant community for cleaning up and rebuilding the region after Hurricane Katrina. In the 20 years since their arrival and settlement, they too have contributed to a patchwork pattern the rest of the nation envies, if not the world.  
It’s this celebrated and successful amalgamation that disturbs Trump and his enablers, who rely on division and resentment to achieve their nationalistic vision. 
So far, it hasn’t taken root in Southeast Louisiana, where few feel the need to sweep the swamp.

Darrell Dennis was convicted of the 2013 murder. A man with a lengthy criminal history, Dennis had been out on parole for five years before Abrams was killed despite being charged with 21 new crimes, including 10 felonies, since his release.

First in a series on Arkansas’ crowded prisons

Between 2010 and 2012, admissions to state prisons fell by 19.6%. That changed after Abrams was killed.
“What happened was Darrell Dennis,” Arkansas Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness told the Advocate. The message, from everyone, including legislators and parole officers, was clear at the time, Magness said: “Parole had gotten too lax.”
The Dennis case prompted outrage that trained a harsh spotlight on Arkansas’ prison system. In response to the killing, the Board of Corrections voted in June 2013 to significantly restrict parole, implementing what has been described as a zero-tolerance policy for violations of parole conditions that gave Arkansas the distinction of having the strictest post-prison release policies in the nation.
“There was such a big hoopla over that, that essentially, the parole board was revoking everyone who came up and turning down people for parole, and had a huge spike in the prison population that was solely as a result of that,” said longtime Arkansas defense attorney Jeff Rosenzweig.
Even though some of the restrictive policies were scaled back in 2015 when the board implemented what Magness described as a “happy medium,” the effects of zero-tolerance continue to reverberate today.
Housing convicted offenders is an active source of consternation for legislators, counties and state corrections officials as Arkansas continues to grapple with a growing prison population, fueled by recidivism rates that consistently see around half of released inmates return to incarceration within three years. The number of incarcerated people has strained prison and jail capacity for years. Prison population growth has been cited as a chief reason for building a new, 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County — a prospect that’s sparked fierce backlash in the River Valley community while dividing the Republican supermajority in the Arkansas Legislature.
Division of Correction facilities have a bedspace capacity of 15,362 as of Dec. 9, according to department data. But the number of incarcerated people sentenced to serve time in ADC was 18,997 as of the same day, including 1,852 held in county jails while waiting for a state prison bed.
 Reverberating consequences 
The effect of zero-tolerance in 2013 was almost immediate. The number of parolees returning to the prison system’s custody more than tripled within a three month period. Many of those who returned ended up in county jails for lack of beds in state facilities. By November of that year, the Pulaski County Detention Center was critically overcrowded.


Admissions had increased 72% by 2015 compared to 2012. After nearly three years of large increases in admissions and parole revocations, the board adjusted its parole policy again in 2015.
“We had to change,” Magness said. “We got close to 3,000 people backed up in the county jails. You’ve got to understand that county jail backup has always been somewhere around 1,500, 1,600 people.”
Zero-tolerance marked the end of a short era of shrinking prison population, in part due to Act 570 of 2011, which had a “major impact” on the prison population, according to the governor who signed it into law, Mike Beebe.
“There’s lots of people in the law enforcement community that do not like [Act] 570, but it really did what it was designed to do,” Magness said. “It was just too lenient on probation and parole [violations]. And other than that, it did put a lot more emphasis on probation, which is not a bad thing.”
Arkansas’ prison population never managed to return to the low levels seen in the years immediately before Abrams was killed. Magness said the sky-high county jail backups dropped after the changes were implemented, but admissions to prisons didn’t follow suit.
Rosenzweig said it’s still too difficult to obtain parole. And even when someone does get out, lack of preparation for societal reintegration creates a “vicious cycle,” he said.
The state’s prison population began increasing again in 2021, even as admissions into the prison system fell to their lowest levels since the implementation of zero-tolerance in 2013. Previously, prison admissions and population rose and fell in tandem with one another. Fewer releases from prisons contributed to the decoupling.


Arkansas’ prison population grew faster than the overall population itself over the last 15 years, even as overall crime has decreased, data shows.
But violent crime is beginning to account for a larger share of crime overall as the number of property crimes has fallen off a cliff.
During the Board of Corrections’ November meeting, Wendy Ware, a consultant who does prison population projections for the corrections agency, told members the trend of harsher sentences and fewer releases would create a “stacking effect” that increases the prison population, despite dropping crime rates.
Sentence lengths have generally increased since 2020, and the 2023 Protect Arkansas Act is projected to continue that trend with many offenses, according to the most recent population projections.
The number of offenders sentenced to the corrections system is projected to grow by 2,902 over the next 10 years as a result of the law, according to the most recent department population projections.
The real drivers
While board policy surrounding parole might have been a chief cause of the prison population spike in the 2010s, it coincides with other issues that keep people in a cycle of leaving and later returning to prison.
Drugs, Magness told the Advocate, were and remain a huge reason why people end up in prison — either as an initial offense or as the reason someone is brought back after being paroled — even if what they’re charged with isn’t a drug crime.
“I would be tempted to say at least 50% of our population is drug-related offenses … or drug-related driven,” Magness said. “Until we change our direction on our drug offenses, we’re going to grow [the prison population] by 2% to 3% a year. It’s not going to change.”
Recidivism reports from the department show that around half of people who return to prison on new charges come back on drug charges, regardless of whether their initial offense was a violent, nonviolent or drug charge. About half the people admitted to state prisons are Arkansans who violate their parole, either on a technical violation or with a new charge.
Just putting people in prison doesn’t solve the overarching problem drug-fueled crime creates, according to Magness, who said he isn’t sure the prisons’ current addiction treatment programs are adequate. Inmates sent to the Department of Corrections’ drug treatment facilities can stay for periods as short as six months, he said. That’s lower than it used to be as the board tried to find ways to turn beds faster, he said.
“You’re not going to cure an addiction in six months,” he said, adding that he’d like to see the minimum time increased in the future. “I don’t know that that’s curing the problems of the drug-related offenses.”

A former DOC inmate who was released in 2018, Nazeem said the state’s approach to parole and prison programming is fueling recidivism — and increasing the prison population — by leaving offenders unprepared to return to society, a view echoed by Rosenzweig. Eligibility limitations on programming required for release leave offenders frustrated and resistant when that is what stands between them and returning to the outside world, Nazeem said.
“Policies are ballooning the prison population,” Nazeem said, by making people spend more time in prison than is necessary. “It doesn’t take 20 years for a person to come out of his criminality.”
Magness, whose term on the board ends this month, frequently touts work training programs such as the Act 309 program during board meetings and pointed to examples of successful former participants in his interview. Act 309 of 1983, amended several times, is the law that allows the corrections department to contract with counties to house state prisoners and also provide work opportunities for them.
But Magness acknowledged more could be done.
“We need to listen to inmates that have come out of the facilities and see what we can do to change it,” he said. “I think we need to look at our programming a lot more than we probably do.”
Nazeem said programming to help inmates prepare for release needs to be available far sooner than it is, and it needs to be more comprehensive.
“I’m a prime example of that,” he said. “When I was incarcerated, every time I tried to get into an educational program other than my GED, they denied me for them due to the fact that I wasn’t 36 months from my parole eligibility date.”
Nazeem was sentenced to mandatory life without parole as a minor. He was released in 2018 after a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision found such sentences for minors were unconstitutional.
DOC spokesperson Rand Champion said eligibility for Division of Correction programming varies depending on the program and inmate. Those without high school diplomas are required to get a GED before participating in other programming, Champion said.
Nazeem said criteria for release often doesn’t match an offender’s actual needs.
“There’s no preparation for the individual to be reintroduced into society in a healthy way,” Nazeem said, nor are there many wraparound programs to help with reintroduction. He said he could easily see how those without a strong support system could end up back in prison.
“It’s like, in Arkansas, they give you $75 on a gift card; if you stay out for, I think it’s 15 days, they put $75 more on there. That’s what they did to me, you know, after serving 28 years in prison, you give me a $75 gift card and say, ‘Hey, welcome to the world.’”

Formed in Delaware, Echoes has a strong following by faithfully recreating the sound, atmosphere, and immersive experience of a classic Pink Floyd concert.
WILMINGTON, Del. — The Queen Theatre will turn back the clock this weekend as Echoes, Delaware’s own Pink Floyd tribute band known as “The American Pink Floyd,” takes the Main Hall stage on Friday, Dec. 19, at 8 p.m., offering audiences a powerful live recreation of one of rock music’s most influential catalogues.
The performance is part of The Queen’s featured holiday-season lineup and is expected to draw longtime Pink Floyd fans as well as families and younger listeners discovering the music for the first time. With Christmas just days away, the show also adds to a packed weekend of live entertainment in Wilmington, alongside other performances and seasonal events downtown.
Echoes, the American Pink Floyd, an absolute feast for the ears and the eyes. What makes Echoes stand out is their stunning terrific stage show.
Delaware’s Pink Floyd Experience
Formed in Delaware, Echoes has built a strong following throughout the Mid-Atlantic by faithfully recreating the sound, atmosphere, and immersive experience of a classic Pink Floyd concert. The band’s shows span the group’s most celebrated albums, including The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.
Echoes is known for its attention to detail, combining layered guitar work, atmospheric keyboards, precise vocals, and carefully designed lighting and visual elements. The result is a concert experience designed to feel less like a tribute and more like stepping into a Pink Floyd show at the height of the band’s career.
With Pink Floyd no longer touring, tribute acts like Echoes provide fans with a rare opportunity to experience the music live, particularly younger audiences who never had the chance to see the original band perform.
Why Pink Floyd Still Matters
Pink Floyd’s influence on rock music is difficult to overstate. Emerging from London’s psychedelic scene in the late 1960s, the band helped pioneer both psychedelic and progressive rock, pushing the genre far beyond radio-friendly singles.
“Pink Floyd popularized the concept album, treating records as unified artistic statements rather than collections of songs.” said Alex Evans, Music Director at the Queen.  “The Dark Side of the Moon became one of the most successful albums in music history, spending more than 950 weeks on the Billboard charts and selling millions of copies worldwide.  Albums like The Wall and Wish You Were Here further cemented the band’s reputation for blending music with storytelling, philosophy, and social commentary and are worth sharing with adult children still today,” continued Evans.
Pink Floyd also set the standard for immersive live performances, introducing elaborate light shows, projections, and stage effects that transformed rock concerts into theatrical, multi-sensory events — a legacy that still shapes arena and stadium shows today.
Their lyrics tackled themes that remain relevant across generations, including mental health, war, alienation, and the pressures of modern life, giving rock music new emotional and intellectual depth.
Sharing the Music Across Generations
That enduring relevance is part of what makes Echoes’ performance especially meaningful for families. Parents attending with older kids and teens often see the show as a chance to share music that shaped their own youth — and to introduce younger listeners to an era when albums were meant to be heard start to finish.
At recent Echoes shows, it’s common to see multiple generations in the audience, reacting together to extended instrumental passages, iconic guitar solos, and familiar lyrics that still resonate decades later.
A Strong Fit for The Queen
The Queen Theatre’s Main Hall provides an ideal setting for Echoes’ detailed sound and visual production, reinforcing the venue’s growing reputation as a regional destination for high-quality tribute acts and live music experiences.
As Wilmington heads into the holiday weekend, Echoes’ return to The Queen offers a reminder of why Pink Floyd’s music continues to endure — not just as nostalgia, but as a living, shared experience.

,DC,2025-12-16 17:19:35+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"No US House vote to extend health care subsidies, Speaker Johnson says",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-us-house-vote-extend-health-care-subsidies-speaker-johnson-says,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he will not allow a floor vote this week on a bipartisan amendment supported by moderate Republicans that would extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits. Johnson was confident that blocking the amendment would not lead centrist GOP lawmakers to oppose the Republican health care bill scheduled to get a vote Wednesday. “There’s about a dozen members in the conference that are in these swing districts who are fighting hard to make sure they reduce costs for all of their constituents. And many of them did want to vote on this Obamacare, COVID-era subsidy the Democrats created,” Johnson said. “We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve and it just was not to be.”The enhanced ACA tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year, sharply increasing the cost of health insurance for the roughly 22 million Americans who purchase plans through the exchange and benefit from the subsidies. The House Republican health care bill wouldn’t extend those tax credits, frustrating GOP lawmakers in that chamber who are most at risk of losing their reelection bids during the November midterm elections. Johnson said he expects that GOP bill will pass, though he didn’t address its prospects in the Senate, where bipartisanship is needed for nearly all bills to advance under that chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. ‘Idiotic and shameful’New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler said in a speech on the House floor that GOP leaders’ decision to let the enhanced ACA tax credits expire was ""idiotic and shameful,"" especially after changes were added to address fraud and reduce costs. “So we have been forced to sign onto two discharge petitions,” he said. “And yet my Democratic colleagues will not join us, but for those that were at the negotiation table.”Lawler then criticized House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, for not encouraging Democrats to sign onto the bipartisan discharge petitions, noting that would likely get the 218 signatures needed to force a floor vote. He argued that's because Jeffries ""doesn't actually want to solve the problem, he wants the issue.""""This place is disgraceful,"" Lawler said. ""Everybody wants the upper hand.  Everybody wants the political advantage. They don't actually want to do the damn work. This problem could be solved today if everybody who says they care about extending this signs the discharge.""GOP-only bill in 2026?When the House returns from its two-week holiday break next year, Johnson said, leaders may try to use the complex reconciliation process they used to enact the “one big, beautiful bill” to address health care. “What we anticipate going into the first quarter of next year is, possibly in a reconciliation package or in regular order a stand-alone, ideas just like this,” Johnson said after being asked a question about Health Savings Accounts. “We have a long list of things that we know will reduce premiums, increase access and quality of care.” President Donald Trump said Monday he wants Republicans to use the reconciliation process or to eliminate the Senate's legislative filibuster to address health care and other policy priorities. ""Republicans should knock out the filibuster and we should approve a lot of things,"" Trump said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said repeatedly he doesn’t intend to change or scrap the filibuster.Direct payments or tax breaksTrump also reiterated during the Oval Office event he would like to see Congress send direct payments to Americans to help them buy health insurance or afford health care. “I want all money going to the people and let the people buy their own health care. It’ll be unbelievable,” Trump said. “They’ll do a great job. They’ll get much better health care at a much lower cost.”The Senate voted last week on two health care bills, one from Republicans and one from Democrats, but neither received the support needed to move toward a final passage vote. Republicans’ bill would have provided direct payments to some people enrolled in either bronze or catastrophic ACA marketplace plans with up to $1,500 in payments annually for 2026 and 2027. Democrats’ legislation would have extended the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits for three years. Cost most urgent issue, poll findsA bipartisan group of senators is trying to find solutions that bridge the political divide, though they are unlikely to achieve consensus on the details before the end of this week.A poll released Monday by the West Health-Gallup Center on Healthcare in America shows that cost is the “most urgent” health issue facing the country, followed by access and then obesity. Just 57% of those polled said they were satisfied with how much they pay for their own health care and only 16% were satisfied with the total cost of healthcare.Nearly two-thirds of those in the survey said they believe it's the federal government’s responsibility “to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage,” while 33% said it’s not.",,,,2025-12-16 12:58:13.294572

(Courtesy photo)A proposed settlement agreement resolving the ethics investigation into former Indiana Secretary of Public Safety Jennifer-Ruth Green would impose a $10,000 fine and no additional penalties, according to a document released Tuesday ahead of this week’s vote by the Indiana State Ethics Commission.
The commission is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to approve the settlement, which would formally close the ethics case that stems from allegations of ghost employment and misuse of state property brought earlier this fall by the Indiana Office of Inspector General.
Under the agreement, Green admits to violating Indiana’s political activity rule and the misuse of state property rule, as well as to certain factual allegations outlined in the inspector general’s ethics complaint, which was filed on Sept. 12.
In exchange, the commission would agree not to impose any additional sanctions allowed under state ethics law, like more serious fines and even barring a person from future state employment.
Story continues below.
JRG Settlement
 
The settlement requires Green to pay the $10,000 fine within 60 days of the commission’s acceptance of the agreement.
The document explicitly states that the ethics commission “will not impose any further penalties” and that approval would represent the final disposition of the case.
By entering into the agreement, Green also waives her statutory right to a public hearing to contest the complaint before the ethics commission, according to the settlement.
A spokesperson for Green did not immediately reply to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment.
How the investigation began
Green abruptly resigned from her cabinet post in early September, but the inspector general had been investigating her conduct months earlier, including concerns about her use of state employees and state property for political and personal purposes.
A remediation agreement signed earlier in the summer — and later obtained by the Capital Chronicle — showed state officials had attempted to address those concerns internally before Green ultimately stepped down.
Indiana inspector general accuses ex-cabinet secretary of ghost employment, misuse of state property

The document outlined allegations that Green directed state employees to draft and edit political content during work hours; used a state-issued vehicle for personal and political travel; and held campaign-related meetings in state facilities.
It also raised concerns about possible retaliation against employees who cooperated with the inspector general’s investigation, warning that substantiated violations could result in further discipline, including termination.
The remediation agreement warned that if additional violations were substantiated, Green could face further discipline, including termination.
The inspector general filed a formal ethics complaint after Green’s resignation, accusing her of violating state ethics laws by involving state employees in campaign-related activities and misusing state property.
In the settlement now before the ethics commission, Green admits that she violated the political activity rule when she had state employees generate content and proofread posts for her “Elect Jennifer-Ruth Green” Facebook account. She also admits to violating the misuse of state property rule by using — and directing a state employee to use — her assigned state vehicle for personal tasks.
What happens next
The State Ethics Commission met privately in a short executive session in September before allowing the underlying complaint to proceed publicly. 
The settlement published Tuesday was included among routine agenda materials for the commission’s Thursday meeting.
The document is signed by Green; Jared Prentice, Indiana’s inspector general; and Elaine Vullmahn, chief counsel for enforcement at the inspector general’s office.
The bipartisan, five-person panel will vote Thursday on whether to accept the settlement, which would take effect upon approval by the commission.
Approval would immediately resolve the matter. Rejection would keep the case open and could send it toward a contested hearing or further enforcement proceedings.
Green’s resignation marked the first departure of a cabinet-level official in Gov. Mike Braun’s administration.
Following her appointment in January, Green’s responsibilities included oversight of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Correction, the Criminal Justice Institute and the Parole Board.
Despite the pending ethics charges, Green announced in October that she will run again for Indiana’s 1st Congressional District. She first challenged Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan in 2022 but was defeated.

The public is invited.

Since I was a child, I’ve always loved old things.
About a dozen years ago, I was in southwest Mississippi especially to look at Wyolah, an 1830s house that was for sale.
On my way to Wyolah, I turned a curve on Mississippi Highway 553 and saw something that grabbed my heart.

It was Christ Episcopal Church — down on its heels, but still elegant and classic.
Soon after that, my partner, John Norris, and I bought, restored and moved into Wyolah. Every time I drove by the church, it called out to me for help.
John and I soon became active members of the historic and beautiful church. It has pure Gothic Revival architecture, the congregation dates back to 1820, making it the oldest Episcopal congregation in Mississippi, and we loved being part of that community of faith.
Everyone agreed with us that the church deserved to be saved. But who would take charge?
By then I had completed work on the films, “The Help,” “Get On Up” and “The Girl on the Train” and had some free time. I volunteered to help.

I knew I could refer to experiences and contacts I made after college, when I worked several years as a building contractor.
Christ Church leaders gave me the go-ahead.
Two things kicked off my work. My friend and neighbor, the late Jinny Patterson, said she wanted more than anything to see the original cross put back on top of the church. To do that, we had to replace the leaking roof.
All that happened in 2019, just in time for the church’s bicentennial celebration in 2020.
Another close friend, The Rev. Ken Ritter, Christ Church’s vicar, was miserable on hot summer Sundays when he had to wear heavy clerical vestments. Of course, there was no air-conditioning. We had to have a climate control system. It was soon installed.
Many of the original windows were badly damaged. We found the source of the original stained glass and etched glass in Germany. Experts at Pearl River Glass Studio in Jackson made the windows look like new.
Other successes followed, including masonry and plaster repairs on the interior walls and ceiling. That work was done by Curtis Anderson of Natchez and Jose Ramirez of Ridgeland and their talented crews. Once again, the walls look like they are made of marble blocks.
Jose scraped the ceiling one day and found the original color of paint from 1856.
Also exciting was seeing the date of 1856 hand-written under a pew. Tom Vigil of Natchez found that when all the pews were removed from the church so that he could repair and paint them.
In fact, Tom had to re-create several pews because they were totally unusable.
The last major project was the church floor, which had been painted decades ago. We found the original color of the floor and put it back.
Other newly completed work includes a specially designed handrail up the front steps, a handicapped ramp, a larger organ, upholstery on the kneelers and the placement of the font and its pedestal at its original location near the church entrance.

Ongoing improvements are being made to the church cemetery by The Cemetery Doctor, LLC. Today the church looks just like it looked when it was built in 1857-1858.

Thanks to the generosity of dozens and dozens of people, all the beautiful work at Christ Church has been totally donated or paid for.
To commemorate the restoration, a rededication Eucharistic worship service will take place at 11 a.m. Saturday.
It will be led by The Right Rev. Dr. Dorothy Sanders Wells, the Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Mississippi.
We invite everyone to attend the service and the free reception afterward. 
The church is located 12 miles north of Natchez at the intersection of Mississippi Highway 553 and Church Hill Road.
Christ Church has worship services conducted by The Rev. Samuel B. Godfrey at 2 p.m. on second and fourth Sundays and is growing as a congregation. We welcome new members.
Bishop Wells perfectly captured the purpose of the restoration when she said, “May God grant this worshipping community many, many more years to shine the light of Christ from this hill.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Labor announced plans for a “targeted review” of Minnesota’s unemployment insurance program amid mounting scrutiny of fraud in the state’s human services programs — now a politically potent issue that’s reached the Oval Office.
The department sent a letter to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development asserting that recent news reports of fraud in the state’s Medicaid-funded human services programs could signal fraud and abuse in unemployment benefits.
“If there has been any related abuse of our (unemployment insurance) systems, it will not be tolerated, and I trust our specialized strike team to get to the bottom of this and report their findings directly to me,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a press release.
A spokeswoman for DEED said the agency routinely exceeds the federal Department of Labor’s metrics for payment accuracy and has a fraud rate below the national average.
“We welcome the opportunity to illustrate the strength of our payment controls and oversight,” DEED said.
Chavez-DeRemer is just the latest Trump official to take an interest in fraud in Minnesota in recent weeks after it caught the attention of President Trump, who’s used heritage of those charged in the Feeding Our Future and Medicaid frauds — most have Somali ancestry — to attack the entire Somali American community as “garbage.”
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week his agency is increasing scrutiny on funds going to “areas of concern, such as Somalia,” and investigating allegations that fraudsters have directed their stolen loot to the al-Shabaab militant group. These allegations, based on anonymous sources published in a conservative outlet, are not new and unsupported by any federal terrorism financing charges. (Federal prosecutors have said the fraudsters are greedy, not ideological.)
Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, threatened earlier this month to withhold funding to programs suspected of being targeted by widespread fraud unless the state Department of Human Services provides weekly updates on its audit activities. Those include the 14 programs the Walz administration announced would be scrutinized in October.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development have also announced probes.

Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) to become the next speaker of the House of Delegates.
With the support of the Democratic Caucus to lead the chamber, Peña-Melnyk has more than enough votes to win an election for speaker when the House convenes for a special session that begins at noon Tuesday. Her election will make her the first Afro-Latina and first immigrant to preside over either chamber in the Maryland General Assembly.
“I really don’t have enough words to express how I feel about my colleagues trusting me with this enormous responsibility to lead,” Peña-Melnyk told reporters as she emerged from the 40-minute caucus meeting. “I’m an inclusive leader, and I’m going to lead with my colleagues. This House belongs to all of us.”
Peña-Melnyk, who serves as chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, quickly emerged as the leading candidate just days after former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) announced she would relinquish the gavel but remain a member of the House. Jones stepped done Dec. 4.
Peña-Melnyk’s selection was very different from Jones.
In 2019, Jones announced then withdrew her candidacy for speaker. She later emerged as a compromise candidate when then Dels. Dereck Davis and Maggie McIntosh were not able to secure enough votes to succeed Michael Busch, who died in office earlier that year. When she took office, Jones became the first woman and the first Black lawmaker to lead either chamber in Maryland.
Peña-Melnyk was one of four candidates seeking to replace Jones as speaker. She quickly secured enough votes to seal the nomination, and within days the three other candidates for the job said they would withdraw and support Peña-Melnyk.
The election in the House Democratic Caucus was punctuated with cheers that could be heard in the hall outside the closed door gathering. It was over in less than 20 mins.

Once a lively gathering spot filled with the aroma of homemade foods and the sounds of chattering families, now the humming of the fridge and other machines can be heard.
“I could almost count how many sales I made in the past three weeks, because the mall is empty,” Warsawe said. 
Somali-owned businesses across Minneapolis have become eerily quiet after ICE targeted the Somali community in recent weeks, sparking fear throughout the Twin Cities.

Once vibrant businesses and bustling corridors now resemble a deserted city. Business owners say foot traffic has nearly vanished since ICE arrived in force. The big conversation among them: how to pay the next month’s rent.
“The tenants in the mall are worried that if ICE raids continue to target the community for several more months or even a year, how will they be able to pay the rent at their shops or cover their daily expenses?” said Basim Sabri, the mall’s owner. 
Customers are staying away, even if they are citizens or legal residents, he said, because “They feel intimidated by ICE activities because we have seen cases where ICE does not discriminate in who they arrest,” Sabri said.
The Somali community is not alone. Burrito Mercado, a Latino community landmark in St. Paul, is reducing inventory and hours, the Pioneer Press reported this week. “The immigrant community being very fearful … that’s obviously keeping folks away,” the owner told the newspaper. 
Even if ICE fails to achieve the mass deportation sought by the Trump administration, they may succeed in choking off immigrant economies. 
The Karmel Mall is not just a place for business. It is a community hub, home to child care centers where the shop owners drop off their children, an eldercare facility, a mosque and a Qur’an school.

ICE agents came to Karmel in the early hours of Monday afternoon and reportedly detained at least four people. 
One of the people detained was a pregnant Somali woman. Abdisalan Abdi, who owns a money transfer business, said he watched the woman as she sat down to prevent herself from falling or slipping. Officers grabbed her by the arms and dragged her through the snow, he said. 
One other person was a young Latino man. Abdi, who saw the interaction, said he cannot confirm whether the man was taken away or released. 
A Somali U.S. citizen was released after being detained, Abdi said.
A large crowd arrived quickly and blocked the ICE vehicles with their cars, demanding the release of the detainees. 
Minneapolis police and Hennepin County Sheriff’s deputies also came to the scene, outnumbering the ICE officers, who quickly left.

Sabri, the mall’s owner, said almost all businesses are affected, but restaurants across immigrant neighborhoods have been hit especially hard. Many have closed.
The most affected area starts at Lake Street and Blaisdell Avenue, extending east to the river, with many Latino shops.
“Lake Street, which used to be busy with heavy foot traffic, is now a ghost town,” he said. 
Sabri remains hopeful. “It’s very unfortunate that it came to this point, but we are optimistic that this is a cloud that’s going to pass,” he said.
Following a xenophobic tirade during which President Trump called Somalis “garbage,” Sabri said he would challenge the president or his cabinet to come and see the Somali community in person. They would change their minds when they see the community, he said.
If the problem persists and tenants are unable to pay their rent, however, the issue will cascade, Sabri said, with potentially devastating effects on tenants, landlords and the entire community.
Samiya Ahmed, a restaurant manager at Karmel, said that even though most shops and restaurants are closed, she’s staying open, hoping upon hope she can generate enough revenue to survive.   
“Even though there’s not a lot of business these days, I still open it every day because with rent due every month, I can’t afford to close it,” Ahmed said.

Dalya Attar, in a February 2025 photo after she was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Maryland Senate.

Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City) have asked a federal court to dismiss several of the extortion counts against her, arguing that she was the victim of harassment who “simply wanted to be left alone.”
In a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, attorneys for Attar argued that the government failed to prove that she and her co-defendants — her brother Joseph “Yossi” Attar and Baltimore City Police Officer Kalman Finkelstein — sought to extort money or property from the victim, meaning those charges, three out of eight, ought to be dismissed.
“This case is not about any attempt by the Defendants to obtain money, property, or thing of transferable economic value,” reads the filing. “The Defendants sought nothing more than freedom from ‘Victim’ 1’s ongoing and well-documented stalking, harassment, threats, and demands.”
The attorneys stopped short of asking U.S. District Court Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher to dismiss the entire case, which also includes counts of conspiracy and wiretapping.
In October, a federal grand jury indicted Attar, her brother and Finkelstein on charges that they carried out a blackmail scheme to silence a disgruntled political consultant who once worked for Attar.

The indictment detailed a plot allegedly carried out by the trio to capture the consultant on video having an affair, and use the footage to scare her, so that she would not attempt to impede the senator’s future campaigns by spreading disparaging information. All three pleaded not guilty last month.
The senator’s attorneys, in Tuesday’s filing, said the government may argue that Attar “retained an ‘economic interest’ in winning the state delegate election,” the filing says the “alleged communications” in the extortion counts were made not to protect her job, but to “escape” the consultant’s intimidation.
In the filing, the attorneys describe a “campaign of harassment” carried out by the consultant, after she was terminated from Attar’s 2018 campaign “for misconduct.”
The filing alleges that the consultant began “relentlessly texting” Attar and members of the Attar family, “with threats to cause economic and reputational harm.”
The consultant, who is not identified in court records, also showed up uninvited at restaurants, at Attar’s parents’ home and “other unexpected locations” for the “sole purpose of haranguing Senator Attar,” according to the filing. Further, the consultant attempted to convince a school that Joseph Attar’s children attended, to expel them “without any rational justification.”
Attorneys for the defendants also pointed to a text message sent to Joseph Attar by the consultant in October 2018.
“Beware,” the consultant wrote, according to the filing. “When u least expect it, expect it. Goodbye. This is my final warning.”
Attorneys for the Attars also took the opportunity to cast doubt on the government’s evidence in the case, pointing out that the government does not possess any of the alleged video footage used in the blackmail scheme.
Instead, the government relied upon one of the victims, who recorded a conversation with Joseph Attar, in which Attar is alleged to have shown a portion of the footage.
“It is Victim 2, and Victim 2 alone, who reports that this fleeting display included intimate images of him and Victim 1 engaging in intercourse nearly two years earlier,” reads Tuesday’s filing. “The Government unquestioningly accepted Victim 2’s allegation as true and relied on it to form the basis of a federal indictment, despite having no other direct evidence of the existence of the alleged illegal recording.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
BURLINGTON – Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos pleaded no contest Tuesday to a charge of drunken driving and received a six-month deferred sentence, allowing the conviction to be cleared from her record provided she does not commit any violations during that period.
The misdemeanor charge against Vekos stemmed from an incident nearly two years ago where she was accused by troopers of showing up to a suspicious death scene in Bridport impaired. 
Judge John Pacht agreed during Tuesday’s hearing in Chittenden County Superior criminal court to allow Vekos to plead no contest as well as the deferment of her sentence over the objection of Assistant Attorney General Rosemary Kennedy, who prosecuted the case.
The hearing Tuesday took place as Vekos, a Democrat, faced calls to resign last week from the heads of the Vermont Democratic and Progressive parties as well as Republican Gov. Phil Scott. 
Those calls followed a VTDigger story this month detailing ethics complaints brought against Vekos from crime victims about how they were treated by her and concerns about how their cases were resolved. She has challenged those allegations against her, and has said she had no plans to step down from her elected office. 
According to court records Vekos was called to meet with state police investigators on the night of Jan. 25, 2024, a homicide scene in Bridport. Troopers later prevented Vekos from driving away from the scene after a couple of them allegedly detected alcohol on her breath, charging documents stated.
At the scene that night, a trooper asked Vekos how much she had to drink that night and she reportedly replied she had one gin and tonic with a burger for dinner about an hour earlier, according to charging documents.
Vekos was eventually taken to the state police barracks in New Haven for processing for drunken driving. 
Before she was taken to the barracks, the charging documents stated, she refused to do field sobriety tests, telling a trooper, “Are you serious Ryan, can’t you just have a friend come and get me,” according to the documents. 
Vekos refused to take a breath test at the barracks and was subsequently charged with drunken driving.
Vekos declined an opportunity Tuesday offered by the judge to address the resolution of the case before he formally imposed the sentence. She also declined to speak to reporters following the hearing.

Don Gaetz has filed a bill to allow college professors, faculty, and teacher assistants to openly carry firearms on campus. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Florida professors, university faculty, and teaching assistants could soon be able to openly carry firearms on campus, thanks to a sweeping new measure filed by a Republican lawmaker.
Sen. Don Gaetz is sponsoring the legislation, entitled “School Safety,” to address security concerns in higher education. If passed, the bill would remove college campuses as gun-free zones — marking a significant shift in how Florida handles gun issues.
It would become one of the few Second Amendment expansion bills adopted in Florida since the Parkland massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018, which prompted a higher gun-purchasing age and red flag laws.
In an interview with the Phoenix, Gaetz called his legislation “sadly timed,” adding that he “never wanted” to file a bill like this.
He referred to a slate of violent incidents in the past few months, including a shooting spree at Florida State University in April, the assassination of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in September, a shooting at Brown University over the weekend, and, most recently, an anti-Jewish shooting in Australia that left 15 dead.
“We’re living in a world where our institutions are being threatened,” Gaetz said, adding that he’s already filed another bill aimed at increasing protection outside of churches, mosques, and synagogues. “I’m sorry that I’m having to do this, but it just seems as though places in our society that we thought were safe, even sacrosanct, are now becoming targets.”
Although he anticipates objections that teachers may abuse the ability to bring a gun to school, Gaetz pointed out that there have been no instances of a school shooting sprouting from an unwell volunteer in the guardian program. This school safety initiative allows trained and vetted school employees to carry concealed weapons on K-12 campuses.
“None of the parade of terribles have happened that the opponents to the guardian program tried to advance,” he said. “While none of that has happened, people have been killed.”
What else is in the bill?
Gaetz isn’t this first Florida lawmaker to try to promote campus carry. At the start of the 2025 legislative session, then-Sen. Randy Fine brought his all-encompassing campus carry bill to its first committee — unlike Gaetz’s, Fine’s bill would have allowed all students to carry — but it was voted down. Fine later left to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Gaetz said that the heart of his bill is hardening Florida’s state colleges and universities by requiring better threat assessments, better responses to threats, and better communications between first responders and faculty in emergencies.
SB 896 would allow university employees, faculty, and students who are also working for a college to either openly carry or carry conceal weapons on campus. It also would expand the school guardian program to the university level and create an offense of discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of school.
Gaetz said his measure also would require universities to ensure all classroom doors lock during an emergency — especially after FSU students discovered during the April school shooting that their doors could not lock. He estimates that around $60 million will end up being appropriated for the effort, in line with what Gov. Ron DeSantis requested in his budget proposal last week.

(David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)President Donald Trump recently issued an executive order to preempt states from passing new legislation or having laws on the books that regulate artificial intelligence, with some
exceptions.
The president believes that the United States should dominate AI for the purposes of “national and economic security.”
He calls for Congress to pass federal law to set a national standard to replace individual state AI regulations that he says impede the innovation the country needs.
States not complying with the executive order will face legal challenges by the U.S. Department of Justice and loss of federal funding.
How should the South Carolina Legislature respond?
There is bipartisan desire to protect children from online exploitation. Sextortion and AI-generated mental health counseling are two of the threats to children that have resulted in possibly up to one in five children being victims and well over 50 suicides nationally.
Every member of Congress will tell you that this must be stopped.
Yet, other than a law on intimate imagery involving deepfakes, there has been no AI regulation by Congress since 1996. And the Communications Decency Act turned out to primarily be a civil liability shield to protect AI companies.
Here’s how you can use the Take It Down Act

It is not only children harmed by AI-generated threats. Adults with mental health issues can also suffer.
Consider this recent Washington Post headline: “A former tech executive killed his mother. Her family says ChatGPT made her a target.”
Over 250 bills in 47 states have been introduced to regulate AI regarding health care.
Then there is the intentional misuse of AI that impacts the lives of many Americans.
For example, over 40 bills have been filed in the states targeting AI algorithms that can be used to “promote anti-competitive and discriminatory practices in the housing industry” resulting in higher rents.
AI algorithms, created by the tech companies themselves, are also largely responsible for our nation being so horribly divided. Social media platforms use the search and browsing history of their customers for the purpose of maximizing use and thus higher profits.
The key ingredient is to feed the customers with messages and misinformation aligned with their interests to drive strong emotional response.
According to Cindy Shen, a communications professor at the University of California at Davis, “outrage and hostility tend to drive engagement” and results in “online echo chambers where extreme views go unchallenged.”
The impact on our political system is that candidates for office find it essential to pay more attention to their voter base with the most extreme, social media-created opinions.
Finding common ground with all voters and the other political parties to solve problems is not rewarded.
No one should expect Congress, even with Trump’s approval, to pass legislation to regulate AI. The billions AI companies have and will spend on the national AI regulation debate will all but guarantee congressional failure, in spite of a national Gallup poll finding 80% approval of more AI safety regulations.
So, should South Carolina move forward with state AI regulations to protect our citizens from the intentional and unintentional harms of AI, which will hopefully include the corrosive effects of
algorithms on our society?
Yes, says state Rep. Brandon Guffey, a York County Republican and an ardent supporter of states’ rights.
He has become a national leader in the effort to protect children from online threats.
Prior to the president’s executive order, Guffey said on my podcast that if there is one that takes away states’ right, “the first thing I am going to do is to try to pass as many regulations as I can on AI just to get challenged in court from the federal level.”
Every state should follow Guffey’s lead to force a national showdown.
While the executive order promises to exempt state AI regulations on child safety protections, no one should assume that will happen when the tech companies push back.
AI must be regulated to protect all of us.
Given an inept Congress bowing to tech billionaires, that job is up to the states.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chatbot-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 11:57:20.983526

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)Ford Motor Company is scrapping plans to manufacture a next-generation electric pickup truck at BlueOval City in West Tennessee, looking instead to gas-powered pickup trucks with more stable paths to profit.
The auto manufacturer will begin producing gas-powered Built Ford Tough truck models at its renamed Tennessee Truck Plant in 2029, according to a Monday news release. The facility was previously called the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center. 
“Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes,” the release states. 
The pivot follows an announcement that Ford and SK On will end their joint U.S. battery factory venture, BlueOval SK. 
The joint venture launched in 2021 to build three battery plants: two in Kentucky and one at Ford’s BlueOval City site in Stanton. SK On will own and operate the Tennessee battery plant on Ford’s campus, and a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the Kentucky plants. SK On stated it would maintain a strategic relationship with Ford, as the Tennessee battery plant is located on Ford’s campus.
“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” Ford President and CEO Jim Farley stated in the release. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”
Plans at BlueOval City, a $5.6 billion campus located on about 3,300 acres of former farmland, have shifted significantly since the manufacturing plant was announced in 2021.
The company originally planned to produce a new all-electric, next-generation pickup truck beginning in 2025. But slowing demand and the rollback of federal electric vehicle funding and tax credits pushed that date out twice — first to 2027 and then to 2028 as Ford began to focus on smaller, more affordable electric models and hybrids. 
Ford received nearly $1 billion in state economic incentives for the massive campus, contingent on the company creating 5,760 direct new jobs on the site over a 10-year period. The manufacturing plant is expected to employ 3,000 of those workers, with the remainder employed by the battery plant.
Ford delays mass production of electric truck at BlueOval City until 2028

Ford announced a $2 billion investment in its Kentucky manufacturing plant in August, converting the plant to produce smaller electric vehicles. The first vehicle from the company’s new Universal EV Platform will be a mid-sized pickup truck assembled at the Louisville plant starting in 2027.
“The company is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storage business,” the release states.
Ford will turn its focus to producing a range of hybrids and extended range electric vehicles — electric vehicles that also feature combustion engines that act as generators to recharge the vehicle’s battery, extending range for long trips. The company expects about half of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range electric vehicles and fully electric vehicles by 2030.
Plans have also changed for the next-generation F-150 Lightning, which will now be an extended-range electric vehicle produced in Dearborn, Michigan. Ford also scrapped plans to produce a new electric commercial van for Europe, and will switch to producing affordable gas and hybrid commercial vans in North America, to be manufactured in Ohio.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2876-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

Stiles said his organization served 4,358 people with about 50 navigators in 10 clinics across the state. Because the notification of the change in funding came in May and his board decided to wind down the program, that wasn’t even a full year, he said. 
With changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that affect health care, Stiles is concerned about the people his organization was serving.  
“These were staff that were in the community, they were in local clinics, and they could help someone with their application or help them understand what they needed to submit, or kind of work to get them back on Medicaid or their health insurance,” he said.
Changes in the law include getting rid of continuous eligibility, which means people on Medicaid will have to apply twice a year, rather than once a year.
 “We’re going to see less people that are able to retain insurance,” Stiles said. 
Although it’s difficult to understand the full effect of the law’s changes, Stiles said it’s estimated Kansas’ uninsured rate will jump from 9% to 12%. 
“It’s just going to be even more crucial that we have the local resources that can help people, keep people on their insurance, keep people on Medicaid, because we are going to see sort of a churning where people are going off and on and off and on,” he said. “It’s going to hurt their ability to get health care, but it’s also going to impact the hospital or the local health care clinic and their ability to get care paid for.”
Stiles said the clinics in the Community Care Network of Kansas currently receive $17 million from the state and serve 40% of the uninsured people in Kansas, along with 25% of everyone on Medicaid. 
“They serve a much higher number of those that are on the health insurance exchanges, because often with those plans there’s going to be a lot of things that are uncovered,” he said. “I think that what people don’t know is that our clinics have to provide care, and they have to put you on their sliding scale whether you’re insured or not.”
For example, if insurance says the patient co-pay is $100 but the individual is on a sliding scale, they may pay only $10 for that health care service, Stiles said. 
“We tend to sort of get people that have insurance that doesn’t cover a lot,” he said.
The clinics also offer behavioral health and dental services, and many clients don’t have dental insurance, he said.
With the number of uninsured expected to go up, Stiles is unsure what that means for the clinics in his system. He served on the team that put together the application for the Rural Health Transformation grant, a $50 billion program offered by the Trump administration to try to alleviate some of the health care challenges created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.   
However, although those dollars will be helpful, they’re only allowed to be used in rural communities, Stiles said. That means just 85 of Kansas’ 105 counties, and some counties that probably should get funds won’t because they’re adjacent to metropolitan areas, he said. 
“It’s not going to cover getting people on insurance. It’s not going to allow us to pay for health care for people that can’t afford it, or don’t have insurance or lose their insurance,” Stiles said. 
The funds will change the health care system in positive ways, with a strong focus on prevention and getting people healthier, he said. 
While that’s important and needs funding and programming, Stiles is worried about immediate systemic effects. 
“We’re going to have to come up with some solutions that get people healthier because the system can’t afford to do their health care when they’re uninsured,” he said. “I think people are interested and excited about some of the ideas that are coming out of that rural transformation approach, but it doesn’t really get at the problems we’re talking about today.”
Stiles remains hopeful.  
“The (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) has some impacts, and I’m not going to discount those, but so much of what we’re talking about is what we should have always been talking about,” he said. “We may not agree on how to get there, but we all should be talking about how do we make our communities places where everybody can be healthy? How do we invest in keeping people from getting sick?”
Such discussions raise tough issues such as pricing medications, such as insulin, and social drivers of health, such as access to healthy food, he said.  
“I am hopeful. This administration, our senators, our federal representatives, our state representatives, we’re having a conversation we need to have,” Stiles said. “We may not agree on how to get there, but at least we can finally agree on the conversation.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

Legislators from both the Michigan House of Representatives and the Michigan Senate called the decision by House GOP leadership to cancel around $645 million in spending a disgrace, as state Rep. Amos O’Neal (D-Saginaw) said in a press conference on Tuesday morning. 
“We can do better than this as Americans and as the state of Michigan. We can do a lot better than these decisions that were already pre-approved for the citizens of this great state,” O’Neal, the chair of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, said.
State Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids) took the chance to flip language often used by House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) on its head, that the cuts were intended to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in government spending. 
“I think that is very important for everyone to understand, to pull that funding midstream without warning is not just unacceptable. It is the very definition of waste, fraud and abuse, because it throws away taxpayer dollars and the real work that was already underway,” Grant said. “When House Republicans disapproved these projects, they didn’t just cut line items. They broke promises and they cut lifelines for the people that we serve.”

State Rep. Mai. Xiong (D-Warren), the Asian Pacific American Caucus co-chair, similarly disputed narratives from Republican legislators about the decision being made to promote fiscal responsibility.
“While House Republicans may be proud that they are saving the state money by clawing back $645 million, that is simply not true,” she said. “This does not make your taxes go down. This does not put money back into your pockets. This money is going back into the general fund, and all of us will have to continue to pay taxes, because that is the law.”
Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) also promised action to attempt to restore funding that had been cancelled in last week’s decision. 
“Last week’s action came after our people, came after our communities. Enough is enough,” she said. “Just know that we will use every tool in our toolbox, in the state Senate, our Democratic colleagues in the House, working alongside our governor, to restore these critical funds.”
Legislators also criticized the disproportionate impact of funding cuts on Black communities and residents, including key projects to reduce crime and promote educational outcomes in Detroit, as Detroit Caucus Chair State Rep. Stephanie Young (D-Detroit) said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It’s so unfortunate because it has caused distress in our communities that was not necessary,” she said, adding that the confusion around exactly which projects were affected by the funding disapprovals was creating a “culture of chaos.” 
“We’re going to continue to dig down deep and to see exactly what’s been impacted,” Young said. “We stand united, the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus.”
The Senate Appropriations Committee will meet later on Tuesday to discuss the work projects. However, Anthony said that the committee would not cancel any further funding —and the deadline to do so has also passed — and that the focus would be on allowing testimony from affected grantees. 
“We would never weaponize the Senate Appropriations Committee for retaliation,” Anthony said. “That type of environment that is being created by the House Republicans has not translated to the Senate Democrats.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_3474-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

State law requires [[...]","The average number of people awaiting placement by the Missouri Department of Mental Health in psychiatric hospitals for treatment to allow them to stand trial has steadily increased, nearing 500 in October (Caspar Benson/Getty Images).State lawmakers are seeking solutions to a growing backlog of jailed Missourians awaiting help from the Missouri Department of Mental Health to move their cases forward.
These Missourians have been charged but not convicted of crimes, and they were found incompetent to stand trial due to mental health disorders or cognitive disabilities. State law requires the department to provide services and treatment to help them. But in October, the average number of people on the waitlist reached a new high of 487.
Several bills filed ahead of the 2026 legislative session seek to reduce the backlog or build out options to get treatment for people with serious mental illnesses outside of jail. Some stakeholders say the bills have loopholes, but their sponsors maintain they will amp up discussion between lawmakers and the department about the roots of the problem and how the legislature can help.
Two bills add requirements or consequences for the department. State Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton, filed a bill that would require the department to reimburse jails for housing people on the waitlist at a rate of $200 per person, per day, as well as the cost of medication. 
Another bill, sponsored by state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson, would impose a 45-day deadline on the department to conduct court-ordered evaluations and require the department to transfer people ruled incompetent to a hospital within another 45 days. The bill would also require the department to submit annual reports to the General Assembly on competency restoration.
Seitz said a key goal of his bill is to bring the department and lawmakers together in conversation to identify solutions.
“This will open the dialogue to [say], ‘We see there’s a problem, let’s diagnose the problem and solve the problem,” Seitz said. “And I think creating deadlines like I did in the legislation and then requiring an annual report will show us where the problem lies.”
Vernetti said the entire state “has to do a better job of finding ways to get people the help that they need.”
‘Warehoused in jails’: State accused of denying mental health services to incarcerated Missourians

A bill filed by a pair of Democrats — state Rep. Aaron Crossley of Independence and state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern ofKansas City — seeks to establish guidelines for court-ordered involuntary outpatient treatment before a person gets a criminal charge. 
The state’s framework for competency restoration — treatment and services designed to allow defendants to have their day in court — has been moving away from department-run psychiatric hospitals. 
A 2023 law authorized the department to offer jail-based competency restoration services and also allowed outpatient treatment for people who could be safely released on bond. The department launched four jail-based pilot programs in St. Louis city and county, as well as Clay and Jackson counties, but law enforcement officials involved in those pilots have reported mixed results.
Crossley said his bill, which delineates a process for courts to assess whether involuntary treatment is necessary and for the person to respond, is designed to “make sure that we’re not forcing people into a situation that is against their will unless it’s absolutely necessary.”
He said it could also help slow the growth of the waitlist for competency restoration services by helping people get treatment earlier.
“We’re talking about getting people help as early as we can,” Crossley said, “and we know that when we help people with any health care issue, the earlier the better, and the more restored they will be to live dignified lives in the community.”
Nurrenbern said the bill would lay out a pathway to get treatment for people with serious mental health conditions who would be better served outside of a psychiatric hospital.
“As we look at this from a state perspective, I think one of the things that should be compelling to individuals is that this is a more efficient model,” Nurrenbern said, “that it can be a more fiscally responsible model, and it can be a model that can be used to ensure that we’re also not breaking individuals’ constitutional rights.”
 A persistent problem

The department has long acknowledged the growing number of Missourians who are waiting for a hospital bed to move their cases toward trial or dismissal. 
Months before the filing in November of a federal class action lawsuit against the department, Mental Health Director Valerie Huhn in May told lawmakers on the House Health and Mental Health Committee that the waitlist left the state vulnerable to litigation. 
“I just wanted to make everybody aware of some of the risks that we know we’re taking on because we can’t get these individuals from jail into our state operated hospitals,” Huhn said in May. “Obviously their illness is worse, and as their treatment is delayed, that makes it harder for us to turn them around.”
Dr. Jeanette Simmons, the department’s deputy director, told The Independent in October that the waitlist is growing because courts are requesting more competency evaluations and the department has a static number of hospital beds.
“As that number continues to increase, I’m not surprised that the number of folks found incompetent increases,” Simmons said. “It clearly correlates together.”
The department maintains that everyone on the waitlist is getting help.
In addition to the jail-based pilot programs, the department indicated in October that two mobile teams of clinicians that visit jails statewide helped 117 people attain competency last year.
But the jail-based programs have met roadblocks.
Sarah Boyd, spokesperson for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office, said Friday that the agency is terminating its agreement with the department in January.
“Our goal in participating in this pilot program was to reduce the number of Clay County inmates awaiting placement in a Missouri Department of Mental Health facility,” Boyd said, “and that did not happen.”
Boyd said the number of people awaiting hospital placement in the jail stayed steady at 7-8 people during the pilot and that the compensation the jail received from the department did not cover the cost of dedicating a pod to competency restoration.
Returning that pod to full occupancy, Boyd said, “will save hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
The sheriff’s office will continue working with mental health staff the department had contracted as part of the pilot program, Boyd said.
“We wanted to be part of a broader solution, but in the current form of this program, it didn’t work out,” Boyd said.
 Proposed solutions

Cape Girardeau County Jail Administrator Richard Rushin said his agency built two mental health pods in the new jail opened in September, partly because the jail is expected to house people awaiting services from the state’s mental health department.
Rushin estimated that the pods, which contain 28 single-bed cells with cameras, cost $7.5 million of the $54 million the sheriff’s office spent on the jail.
Rushin said he supports Vernetti’s jail reimbursement bill partly because of the cost of housing people with acute mental health needs, including medications and extra staff.
Taney County Sheriff Brad Daniels said “it wouldn’t hurt to get some of those funds back from housing the inmates.” 
“But to me, that’s not the big thing,” he said. “I’m not in this job to make money off of housing prisoners. I feel like we need to get them the help that they need so that they can move on.”
State Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton, speaks during Missouri House debate on Feb. 27 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Vernetti said “the money is not the motivation.”
“This is about the discussion on the issue,” Vernetti said, “because I think that if we just threw money at the current problem, that’s only continuing the problem.”
Daniels said he likes that Seitz’s bill would give the department a 45-day deadline to place someone in a hospital.
In recent weeks, Daniels said, the department has been taking about two weeks to complete competency evaluations, often via telehealth. That’s an improvement, he said, but wait times for a hospital bed are still long.
Of the seven people in his jail who have been ruled incompetent, Daniels said on Wednesday, one has been waiting over 14 months for hospital care.
“Once they’ve been determined to be incompetent,” Daniels said, “we need to get them out of here.”
Rushin said he would support the 45-day deadlines Seitz’s bill imposes on the department “if [the bill] would actually hold them accountable for that.” But he doubts the department would meet the deadlines.
“I hate to sound negative, but right now, all they have to do is keep asking for extensions,” Rushin said.
While state law already requires the department to complete competency evaluations within 60 days, the department often takes longer — an average of 75 days, according to its fiscal year 2027 budget request. 
There is no law capping how long the department can take to transfer someone to a hospital. 
Rushin said that many of the people who have been jailed and ruled incompetent in his county were charged with misdemeanors like trespassing.
“If they plead guilty upon the first hearing with an attorney present, they might get 30 or 60 days, [or they] might get six months,” Rushin said. “Yet they end up going about 18 months to two plus years through this process because of the backup.”
It’s gotten to the point, he said, where “there’s no due process anymore for these lower-lying laws, which is a violation of their rights.”
 Money matters

Addressing the underlying causes of the backlog, Nurrenbern said, comes down to funding. 
“Departments have been telling us to do more to increase wages, and we haven’t done that,” she said. “Unless we spend significant state resources to invest in our workforce in the Department of Mental Health and Department of Health and Senior Services…we’re not going to do anything to be able to alleviate the gaps that exist there.”
Seitz and Vernetti underlined a need to keep the department accountable in its spending.
“We spent money on the mental health department,” Seitz said. “I’m sure they do a great job in very many areas, but this is one area seemingly that people have fallen through the cracks.”
Vernetti said a shortage of hospital beds “would be the wrong answer [for the department] to give.”
“Then we’re going to start looking at their budget and seeing, ‘OK, let’s maybe move some of your budget from an area that you’re not spending all of it, or maybe not spending it wisely,” Vernetti said.
Daniels and Rushin said they hope lawmakers’ attention to the backlog of people awaiting mental health services in jails will yield solutions.
“They don’t deserve to be living like that,” Daniels said. “They need to get the help that they need so that they can either be found guilty or not guilty of the crime that they have allegedly committed, and get on with their lives or serve their time.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/prisoner-behind-bars-handcuffs-jail-prison-getty-e1673729426865-1.jpg,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

But there may be a divine opportunity. 
Religious institutions across the state own thousands of acres of land – a massive reservoir of potential housing – and if just half of the developable parcels were built out at higher density, researchers estimate it could create a striking half a million new housing units. That generous estimate would be more than twice the state target of 222,000 new units that officials say is needed by 2035. 
Faith-based organizations control approximately 4,860 developable parcels totaling more than 20,000 acres across the Commonwealth, according to an analysis by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy’s Center for Geospatial Solutions commissioned by the Lynch Foundation.  
“We do not have another option here in Massachusetts,” said Katie Everett, executive director of the Boston-based Lynch Foundation, which focuses on a range of issues, including housing and homelessness, driven by Catholic principles. “We are not getting any bigger. In fact, we’re probably getting smaller due to environmental challenges” that put areas of the state off limits for new development. “This is it.” 
The 2025 findings – the second year of a comprehensive Bay State survey of religious land ownership through the partnership – were released as a cohort of state lawmakers and advocates push for legislation that would streamline housing development on religious properties. The so-called YIGBY bill, short for “Yes in God’s Back Yard” and a twist on the pro-housing slogan YIMBY or “Yes in My Back Yard,” would reduce local zoning barriers for parcels owned by religious communities that currently prevent or slow housing construction. 
Though the nearly 5,000 developable parcels are just a small proportion of land statewide, their strategic location and size make them uniquely valuable for development. About 63 percent sit near transit stops, 65 percent already have water and sewer access, and 54 percent are in areas with above-average walkability, according to the report. The average parcel spans four acres, large enough for substantial housing projects, and is assessed at just over $2 million. 
The land does not just consist of large parcels where churches and other faith congregations are based.  
“What we were struck by, when we started looking at the parcel data for faith-based institutions, is everyone immediately thinks about the places of worship,” said Reina Chano Murray, associate director at the Center for Geospatial Solutions. “But we found that there were a fair number of residential parcels that appeared to have been willed or gifted to congregations by their parishioners.” 
The inventory found 39 percent of developable religious parcels are owned by non-Catholic Christian denominations, 33 percent by Catholic institutions, 20 percent by non-denominational organizations, 5 percent by Jewish congregations, and 3 percent by other faiths. Almost 83 percent of it is zoned as residential property – all of it tax-exempt. 
A map of religiously owned developable parcels from The Lynch Foundation.
This land is spread across the state, but mostly centered around larger urban areas like Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. Proponents of unlocking it for housing point to YIGBY bills that have been passed in California, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington that cleared the way for several housing projects on religiously owned land that boasted unit counts near 50. 
The Massachusetts YIGBY legislation, proposed by state Sen. Brendan Crighton of Lynn and Rep. Carlos González of Springfield, would allow faith-based organizations to build multi-family housing by right on parcels they’ve owned for at least three years. Developments with 30 or more units per acre would be required to set aside 20 percent as affordable for households earning up to 80 percent of area median income.  
Projects exceeding 50 units per acre must designate 25 percent affordable, or 20 percent affordable for households at 60 percent AMI or below. 
Unlike most tax-exempt religious property, new developments would pay local property taxes unless municipalities decide to allow exemptions. If just half of the parcels were developed – given that not all would likely be subjected to local taxes – they would generate approximately $61 million in annual municipal revenue, according to the foundation’s estimates. 
Buildings within half a mile of transit could not face parking requirements. 
“We’re looking for every tool possible in our housing production toolbox,” Crighton said. Massachusetts has approved roughly 14,000 housing permits annually in recent years, far short of the 222,000 units needed by 2035, according to state estimates. 
According to the Lynch Foundation, which supports the YIGBY bill, depending on the level of density and amount of land developed, between 60,000 and 500,000 units of housing could be built.  
This is the first year that YIGBY legislation has been filed in Massachusetts, and there is no clear opposition organized at this point. But that may change if the bill gets more traction.  
Statewide zoning mandates often draw stiff resistance from communities, which insist on local control over land use. The bill carries some echoes of the MBTA Communities housing law, which requires zoning for new multi-family housing near transit stops and has faced strong opposition from some communities. 
As with the MBTA Communities law, there is a danger of overpromising and panicking municipalities that express alarm at overdevelopment. While half a million units is an astonishing amount of potential housing, experts generally caution that the highest estimates are often a dramatic overstatement of any housing policy’s impact. If roughly 10 percent of the religiously owned developable parcels were built out, the Lynch Foundation estimates more like 80,000 new units could come online – still potentially meaningful progress as the state slogs toward its 222,000 unit goal. 
Several churches already are eagerly working to find ways to convert their parcels into affordable housing as congregations shrink. The Archdiocese of Boston, through its Planning Office of Urban Affairs, has developed almost 3,000 units since 1975 from Boston to Brockton to Wrentham. The archdiocese did not make planning office officials available to discuss its land inventory or project identification process for this story, but told CBS Boston in August that nearly a dozen properties have been converted into affordable or mixed-use housing. 
“When we are having conversations with parishes, with pastors, it’s about how can we continue to preserve our legacy of service and help to continue to meet the needs of the community. An effective way to do that is to look at the property and to see how it can be repurposed for affordable mixed-income housing,” Bill Grogan, the president of the archdiocese planning office, told the station.

Kurt Lang, pastor at the East Coast International Church in Lynn, testified in support of the YIGBY bill during a hearing in July. 
“As an expression of our church’s desire to bring housing to the unhoused,” he said, the Lynn church owns 40 units, mostly affordable rentals as well as nine transitional housing units in which the residents don’t pay rent while they look for more permanent housing. There is no requirement that residents be part of the congregation, he said. 
Lang noted that even small congregations can tie up substantial developable space if developing the land for housing doesn’t seem feasible. “Many other religious groups would begin to create affordable and working-class housing if the opportunity and a path was created for them,” he said. 
In his testimony, Lang told lawmakers about a Protestant church inside Route 128 that he said has just 12 people attending but owns 45 acres of land. The church met with him and expressed interest in turning the land into housing. 
“They quickly retreated upon learning about the zoning challenges,” Lang said.  
A small religious college in Boston, looking to offload 25 acres of land to a real estate management company for conservation, told the Boston Globe last week that it had considered developing the forested area but chose conservation instead after considering the myriad “zoning, regulatory, and community hurdles that would take years to address and may have never been resolved.”  
Faith communities trying to build housing without YIGBY options have faced years of delays and expensive rezoning battles. Hartford Street Presbyterian Church in Natick has spent 40 years attempting to build housing and recently sheltered migrant families in its basement while seeking zoning relief.  
The Lynch Foundation says there have been redevelopment successes, pointing to the mixed-use Overlook at St. Gabriel’s in Brighton, which converted a former monastery campus into 555 apartments, including 83 affordable units.  
Even identifying religiously owned parcels ripe for development is not a simple matter.  
Assessors’ records varied wildly in quality for tax-exempt properties, according to Chano Murray at the Center for Geospatial Solutions. Some parcels listed deceased clergy as owners, their deaths never recorded. Others used inconsistent abbreviations like “Rom Catholic Arch” that required algorithms to identify. 
Religious organizations may not know their full portfolios. Ownership can be complicated by distinctions between diocese-owned versus congregation-owned property, or parcels held in clergy names for administrative purposes.  
Proponents of the YIGBY legislation include religiously centered advocacy groups like the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action (JALSA), housing groups like Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, real estate developers, chambers of commerce, and faith leaders across denominations. 
In written testimony, JALSA president Cindy Rowe grounded support in Jewish teachings: “On Yom Kippur, our most sacred holiday, we read in Isaiah, ‘take the poor into your homes,'” she said. She noted that Massachusetts has the third-highest median home price and highest median rent nationally, with prices increasing $300,000 on average from 2014 to 2024. 
“We must take every step that we can to make housing available to all,” she wrote. “Upholding human dignity, the fundamental Jewish value of Kavod HaBriyot, demands that we ensure housing for all.” 
Crighton still shakes his head over a local project that stalled out several years ago while he was on the Lynn city council.   
“This was a vacant plot of land, not being used, in an area that already had multi-family housing,” he said. “So it wouldn’t drastically alter the character of the neighborhood or anything.” But the religious group trying to build affordable housing on a parcel it owned couldn’t get the support they needed on the council, he said. 
“It got scrapped. And a decade later, I drive by this parcel,” he said. “It’s still just sitting there, and to think that families could have been living there for the past decade, you know, it was incredibly frustrating. That wouldn’t happen under the updated zoning. The legislation simply creates incentives to develop for housing rather than leave parcels vacant.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/churches2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

Fishman, an attorney at the Arnold & Porter law firm who is representing Kelly, wrote in a Monday letter to the secretary of the Navy that “there is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power.”“If the Executive Branch were to move forward in any forum—criminal, disciplinary, or administrative—we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” Fishman wrote. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had set Dec. 10 as the deadline for the secretary of the Navy to recommend what to do about Kelly’s appearance in the video, but that came and went without any public announcements.Hegseth also remained silent on the matter after rebuking Kelly weeks ago for posting the video where he and five other Democrats warned against illegal orders.Kelly said on Dec. 9, one day before the deadline, he hadn’t received any information from the Navy or other administration officials. “Forget about an update. I haven’t heard anything from the guy,” Kelly told reporters. “That’s a good question for you guys to ask the Navy.”The secretary of the Navy’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment from States Newsroom. The Department of Defense posted in late November that officials were looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly for appearing in the video. It didn’t detail how Kelly might have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice but stated that “a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” Hegseth referred the issue to Navy Secretary John Phelan for any “review, consideration, and disposition” he deemed appropriate. Hegseth then asked for a briefing on the outcome of the review “by no later than December 10.”Kelly said during a press conference in early December the military’s investigation and a separate one by the FBI were designed to intimidate the six lawmakers in the video from speaking out against President Donald Trump. The lawmakers in the video, who have backgrounds in the military or intelligence agencies, told members of those communities they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”The other Democrats in the video — Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander — are not subject to the military justice system. Trump railed against the video a couple days after it posted, saying the statements represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”",,,,2025-12-16 10:59:13.931732

MAURA HEALEY called on federal immigration officials Monday to stop using private aircraft at Hanscom Field airport to move people out of state “without due process of law.”
In a Dec. 12 letter to Secretary of Defense Kristi Noem and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons, Healey demanded the agency “immediately stop using any Massachusetts airports and private jets to deport residents and obstruct due process, and to halt this practice across this country.”
Asked how and when she became aware of the situation at Hanscom, Healey spokesperson Karissa Hand said that Healey “was alerted to it by advocates.”
ICE did not respond to a News Service inquiry about Healey’s claims, why the agency might be using Hanscom and when that use began. 
Located in Bedford, Hanscom Field is a regional aviation facility managed by the quasi-public Massachusetts Port Authority.
Asked about details of ICE-related flights out of Hanscom, MassPort Director of Media Relations Jennifer Mehigan said ” ‘ICE flights’ refer to charter flights operated by fixed based operators at Hanscom. Massport does not receive prior knowledge of these flights, nor does the Authority have a role in their operation.”
“The flight information we receive does not indicate which flights are operated by or are associated with ICE. We would refer you to the federal government for specific data on those flights,” Mehigan added.
Healey in her Friday letter said ICE’s use of private aircrafts at Hanscom “to quickly remove residents and sever them from their family, friends, and counsel without due process of law” is part of ICE’s “disturbing and anti-American deportation tactics.”
The US Department of Homeland Security recently announced that its enforcement operations have led to more than 605,000 deportations since Jan. 20, 2025.
“DHS has prioritized removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens as part of the Trump Administration’s efforts to return law and order to the United States,” a Dec. 10 release said. 
Another 1.9 million people have “voluntarily self-deported” since January, according to DHS. 
“As you well know, a significant majority of people detained by ICE in Massachusetts over the past year have no criminal convictions or charges,” Healey wrote. “They are hard-working, productive, and beloved members of our community that you have indiscriminately targeted for deportation proceedings. Many of them are in the midst of a lawful process seeking citizenship through Massachusetts courts.”
During ICE’s recent weeks-long enforcement operation in September, the agency reported apprehending more than 1,400 people. DHS said that more than 600 people arrested “had significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives.”
Healey in her Monday statement referred to reporting from “The New York Times,” which shows that 63 percent of immigrants arrested by ICE in major operations in Massachusetts between Sept. 4 and Sept. 30 had no criminal charges against them. 
“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey wrote. 
Immigrant advocates have been calling on state lawmakers to protect immigrants who might be targeted by federal immigration officials. They’ve rallied at or near the State House, and some recently testified in favor of bills they say would make a dent in the issue locally. 
After Healey’s office released her letter, the Massachusetts Democratic Party late Monday called on three Republican candidates for governor to “denounce ICE’s Use of Hanscom airport for deportations.”
“The silence by Brian Shortsleeve, Mike Kennealy and Mike Minogue on all ICE matters speaks volumes,” party chair Steve Kerrigan said in a statement. 
The Massachusetts Communities Action Network on Tuesday plans to gather faith groups to hold a press conference and multifaith prayer vigil at 10 a.m. at the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum Area to “take action for immigrant justice” and “protect the people and sovereignty of Massachusetts.”
Clergy and lay leaders will be “calling on the governor to use her executive authority to protect the rights, safety, and dignity of Massachusetts residents — especially immigrants — in the face of harmful federal actions,” according to the Essex County Community Organization, a multi-faith network based in Lynn.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bedford-Hanscom_Air_Traffic_Control_Tower-e1765895738899.jpg?fit=499%2C375&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

The Federal Bureau of Investigations’ office in Anchorage issued an alert warning Alaskans of scams impersonating law enforcement or government officials demanding payment. Alaskans lost an estimated $1.3 million due to this type of government impersonation scam in 2024 — more than five times the previous year’s losses.
Officials say Alaskans should not respond to calls claiming they have missed jury duty or have warrants out for their arrest. Officials say anyone targeted by such calls should not provide personal information or payment to the caller, but they should report scams to the agency.
“This scam isn’t new, but we are certainly seeing an uptick in this type of scam here in Alaska,” said Chloe Martin, a public affairs officer with the FBI Anchorage office.
In 2024, the bureau reported 6,670 fraud complaints from Alaskans, with over $26.2 million in losses. 
Scammers are calling residents and identifying themselves as an FBI official, a member of state or local law enforcement, or a government official. The scammer then claims the victim has missed jury duty or that a warrant has been issued for their arrest and demands payment from the victim, Martin said. 
Sometimes scammers will call using personalized information to appear official. “So when they look at their caller ID, it might actually look like it’s a caller from a legitimate law enforcement agency,” she said.
Martin said scammers use urgency, intimidation and fear to demand immediate payment in the form of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, prepaid gift cards or wire transfers.
Martin urged Alaskans to pause, not give personal information or make payments and report the fraud to their bank and to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, a reporting hub for cyber-crime. 
“If reported immediately, it’s actually not outside the realm of possibility to recover funds, so timely reporting is key,” she said. She added that victims should contact their bank to freeze funds if they have responded to a scam. 
Last year, the FBI recorded a more than five fold increase in losses from these scams, from nearly $250,000 lost in 2023 to more than $1.3 million in 2024.  


Austin McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Public Safety said it is common for scammers to impersonate Alaska State Troopers. 
“These scammers will go through and find the name of an Alaska law enforcement officer at that agency and call, pretending to be an actual state trooper, so that they’re sophisticated,” he said.
“This happens across the state. This targets every age demographic, and it’s something that we see a lot of,” he said. “I have personally received these types of scam calls demanding that I pay some type of exorbitant fee because I missed jury service. And thankfully, I know that’s definitely a scam, but not everyone does.”
McDaniel said it’s difficult to track, investigate and prosecute scammers because some of them are calling internationally, and are difficult to trace. He urged Alaskans to be cautious and not to make payments. 
“Law enforcement, the government, a utility, a bank, is never going to call you and demand money with a gift card or with Bitcoin,” he said. “If you get some type of suspicion that something’s wrong, it probably is.” 
Earlier this month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued an alert warning Alaskans of scammers posing as government officials, insurance agents or aid workers targeting residents impacted by Typhoon Halong receiving disaster assistance. 
Officials urged residents to contact FEMA to verify if a call is legitimate. 
McDaniel and Martin said their departments could not confirm cases of scammers specifically targeting residents impacted by the Western Alaska storm at this time, but McDaniel emphasized his department sees scammers victimize those who may already be more vulnerable. 
“We see it happen with missing persons,” McDaniel said. “Someone will call and try to defraud family members of missing people. Usually any type of situation where there’s some type of tragedy or emotional response to something, scammers will attempt to go through and exploit that.”
According to FBI data, Alaska ranked No. 1 in the nation in the number of internet crime complaints reported, at a rate of 914.7 complaints per 100,000 residents. Scammers target older residents because they can be more susceptible to scams The bureau estimates Alaskans in the age group of 60 or older lost more than $8.1 million to scams in 2024. 
Cryptocurrency scams are growing nationwide, as they are difficult to trace. In 2024, the FBI estimates 45% of Alaskans’ losses, approximately $11.7 million, were related to cryptocurrency related scams.
Such scams  have become a means to cheat investors, also known as “pig butchering,” according to the bureau. Scammers target victims, develop a relationship, and introduce a fraudulent investment opportunity in cryptocurrency.  Victims are coached to invest more and more money into the fraudulent investment, only to then be unable to withdraw their funds. 
Internet-based scams and fraud can range from emergency calls and extortion to identity theft and phishing or spoofing, where scammers identify as a trusted source and aim to gain login details or personal information to steal money or data. The FBI reports that complaints increased nationally by 33% in 2024, with $16.6 billion in losses.

Dec. 16, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.In a keynote speech at the Michigan Literacy Summit, held Tuesday at the Michigan Science Center, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that improving literacy rates would remain her top priority in her final year as governor. 
“Helping every child read is tough. It’s a worthwhile goal,” she said. “It’s a long term project that will pay off in decades, not days. It’s a team effort that requires buy-in from students, parents, teachers and policy makers.”
She referenced the increased implementation of the “science of reading” law, which she signed in October 2024, as part of this priority. That law standardized literacy teaching methods across the state and implemented regular dyslexia testing for students up to third grade. She also touted the free school breakfast and lunch program, a key piece of the state’s education budget, and funding to reduce class sizes. 
Michigan currently ranks 44th in the nation for 4th grade reading skills, Whitmer said, calling it a “crisis.”
“The vast majority of people in our state agree this isn’t the fault of any one person or any one policy or any one political party,” she continued. “I know how hard every one of our educators works every day, but we’re all feeling the impact of our literacy crisis.”

State Superintendent Dr. Glenn Maleyko, who officially took over the role leading the state’s department of education on Dec. 8, introduced Whitmer to a crowd of educators and advocates, who had gathered in Detroit for the day-long event that included panels with teachers and school leadership. 
“What stood out to me the most was the governor’s genuine commitment to partnership,” Maleyko said. “She understands that improving outcomes for students is not about politics, it’s about listening, working together and staying focused on what matters most.”
This was Whitmer’s first public appearance since Michigan House Republicans canceled nearly $650 million in spending for departmental projects, a move heavily criticized by Democrats as “untransparent” and “cruel”. While Whitmer’s press secretary shared similar criticism from the governor’s office, Whitmer herself has yet to make a statement on the cuts, and left the summit before speaking to the press.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-16-091445-1024x677.png,,,2025-12-16 10:01:25.689917

(Washoe County School District photo)All but three public school districts across the state saw student enrollment drop this year, according to the data compiled by the Nevada Department of Education.
Statewide enrollment in K-12 public school districts dipped by around 2% for the 2025-26 academic year.
Charter School Authority absorbs 6 CCSD-run charter schools

The notable exception was the Nevada State Public Charter School Authority, which earlier this year absorbed six charter schools previously overseen by the Clark County School District. The transfer of those schools, combined with seats created by new and expanding charter schools, contributed to a 10.9% jump in enrollment for the 2025-26 academic year.
The Charter School Authority’s growth rate excluding the transferred CCSD schools was 2.3%, which is more aligned with the authority’s growth rate in recent years, according to authority staff.
More than 70,500 students statewide are now enrolled at state-authorized charter schools.
Clark County SD saw enrollment drop by 4.7% — from approximately 306,000 students to 291,500, a loss of more than 14,000 students. That number includes the roughly 5,400 students at the six schools the district transferred to the Charter School Authority.
﻿
Washoe County School District saw its enrollment dip by just under 1%, or 6,800 students.
Clark County SD, Washoe County SD and the Charter School Authority enroll approximately 90% of public school students in the state.
Enrollment data among the state’s rural districts showed most lost students.
Churchill, Mineral and Douglas County School Districts had drops around 4%.
Eureka, Elko, Pershing, White Pine and Humboldt County School Districts, as well as Carson City School District, saw enrollment drops in the range of 2% to 3%.
Esmeralda County School District, the state’s smallest school district, dropped from 75 kids to 69.
Meanwhile, Storey County School District, which only has around 400 students total, logged a growth rate of 4% by adding 16 kids. Enrollment in Nye County stayed relatively flat by enrolling seven more students this year than last.
Families opting for charter schools has contributed to declining enrollment rates in the traditional school districts, particularly in Clark and Washoe counties where charter school growth has been concentrated. But other factors, including the nation’s overall declining birth rate and growing interest in homeschooling are also believed to be impacting enrollment rates.

Clark County SD is still by far the largest district in the state, enrolling 62% of public school students. But the Charter School Authority is now the second largest local education agency in Nevada, surpassing Washoe County SD by nearly 7,000 students. The Charter School Authority now enrolls 15%, and Washoe County SD enrolls 13%.
Charter school growth has been outpacing Washoe County SD for a decade now.
This year’s data shows the Charter School Authority closing some gaps when it comes to having enrollment reflect the state’s population as a whole. For example, Black students now make up 12.7% of charter students, compared to 12.4% of students statewide.
Charter school students remain less likely to be classified as English learners (ELL), have an individualized education plan (IEP) or qualify for free or reduced lunch (FRL):

13.9% of students statewide are ELL, compared to 10% of charter school students;
14.7% of students statewide have IEPs, compared to 11% of charter school students; and
36.4% of students statewide are directly certified for FRL, compare to 30.4% of charter school students.

The Nevada DOE requires schools to conduct their official enrollment counts around Oct. 1 of each year. The numbers are used for funding purposes and mandatory reporting. They also provide a snapshot of student enrollment in public schools over time.
The state compiles private school enrollment separately, though the physical count is held around the same date each year. The private school enrollment report has not yet been released by the state. But, as of October, more than 22,000 students were enrolled in private schools in Nevada and officials believed the population was leveling off after a covid pandemic boost.

From CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang:
Gov. Gavin Newsom has tapped two prominent former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials with jumpstarting a new public health initiative — though details of what precisely the initiative will accomplish in the coming months are sparse.
Former CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and former chief medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, both of whom have publicly sparred with Trump administration policies, will advise the newly minted Public Health Network Innovation Exchange.
Monarez was fired in August after reportedly refusing to rubberstamp recommendations made by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s handpicked vaccine committee, which includes prominent vaccine skeptics. Houry resigned partially in protest. 
“It’s not a shadow CDC we’re creating, but it’s a shield to what’s going on,” Newsom said.
So, what will the Public Health Network Innovation Exchange, or PHNIX, do?

In a press conference, Newsom said the purpose is to rebuild public confidence in public health institutions and improve the technology that public health uses to track diseases and monitor trends.
Monarez will oversee innovation and technology for the new program. The state could partner with the private sector and academia to create real-time data sharing systems for health departments or to leverage AI, she said.
Houry will help the state develop partnerships with other public health organizations, building on California’s existing West Coast Health Alliance, which makes vaccine recommendations, and the Governors Public Health Alliance.
The group will also search for funding, both public and private, to bolster public health.

To begin, California lawmakers allocated $4 million to the initiative in this year’s budget. 
It’s not yet clear: 

How the $4 million will be spent and what portion will go toward paying Monarez and Houry;
Whether any other states or public health organizations have formally agreed to partner with California;
When the PHNIX is expected to accomplish its aims by; 
What kind of additional funding it expects to need to do those things.

“This is about upholding science, integrity and trust,” State Public Health Officer Dr. Erica Pan said.

Job fears fuel community college enrollment

Early data from California community colleges are showing an upward tick in enrollment. College leaders are attributing the trend mostly to fears about the economy and unemployment, reports CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
With rising unemployment rates, a weak job market and the cost of living and consumer goods getting more expensive, more students, particularly returning adults, want to improve their skillsets.

Enrollment at Los Rios Community College District is up by more than 5% compared to last fall. 
Enrollment for students ages 35 to 54 at Los Angeles Community College District is up 28% compared to last year. 
The President of Chula Vista’s Southwestern College said the district had over 32,000 students in the last academic year — its highest enrollment rate since the Great Recession.

But as these colleges serve an influx of new students, many say the state isn’t providing them with enough funds. Mario Rodriguez, an executive vice chancellor for Los Rios, said the Sacramento-area district is serving about 5,000 more students than the system is funded to support, representing about $20 million in lost revenue.

What leads to dry fire hydrants


Firefighters work to put out a fire that burned down near Malibu as a result of the Palisades Fire on Jan. 9, 2025. Photo by Ted Soqui for CalMatters




After wildfires ignited in Southern California in January, reports of a water shortage and dry fire hydrants prompted state and federal investigations. On Monday, a team of researchers at UCLA and Arizona State University published an issue brief that found that when fires burn urban areas, hydrant flows can sputter out and result in poor hydrant performance, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
When a wildfire rages in a town, each burned home hemorrhages water from the water system, and too many hoses simultaneously feed on a limited supply — leading to a loss of pressure. In fire after fire, researchers found reports of lost water pressure, echoing the conclusions of a recent state investigation of the Palisades Fire.

Kevin Phillips, district manager of Paradise Irrigation District: “Every one of those homes that gets burnt is an open sore to the outside. Your system basically is dying as every one of those homes are being destroyed.” 

This year, California passed a law requiring water systems in California’s fire-prone regions to have enough backup power or alternate water supplies to keep water pumps running. Some water suppliers, however, argue that it costs too much to comply with the law.

Is it worth it?","Guest Commentary written by

Shaye Wolf
Shaye Wolf is the climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity.


California’s most expensive electricity source is finally poised to lose a government handout that props up its high costs and harmful pollution. In an era of clean, cheap solar and wind energy, policymakers are rightly beginning to treat biomass energy like the boondoggle it is. 
Biomass energy — electricity made by burning or gasifying trees — is an expensive, dirty relic that relies on industry misinformation and taxpayer money. 
In a vote later this month, the California Public Utilities Commission is expected to end the BioMAT subsidy program, which requires electric utilities to buy biomass power at exorbitant costs — four times the average. Californians get hit with those extra costs in our power bills, along with pollution that harms our health and climate. 
Utilities and environmental groups support ending this costly subsidy. 
But the biomass industry is fighting back with misleading claims that its projects are made clean by “new” technology or that they’re needed for wildfire safety. Don’t be fooled.
Burning trees to make electricity harms the climate. In fact, biomass power is more climate-polluting at the smokestack than coal. 
Biomass energy releases toxic air pollutants that endanger health, increasing the risk of premature death and illnesses like asthma. The facilities often are located in low-income communities and communities of color that have long fought to shut them down.  
It is telling that the biomass industry is rebranding. 
It claims it will use “clean” methods to gasify trees instead of burning them. But gasification — which also involves heating organic material — releases large amounts of climate-harming air pollution. 
State regulators in May denied a costly biomass gasification project that couldn’t show it would reduce emissions as promised.  
The industry also promotes carbon capture and storage, claiming this technology will suck up carbon dioxide from biomass smokestacks and store it underground forever. But carbon capture and storage is a costly, decades-old technology with a long history of failure and serious health and safety risks.
Finally, the industry claims biomass energy projects will help pay for forest thinning, which it says will protect communities during wildfires. That means cutting trees, often large trees, which threatens wildlife and destroys forests, which naturally store carbon and fight climate change.
Thinning isn’t a good way to keep communities safe. Most of the community destruction is caused by wind-driven fires during extreme fire weather, made worse by climate change. The fastest-moving 3% of wind-driven fires is responsible for 88% of the damage to homes. 
No amount of forest thinning can stop that. In fact, thinning makes cool, moist forests hotter, drier and more wind-prone, which can make fires burn faster and more intensely.
Most of California’s destructive wildfires — like the Los Angeles area fires in January — have burned in shrublands and grasslands, not forests, making thinning irrelevant in those cases.
A better way to prevent fires
Instead, the best investment for protecting communities during wildfires is hardening homes, so they’re less likely to catch fire, and stopping new development in fire-prone areas. Yet the state has earmarked only 1% of its wildfire funding for home hardening. Most goes to thinning. 
Where thinning occurs, it’s most cost-effective to scatter the wood in the forest to create wildlife habitat, retain vital nutrients, and enhance natural carbon storage. If wood must be removed, it can be turned into mulch and shavings. The worst choice is subsidizing biomass companies to make dirty energy.
Any way you look at it, biomass energy is a polluting money pit that won’t solve our climate or wildfire safety problems.
California already has the affordable solutions we need: Clean, cheap solar and wind energy and energy storage to power our state, and home hardening to protect communities from wildfire while growing local economies.  California’s leaders need to embrace these proven solutions and get us out of the expensive, dangerous biomass business.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/092022_Power-Lines_RL_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608

Tommy Tuberville addresses media questions in a press gaggle following his speech at the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. Tuberville has accelerated attacks on Muslim Americans in recent days, calling for their forced deportation on Sunday and making claims about Somali-Americans without evidence. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville accelerated attacks on Muslim Americans over the weekend, calling for the forced deportation of those of the Islamic faith.
The Alabama Republican’s remarks followed attacks on a school for Muslim children and Somali immigrants in Minnesota, accompanied by the filing of two bills targeting Muslims. The moves drew condemnation and led to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a civil rights group that advocates on behalf of people of the Islamic faith, placing him on a list of anti-Muslim extremists.
“Unfortunately, Sen. Tuberville has really gone full blast with his attacks on Muslims,” said Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director for CAIR, in an interview on Monday regarding the list. “Whether that is introducing two bills in Congress to essentially ban our faith in the United States or saying that we are not even a religion. So, that level of assault on an American faith deserves getting designated as what it is, and that is an Islamophobe.”

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Tuberville said he considers it “a badge of honor” to be labeled as an extremist by the organization.
Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor for a likely run against Tuberville for the office next year, condemned the senator’s remarks in an interview on Monday.
“It is really a sad state of affairs when you have a U.S. senator who is so bigoted with religious bigotry as Sen. Tuberville is,” he said. “We need to be a state for all people, and a welcoming state, and make sure everyone in the state is treated with the same dignity and respect.”
Tuberville introduced the “No Sharia Act” in October that prohibits courts from enforcing the foreign law in the country. It also renders any contract null and void and prohibits family law from enforcing foreign law in family law.
Sharia law consists of Islamic principles that are derived from the Quran, traditions of Islam’s prophet Mohammad, and the statements of Islamic scholars throughout history. There are varying interpretations and applications of sharia in majority-Muslim countries.
Tuberville also filed a companion bill, “Preserving a Sharia Free America Act,” that authorizes the secretary of state and other agencies to deny immigration benefits to people who advocate for Sharia Law or have them deported. It also allows federal agencies to withhold immigration benefits and have people deported if they fail to disclose to federal agency officials that support sharia law.
Tuberville in June said Muslim immigrants would “overwhelm us” and that we have to fight back.”
In recent days, Tuberville accelerated his assaults. On Sunday, Tuberville’s Facebook account posted a statement that said Islam is “not a religion. It’s a cult.” and claimed that “Islamists aren’t here to assimilate. They’re here to conquer.”
“Stop worrying about offending the pearl clutchers,” the statement said. “We’ve got to SEND THEM HOME NOW or we’ll become the United Caliphate of America.”
The actions of the Council on American-Islamic Relations came on the heels of another post from on X, formerly Twitter, that mass migration of “Islamic extremists destroyed Europe” that reinforced a 15-minute speech he gave on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Thursday when he said that the country will soon be known as the “Caliphate of America.”
“They turned a blind eye like we are at the moment and are going to have to fight in the streets to get their countries back,” Tuberville said of Europe about Muslim immigrants. “It’s coming. And that is exactly what’s going to happen in this country in a few short years if we don’t act now to save our country and our way of life.”
Tuberville made multiple remarks disparaging immigrants, making claims that immigrants from Somalia living in Minnesota are stealing from taxpayers and sending the money to terrorists in that country. Tuberville provided no evidence for his comments. Most people of Somali descent are citizens, and Republicans including President Donald Trump have made wildly inaccurate claims about the Somali-American community in Minnesota.
He also referred to the Islamic Academy of Alabama, which withdrew a proposal relocate to Hoover amid criticism and threats.
“I was asked about it,” Tuberville said during his comments on Thursday. “And I said the only place this Islamic academy should be moving is out of Alabama and out of our country.”
A spokesperson for the school declined to comment on Tuberville’s statement, referring instead to a news release published after the Hoover planning and zoning committee denied the school’s proposal to move its site from Homewood.
“Not one word of these allegations reflects the teachings, values, curriculum or culture of our school,” Stacy Abdein, the school’s assistant principal said in the news release. “They are irresponsible fabrications that fuel fear, prejudice and division.”
Jones defended the school on Monday.
“These are not indoctrination academies,” he said. “These are schools that teach children how to read, how to write, to do math, to do all the things, but they also teach them their religion.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251016_090716-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608

One assumes that its faculty and administrative cadre are saturated with extremely bright people. Nevertheless, UC has succumbed to a managerial disease that has afflicted other corners of state government — the chronic inability to successfully adopt information technology.
The state has spent billions of dollars on high-tech projects meant to make state agencies more efficient and responsive. But those efforts have either failed completely, worked only partially or couldn’t meet implementation deadlines.
The syndrome has afflicted many agencies. The most obvious example is the Financial Information System for California, with the catchy abbreviation of FI$Cal. 
It was supposed to be a one-stop financial management tool. But since FI$Cal launched in 2005, it has consumed more than a billion dollars and is not likely to be completed until sometime in the next decade. 
It’s a bureaucratic zombie, not quite alive but not quite dead.
‘Glitches and bad data’
UC’s attempt to upgrade its pension system echoes that experience. As described in an article by Politico, a website devoted to politics:
“In April 2019, the University of California unveiled a new computer program that school officials promised would overhaul its clunky, outdated system for disbursing pension payments to more than 150,000 former employees.
“Glitches and bad data, however, marred the launch, delaying payments and causing other problems. Now, six years later, the university is still embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the contractors it hired to build the system, claiming the companies repeatedly misled and defrauded the university.”
The companies said the allegations — and the university’s demand for tens of millions of dollars in damages — are baseless. One company called the protracted legal battle a “vindictive crusade.”
UC manages its own pension system, with more than $100 billion in assets, delivering benefits to 151,000 former employees, ranging from retired university chancellors to former janitors.
Twelve years ago, UC officials awarded contracts to two companies, Sagitec Solutions and Linea Solutions, worth $28 million to upgrade the pension system’s outdated computer system. 
When the upgrade was tested a half-decade later, chaos erupted. Pension payments weren’t delivered on time, pension calculations were riddled with errors, UC retirees pelted the system’s administration with complaints, and the contractors and UC executives began pointing fingers of blame at each other.
UC accused the vendors of shoddy work. The vendors complained that UC officials muddied the waters with requests for multiple changes as the system was being installed. The conflict is still in the courts.
Troubled tech
UC’s failed tech project follows the pattern of other troubled efforts to use information technology over the last couple of decades.
I once asked an acquaintance who sold computer software to state agencies why so many systems failed. He said bureaucrats often don’t know what they want and are rarely conversant about tech capability, leading to misunderstandings about what will be done.
When the list of troubled projects began to stack up, the Legislature and the governor created the California Department of Technology to oversee tech adoption. However, two years ago State Auditor Grant Parks issued a sharply worded report on its shortcomings.
“CDT has broad responsibility and authority over nearly all aspects of IT (information technology) in the state, including providing strategic direction, assessing IT security, and performing project oversight,” Parks told the Legislature. “However, it has not fulfilled important responsibilities in these areas, resulting in significant consequences for the state.”

The friend’s Guatemalan tenant, who didn’t know she was pregnant, had just delivered a premature baby in the New Orleans house. The parents lacked legal residency, and the mother refused to go to a hospital for fear of being detained by federal immigration officers.
“There’s blood everywhere, and the baby’s dead,” Rosales-Fajardo recalled her friend saying. Rosales-Fajardo put on her sandals, grabbed surgical gloves, and rushed to the house.
Rosales-Fajardo, herself an immigrant from Brazil, is a grassroots organizer and advocate in the New Orleans East community, where many immigrants live. She has no formal medical training, but she has experience with delivering babies.
She scanned the room when she arrived. A 3-year-old child stood to one side while the mother sat on the edge of the bed. The father held their swaddled newborn son, who wasn’t breathing and was wrapped in blood-soaked towels.
“The baby was completely gray,” Rosales-Fajardo later said.
Rosales-Fajardo wiped fluid away from his small mouth and rubbed his back before performing tiny chest compressions and breathing air into his lungs.
She told the parents she had to call 911 to get the mother and newborn to a hospital for care. The baby was out, but the delivery wasn’t over.
“I assured her. I promised her that she was going to be safe,” Rosales-Fajardo said.
Fear hung over the room. Still, she made the call and continued performing CPR. Finally, the newborn revived and squirmed in Rosales-Fajardo’s arms. When the ambulance arrived, the mother tried to keep her husband from riding with her, terrified they would both be arrested.
He went, anyway.
“These are hard-working people,” Rosales-Fajardo said. “All they do is work to provide for their family. But they were almost at risk of losing their child rather than call 911.”
Putting Safety Over Health
Nearly two weeks into the Department of Homeland Security’s Operation Catahoula Crunch, which launched Dec. 3, health professionals and community advocates in Louisiana and Mississippi report that a significantly higher-than-usual number of immigrant patients have skipped health care appointments and experienced heightened stress levels.
According to a press release, DHS said it had arrested more than 250 people as of Dec. 11. Though federal officials say they’re targeting criminals, The Associated Press reported that most of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the New Orleans operation had no criminal record.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, immigrant families nationwide have become more likely to skip or delay health care, due in part to concerns about their legal status, according to a recent survey by KFF and The New York Times.

The survey found that nearly 8 in 10 immigrants likely to be living in the U.S. without legal permission say they’ve experienced negative health impacts this year, from increased anxiety to sleeping problems to worsened health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. The federal immigration raids in California, Illinois, North Carolina, and now Louisiana and Mississippi add to the health care barriers that these families already face, including access to services, language barriers, lack of insurance, and high costs. That hesitancy to receive even emergency care appears justified amid the ongoing raids.
Hospitals and health facilities generally must allow federal agents in areas where the public is allowed, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In California this year, federal agents have staked out hospital lobbies, shown up at community clinics, and guarded detainees in hospital rooms. Even driving to and from appointments poses a risk, as traffic stops are a popular place for immigration agents to make arrests.
University Medical Center nurse Terry Mogilles said that immigrants typically make up at least half the patients in her orthopedic trauma clinic in New Orleans, many of them with construction-related, bone crushing injuries that require surgery. But now, Mogilles said, many of those patients aren’t coming in for follow-up appointments, despite the risk of infection.
“When we call, we can’t get through,” Mogilles said. “It is so upsetting because we have no idea what’s happening to them post-op.”
A Chill Spreads in the South
Federal officials said the Catahoula Crunch operation extends to southern Mississippi, though the bulk of the initial arrests have occurred in the Greater New Orleans area. Immigrant families throughout Mississippi are hunkering down in anticipation.
Michael Oropeza, the executive director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities in Biloxi and Forest, said the organization has witnessed families delay care, cancel children’s checkups, and go without refilling medication.
“It’s not because they don’t value their health; it’s because they don’t feel safe,” Oropeza said. “When hospitals and clinics are no longer that safe place, people withdraw trust that took years to build up. It can disappear overnight.”
Maria, a Biloxi resident from Honduras, said, in Spanish, she and her two children have missed routine doctors’ appointments because they are “terrified” to leave the house amid an increased presence of federal immigration officers. Her husband, who is authorized to work in the U.S., was detained for two months this year.
Her children are U.S. citizens. They previously qualified for Medicaid, but Maria opted to disenroll them three years ago out of concern that using public benefits would jeopardize her family’s residency applications, she said. The family now pays for their children’s care out-of-pocket.
When it feels safe to attend doctors’ appointments again, Maria said, her priority will be seeking mental health care to address the stress her family has endured.
“I definitely need to see a doctor to get checked out, because I don’t feel well,” she said, describing her anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
In Louisiana, Marcela Hernandez of Familias Unidas en Acción, a nonprofit that provides direct aid to immigrants, said many of the families she works with live paycheck to paycheck. Sheltering at home and missing work only adds to the stress. Hernandez said she received 800 calls for food in two days from families afraid to leave home.
The federal operation in Louisiana and Mississippi could last more than two months, according to the AP. The longer it goes on, Hernandez said, the more she worries evictions will come next as people can’t pay rent, further traumatizing a community whose members often had to make difficult and dangerous journeys to flee hardships in their countries of origin to reach the U.S.
“You don’t leave your country knowing that you’re gonna get raped on the way just simply because you wanna come and meet Mickey Mouse,” she said.

Rosales-Fajardo, who runs a nonprofit called El Pueblo NOLA, said families tell her how children have started urinating on themselves due to stress and fear. Nationally, immigrants who are likely to lack legal status report that some of their children have had problems sleeping and that they’ve seen changes in school performance or behavior, according to the KFF and New York Times survey.
Community groups said they hope people step up locally to deliver food and hygiene products to immigrant homes, and that health care professionals provide more at-home or telehealth visits.
Like at other hospitals, UMC’s waiting rooms are considered public spaces, Mogilles noted. But the nurses union is calling for the hospital to create safe spaces for patients that federal agents can’t access and clearer policies to protect health care workers who shield patients. Post-op appointments can’t be done virtually, so patients need to feel safe enough to come in, Mogilles said.
Prenatal and postnatal care is also challenging to provide virtually, leaving the health of new and expecting mothers vulnerable, said Latona Giwa, the executive director of Repro TLC, a national sexual and reproductive health training nonprofit.
Since the Chicago immigration sweeps began in September, Giwa said, the clinics and health providers her organization works with have reported that 30% of patients had missed appointments. She said pharmacies saw a 40% drop in medication pickups.
“What we know about management of chronic conditions, especially in pregnancy, but in general, is that even missing one appointment can impact the trajectory of that condition and worsen a patient’s outcomes,” Giwa said.
In Louisiana, which already has poor maternal health outcomes, the fear of arrest could exacerbate the crisis worsened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade and threaten lives. She’s especially concerned about families with preterm babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.
“Imagine your child is in the hospital, and so vulnerable, and you are terrified to go visit and care for your newborn infant because you’re worried about being deported,” Giwa said, noting that a newborn’s health partly relies on parental visits.

(Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)
That’s the position the Guatemalan family in New Orleans is navigating.
On a recent day in December, Rosales-Fajardo acted as the family’s translator and advocate on their first visit to see their son in the NICU at a hospital on Lake Pontchartrain’s Northshore. Hospital staffers told the parents they would need to make the long and risky trip to the hospital repeatedly for at least a month to provide skin-to-skin contact and breast milk.
Rosales-Fajardo drove the parents, who were afraid to travel alone out of fear of being pulled over and arrested on a bridge. She said she’ll keep driving them as long as she needs to.
“Whenever they see a Hispanic driving or anything like that, that’s suspicious to them,” she said of federal agents.
But the baby is safe and healthy. And the parents have named Rosales-Fajardo his godmother.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)About 130,000 Alabamians could lose health care coverage or pay significantly higher premiums at the start of 2026 after Congress failed to pass an extension on tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans last week.
Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel for the Southern Policy Law Center (SPLC), said in an interview Monday that about 446,000 Alabamians, nearly all of the state’s ACA enrollees, qualify for an enhanced premium tax credit. The tax credits do not have an income cap, but Lau said that enrollees that fall on the lower end benefit the most from the tax credits.
“It’s meant to benefit anyone who is able to get their coverage on the marketplace, but primarily it helps folks with the lowest incomes,” Lau said.
The vote on a one-year extension was a condition for Senate Democrats to reopen the federal government in November. 
“There’s been a lot of back and forth about how there is supposed to be a health care vote that would actually fix health care, that would actually be able to protect folks from losing coverage,” Lau said. “The reality is the only viable solution that would help people now, with the expiring ACA tax credits bookend of the year, is to extend the ACA subsidies.”
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., cited the cost of the extension for her vote to not extend the tax credits. 
“Their plan props up a broken, unaffordable system that’s wrought with fraud and failing the Alabamians who truly need it, all while extending COVID-era subsidies with no income caps,” Britt said in a statement.
According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the one-year extension would cost $23.4 billion, with the financial benefits primarily reaching individuals with incomes under $200,000.
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Tuscaloosa, condemned the vote in a post to social media.
“Many will find themselves one diagnosis away from bankruptcy,” she wrote. “Once again, Trump and Republicans have proven themselves utterly incapable of addressing our nation’s affordability crisis.”
Lau said that ACA enrollees will not be automatically dropped from their plans, but many will opt out because of the cost of monthly premiums. She said that a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 per year in Alabama would see their premium increase from $0 per month to $1,876 per month.
“That’s a huge jump, and it makes it completely unaffordable for people to continue to have health care,” Lau said. “People will have to make a decision on whether to keep going with their plan, or to go without.”
She said many may drop their ACA plans because health insurance is not an immediate need.
“People have to make different decisions. A lot of people I feel like oftentimes will forgo healthcare because it’s not an immediate need, whereas, rent and food are definitely immediate needs,” Lau said.
While managing the cost of ACA plans is up to the federal government, Lau said that states that have not expanded Medicaid are disproportionately impacted by the lack of tax credits. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, about 107,000 Alabamians are enrolled in ACA marketplace plans that would qualify for Medicaid in a state where it is expanded.
“Alabama has not extended Medicaid, which would help the population that is right above the poverty line,” Lau said.
SPLC, Alabama Arise and Democratic politicians and candidates have advocated for Medicaid expansion for years. 
There is still time for Congress to address the rising cost of health care. A House GOP bill introduced last week would appropriate funding for cost sharing reduction payments that would reduce health insurance premiums and stabilize the individual market starting in 2027. 
“It’s not going to be something that can be implemented immediately, as well as, any of the changes to cost sharing, all that stuff requires time and process,” Lau said.
She said a “clean extension” of the ACA tax credits is the only option to keep people from losing their health coverage.
“There’s still an opportunity to try to fix this,” she said. “That’s really the most viable solution we can get right now to try to prevent folks from losing coverage.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0450-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-16 08:56:24.760608

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)We’ve been here before: congressional Democrats and Republicans sparring over the future of the Affordable Care Act.
But this time there’s an extra complication. Though it’s the middle of open enrollment, lawmakers are still debating whether to extend the subsidies that have given consumers extra help paying their health insurance premiums in recent years.
The circumstances have led to deep consumer concerns about higher costs and fears of political fallout among some Republican lawmakers.
According to a KFF poll released in December, about half of current enrollees who are registered to vote said that if their overall health care expenses — copays, deductibles, and premiums — increased by $1,000 next year, it would have a “major impact” on whether they vote in next year’s midterm elections or which party’s candidate they support.
For those caught in the middle — including consumers and leaders of the 20 states, along with the District of Columbia, that run their own ACA marketplaces — the lack of action on Capitol Hill has led to uncertainty about what to do.
“Before I sign up, I will wait and see what happens,” said poll participant Daniela Perez, a 34-year-old education consultant in Chicago who says her current plan will increase to $1,200 a month from about $180 this year without an extension of the tax credits. “I’m not super hopeful. Seems like everything is in gridlock.”
In Washington, as part of the deal to end the recent government shutdown, a Senate vote was held Dec. 11 on a proposal to extend the subsidies. Another option, which was advanced by Republicans and included funding health savings accounts, was also considered. Neither reached the 60-vote mark necessary for passage.
On the House side, Speaker Mike Johnson plans to bring to the floor a narrow legislative package designed to “tackle the real drivers of health care costs.” It would include expanded access to association health plans and appropriations for cost-sharing reduction payments to stabilize the individual market and lower premiums. It would also increase transparency requirements for pharmacy benefit managers. Like the bill put forward by Republicans in the Senate it would not extend the ACA’s enhanced subsidies. Lawmakers are likely to vote on such an extension at some point.
In general, Democrats want to extend the life of the more generous subsidies, created in response to the covid pandemic. Those are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans are split, with many balking at the cost of a straightforward extension, as well as the policy and political implications that might come with a vote to buttress Obamacare, which many have long viewed as public enemy No. 1.
And a few back various proposals that would extend the tax subsidies, fearing that failing to do so will result in political fallout in next year’s midterm elections.
The result is that differing policy positions are being advanced by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers of Congress.
The White House, though supportive of HSAs in principle, has not made clear its choice among the various Capitol Hill plans.
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking for shoppers. People needed to choose their ACA plan before Dec. 15 for coverage to begin Jan. 1. Open enrollment continues in most states until Jan. 15 for coverage beginning Feb. 1.
The marketplaces, too, must have contingency plans in case Congress intervenes. These adjustments could take days or weeks.
“We have a plan on the shelf” to go update the website, including notifying consumers of any changes, said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, a state-based ACA insurance marketplace.
Still, not many working days remain on Congress’ 2025 calendar, and “in many ways, it feels like they are farther apart than they were even a few months ago,” said Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, that state’s ACA marketplace.
Waiting for numbers
Both Altman and Gasteier said it’s still too early to tell how final enrollment tallies will come out, but already there are indications of how sign-ups will compare with last year’s record high of about 24 million.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Dec. 5 released figures from about the first month of open enrollment, showing 949,450 new sign-ups — people who did not have ACA coverage this year — across the federal and state marketplaces. That’s down a bit from approximately the same period last year, when there were 987,869 new enrollees by early December.
Up slightly, however, are returning customers who have already selected a plan for next year. That stands at about 4.8 million, according to CMS, compared with about 4.4 million at this time last year.
That initial finding — lower new enrollments but quicker action by some already covered — may reflect that “people who come back early in the enrollment period are those who need the coverage because they have a chronic condition or need something done,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. “So they are more motivated in the front half.”
And the final number of federal marketplace enrollments takes time to shake out. “The rubber meets the road when people have to pay the first premium,” Corlette said. “With the federal marketplace, we won’t know that for some time.”
Some states have also released information from the first few weeks, with the caveat that many people may wait until mid-December or later to make coverage decisions. Affordability has emerged as a pressure point.
In Pennsylvania, for example, in the first six weeks of open enrollment there was a 16% decrease in people signing up for the first time compared with last year, according to data posted by Pennie, the state’s ACA insurance marketplace. For every one of those new enrollments, 1.5 existing customers canceled, Pennie reported.
There were some indicators that income is a factor: Most of those canceling earned 150% to 200% of the federal poverty level, or $23,475 to $31,300 for a single adult.
Most states automatically reenroll existing customers into the same or similar coverage for the following year. Letters and other notifications are sent to consumers, who then can let the coverage continue or go online during the open enrollment period to change their plan or cancel it.
California reported a 33% drop in new enrollments through Dec. 6. And Altman said she’s also seeing some other changes.
She said more people are opting for “bronze”-level plans, which have lower premium payments than “silver” or “gold” plans but also higher deductibles — the amount people have to pay before most insurance coverage kicks in.
Nationally, the average bronze-plan deductible will be $7,476 next year, while silver plans carry an average $5,304 deductible, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
“That people are being forced to opt for plans with really high deductibles is a warning sign,” Altman said.
In Massachusetts, consumer calls to the state’s marketplace in the first month were up 7% over last year, Gasteier said.
Additionally, “our call centers are getting heartbreaking phone calls from people about how they can’t understand how they can possibly remain in coverage,” she said.
Detailing the difference
If the enhanced tax credits expire, Obamacare subsidies will revert to pre-pandemic levels.
Households will pay a percentage of their income toward the premium, and a tax credit subsidy will cover the remainder, with the payment generally made directly to the insurer.
The enhanced subsidies reduced the amount of household income people had to pay toward their own coverage, with the lowest-income people paying nothing. Also, there was no upper limit on income to qualify — a particular point of criticism from Republicans. Still, in reality, some high earners don’t get a subsidy, because their premiums without it are less than what they are required to contribute.
Next year, without the more generous subsidies, those in the lowest income brackets will pay at least 2.1% of their household income toward their premiums, with the highest earners paying nearly 10%. No subsidies would be available for people earning more than four times the federal poverty level, which comes to $62,600 for an individual or $84,600 for a couple.
For those now shopping for coverage, that cap means a sharp increase in coverage costs. Not only have insurers raised premiums, but now that group’s subsidies have been cut entirely.
“They said, based on our salary, we don’t qualify,” said Debra Nweke, who, at 64, is retired, while her husband, 62, still works. They live in Southern California and are looking at coverage going from $1,000 a month this year to $2,400 monthly next year if they stay in the same ACA plan. “How can you have health insurance that is more than your rent?”
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in early December that Republicans want to find a solution that will lower health care costs, but not one with “people who are making unlimited amounts of money being able to qualify for government subsidies.” He also objected to granting free coverage to those at the lower end of the income scale.
Even those getting subsidies say they are feeling the pinch.
“Our prices are going up, but even at that, I don’t have any other options,” said Andrew Schwarz, a 38-year-old preacher in Bowie, Texas, who gets ACA coverage for himself and his wife. His three children are on a state health insurance program because the family qualifies as low-income. Both Schwarz and Nweke took part in the KFF poll.
Schwarz’s coverage is going from $40 a month this year to $150 monthly next year, partly because he chose a plan with a lower deductible than some of the other options.
Schwarz said that while the health system overall has many problems, Obamacare has worked out for his family. They’ll just have to take the additional cost out of somewhere else in the family budget, he said.

(Courtesy Innovation Law Lab)A federal judge in Albuquerque on Monday ordered the immediate release of an Iranian man held at an Estancia immigration lockup for the last six months, agreeing with his lawyers that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was not acting quickly enough to deport him to a third country, his lawyers told Source New Mexico.
Hamid Ziaei, 42, came to the United States in 2024 from Iran, where he said he feared retribution after using his platform as a prominent bodybuilder to speak out against the government, his lawyers said. A judge in June 2024 granted Ziaei protection from removal to Iran, but ICE agents arrested him a year later  when he arrived at a scheduled immigration appointment in San Diego.
ICE incarcerated Ziaei at the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia soon after his arrest. That’s where he met lawyers from the Innovation Law Lab, based in Portland, Oregon, who in early November filed a petition on his behalf arguing that his continued detention, which they described as “indefinite,” violated his constitutional due process rights.
Newly released data shows sharp decline of inmates at New Mexico ICE facility 

Over the last six months in ICE detention in Estancia, Ziaei did not have adequate food or water, and he grew depressed as he awaited updates about his immigration case or possible release, attorney Tiffany Wang told Source on Monday in an interview after the hearing. His experience is common there, Wang said, and underscores her organization’s push for ICE to close the facility. 
The jail Ziaei is set to leave has been subject to renewed scrutiny for weeks, after an agreement between ICE, Torrance County and CoreCivic, the private company that owns and operates the jail, expired Oct. 31. Since the expiration, the population has sharply declined from up to 700 detainees in May, according to new data. 
CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd previously told Source New Mexico that it continues to provide “safe,  humane and respectful care” to detainees despite the contract’s expiration, and that the population may fluctuate week to week but that it’s “nothing out of the ordinary, and our operations have remained unchanged.”
Still no contract for NM ICE lockup, as detainees report interrupted access to ‘vital’ tablets

Wang estimated Monday that only 100 or so detainees are currently incarcerated there at the moment.
“The Torrance County Detention Facility is not fit to hold anybody. Mr. Ziaei has suffered from respiratory issues since the day he was detained in there,” Wang said “He’s not receiving adequate food. His mental health has significantly declined, obviously, both being detained and just the fact that he hasn’t been told anything.”
Judge Matthew Garcia during Monday’s hearing pressed Ryan Posey, a prosecutor with the United States Attorney’s Office in New Mexico, for answers about the government’s efforts to deport Ziaei to a country other than Iran, according to Ziaei’s lawyers. Posey could not say what country the government intended to deport Ziaei to, they said, or when they intended to deport him.
Garcia ordered Ziaei’s release from Estancia within 24 hours, according to a summary of the proceedings prepared by a court clerk. He said he would issue an order requiring Ziaei’s release by Monday. 
The United States Attorney’s Office declined to comment, a spokesperson told Source on Monday.

(Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Dec. 11, 2025, that aims to supersede state-level artificial intelligence laws that the administration views as a hindrance to innovation in AI.
State laws regulating AI are increasing in number, particularly in response to the rise of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT that produce text and images. Thirty-eight states enacted laws in 2025 regulating AI in one way or another. They range from prohibiting stalking via AI-powered robots to barring AI systems that can manipulate people’s behavior.
The executive order declares that it is the policy of the United States to produce a “minimally burdensome” national framework for AI. The order calls on the U.S. attorney general to create an AI litigation task force to challenge state AI laws that are inconsistent with the policy. It also orders the secretary of commerce to identify “onerous” state AI laws that conflict with the policy and to withhold funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program to states with those laws. The executive order exempts state AI laws related to child safety.
Executive orders are directives to federal agencies on how to implement existing laws. The AI executive order directs federal departments and agencies to take actions that the administration claims fall under their legal authorities.
Big tech companies have lobbied for the federal government to override state AI regulations. The companies have argued that the burden of following multiple state regulations hinders innovation.
Proponents of the state laws tend to frame them as attempts to balance public safety with economic benefit. Prominent examples are laws in California, Colorado, Texas and Utah. Here are some of the major state laws regulating AI that could be targeted under the executive order:
 Algorithmic discrimination

Colorado’s Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence is the first comprehensive state law in the U.S. that aims to regulate AI systems used in employment, housing, credit, education and health care decisions. However, enforcement of the law has been delayed while the state legislature considers its ramifications.
The focus of the Colorado AI act is predictive artificial intelligence systems, which make decisions, not newer generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, which create content.
The Colorado law aims to protect people from algorithmic discrimination. The law requires organizations using these “high-risk systems” to make impact assessments of the technology, notify consumers whether predictive AI will be used in consequential decisions about them, and make public the types of systems they use and how they plan to manage the risks of algorithmic discrimination.
A similar Illinois law scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, amends the Illinois Human Rights Act to make it a civil rights violation for employers to use AI tools that result in discrimination.
 On the ‘frontier’

California’s Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act specifies guardrails on the development of the most powerful AI models. These models, called foundation or frontier models, are any AI model that is trained on extremely large and varied datasets and that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks without additional training. They include the models underpinning OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini AI chatbots.
The California law applies only to the world’s largest AI models – ones that cost at least US$100 million and require at least 1026 – or 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 – floating point operations of computing power to train. Floating point operations are arithmetic that allows computers to calculate large numbers.
Machine learning models can produce unreliable, unpredictable and unexplainable outcomes. This poses challenges to regulating the technology.
Their internal workings are invisible to users and sometimes even their creators, leading them to be called black boxes. The Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that these large models can be quite opaque.
The risks from such large AI models include malicious use, malfunctions and systemic risks. These models could potentially pose catastrophic risks to society. For example, someone could use an AI model to create a weapon that results in mass casualties, or instruct one to orchestrate a cyberattack causing billions of dollars in damages.
The California law requires developers of frontier AI models to describe how they incorporate national and international standards and industry-consensus best practices. It also requires them to provide a summary of any assessment of catastrophic risk. The law also directs the state’s Office of Emergency Services to set up a mechanism for anyone to report a critical safety incident and to confidentially submit summaries of any assessments of the potential for catastrophic risk.
 Disclosures and liability

Texas enacted the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act, which imposes restrictions on the development and deployment of AI systems for purposes such as behavioral manipulation. The safe harbor provisions – protections against liability – in the Texas AI act are meant to provide incentives for businesses to document compliance with responsible AI governance frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.
What is novel about the Texas law is that it stipulates the creation of a “sandbox” – an isolated environment where software can be safely tested – for developers to test the behavior of an AI system.
The Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act imposes disclosure requirements on organizations using generative AI tools with their customers. Such laws ensure that a company using generative AI tools bears the ultimate responsibility for resulting consumer liabilities and harms and cannot shift the blame to the AI. This law is the first in the nation to stipulate consumer protections and require companies to prominently disclose when a consumer is interacting with generative AI system.
 Other moves

States are also taking other legal and political steps to protect their citizens from the potential harms of AI.
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he opposes federal efforts to override state AI regulations. He has also proposed a Florida AI bill of rights to address “obvious dangers” of the technology.
Meanwhile, the attorneys general of 38 states and the attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands called on AI companies, including Anthropic, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Perplexity AI and xAI, to fix sycophantic and delusional outputs from generative AI systems. These are outputs that can lead users to become overly trusting of the AI systems or even delusional.
It’s not clear what effect the executive order will have, and observers have said it is illegal because only Congress can supersede state laws. The order’s final provision directs federal officials to propose legislation to do so.

Only 3.3% of New England is protected wildlands. Experts recommend tripling that while expanding sustainable forestry practices.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eric Sorenson, Brett Engstrom, and Liz Thompson: We need more wild forests and ecological forestry..","Dear Editor,



We applaud Mr. Riley’s excellent opinion piece on ecological forestry. We share his love of forests.
Forest loss and fragmentation diminish both the vast biological and ecological functions of forests and all the benefits we humans derive from them. Permanent conservation is needed to keep forests as forests.
Ecological forestry, which we fully endorse, is an approach to both maintain forests and to produce the products we need locally.

We also need more wild forests, forests that are allowed to mature with free will, under natural processes and evolving over time. As forests mature, they become more complex biologically and structurally, store vast amounts of carbon and are scientific benchmarks for bettering our understanding of forest ecology and management. Moreover, wild forests and all their inhabitants simply have inherent value. We have a responsibility to protect them.
Wild forests are rare in the region. The 2023 report Wildlands in New England: Past, Present, and Future identified only 3.3 percent of the region as protected wildlands. Both this report and Vermont Conservation Design call for at least 9-10 percent of the landscape to be protected as wildland or old forest. The 2024 analysis and report Beyond the “Illusion of Preservation” identifies three steps for our forests’ future: 1) protect forests (at least 10 percent of the land as wildlands, 70 percent as managed woodlands), 2) reduce consumption by 25 percent, and 3) expand ecological forestry.
We need more wild forests and more ecological forestry, and we have plenty of room for both.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Leaders of an Indiana group aimed at supporting independent political candidates say the state’s time in the national congressional redistricting spotlight gives them hope that the Legislature will advance election reforms.
On top of Independent Indiana’s list is eliminating straight-ticket voting in which those casting election ballots can vote for all of a party’s candidate with a single push of a button.
Independent Indiana organizers, who launched the group this fall, released Monday a report on the competitiveness of the state’s elections. They said straight-ticket voting is among the greatest obstacles independent candidates face since voters don’t even see the names of those candidates.
A poll conducted for the study found that 62% of voters considered straight-ticket voting a “bad thing,” with 26% in support. The highest level of support was from among Republicans, but they were 36% in favor and 49% against the practice.
Nathan Gotsch, executive director of Independent Indiana, said the secretary of state’s office does not track how many straight-ticket votes are cast statewide.
“But we went through and looked at the top five largest counties in the state and over 50% of voters in the last election in those counties voted straight ticket,” Gotsch said.
Call to eliminate straight-ticket voting
Bills to eliminate straight-ticket voting have been introduced numerous times in the Legislature over the past decade without winning passage.
Such issues have been dismissed in the past as ones of little interest to the public. But that was also the view about a topic like congressional redistricting before the monthslong debate ended with its defeat by the state Senate last week, said Jay Chaudhary, a board member of the nonprofit Center for Independent and Effective Government, which is Independent Indiana’s parent organization.
“Nobody cares about redistricting, right? But we saw the absolute fire storm and really the power of the people in beating that back,” said Chaudhary, who was director of the state’s Division of Mental Health and Addiction under Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb.
Indiana is one of only six states that currently allows straight-ticket voting, according to the group.
Gotsch said a new factor in the straight-ticket voting discussion will be the impact of school board candidates being allowed to list their political party affiliation starting with the 2026 elections. The partisan school board bill adopted earlier this year, however, does not allow straight-ticket votes to count in those races.
“I actually think in a lot of Republican areas, you could find Republican school board members losing because of that under vote,” Gotsch said. “So many people are going in, voting straight ticket and then those Republican school board members are not benefiting from those votes.”
The group is also advocating for a lowering of the signature threshold independent candidates must meet in order to qualify for the election ballot.
Those candidates must now collect petition signatures from registered voters equal to 2% of the most recent secretary of state vote in their district. For a statewide race, that means nearly 37,000 signatures.
Gotsch, who was an independent candidate in 2022 for northeastern Indiana’s 3rd congressional district seat, said that the 2% requirement was enacted in 1980 and creates a barrier for those wanting to run as independents.
Poll finds many voters dissatisfied
Independent Indiana’s report also blames gerrymandering for what it said resulted “in a small, unrepresentative slice of voters effectively determining who ultimately holds most elected offices.”
The report cited the 2024 primaries, in which 17% of Indiana registered voters cast ballots — an estimated 13% in the Republican primary and 4% in the Democratic primary.
The report’s poll found that 53% of overall Indiana voters were dissatisfied with their election choices, with 40% satisfied. Republican voters, however, were satisfied with their choices by a 68%-26% margin.
For political party identification, the poll found:

29% of voters considering themselves Republicans
 15% saying they were independents who leaned Republican
21% said they were Democrats
11% independents who leaned Democratic
15% independents
8% declined to answer

Regarding the state’s major parties:

33% had favorable opinion of the Indiana Republican Party, with 45% unfavorable
25% had favorable opinion of the Indiana Democratic Party, with 43% unfavorable  

The poll, conducted by North Star Opinion Research, was taken of 604 registered voters in early October with a margin of error of 3.99%. North Star regularly polls for GOP candidates and national Republican committees.

While 58% of military veterans treated between 2002 and 2015 had a diagnosed mental health disorder, less than half of U.S. vets seek out treatment due to the cost, lack of availability and stigma. In response, mental health professionals, veterans groups and researchers have sought alternatives to in-office treatment, finding positive results with outdoor recreation and exposure. 
Although adventure-based trips like backpacking and whitewater rafting had a positive impact on veterans facing PTSD, anxiety, depression and other conditions, the Sierra Club report notes these programs are only available sporadically. Additionally, many areas lack the natural resources needed for this recreational therapy.

Veterans need access to quality natural spaces near their homes, the report says, emphasizing that this space should be accessible  regardless of transportation availability, connection to organized outings, or their personal economic situations.
Air pollution can also complicate access to green spaces, as many veterans suffer from respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, making them more sensitive to pollutants, preventing them from engaging in outdoor activities. 
The report examined eight cities across the U.S., including Detroit, assessing each based on the amount of vets lacking access to nature, as well as the American Lung Association’s 2025 state of the air grades. 
In its assessment of Detroit, the report notes that its park system is growing, as it encompasses nearly 5,000 acres across 300 parks. While 84% of residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park, 20% of veterans lacked access to nature in their neighborhoods, with the Sierra Club rating the city a “B” for overall nature access.
However, the city’s “F” rating from the American Lung Association, low walkability and poor access to public transit, pose a barrier to veterans’ park access, the report notes.
Additionally, the neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of people of color also had access to 38% less park space than the neighborhoods with the most white residents. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the report gave Detroit a “D” rating overall.

With many veterans facing long-term respiratory, cardiovascular and mental health conditions that can be made worse by pollution, the Sierra Club emphasized the importance of maintaining protections for clean air, water and for public lands, to support nature-based therapy and limit further exposure of veterans to toxic air pollution.
“When parks are closed, air is polluted, or communities near bases suffer environmental damage, veterans—many of whom live in those areas—bear the brunt,” the report states. “Protecting the environment is not just an ecological responsibility; it’s part of the nation’s duty of care to those who served.”
The report also recommends supporting efforts to connect veterans with nature, supporting staffing and funding for public lands, and improving accessible infrastructure in parks and public land.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-190946.png,,,2025-12-16 07:56:18.175830
