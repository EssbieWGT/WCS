(Photo courtesy of Sorrell Redford)On Friday, April 25, Sorrell Redford, education director for Montezuma School to Farm Project, heard that their AmeriCorps funding through Serve Colorado would run out following abrupt cuts from the federal government. The agency bought themselves a few extra days by cobbling together two weeks-worth of funds to help ease the transition and possibly, to tide them over until a court reversal.
Near the end of April, DOGE cut more than 1,000 AmeriCorps grants totalling nearly $400 million across the United States. Many of these programs provided pivotal social services for rural communities that do not have the resources to fill these gaps without federal funding.
In Cortez, Colorado, Montezuma School to Farm Project depends on AmeriCorps members to keep the organization going. The nonprofit teaches garden classes in local public schools and also grows food for the food pantry, Good Samaritans. Redford said they have a goal to produce 6,000 pounds of food this year.
Redford said the organization only pays $300 for each AmeriCorps member right now and the government subsidizes the rest.
“Without that, we could not afford to employ them,” she said.
She hopes that they will be able to pay for their current members until the end of their terms in July, but it will cost the organization an extra $5,300 a month — a lot for a small nonprofit.
On April 29, 24 states and the District of Columbia, including Colorado and Kentucky, filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps funding, calling it unconstitutional because it “usurps Congress’s power of the purse” and does not allow the agency to serve its mission and purpose.
While Redford hopes the lawsuit will restore funding for their programs, it could come too late for both the current members and next year’s AmeriCorps members, who would start in August. Redford has already made an offer to a member for next year but now that is up in the air. Without AmeriCorps starting in late summer, the harvest season will fall entirely to Redford, currently Montezuma School to Farm Project’s  only full-time employee.
“There’s a whole trickle down effect, if we can’t grow the food, we can’t get it to the food bank, they won’t have fresh food to give out,” Redford said.
The pantry is already hurting due to USDA grant cuts that fund local purchases for food pantries and schools. The AmeriCorps also work as volunteers in the pantry distributing food. Adding insult to injury, AmeriCorps’ absence in Montezuma would halt garden classes, hurting both teachers and students.
In Colorado, 27 out of 37 AmeriCorps programs were cut, said Colorado Lieutenant Governor, Dianne Primavera. Seventeen of those were in rural areas. Serve Colorado, the state agency that manages Colorado AmeriCorps, is under the office of the Lieutenant Governor. Primavera said that Colorado lost about $12 million of funding for rural areas alone.
“AmeriCorps members’ service is the only support system in many rural towns, so losing these programs isn’t just a budget issue, it’s a community resilience issue,” Primavera said in an interview with the Daily Yonder.
Primavera emphasized that AmeriCorps is a workforce development program – many AmeriCorps members go on to become teachers, mental health professionals, firefighters and other vital community professions, based on their experiences in AmeriCorps.
“This isn’t a time to cut AmeriCorps. It’s a time really, to double down on services, not dismantle it,” said Primavera.
  History of AmeriCorps 

AmeriCorps programs have been around, under various names, since the 1960s, when the Volunteers in Service to America, or VISTA, program was established as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Even before that, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. It was later used as a model for conservation corps programs that still exist today, many of which are funded through AmeriCorps grants.
While AmeriCorps does operate some direct programs like the National Civilian Community Corps, most of the funding through the program goes directly to city and county governments, nonprofits, and other organizations doing work on the ground in communities.
Service members receive a small stipend for their service term which can last from a few months to more than a year. At the end of the term, members are eligible to receive an education award of around $7,000 that can be applied towards future education opportunities or towards student loans. For any AmeriCorps member affected by grant cuts, education awards stopped accruing and will be prorated as of April 25, 2025, violating contracts signed by these members at the beginning of their service terms.
  Eastern Kentucky 

On Saturday, April 26, Josh Mullins received a call from Serve Kentucky that Hindman Settlement School’s AmeriCorps funding – more than a million dollars – had been cut by the Trump Administration.
Hindman Settlement School in Eastern Kentucky had two AmeriCorps grants to fund 52 service members across five different counties in seven school districts, providing math and reading tutoring for K-3rd grade students.
Mullins, the director of operations for Hindman Settlement School, said that the organization had been an AmeriCorps grantee for the past five years and they shouldn’t have had to reapply for funding until next year for their ReadingCorps program, and two years from now for their Math Corps program.
“The school systems rely on these services to help their most at-risk students,” Mullins said in a Daily Yonder interview. “The schools do not have the staffing to provide one on one intervention,” he said. AmeriCorps members directly fill these gaps, providing tutoring to students falling behind in math and reading.
In Kentucky, 21 out of 28 AmeriCorps programs were cut – $9 million dollars of funding – affecting the service terms of 691 volunteers. While called volunteers, AmeriCorps members are full time (sometimes more than full time) employees, and for many, it is their primary employment, despite being paid a near-poverty-wage stipend.
Mullins said that Hindman Settlement School is committed to funding their service members until the end of their terms in July. They are currently fundraising to fill the gap left by the AmeriCorps funding cuts.
“If we don’t win the lawsuit, everything will stop immediately. There’ll be some not for profits, that will have to shut their doors,” said Lt. Governor Primavera.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.
“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.

A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.
In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.
Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)This week is National Small Business Week, a time to celebrate the entrepreneurs who keep our communities vibrant and full of opportunity. In Anchorage, we’re lucky we don’t have to look far to see that spirit in action.
Just last  week, a room full of small business owners, proud families, and community members gathered in Spenard to celebrate the newest graduates of Anchorage Community Land Trust’s Set Up Shop and Indigenous Peoples Set Up Shop programs. These programs help entrepreneurs in underserved communities launch and grow their businesses, creating a ripple effect of community revitalization and generational wealth. 
But just as we mark this week meant to honor small businesses, the future of this work is in jeopardy. Recently, the federal government terminated congressionally approved grants that fund these very programs. That means Set Up Shop — a proven path to self-sufficiency for underserved entrepreneurs — may not continue in its current form.
And let’s be clear. This isn’t about government waste or bloated bureaucracy. It’s about breaking a contract. 
Imagine hiring a contractor to paint your home. They buy the paint, prep the walls, schedule a crew, and then you cancel the job halfway through and refuse to pay. Most people would agree that’s unethical, and certainly indefensible. Yet that’s exactly what’s happening to nonprofits like ACLT, who were asked to do a job, only to see the funding pulled midstream. The work still needs to be done, but the government has walked away.
We’re not just talking about line items in a budget. We’re talking about hard- working Alaskans who have done everything right. They’ve taken business classes, written plans, earned certifications, and opened storefronts, and are now left with fewer tools and less support than they were promised. When we don’t invest in our own people, we pay the price in other ways, with lost jobs, empty buildings, and neighborhoods full of untapped potential.
When an entrepreneur opens a new business in Anchorage they hire locally. They spend locally. They transform vacant lots into thriving storefronts. The economic return goes far beyond the individual business owner and it makes our city a better place to live. 
Set Up Shop has helped more than 500 entrepreneurs turn ideas into realities, and side hustles into fully fledged businesses. These businesses hire locally, pay taxes, and invest in their neighborhoods. That’s not charity. That’s economic infrastructure  built from the ground up.
We will continue to do this work, with or without the original funding. That’s what it means to serve your community. But we could benefit from you being with us. If you believe in the promise of local business and the power of neighborhood-led change, we invite you to consider supporting ACLT and, most importantly, supporting these entrepreneurs. You could visit their businesses, share their stories and help us keep the momentum alive.
Because when we invest in our neighbors, we all win — and that’s just good business.

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland Democrats reacted swiftly, and angrily, Friday to news that President Donald Trump had fired the librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, a former director of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore who drew raves for her work there.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Friday that President Donald Trump fired Hayden Thursday night because of “quite concerning things that she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.”
“We don’t believe that she was serving the interest of the American taxpayer well so she has been removed from her position and the president is well within his rights to do that,” Leavitt said.
Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd said late Thursday that Trump’s “callous dismissal of Carla Hayden is a disgraceful disservice to all Americans.”
“We must call this out for what it is: an attack on our democratic norms and yet another effort to replace dedicated public servants with MAGA allies,” Olszewski said in a statement.

When she was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2016, Hayden was the 14th librarian of Congress but the first woman and the firs African American in the job, which has a term of 10 years.
Her term included the four years of Trump’s first term in office.
“Dr. Hayden deserves to serve out the remainder of her 10-year term and the country will be better off for it,” Olszewski said. “Congress must demand answers and be ready to fight for her reinstatement.”
Prior to her federal appointment, Hayden was CEO of the Enoch Pratt Library, a position she had held since 1993, according to her official Library of Congress biography.
Del. Samuel I. “Sandy” Rosenberg (D-Baltimore), who called Hayden’s termination a “Trumpian tragedy,” recalled her insistence on keeping the library open during the height of the unrest in Baltimore over Freddie Gray.
“The epicenter of the disturbances after Freddie Gray’s funeral was Pennsylvania and North Avenue,” Rosenberg said. “The library branch at that corner was kept open by Carla Hayden.”
Rosenberg said Hayden’s efforts “so impressed” then-House Speaker Michael Busch that he backed legislation mandating additional funding to the system for extended hours.
The bill, passed by the General Assembly, was vetoed by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, but that veto was susseqently overriden by lawmakers.
Roddy re-retires in Baltimore County
Patrick Roddy, a long-time Annapolis lobbyist, who retired in 2021 and then rejoined Baltimore County government this year, will re-retire at the end of the month.
A spokesperson for County Executive Kathy Klausmeier confirmed Roddy will retire from his position as director of government relations effective June 1. Roddy spent two decades in Baltimore County government as director of legislative affairs liaison and an assistant county attorney before joining Rifkin Weiner Livingston in 2003.
Roddy did not respond to a request for comment. In previous interviews, the former Annapolis lobbyist said he did not see his return to county government as permanent.
Klausmeier — the 15th Baltimore County executive and first woman to hold the position — tapped Roddy and his wife Valerie to join her administration just days after she was named to fill the vacancy created when Johnny Olszewski Jr. was elected to Congress. Both Roddys were initially named senior advisers, with Patrick moving into the county’s lobbying shop — a job he’d held previously. Valerie Roddy became deputy chief of staff.
The county spokesperson said Valerie Roddy will continue in her position. And while rumors of potential replacements for Patrick Roddy circulate, the spokesperson said a search is ongoing.
Five Maryland sites added to National Underground Railroad Network
Five Maryland sites have been added to the National Underground Railroad Network of Freedom Program.
The new sites join more than 90 others in the state as part of a National Park Service program aimed at promoting preservation and research of sites related to the Underground Railroad — part of an abolitionist effort that helped enslaved people escape.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By adding five historical sites here in Maryland to the National Park Service’s National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program, we are honoring the legacy and lives of the courageous men and women who escaped slavery through the Underground Railroad. At a time when this Administration is actively trying to erase American history, we in Maryland will never back down from this simple truth: our history makes us stronger, more resilient, and more prepared to never let the evils of our past repeat,” Maryland U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks said in a joint statement from the Maryland delegation.
The five Maryland sites are:

Goshen Farm in Annapolis.
Issac Mason Escape Site in Chestertown.
St. Augustine Church in Chesapeake.
Rich Hill in Bel Alton.
Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, Susquehanna State Park in Havre de Grace.

“I commend the preservation efforts of the National Underground Railroad Network. Three of the new historic sites – Isaac Mason Escape Site, St. Augustine Church and Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal – are located in the First Congressional District. The addition of these sites preserve the legacy and bravery of Marylanders who sacrificed their safety for the freedom of others,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) said in the joint statement from the Maryland delegation.
The five sites in Maryland are part of 31 additions to the National Park Service Program. Currently there are 800 sites in 41 states.
Group calls for veto of “Earned wage” bill
More than three dozen advocates, including the NAACP Maryland State Conference, are calling on Gov. Wes Moore to veto a bill meant to regulate so-called “earned wage access” loans.
In a letter sent to Moore, advocates said House Bill 1294 exempts app-based lenders from state laws that “prohibit lending that is discriminatory, is deceptive, or carries extremely high interest rates.”
“The NAACP is particularly concerned that certain companies have written themselves out of the anti-discrimination protections embedded in the small-dollar lending statute,” NAACP Maryland State Conference Political Action Chair Ricarra Jones, said in a statement. “At a time when the federal government is openly working to dismantle hard-won laws and policies that protect people of color, these industry-proposed rollbacks are especially harmful for the people of Maryland. We call on Governor Moore to stand firm in defense of civil rights and equal protection under the law.”
Earned wage access programs typically come in two versions – one offered by employers to their employees and another offered by private companies directly to workers. Both versions are intended to give early access to a portion of wages earned but not yet paid. The amount is then paid back typically through automatic deductions, usually with a fee or “tip.”
Jones and opponents of the House bill say those tips amount to finance charges that often can exceed 300% interest, higher than the state’s 33% limit. Allowing the bill to become law “removes the last and best defense against predatory lending in the state,” the group said in its letter to Moore.
House Republicans want Schiraldi fired
House Republicans are calling on Gov. Wes Moore to fire embattled Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi in the wake of a troubling new audit.
A convicted criminal worked with children at Maryland facility, audit finds

The 75-page report from the Office of Legislative Audits found scores of issues with the agency that is responsible for incarcerating minors. Included in the findings was a lack of criminal background checks by contractors on their employees. One contractor, who auditors said was convicted of second-degree assault and possession of a dangerous weapon with the intent to injure, was still working for a DJS vendor as recently as January.
It’s the second time in less than a year that Republicans have called on Moore to fire Schiraldi. House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) called the audit “yet another troubling, but not surprising, example” of the department’s failure to protect  children in its care.”
“This agency has a record of constant failure in its basic duties, and they have not once been held accountable,” Buckel said in a statement released by the House Republican Caucus. “With the hundreds of accusations of historic abuse being lodged at the DJS, one would think they would have a laser focus on those who were working directly with the children under their supervision, but again, this is not the case.”
In its reply to auditors, the department said it is working to correct the deficiencies cited in the audit — which, it noted, includes only one year of Moore’s term in office, and almost three years under the previous administration.
“This evaluation took place almost entirely during the previous administration and highlights the state of disrepair the department was in when Governor Moore assumed office,” Carter Elliott, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement. “Secretary Schiraldi and the Department of Juvenile Services have spent the last two years addressing deficiencies left by the previous administration and this is just the latest example.”
Even so, it has become another flash point for the secretary.
“Governor Moore’s all-of-the-above approach to public safety is seeing results across the state,” Elliott said. “Juvenile crime numbers in murder, auto theft, carjacking and other areas continue to drop because of the work the administration is doing in partnership with the general assembly, state attorneys, local leaders, and advocates.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LibraryofCongress-2_20250509_JED-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-10 09:04:30.402003

Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.

Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

An Alabama grand jury indicted former state trooper James Bonard Fowler for the Feb. 18, 1965, killing of Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was trying to protect his mother from being beaten at Mack’s Café. 
At Jackson’s funeral, Martin Luther King Jr. called him “a martyred hero of a holy crusade for freedom and human dignity.” As a society, he said, “we must be concerned not merely about who murdered him, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderer.” 
Authorities reopened the case after journalist John Fleming of the Anniston Star published an interview with Fowler in which he admitted, despite his claim of self-defense, that he had shot Jackson multiple times. And Fleming uncovered Fowler’s killing of another Black man, Nathan Johnson. In 2010, Fowler pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in Jackson’s death and was sentenced to six months behind bars. In the 1990s, he served five years in prison in Thailand for heroin trafficking. He died in 2015.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120240/May10-jackson4_custom-8f4dc63f45a2f36e638bea33c67362ac8836c65e.jpg,,,2025-05-10 09:04:30.402003

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)After losing their bid to unionize the Amazon warehouse in Garner by a three-to-one margin in February, labor organizers with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment are challenging the election results, arguing Amazon coerced employees into voting against the union campaign.
In a filing with the National Labor Relations Board on Feb. 24, CAUSE alleges that Amazon misled workers into believing that they would lose existing benefits and wages if they voted in favor of the union, brought in a speaker who said the union would deport workers, and targeted pro-union workers for discipline throughout the election period.
“The Employer engaged in improper surveillance of employees, created the impression of surveillance, and interrogated employees regarding their Union support and Union activity,” the CAUSE objection reads. “The Employer selectively enforced workplace rules regarding performance standards and appearance, targeting known Union supporters for discipline and enforcement while ignoring similar violations by workers who were not known Union supporters.”
Though more than 30% of workers comprising the bargaining unit signed union cards in 2024 — representing the support of more than 1,000 warehouse associates — fewer ultimately voted in favor of the union, with just 829 voting in favor and 2,447 voting against, according to the NLRB. That left the union campaign far short of the majority vote necessary to win the right to bargain on behalf of the warehouse staff.
Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment on CAUSE’s allegations of coercion, surveillance, and selective discipline, but expressed satisfaction with the result of the election.
“Our team in Garner overwhelmingly chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,” Hards wrote in an emailed statement. “We look forward to continuing to make RDU1 a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.”
In March, the NLRB placed the union campaign’s challenge on hold while complaints around the company’s conduct during the election period are vetted. Meanwhile, labor activists are gearing up for renewed efforts at Garner’s RDU1 warehouse as well as additional facilities throughout the Carolinas.
‘We desperately need the protection of the NLRB’
Since 2022, CAUSE has brought more than a dozen unfair labor practice complaints against Amazon, largely focusing on employee terminations, discipline of union organizers, and a general climate of surveillance.
The first of these complaints, coming in June 2022, soon after the union campaign’s formation, cited warehouse rules forbidding discussion of wages, hours, and other working conditions as an illegal prohibition on union activity. It also pointed to the end of site-specific COVID-19 updates, restrictions on the company’s internal discussion board, and the removal of a “web clock punch” feature on the employee app as impediments to protected labor activities.

The most extensive labor litigation pursued by the union surrounded disciplinary action against its co-founder, Rev. Ryan Brown, who alleged in 2022 that his complaints about warehouse conditions and racial discrimination were met with retaliation from supervisors, including a “final written warning.”
In a May 2024 response to the complaint, Amazon conceded that it issued the warning but denied that “such discipline was issued for any unlawful purpose” and was instead purely due to violation of company policy.
Arguing that the complaint should be dismissed, attorneys for Amazon went further than the facts of the individual case: they claimed the NLRB’s adjudicative procedures themselves are inherently unconstitutional, as board administrators are “improperly insulated from the President’s removal power.”
“The Complaint should be dismissed because the agency procedures through which the Complaint will be resolved violate Article II of the United States Constitution,” attorneys for Amazon wrote. “The National Labor Relations Board’s concurrent exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial power in this proceeding violates the separation of powers established by the United States Constitution and the guarantee of due process found in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”
Though Amazon was ordered in September 2024 — nearly two years after the initial complaint — to produce documents relating to policy complaints and allegations of discrimination that Brown and other employees voiced, the union withdrew its complaint the following month, due to the time and expense of the lengthy appeals process.
CAUSE has alleged that several employees have lost their jobs as a result of union organizing leading up to and during the election period, including Brown and Duke professor Orin Starn. Those terminations have continued in the wake of the election, organizers say, including that of Diedre King in March. According to CAUSE, she worked at the Garner warehouse for four years with an unblemished disciplinary record and was an “active, dedicated, and visible” member of the union organizing committee before she was accused of slapping a coworker during the election period, a claim she denies.
King said in the wake of her termination, she has received “amazing” support from other members of CAUSE. Organizers set up a fundraiser that has raised more than $5,500 for her as of Friday, and she said she also received a flood of calls offering support, even from colleagues she did not know before. “They call, they check up on me and see what I’m doing, get me out, get me involved in stuff — and not want me to sit at home and, like, be really depressed.”
Starn, the Duke professor, pointed to King’s termination and that of another employee afterwards as evidence of a “mass purge” targeting union organizers. A worker on the warehouse’s loading dock and an active organizer with the union, Starn was let go in December 2023 after a social media post in which he toasted the union effort with a sip of rum in the parking lot after work.

While the company cited its drug and alcohol policy as grounds for the dismissal, Starn wrote in an October 2024 NLRB appeal letter that he was instead let go for the “real and illegal reason” of openly campaigning for the union, one of just three workers doing so at the time.
“My firing damaged our effort by keeping me out of the facility and the chance to mobilize workers there, although we are making strong progress in our card collection nonetheless,” he wrote. “We desperately need the protection of the NLRB in supporting rightful complaints like mine to keep a powerful company from getting away with demoralizing illegal tactics in trying to suppress worker efforts to have a voice in the workplace.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, wrote in a statement that Starn’s termination was not related to his union activities and disputed his characterization of selective enforcement of the company’s drug and alcohol policy.
“The decision to terminate Mr. Starn was unrelated to whether he supported any particular cause or group. Mr. Starn was terminated for violating Amazon’s drug and alcohol policy, a violation that has resulted in several other terminations at RDU1 in the past,” she wrote. “We expect all of our employees to follow our policies, and we take appropriate action when those policies are violated.”
Ultimately, of the 13 labor complaints brought by CAUSE organizers, all but two have been dismissed or withdrawn — the most recent of those complaints, an expansive Feb. 7 complaint alleging a campaign of surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation by Amazon throughout the election period, remains open, as does a Jan. 15 complaint citing the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property in December. A Feb. 12 complaint that Amazon brought against the union over the removal of company posters is also still active.
A resolution to CAUSE’s election objections will come only after their prior complaints are adjudicated. “I have determined to postpone the objections hearing until I determine the merits of the related pending unfair labor practice allegations and whether consolidation of the pending objections with an unfair labor practice proceeding before an administrative law judge is warranted,” NLRB regional director Michael Turner wrote in March.
With President Donald Trump’s election, however, it appears CAUSE’s claims may well face an uphill battle with the NLRB. In March, Trump nominated Crystal Carey as the board’s next general counsel — a management-side labor lawyer whose firm has represented Amazon in labor disputes and advanced the claim that the board itself is unconstitutional.
Union supporters allege ‘a total fear campaign’
At the center of the ongoing dispute over the labor election results is the conduct of Amazon and the union campaign during the election period, from late 2024 to early 2025.
Organizers say Amazon carried out a campaign of intimidation and union-busting, culminating in the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property, while the company says the campaign went too far in its efforts to reach workers on the premises and counter company messaging, accusing them of trespassing and vandalism.
In their Feb. 24 election challenge, lawyers for CAUSE wrote that the thrust of Amazon’s messaging campaign was that unionizing would be “futile” and was likely to lead to the rollback of higher wages, benefits like volunteer and unpaid time off, and other employment protections that the company had granted in the absence of organized representation.
“[Amazon] threatened employees with the loss of benefits and/or pay if workers voted in favor of being represented by the Union,” the attorneys wrote. “[They] solicited employees to participate in the production of anti-Union marketing materials, and took video footage of employees to use in anti-Union videos without the employees’ knowledge or consent.”

Italo Medelius, a CAUSE organizer who worked the warehouse’s shipping dock, said managers and employee relations consultants would walk the warehouse floor, soliciting workers and discouraging them from joining the union. This was paired with a “Vote No” promotional video that aired on repeat on televisions across the facility’s lobbies and break rooms, which he said featured a former Teamster making the case that union representation would only harm the workers. “So just a total fear campaign, 24/7 inside of that warehouse,” he said.
According to a report by LaborLab, a pro-union nonprofit corporate watchdog, Amazon paid management-side consulting firm Road Warrior Productions more than $366,000 over the span of roughly a month to create anti-union materials used in the election, which the organization condemned as “union-busting services.”
“Amazon is one of the greatest union busters in the history of the world,” said Medelius. “They cover every single inch of that warehouse in some way, shape, or form with anti-union propaganda.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, cited the extensive organizing efforts across Amazon facilities throughout the U.S. as necessitating the use of labor consulting firms. She pointed to “tens of billions of dollars in benefits” including health care, a 401K program with a company match, and pre-paid college tuition as evidence that investments in workers vastly outweigh the use of those services.
“We also know that there are outside organizations working hard and spending heavily to spread inaccurate information about us to our teams. Which is also why we work to ensure our employees are fully informed about their rights and how decisions about outside representation could impact their day-to-day lives working at Amazon,” Hards wrote in a statement.
Medelius also described an anti-union persuasion campaign that he said targeted Spanish-speaking workers specifically, which he said invoked racial stereotypes in an attempt to divide workers. Medelius, who is bilingual, said he was individually banned from Amazon’s Spanish-language informational meetings after speaking out against these tactics. He added that on one occasion, he was required to report for a random drug test minutes after speaking out at one of these meetings, an experience he said other organizers reported as well.

“The crazy thing is that we’ve been fighting for translation in Human Resources. So, if somebody that’s a Spanish speaker has an issue that needs to be resolved by HR, I have to go with them to translate for them,” Medelius said. “But when it comes to union busting, everything is in Spanish, so it’s kind of a little bit dystopian there.”
Starn recounted a town hall meeting in which a manager sought to associate CAUSE with immigrant deportation efforts to “raise fear and uncertainty” among workers and scare them out of supporting the union effort.
“At one of the town hall meetings, one of the mangers says, you know, ‘We’ve been hearing that CAUSE is telling people that if they vote no, they’ll be deported, and we don’t think anybody should be deported,’” Starn said. “This is a completely outlandish charge, but it’s the kind of thing Amazon does.”
This incident was also detailed in the election challenge, with attorneys for the union campaign writing that Amazon “coerced and intimidated employees into voting against Union representation by falsely accusing the Union of suggesting workers could be deported for voting no” and themselves “suggesting that workers’ immigration status could be impacted by the results of the election.”
According to Hards, employees came forward with complaints that union organizers told them if they did not vote in favor of the union, they could face deportation, and the comments during the informational session were intended to rebut those claims.
The complaint also alleges that Amazon took action against specific employees to prevent them from voting in favor of the union, including delaying a known union supporter’s return-to-work date until after the election had concluded. And it details a culture of surveillance in which workers’ social media accounts were allegedly monitored for statements about the campaign and where workers were “interrogated” about support for the union.
Many of these allegations were also the subject of a Feb. 7 unfair labor practice complaint filed by CAUSE that remains open, including a claim that workers were explicitly asked to report union activity to management and that Amazon selectively targeted known union supporters for disciplinary action.

These claims have been a persistent subject of CAUSE’s labor complaints long before the union card campaign concluded, with their attorneys writing in a May 2023 unfair labor practice complaint that Amazon was “instructing its employees to file internal complaints against supporters of [CAUSE]” and launching investigations against organizers to search for cause to terminate them.
The union alleges that interference with the election effort came to a head on Dec. 7, 2024, when three organizers not employed by Amazon were arrested by Garner Police on trespassing charges as they sought to pass out food and collect union cards outside the warehouse. Days later, Amazon also terminated Brown, the union co-founder, citing inflammatory remarks likening company management to slaveholders and labeling a defender of the company an “Uncle Tom.”
Hards declined to comment on the broader allegations of coercion and surveillance, but wrote that the company was within its rights to seek the removal of non-employees from its property during the Dec. 7 incident.
“Last December, several individuals who aren’t Amazon employees or partners came on to our property and refused multiple requests to leave,” Hards wrote. “After repeated attempts to remedy the situation and consistent with our standard protocols, we engaged law enforcement for assistance. Those individuals were eventually arrested after refusing to follow the police officer’s orders.”
She also condemned Brown for what she described as efforts to “push misinformation to the media” on his arrest and said his dismissal was the result of “repeated misconduct” including the use of “derogatory and racist language,” which the company had previously investigated. “His most recent violation resulted in his termination because we don’t tolerate that type of inappropriate behavior at Amazon.”

During this same period, Amazon alleges that union supporters tore down posters encouraging workers to vote no, labeling the actions as “acts of property damage.” CAUSE contends in its own complaint that scores of pro-union posters and signage from inside and outside the facility were destroyed — including signs posted in the break room and banners supporting the union hanging on the public sidewalk outside the warehouse.
Despite these setbacks, the card campaign succeeded in January after organizers collected signatures from more than 30% of workers comprising the prospective bargaining unit. But in February, they lost by a roughly three-to-one margin, a result that indicated there had been a falloff of support in the critical month leading up to the election — a result that Medelius said came as “a blow” in the moment.
“Ultimately, just looking at it, we knew that historically and logically we were facing an uphill battle from the very beginning,” Medelius said. “Everybody that’s a professional labor organizer has told us, you’re never gonna win the first time.”
‘This election hasn’t stopped the train’
On Friday, organizers with CAUSE once again set up their tents outside RDU1 — their first demonstration on-site since the election. As they renewed their pitch to workers, the company began work on a new eight-foot fence along the property line.
“My biggest fear leading up to the election was if there is a loss, or if there is a big loss with a big margin like what happened, that we would just collapse — that’s what Amazon pretty much hopes, right?” Medelius said. “But with us, I mean, the next day we had a meeting, that Sunday, and it was one of our most attended meetings. There were even people that voted no that were there and trying to figure out how we can build a better union.”

He described a mood of “optimism and hope” among organizers as the fight moves forward and called the 829 supporters in the warehouse a strong foothold to come back and succeed in the next effort. According to NLRB rules, a union campaign can file for a new election 12 months after the conclusion of the previous one. That means organizers could give Amazon “another Christmas present this year” with a renewed card authorization campaign, Medelius said.
King said she has heard from workers who voted no and who have had a change of heart since, pointing to issues like a wave of terminations after the election and excessive enforcement of policies like cell phone restrictions and “time off task” discipline.
“That’s why we’re out here today, to let people know that we’re still here,” she said on Friday, sitting under one of the tents to meet and persuade former coworkers. “We’re not going anywhere, and we have your back, but we need y’all to have ours as well.”
After the first election effort, Medelius said, organizers now have firsthand experience with the company’s anti-union tactics, giving them a better chance at countering their messaging among workers.
“Now we know the rules, we know what we’ve got to do, and we can come in with a better strategy,” Medelius said. “It’s kind of like a boxing match, right? You lose one round, but then you jump back and win the next three, so we’re very excited to do that.”

In particular, he outlined plans to strengthen CAUSE’s Hispanic Organizing Committee and day shift and night shift organizing committees, and to begin collecting authorization cards year-round. He added that organizers had been in contact with workers at the RDU5 and DRT8 warehouses in Durham as well as facilities in South Carolina who want to begin their own efforts, but declined to offer specific information about potential future campaigns, citing the need for secrecy around organizing strategies.
Benny Koval, chair of CAUSE’s night shift organizing committee, said the immediate priority was “what we can do on the shop floor,” pushing back on issues like excessive temperatures in the facility, post-holiday rush layoffs, and mandatory overtime days — one of which was slated to be on Mother’s Day before the company backtracked after employee outcries, Koval said.
“I feel like they’re just stepping on us to see how much we’ll take to a certain extent,” Koval said.
Meanwhile, efforts to unionize Amazon continue throughout the U.S., particularly across the South. In Louisville, Kentucky, workers at the company’s KCVG Air Hub are seeking to organize through the Teamsters, and in Bessemer, Alabama, labor officials have ordered Amazon to hold a third union election after finding unlawful interference in previous attempts.
Abraham Walker, a sociology professor at Fayetteville State University, said the South poses some structural obstacles for union campaigns. Every state in the region is a “right-to-work” state, meaning that workplaces cannot make union membership compulsory and all workers are entitled to the same benefits regardless of union affiliation, creating what Walker called a “free rider problem” in which workers reap the rewards of union-bargained contracts without paying dues to support organizing efforts. And because of the low rates of union membership throughout the South, many workers do not know anyone who is a member of a union, leaving them susceptible to misinformation about union impacts, Walker said.
  Labor groups from across the South came together to support the CAUSE campaign. Fayetteville State University professor Abraham Walker pointed to these ties as a source of strength for the union going forward. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
He noted that in Chattanooga, Tennessee, it took three elections before workers at the city’s Volkswagen plant voted to unionize the facility in 2024. Walker said a benefit of CAUSE’s status as an independent grassroots campaign is that “they’re not going anywhere.” He cited “very strong coalitions” the organizers built across the Research Triangle as a source of structural support that will allow the union to renew its efforts going forward.
“Despite the final tally, I see a lot of promise in CAUSE’s future,” Walker said. “There’s going to be a process of reassessment, I think, going forward. They will in all likelihood try to do this again — it might not be a year, it might be a few years from now, but one of the things about Amazon warehouses, which is both challenging and potentially an advantage, is the turnover’s high.”
The New York Times reported in 2021 that Amazon sees a roughly 150% turnover rate among its hourly associates each year. Medelius said this was a source of difficulty in this year’s election because many of those who signed authorization cards were already gone from the warehouse by February. But that fact can also be turned to the union campaign’s advantage, he said: many, if not most, of the 2,447 who voted against the union will no longer be with at RDU1 in a year’s time, giving organizers “a brand-new warehouse” for its next effort.
“All we’ve gotta do is keep our supporters, make sure that we keep telling them our motto, ‘Don’t quit, organize,’ and that’s the way that we’re going to out-organize them, so the plan right now is keep calling for an election — if we lose, do it again,” Medelius said.
“We’re going to organize as if we had won the election, we’re going to continue building our movement, and we’re gonna continue not just within RDU1, but all across the Carolinas,” he added. “This election hasn’t stopped the train.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P2080246-scaled-e1741104680670-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-10 08:04:14.162335

Capitol News Illinois (CNI), a nonprofit news service, is proud to announce three of its reporters were nominated in four categories for the prestigious Lisagor Awards. These awards celebrate journalistic excellence across Illinois and northwest Indiana, spanning print, digital and broadcast media. CNI's Beth Hundsdorfer was selected as winner in the Best Public Service category for her investigative reporting on funeral home licensing in Illinois.

The winners were announced on Friday, May 9, at the 48th Annual Peter Lisagor Awards ceremony hosted by Chicago Headline Club at the Union League Club of Chicago.

Capitol News Illinois reporters and their nominations include:

Beth Hundsdorfer:
WINNER: Best Public Service
“Funeral Home”
Investigative reporter Beth Hundsdorfer lead an investigation into funeral home licensing in Illinois. This was sparked by news reports of a Carlinville-based funeral home mishandling human remains. The investigation has since expanded to other parts of the state.

Hannah Meisel:
NOMINATED: Best Deadline Reporting (Small or Medium Print/Online Category)
“Corruption trial and bizarre pre-trial arrest of polarizing ex-lawmaker Sam McCann”

In 2021, Springfield-area lawmaker Sam McCann was indicted on charges of fraud, money laundering and tax evasion related to his alleged use of campaign funds for personal expenses. McCann would eventually reverse his position of innocence and in February 2024 plead guilty on all counts.

NOMINATED: Best Reporting on Crime and Justice (Small or Medium Print/Online Category)
“Reporting on the trial of former House Speaker Mike Madigan”

Meisel provided detailed coverage of the corruption trial of ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan from the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in Chicago. The former speaker faced 23 counts of racketeering, bribery, extortion and wire fraud. Jurors convicted him on 10 counts and acquitted him on seven. Six others ended in a mistrial.

Molly Parker & Beth Hundsdorfer:
NOMINATED: Best Education Reporting (Large Print/Online Category)
“No-Schoolers”
Illinois has virtually no regulations on homeschooling, allowing parents to pull vulnerable children from public schools and then not provide any education for them. Officials call them “no schoolers.”  Hundsdorfer and Parker have been investigating the issue for over a year.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State health and labor officials hope that new workplace regulations will help workers avoid overheating on the job, as Maryland enters the annual heat season on the heels of a deadly 2024 summer.
The Maryland Occupational Safety and Health division of the Department of Labor finalized new heat illness prevention standards in September, at the tail end of a 2024 heat season that saw 27 fatalities and more than 1,200 emergency room visits related to high temperatures.
Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said there was already “a general duty to protect workers from dangerous conditions, but I think the heat-stress standard provides some really specific guidance to employers.” She said her department has been educating workplaces to get them “up to speed” on the new regulations ahead of the 2025 season.
“We have done a ton of outreach in both public and private sectors — industries like construction, tree care, warehousing, agriculture, restaurants, commercial kitchens, laundries,” Wu said.
Anticipation for the new regulations rose last year following the death of Ronald Silver II, who died Aug. 2 from a heat-related illness while working at his job with the Baltimore City Department of Public Works’ Bureau of Solid Waste.
The new heat stress prevention regulations require workplaces to have plans when the heat index begins to rise to above 90 and 100 degrees. The new regulations also prompt employers to ensure that workers have ample access to water and cool locations while allowing for frequent break times at high temperatures.
Workplace heat-illness standards finalized as deadly ‘heat season’ comes to an end

Wu admits that the new regulations are somewhat “common sense,” but said that the regulations ensure employers have an established course of action when temperatures rise this summer.
“I tend to think about it as ‘rest, break, shade, ease-in,’” Wu said.
She noted that the state is emphasizing what’s called “acclimatization,” which is a process to help new employees get used to working in hot conditions for up to the first two weeks of employment.
“People who have been working in hot conditions for days, weeks, months on end, their bodies are more used to it,” Wu said. “Somebody who started yesterday and it’s 95 degrees today … they need some time to get used to it.”
“That’s where we see the accidents happen,” Wu said. “We often have a situation where a supervisor may not be experienced in on-boarding new employees — construction is a good example.”
Acclimatization can also apply to experienced workers when temperatures spike suddenly, she said.
Workplace standards can only do so much, since many victims of heat stress may not be on the job – in fact, half of the fatalities from last year were of people aged 65 years and older.
Clifford S. Mitchell, director of the Environmental Health Bureau in the Maryland Department of Health, said that temperatures are trending higher and for longer periods, leaving those who are medically vulnerable more at risk for longer stretches.
“There are earlier hot days, there are more frequent hot days, and there are longer periods of hot days. And more importantly, we are not seeing the same degree of cooling in the evenings that we used to see, because of the greenhouse gas effects,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Because recovery time is also important, one of the things that we are seeing now is people who are in hot environments in the day and are not getting relief at night,” he added. “And that is a problem for people who are vulnerable, particularly those who are vulnerable medically.”
The change in federal administrations may also complicate the state’s efforts to reduce heat-related illnesses, as President Donald Trump (R) and his administration reduce the federal workforce at weather-related agencies.
“We rely very, very much on our federal partners in the National Weather Service and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) for high-quality forecasting, modeling and ability to understand exactly what is happening,” Mitchell said, noting that accurate forecasts help the health department plan and anticipate periods of extreme heat.
From a state perspective, he said the Department of Health will be “better prepared through actions like the new MOSH standards for employers,” which will add “structure and guidance for what to do when things are getting hot.”
“That makes it easier for all of us, because there are more people who are following those guidelines,” Mitchell said.


The 2025 heat season runs roughly from May through the end of September. Already, 22 people have landed in emergency rooms or urgent care, according to the health department’s Heat-related Illness Surveillance Report for the week of April 27 through May 3. The department will release weekly updates during the season on Wednesdays.
Ahead of summer, Mitchell urged Marylanders to adhere to standard heat precautions: take frequent breaks, stay hydrated and act quickly if someone starts showing signs of heat illness.
“If you start to feel your heart racing, if you start to get a little confused, anything that doesn’t feel right, you want to get out of the heat as soon as possible,” he said. He also urged folks to check-in on their neighbors in periods of prolonged heat, and to never leave a child or pet in the car.
“I say it every year, and unfortunately every year we see examples – never, ever leave children or pets in a closed vehicle,” he said. “We see completely preventable deaths in those settings.”
Generally speaking, Mitchell urged that “outdoor workers, student athletes, and everybody” should “take it easy in the heat” this summer.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024_march28_baltimore-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-05-10 08:04:14.162335

But now, huge renewable projects are dead.","Ames Alexander, Floodlight",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/10/even-in-red-america-clean-energy-is-booming-but-now-huge-renewable-projects-are-dead/,"Political uncertainty under Trump has dampened the clean energy market, with nearly $8 billion in projects scrapped or cut back already this year.","This story was originally published by Floodlight.
Renewable energy in the United States has surged to unprecedented levels, with the combined power generated by solar, wind and geothermal more than tripling over the past decade, according to a new report by a network of state environmental groups.
The growth has slashed harmful greenhouse gas emissions, made the nation’s energy system more resilient and prevented thousands of premature deaths from power plant pollution, according to the report by Environment America.
But this progress faces increasing resistance as President Donald Trump in his first 15 weeks in office has begun to dismantle federal policies and spending aimed at slowing climate change.
It’s all happening at a time of heightened concern among environmentalists. Despite an international accord to lower greenhouse gas emissions, the atmosphere now contains record levels of heat-trapping gasses. All 50 states have warmed since the first Earth Day in 1970, according to a new analysis by Climate Central, an independent nonprofit group that researches and disseminates information about climate change and its effects.

Among the highlights of the Environment America report:

The amount of solar energy produced in 2024 — enough to power 28 million homes — was nearly eight times higher than a decade earlier. Solar power production increased 27% from 2023 to 2024.


Wind produced even more energy — enough to power 42 million homes in 2024. The amount of power from wind has more than doubled over the past decade.


Wind, solar and geothermal energy accounted for 19% of all retail sales of electricity last year, according to the federal data used to produce the report.


The amount of utility-scale battery storage in the United States grew 63% from 2023 to 2024 — and a more than 80-fold increase over the past decade.


Nearly 3.3 million electric vehicles were on U.S. roads at the end of 2023 – a 25-fold increase from 2014. The number of electric vehicle charging ports, meanwhile, grew to more than 218,000 at the end of 2024 – six times more than 2015 and a 24% increase from just the year before.

More than 1.5 million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in 2024, an increase of more than 7% over the previous year, according to Argonne National Laboratory. Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles were sold in the United States during the first quarter of 2025 — an 11% increase over the same period last year, Kelley Blue Book data shows.
“The growth of these clean energy technologies is now clearly benefiting people in all 50 states, and they’re really providing the building blocks of a clean energy system free from dirty and inefficient fuels,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, which is led by Environment America. “And the more that we can accelerate the progress that we’ve seen, the better it’ll be for our health and for our environment.” 
Most of the states that have seen the biggest percentage increases in wind, solar and geothermal energy over the past decade are in the South — and most are Republican states, according to a Floodlight analysis of the federal data used in the Environment America report. 
Some of those states, including Mississippi and Alabama, still rank low in the total amount of renewable energy produced. But other right-leaning Southern states, including Florida and North Carolina, now rank above most others in terms of the total renewable energy generated.

Billions in clean-energy projects canceled 
For those concerned about climate change, however, a new analysis points to a more worrisome sign: Almost $8 billion in investments — including 16 large-scale factories and other projects — were canceled, closed or downsized in the first three months of 2025, according to the report by E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for sound environmental policies.
Likely contributing to the cancellations: market uncertainty and the debate in Congress over repealing tax credits and other incentives for clean energy projects. The $7.9 billion in investments withdrawn this year are more than three times the amount canceled over the previous two years, the E2 report notes.
“Clean energy companies still want to invest in America, but uncertainty over Trump administration policies and the future of critical clean energy tax credits are taking a clear toll,” E2 spokesman Michael Timberlake said in a statement.
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s massive climate law, extended renewable energy tax credits until at least 2032. Whether the Republican-controlled Congress will eliminate those tax credits is unclear.
“I think that market certainty has been stripped away for many of these technologies right now, and they’re feeling uneasy,” Neumann said. “And so it’s not surprising to me that we’re seeing a retraction in investment.”

A state education official tempered what he implied were exaggerated claims about investments in public education during a post-legislative tour stop in Pocatello Thursday. 
The Legislature did increase funding this year for public education — but debate over the amount continues between politicians, education stakeholders and the Idaho Department of Education (IDE).  
IDE staff directly countered Rep. Wendy Horman’s touting of $400 million in new public education investments, and watered down Gov. Brad Little’s showcasing of $50 million for rural school facilities. 
Some Idaho education groups concerned with state’s new public schools budgets, operations funding

Gideon Tolman, the IDE’S chief financial officer, did not mention Horman by name, but said claims of a new $400 million investment were “misleading at best.”
Public education’s financial gains were few but appreciated, IDE leaders said, during a 2025 legislative session that had moments ranging from surprising to heartbreaking. From a failed $3 million request for high-needs students to the state’s first private school choice tax credit, the repercussions led to a sense of gloom among the district leaders and superintendents who gathered at Idaho State University for a recap of the session. 
As politicians and educators scramble to craft the narrative over what the session meant for public education, Little held his own press event Thursday, where he said “it’s both our constitutional and our moral obligation to the next generation that we increase funding, and more importantly, have better outcomes for public schools.”

 The debate over Horman and Little’s claims

In a column for EdNews, Horman wrote that “public education received $400 million in new funding.”

That sparked frustration among education stakeholders who said the public schools budget provides no new additional state funding for anything other than pay increases and benefits for school staff, as Clark Corbin of the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
In response, Horman told Corbin that just $100 million in new general fund dollars will go to pay and benefits. The other $300 million is located outside public school budgets in the form of tax cuts and facilities payments sent to districts to pay down levies and bonds. 

IDE staff publicly chimed in Thursday. 
Tolman said there was a $100 million increase for pay and benefits — a fact stakeholders and politicians seem to be able to agree on. 
The other $300 million is not accessible to charter schools, Tolman said. For traditional school districts, this funding is either “very restricted or has been repurposed” — meaning it was already in education coffers, but got moved from one account to another. 
For example, Little has touted a $50 million investment for rural school facilities, a promise he outlined in his state of the state address. 
But that $50 million isn’t as new or accessible as it seems, Tolman said. 
Half of it had been sitting in a facilities cooperative fund, “which has been on the books for about 20 years,” Tolman said. To access it, a district had to run a failed bond or levy, and document a health and safety concern in the building.
Over the 20 years, only two districts have been able to use the fund — Plummer-Worley to build a new school, and Salmon to replace a roof.  School districts that meet those conditions can apply for and receive the funds, but would have to pay back the funds with state dollars they received for paying down bonds and levies, if possible, Tolman said. But, if the money isn’t repaid within 20 years, it will be forgiven. 
The second half of the $50 million comes from a preexisting bond levy equalization fund, which was discontinued in the 2024 session — but the cash remained. So this year, legislators moved those dollars into this new fund. 
That, Tolman said, helps illustrate why the $400 million claim is misleading — “because it’s repurposing funding that either was given to you and taken away and now given back to you, or was already in the account, or that doesn’t apply to charters.”
At a separate event held the same day, hours later, Little touted “an additional $50 million for rural school facilities.”

He also cited $85 million for increased teacher pay, and “additional literacy investments. 
While Little’s claims about public education investments were more modest than Horman’s, he seemed to defend her thinking when asked about the $400 million. “If a district receives money to pay for facilities, pay for maintenance, that’s money they can use elsewhere,” Little said. 
 Denied special education funding puts it at top of list for next year

Facing an $82 million special education funding gap, state superintendent Debbie Critchfield pushed to shore up funding in two ways — a new, student-weighted funding formula and a $3 million funding request for high-needs students. Both failed. 
The fate of the funding formula rewrite — a long sought-after change that legislators have previously pursued, without success — was likely not a shock. 
But IDE staff were “surprised” that the relatively small, $3 million ask “ended up being a fiscal hangup for some,” said Greg Wilson, Critchfield’s chief of staff. “It goes back to how these requests, however minuscule, require a high bar in order to get them across the finish line.”
Wilson said he knew the $3 million “isn’t a lot,” but said it seemed a “reasonable amount to get it through the (legislative) process and get something in place.”
Scott Muir, superintendent of Soda Springs School District, asked IDE leaders why legislators oppose additional special education funding. 
“As we see the rise in special education, and we cannot meet the needs, now we’re going to see advocates and lawyers stepping into the process and school districts are going to suffer for that,” he said. 
Tolman said some legislators are not aware of the $82 million gap between what the federal government provides and what schools need. 
“Other comments we have heard are, ‘Why are you educating special education students at all? Why are they part of the public school system?’” Tolman said. “There is a real lack of understanding or an unwillingness to learn more about the problem.”
“It kind of breaks your heart when you listen to the comments some of the legislators made regarding the students that we not only want to serve but are required federally to serve,” said Spencer Barzee, the IDE’s deputy superintendent for eastern Idaho.
Some legislators were also surprised by the high costs associated with students who might need a one-on-one aide, or who have feeding tubes or are nonverbal, Tolman said, adding that the $400 million in tax cuts may also have made it difficult to approve even small asks.
Wilson said increased special education funding will be a priority in the next legislative session. 
Little said special education funding is also a priority for him. But there’s a caveat — the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education could lead to increased uncertainty, and require a wait-and-see approach, he said.  
Little took a similar tack when addressing private school choice. 
When asked whether he planned to push for more oversight and accountability for the program, and whether he would advocate to keep its $50 million cap in place, Little was noncommittal. 
“We’ll see how the implementation goes,” he said. “We’ll obviously work with our legislative partners for next year. Anything is relative to what the budget looks like next year.” 
“All of those issues will be on the table,” he continued. “But public education will continue to be the top priority.”

(Photo by Getty Images)On Gov.Wes Moore’s desk sits House Bill 1294, which would give predatory, app-based payday lenders a legal green light to exploit Marylanders. If signed into law, it would exempt these lenders from Maryland’s hard-won protections against usury, deceptive practices, and discrimination based on race or sex. The governor should veto this bill.
HB1294 opens a loophole that would allow new, app-based payday lenders to bypass Maryland’s 33% annual interest rate cap. These digital lenders already operate in the state, often illegally, offering small-dollar loans with effective annual interest rates that regularly exceed 100% — way higher than even the most expensive credit cards. The Maryland General Assembly, instead of cracking down on these scofflaw payday lenders, chose to legalize and protect their harmful practices.
Entrenching these extractive companies in Maryland will financially devastate families. These lenders rely on repeat borrowing to make a profit. Borrowers are typically advanced just a small amount, usually less than $100, and charged high fees each time. These fees are sometimes disguised as “tips” or voluntary payments. The goal is to keep borrowers returning again and again.
We’ve seen this playbook before. In 2003, I founded the Mississippi Center for Justice to fight the systemic forces keeping people in poverty. One of our first and longest battles was against storefront payday lenders. These companies blanketed low-income neighborhoods with high-interest loans, trapping people in debt and blocking pathways to economic security.

We saw families struggle to repay one loan, only to be forced to take out another. We watched predatory lenders siphon away financial resources from communities, especially Black communities. These practices helped keep Mississippi at the bottom of nearly every measure of economic health.
Unlike Mississippi, Maryland has historically stood firm against payday lenders. But HB 1294 would unravel that legacy. It establishes a haven for predatory lenders to firmly establish themselves in our state and wreck the finances of our residents. By exempting app-based payday lenders from key consumer protections, the bill makes it more likely Marylanders will get trapped in debt, scammed, or targeted with an unaffordable loan because of the color of their skin.
Data from the Center for Responsible Lending paints a troubling picture. Over 25% of Marylanders using these apps take out 25 or more advances per year. Nearly half use two or more apps simultaneously. These are the same debt-trap patterns we saw with storefront payday lending.
The bill would also shield app-based lenders from Maryland’s ban on misleading or deceptive statements about loan terms. That means they could continue to obscure the true costs of borrowing behind confusing terms and hidden fees, all with the state’s blessing.
Perhaps most alarmingly, the bill exempts these lenders from Maryland’s anti-discrimination laws. That means app-based lenders wouldn’t be held accountable if they discriminated based on race or sex, an especially dangerous move given persistent disparities in access to fair credit.
At a time when federal consumer protections have weakened, especially under the Trump administration, which gutted enforcement at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), state laws are more important than ever. The CFPB has abandoned actions against payday lending apps accused of deception and against mortgage lenders accused of racial discrimination. Without strong state protections, Marylanders will be left vulnerable.
HB1294 lets an industry built on exploiting financial hardship break the rules. Friendly branding and smartphone apps don’t change the underlying business model: pushing borrowers into a cycle of debt.
I’ve seen what happens when predatory lenders are allowed to flourish — how they target vulnerable communities, make false promises, and leave people worse off than before. I’ve been fighting these practices for decades, and I can say with confidence that this legislation would give a free pass for abusive payday lending in Maryland.
Gov. Moore has the opportunity to stand with consumers, protect vulnerable families, and uphold Maryland’s tradition of strong financial protections. He should veto HB1294.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/money-1024x6781692353379-1.jpg,,,2025-05-10 07:00:29.336913

For two years, Ember McCoy has been researching air quality and the gaps in data collection in neighborhoods in Southwest Detroit where mostly Black and Latino residents live. The project, part of McCoy’s doctorate work at University of Michigan, is suddenly at risk.
The National Science Foundation, a major funder across the world for basic research, was ordered by the Trump administration in recent weeks to stop funding and awarding grants.
“I knew that things were happening at the NSF. I knew that future grants were at risk. I think it was more unexpected that they would terminate existing grants,” McCoy said. McCoy, 33, has received $10,000 of a $15,000 grant and was notified April 21 by email that the rest of the grant was in limbo. McCoy is just one of the hundreds of researchers whose work has been targeted as a result of an executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs funded by the federal government.
The Trump administration, across federal agencies, in the past months and weeks has stopped paying out millions of federal dollars for programs and research  linked to environmental justice and racial inequity.
NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan resigned on April 24 amid the most recent round of notices. “I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership,” he said in an email to agency staff obtained by Science magazine.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on April 22, the celebration of Earth Day, that nearly 300 employees who work on environmental justice and civil rights issues would be laid off.


McCoy’s academic advisor said professors and students across campus in Ann Arbor were grappling with uncertainty while trying to continue their work. “We’re kind of in this sort of strange time where so much is happening, but also we don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Shobita Parthasarathy, director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at the University of Michigan.
“The government, of course, isn’t just funding things. It’s also setting priorities,” Pathasarathy said. “And so you know, the private sector isn’t going to obviously do research like this.”
McCoy’s work included interviews with residents about current air monitoring techniques and when and how monitors failed to capture pollutants—including volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide—in their neighborhoods in southwest Detroit. Residents live near several industrial facilities in the area yet air monitors installed by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, which were updated in 2022 after requests from community members, don’t capture the extent of the community’s pollution burden, according to McCoy.


“That area is where there’s over 50 industrial facilities within three miles. … There’s a Marathon Oil facility. There used to be a coal plant,” said McCoy. “Those types of communities exist everywhere.”
She added: “They face really high rates of air pollution, or at least air pollution related health experiences like asthma, cancer or conditions.”
McCoy has worked or studied at University of Michigan since 2015. She said her current research aims to gather data and share information among the affected communities about pollution levels and risk. The email she received “did not say [why the grant was canceled]. It just said that it no longer fit the priorities of the staff,” McCoy said.
She wasn’t totally surprised. Earlier this year, she was startled to find her grant on a list compiled by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas of so-called “Woke DEI” grants.
She later surmised, from reading government websites, that the wording of her application may have been a trigger. She had cited “environmental justice” in her abstract
“It was clear on the FAQ page,” she said. ”They remanded grants that are associated with diversity, equity and inclusion.”
“I know they are keywords that are under scrutiny by the administration and so I imagine that they searched abstracts for those words and those that fit them were on the chopping block,” McCoy said.
Longtime environmental justice advocate Dolores Leonard has known McCoy for years. McCoy worked with residents in the area throughout her undergraduate and masters’ degrees study, Leonard said. “I was devastated for her. Devastated because I understood the amount of work that she had put in, 10 years approximately.”


“I felt her pain,” Leonard said. “Not only her personal pain, but all the work that she did to benefit the community, the people.”
Leonard lives near the Marathon Oil Refinery, an area where 80 percent of the residents are Black, 12 percent are Hispanic and 40 percent live in poverty, according to a Harvard Business School study from 2022.

A resident for nearly 60 years in Detroit, Leonard said she suffers respiratory problems and McCoy has been instrumental in documenting the health risks for people who live near the polluters.“Of all the students I’ve met, I am most proud of Ember,” Leonard said.
McCoy noted that the Trump administration’s actions will likely have a chilling effect on researchers’ efforts. But environmental justice has a long history of perseverance, she said.


“This type of research, this type of activism and organizing around environmental justice has been happening for decades, long before this type of work was properly funded,” she said. “I know [it] will continue.”
McCoy’s advisor said the loss of funding will affect what future generations know about their environments and potential health risks. Funding—and this broadside of federal cuts—will change research tracks for graduate students and curriculums, Parthasarathy said.

She reportedly collected more than $125,000 through the fraud scheme and used the money for luxury purchases, according to Attorney General Liz Murrill.
Priscilla Jackson, 40, of Prairieville was arrested Thursday and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. The Louisiana Bureau of Investigation started a probe in November 2022 after the agency was forwarded fraud allegations from the Louisiana Department of Health. 
An internal LDH audit discovered Jackson had underreported her household income, didn’t disclose she was married and failed to include financial support she received from her husband on her applications for Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits from the state Department of Children and Family Services, the attorney general’s office said.
The money Jackson received from the fraudulent applications totaled more than $107,000 from the health department and $19,665 from DCFS, according to Murrill’s office.
Arrest records the attorney general referenced indicate Jackson’s household bought a Cadillac Escalade for more than $110,000 and paid for a $70,000 pool installation during the time she allegedly obtained the benefits through fraud. Jackson and her children did not qualify for Medicaid from 2018-25, the records also noted.
The felony charges against Jackson include one count each of unauthorized use of SNAP benefits, theft over $25,000 and government benefits fraud.
There was no response to messages sent to two phone numbers listed under Jackson’s address.
Jackson’s bond was set at $100,000. Information was not immediately available on whether she had posted bail.

(AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)When 69-year-old Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost appeared on the main balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica for the first time as Pope Leo XIV on May 8, he was cheered loudly by the huge crowd of pilgrims, tourists, local Catholics and other onlookers who had waited hours for the first sign of white smoke and the official announcement.
As a specialist in Catholic history and ritual, I know how important this moment was for Catholics and others all over the world. A new pope brings with him a sense of excitement often mixed with uncertainty.
But the choice of the College of Cardinals came as a surprise to some. Prevost is the first pope from the United States, and, traditionally, the European-dominated College of Cardinals has had reservations about choosing a cardinal from the U.S. for fear of too much American influence in the church.
So, who is Prevost, and what might have influenced the cardinals’ vote?
 
Early experiences
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Prevost joined a Catholic religious order at the age of 20: the Order of St. Augustine, called Augustinians, founded in the 13th century. Instead of withdrawing from the world in isolated monasteries, members of this order travel as mendicants to aid the poor as well as serve as missionaries and teachers.
Prevost studied theology in the U.S. and Rome, and as a newly ordained priest he spent a year in Peru. After a short return to the U.S. as an official of the Augustinian order in Illinois, he returned to Peru as a seminary professor to teach canon law, the legal structure of the Catholic Church. He would stay in Peru for the next 10 years.
In 1999, he became the prior — that is, the head — of the local Augustinian province in Chicago and was later elected prior of the worldwide Augustinian order. This gave him a truly global experience, since the Augustinians had some 50 communities spread across every continent.
In 2015, Pope Francis appointed him bishop for the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru. In 2019, Francis appointed him a member of several important Vatican dicasteries, or departments, where he became familiar with the central church administration. Most importantly, he served as prefect, or chairman, on the Dicastery for Bishops.
In fact, because of his lengthy pastoral experience in Peru and service at the Vatican, some commentators had noted before Prevost was chosen that if the cardinals were to elect an American pope, it would be him. His service on the Dicastery for Bishops was considered especially important, since members play a key role in selecting new bishops.
 
Global church
During the 20th century, especially after the Second Vatican Council — a series of meetings of the world’s bishops to modernize the church, ending in 1965 — the popes began to name cardinals from other parts of the world that were previously considered to be on the periphery of the Catholic Church.
This led to popes being chosen from outside of Italy for the first time in centuries. Pope St. John Paul II was Polish and the first non-Italian pope since the 16th century. Pope Benedict XVI was another non-Italian, born in Germany, who had served as a Vatican official. Pope Francis was born in South America to parents who were Italian-born immigrants to Argentina.
The College of Cardinals, which had few representatives from other continents until recently, is now much more international. Some 80% of the cardinal electors were named by Francis, many from countries that had never before had a cardinal.
In reviewing his record, the cardinal electors might have taken a number of factors into account. Prevost would be an effective administrator as head of the church and was an expert in church canon law. He had decades of experience doing pastoral work in South America, as well as in North America. And as prior general of the entire Augustinian order, he would likely have traveled widely to visit many of the communities he supervised.
 
Papacy under Leo
The new pope appeared on the Vatican balcony wearing the traditional papal garments: white cassock, short red cape, decorated red and gold stole, and golden cross hanging around his neck. Francis, on the other hand, had appeared dressed in the plain white cassock of a pope.
Certainly, he had not chosen the simplicity of Francis. Was this a sign that he would be more of a traditionalist?
His choice of a papal name, I believe, could indicate a different point of view. Pope Leo XIII wrote a groundbreaking encyclical in 1891, “Rerum Novarum,” subtitled “On Dignity and Labor.” In this he stressed the rights of workers to unionize and criticized the conditions in which they worked and lived. He also championed other rights the ordinary worker deserved from their bosses and from their government.

In his first remarks from the balcony, offering a glimpse into the direction of his papacy, Leo XIV stressed the role of Catholics and the church as peacemakers and bridge-builders, in dialogue with other religious traditions and cultures. His first words were “Peace be with you all,” describing this peace as “a disarmed peace, a disarming peace.” He further urged Catholics to act together “without fear … united with one another … to build bridges” through dialogue and outreach — to bring peace to the world.
He may not follow exactly in Francis’ footsteps, but he will likely continue walking in the same direction.

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Alaska’s state-owned investment bank could get permission to start oil exploration work in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as soon as the third quarter of this year, according to court documents filed Friday in Anchorage.
In a status report on a series of lawsuits seeking to block oil development in the refuge, attorneys representing the U.S. Department of the Interior say the agency intends to issue a new document known as a “record of decision” that would cover oil and gas leases sold by the agency in 2020.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the state’s publicly owned investment bank, was the leading bidder on several oil and gas tracts during that 2020 lease sale.
The Biden administration suspended, then canceled the results of that sale, held in the last days of the first Trump administration, but a U.S. District Court judge overturned that cancellation.
The leases remain suspended, but the status report — and a second one filed by AIDEA attorneys — shows the second Trump administration planning to reverse that suspension and reinstate the leases.
“Federal Defendants indicate that they are considering lifting the suspension, which could result in activities taking place pursuant to the leases in the near future,” wrote attorneys representing the plaintiffs, several environmental and Alaska Native groups that have filed suit to block development. “Given the President’s and Secretary’s direction concerning resource development on the Coastal Plain, lifting the suspension is likely.”
That would clear a path for AIDEA to begin seismic testing and other work necessary before oil drilling. 
On Alaska’s North Slope, most exploration activities take place in winter, when the region’s tundra is frozen and travel is easier. Federal action by this fall could permit work in the winter of 2025-2026.
Attorneys for the federal government and AIDEA have asked the U.S. District Court to place a hold legal on proceedings through Sept. 30. 
Plaintiffs, meanwhile, are asking for a prompt trial, where they will attempt to prove that the federal government acted incorrectly by opening the refuge to oil and gas leasing in 2020.

(National Park Service photo)The Alaska Department of Fish and Game said Friday it will resume its predator control this weekend in Western Alaska, despite a court ruling two days earlier that determined the program remains in violation of the state constitution.
The program, which is using aircraft to kill bears in the area used by the ailing Mulchatna Caribou Herd, will resume on Saturday, the department said in a statement.
In its statement, the Department of Fish and Game said Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin’s decision against issuing a restraining order that was sought by an environmental organization, the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, allows predator control to be carried out, as authorized by the Board of Game in March.
“The court order did not prohibit these activities or invalidate emergency regulations adopted by the Alaska Board of Game on March 27, 2025,” the statement said.
The program is needed to improve calf survival so that the herd size can grow enough to support hunting, the department’s statement said. “During the peak, this herd provided as many as 4,770 caribou for the subsistence needs of more than 48 local communities, as well as hunting opportunities for all Alaskans and nonresidents,” the statement said.
While Rankin declined to issue a restraining order sought by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, she ruled that the need for such an order was moot. Her ruling, issued Wednesday, said the state remained bound by an earlier decision, issued on March 14 by Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi, which found that the program was unconstitutional. The Board of Game’s action two weeks later failed to address the deficiencies that Guidi identified, she said.
The Mulchatna predator control program was initially authorized in 2022. It started in 2023. Through it, 180 bears and 19 wolves have been killed, according to the department.
The program has been carried out during spring and early summer, the time of year when the caribou are giving birth to their calves that department officials say are vulnerable to being killed by bears.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance on Friday before the state announcement already had filed a new application for a restraining order to prevent the startup of this year’s predator control, along with additional information providing evidence that the state was gearing up to kill bears.
Joe Geldhof, an attorney for the alliance, accused the state of violating the judge’s order.
“This is so wrong on so many levels. And it’s now turning into a constitutional fight,” he said late Friday, after the department announced that its predator control will resume.

(File photo/Lex Treinen, Chilkat Valley News)Critics of a mining project that’s long stirred political debate in the Southeast Alaska town of Haines are celebrating an announcement that the development is on the market — just months after its owner acquired it.
A small, Vancouver-based company, American Pacific Mining Corp., assumed full ownership of the Palmer Project late last year. At the time, company executives and major investors touted it as an exciting deal that would provide a clear path forward for the project.
Now, in what mine opponents view as a stunning about-face, American Pacific’s executives are saying they intend to “transact on” the project and focus on advancing another development that the company owns, in Montana. 
The Southeast Alaska project is “outside of our wheelhouse, if we’re completely honest,” American Pacific’s chief executive, Warwick Smith, said in a call with analysts last month. 
The company notified state regulators this spring that it does not intend to do any exploratory drilling this year, marking the first summer the project will sit idle in several years. 
Palmer is now in a “state of transition,” the company said in its notice to the state. American Pacific officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Mineral exploration is a famously speculative industry, and it’s common for deposits to change hands, often several times, before a developer comes in and builds a mine.
But Palmer opponents still say American Pacific’s apparent desire to back away from the project signals a dimming of its potential.
“It’s a remarkable turnaround,” said Gershon Cohen, a longtime Haines resident and clean water advocate who’s concerned about the impacts of mining. “The project appears to be fading away.”
“This is a huge step toward protecting this valley,” he added, noting the Chilkat Valley’s wild salmon runs and huge bald eagle population. 
Other Haines residents have supported the copper and zinc project because it could bring high-paying jobs to the region. Gov. Mike Dunleavy toured the development several years ago. 
For years, Palmer’s owners have been drilling holes and studying its geology to determine whether a mine would be profitable. Some permits face legal challenges from a local tribe and conservation groups, and a mine would require additional permits from the federal government before it could be built.
The apparent setback for one of Alaska’s more advanced exploratory mines comes at a surprising time, when miners around the state are expecting boosts from high metal prices and the Trump administration’s pledges to accelerate resource extraction and permitting. 
Even amid their decision to sell the project, American Pacific executives have been advertising increased copper demand and the Trump administration’s particular focus on Alaska as potential tailwinds for Palmer.
Companies have been trying to advance the project for well over a decade. American Pacific bought a minority stake in the project in 2022. 
Development seemed poised to leap forward a few years ago, when the project had access to the deep pockets of part-owner Dowa Metals and Mining, a Japanese smelting giant. 
Dowa and American Pacific built a camp to house dozens of workers and initially appeared intent on drilling a mile-long tunnel under a glacier to access more ore — a step that observers said could boost the chances that developers would build a mine. 
But the tunnel still hasn’t been built. And Dowa, which spent some $20 million on the project over the past two summers, pulled away last fall, leaving American Pacific with full ownership of the project.
The Canadian company also received $10 million from Dowa, in exchange for an option to buy half the zinc produced at a Palmer mine if one is ever built.

	Palmer sits above the salmon-bearing Chilkat River some 15 miles from the Tlingit village of Klukwan and about 40 miles from Haines.  For years, the project has fueled political division in Haines, a small town renowned for both its rugged beauty and ideological rifts. 
Some residents see a mine as an economic lifeline for the Chilkat Valley’s rural population of 2,500, while others — including the leaders of Klukwan — view it as a threat to the valley’s wild salmon and subsistence culture.
American Pacific has not announced any potential buyers but is in the midst of negotiations, Smith, its chief executive, said on the April call. The company aims to sell the project to a company based in the state. “We think that there are better groups that are more well-suited towards Alaska than we are,” Smith said. 
The company expects to receive about $25 million in a transaction, he added.

NEWARK — Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested Friday and accused of trespassing at an immigration detention center, was released from custody hours after his detainment to cheers from hundreds of supporters.
Baraka, a Democrat, walked out of the federal building where he was being held just before 8 p.m. to the strains of “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” by McFadden & Whitehead blaring through speakers that had been set up by protestors.
The mayor, one of six Democrats running for governor in the June 10 primary, said he “didn’t do anything wrong.” 
“I didn’t know this morning when I woke up that I would be in this facility here, that I would end up incarcerated for something that I believe is my democratic right to show up and speak out against what I think was happening here, a violation of city and state laws,” he said.
He was ordered to be released by U.S. District Court Judge Andre M. Espinosa at roughly 7:30 p.m. Baraka said he was charged with trespassing and will have to appear in court May 15. He said Department of Homeland Security agents treated him “very nicely.”

Baraka’s release capped off a wild day in Newark that started with him and three members of Congress — Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Rob Menendez — appearing in Newark to visit Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed immigration detention center that Baraka has tried to prevent from opening, saying the jail’s owner has not obtained necessary city permits.
Baraka said he was with fire officials Friday attempting to gain entrance to the facility, and videos show he was warned by federal agents that he would be placed under arrest. 
After immigration agents arrested Baraka, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba claimed the mayor was trespassing. McIver and Menendez said Baraka was invited onto the jail’s property before he was arrested.
A scuffle broke out after protestors locked arms to protect Baraka, with Watson Coleman and McIver being pushed by immigration agents, videos show. Menendez was also seen yelling at officers not to arrest the mayor. 
Baraka was walked away by masked agents and plainclothes officers.

The Department of Homeland Security characterized the incident as a “bizarre political stunt.” It claims the House members were “holed up in a guard shack” with protestors while a bus of detainees entered the security gate. It also denied claims that Delaney Hall does not have the proper permitting — allegations at the center of a lawsuit Newark filed against the jail’s owner, Geo Group — and said inspections and fire codes have been cleared.  
Once protestors and officials found out Baraka was being held at an ICE facility on Frelinghuysen Avenue about 10 minutes away from Delaney Hall, the protest moved there — and grew. Hundreds of supporters and immigration activists stood in the pouring rain, relentlessly chanting for hours for federal officials to free the mayor. 
State senators, county commissioners, local council members, and politicos from nearby New York also joined the protest. Meanwhile, statements of support poured in from other Democrats who are also running for governor, while Republicans used it as an opportunity to attack Baraka. Baraka’s campaign also sent out a fundraising text while he was detained. 
During the protest, ICE agents peered through windows of the brick building where Baraka was being held, and a group of six agents stood in the parking lot, keeping watch on the crowd. 
Watson Coleman told reporters that she had been “manhandled” during Baraka’s arrest. And Menendez called it an “act of intimidation” to keep the public from speaking about the Trump administration’s increasing immigration enforcement.
“The fact that they pushed, physically assaulted two female members of Congress, ask yourself if this is the beginning or if they’re going to change course,” Menendez said. “I have no faith that they’re going to change course, but we will continue to speak out against it.”
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said on social media that while he was happy to see Baraka released, “the bottom line is he never should have been detained in the first place.” 
While walking with police officers down Frelinghuysen Avenue after his release, Baraka was asked what his next steps would be.
“See my children,” he said.

(TIm Bommel/Missouri House Communications)Missouri House Republicans unexpectedly refused to allow a vote Friday on a $513 million spending bill for construction projects, citing a desire to control spending for a move that was kept secret from Democrats in the chamber and members of the state Senate.
The move sank funding for major projects around the state, including national guard facilities, Boys and Girls clubs, and community health centers, to name a few. And it could seriously damage relations within the House and between chambers.
Up to the moment the House adjourned without passing the bill, this year’s process for deciding the budget had resembled years in the past where even major disagreements over spending priorities was resolved in time to meet the Constitution’s deadline for passing appropriation bills. 
House and Senate conference committees hammered out the details of the $49.8 billion budget for day-to-day operations over two days of meetings this week. Last year, no public negotiations at all occurred because factional Republican warfare in the Senate delayed spending bills in that chamber.
The major new spending items in the operating bills going to Kehoe’s desk include:

A $300 million increase for the foundation formula, the state’s basic aid program for public schools.
$107 million to revamp the child care payment system so providers receive their money at the beginning of each month for the children enrolled in their center.
$50 million to expand the number of children served by the MOScholars program, which helps parents pay tuition at private and parochial schools.
A state employee pay raise plan based on longevity, with raises up to 10%, plus pay increases for Department of Corrections officers who work in high-security and administrative segregation areas.

Only once, since the early deadline for spending bills was enacted in 1988, have lawmakers failed to pass any of the operating budget bills. Failure to enact those bills means they must meet in special session before the fiscal year begins on July 1.
There is no similar urgency for the construction bill, except for the organizations and agencies planning the projects it would fund. Gov. Mike Kehoe could call a special session to consider construction spending or let the projects wait a year to receive money.
There was no advance notice that the capital projects bill would not receive a vote. The final votes on the 13 operating budget bills came, for the most part, rapid fire. Only the bill that included the $50 million for the MOScholars program received extended debate in the House and it passed by the narrowest margin, 84-55, on a roll call that required 82 votes to pass.
Along with the operating budget bills, three capital appropriation bills were pending when the day began. One bill authorized $171 million for maintenance and repair needs, the second allocated $513 million to new construction and a third bill has $2.6 billion of state and federal tax money to continue projects first included two years ago.
The Senate voted on the capital appropriation bills first as it waited for word that the House had passed several of the operating bills. The Senate voted on each bill as it arrived from the House, sending the entire set to Kehoe’s desk.
The Senate was already adjourned for the day when the House finally debated the maintenance and repair funding and the bill to continue ongoing projects late Friday afternoon, just hours before the constitutional deadline. 
Only when the House itself adjourned without taking up the construction bill was it clear that the bill would die. The Constitution forbids lawmakers to consider spending bills in the final week of their regular session.
 House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton of Noel, left, speaks privately with Majority Leader Alex Riley of Springfield, during debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Noel Republican, said at a news conference that he made the decision after consultation with House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit and Majority Leader Alex Riley of Springfield. He said he did not inform Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican, of his decision. House Democrats said they were not told, either.
It was a purely financial decision, Deaton said. The House-passed budget, he said, projected the state would use about $600 million of what the governor’s budget plan projected will be a $2.5 billion unencumbered general revenue surplus at the end of the current year. Kehoe’s budget used about $1.1 billion of the surplus, but when the operating budget negotiations ended, the projection showed that about $1.6 billion would be spent.
During negotiations on the nearly 600 budget lines with differences between the House and Senate, Hough held the Senate position on more than 350, while the House version was chosen about 185 times. For several dozen, a compromise amount between the chambers was included.
On the majority of lines where differences occurred, the conference committee chose the higher spending amount.
“We had many things in there that we thought were good and worthy of doing and would have liked to have seen done,” Deaton said. “But considering what we spent in the operating (budget), I just felt like we couldn’t move forward at this time.”
The decision to shelve the construction bill was not because the House perceived it had lost in budget negotiations, Patterson said.
“We don’t think about Senate positions and House positions,” he said. “We think about positions from Missouri, I think probably had more to do with we sent them the bill on the 17th and then we received the bill back with about six hours left.”
Lawmakers have one more week before the session ends. There are major bills awaiting final action, including GOP priorities to roll back the abortion rights and the sick leave law approved by voters in November.
Patterson said he didn’t see any reason why refusing to vote on the construction bill would change whether those other bills pass.
“I have nothing but great things to say about how the Senate has been working this year,” he said. “I think they’ll continue to work like that.”
After passing the operating budget, the House recessed and Republicans met in caucus. That is when the decision was made, Deaton said.
“They had great concerns that I would try to be fair to them and not ask them to have to vote on something that they hadn’t had an opportunity to review and have input on,” Deaton said.
 State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, speaks Friday at a news conference about the budget, surrounded by other members of the Democratic caucus (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The action hurts communities across the state that were anticipating projects that ranged from hospitals and new National Guard facilities to major research buildings, said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
“My members and I worked very hard to fund vital services to Missourians in House Bill 19,” Fogle said. “I would like to deliver the promise and the effort that we made. And I know a lot of the majority party feels the same way. Looking through this list, there were members that worked very hard to bring dollars back home to our communities.”
Hough confirmed in an interview with The Independent Friday eventing that he was not informed by Deaton that the bill would not receive a vote.
“Am I frustrated with them taking no action and essentially then killing the (capital improvements) bill? Absolutely.” Hough said. “That’s frustrating for everyone.”
The Independent tracks earmarks — special items added to the budget proposed by Kehoe — and of just over 300 in the budget, 60 were in the capital bill that did not pass. Of those 60, 42 were in the bill when the House approved it.
“Disproportionately, they hurt their own members,” Hough said. “The majority of the things in that bill were added for House members, so that just doesn’t make any sense.”
As proposed by Kehoe, the construction bill used about $139 million of general revenue and about $186 million of federal funds and other money. The projects included $50 million to support a new research reactor at the University of Missouri, $55 million for projects on the State Fairgrounds in Sedalia and $52 million for National Guard facilities.
In the House-passed version, the general revenue was bumped to $216 million and new projects included $20 million for a parking garage adjacent to a convention center in Jefferson City, $11 million for a redevelopment project in Cape Girardeau and $6.8 million for a hospital in Salem. The smallest project added in the House was $60,000 for a county maintenance building in Dallas County.
The Senate accepted all of those projects and added 18 more of its own, with items like $10 million for a community health center in Barry County, $8 million for Boys & Girls Clubs statewide and $1 million for improvements at an airport in Washington County.
Because of the tight timeline for passing budget bills and House rules that make conference meetings impossible when the deadline is near, Hough had anticipated that by keeping everything in the bill when he received it, the House would accept it.
He said at the Wednesday committee meeting that approved it that he had assurances from Deaton that was the case.
“The trust has been eroded with the lack of communication from the House,” Hough said.
Deaton said he had not given Hough any assurance that the package would be acceptable.
“There was never any agreement, and certainly not one that we would just take anything if our insertions were not taken out,” Deaton said.
House Democrats, who had praised Deaton for running a more bipartisan budget process where they received a share of the earmarked items, said the goodwill of that work has been damaged.
“What Rep. Fogle was mentioning,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City, “about having not been clued in that this was on the table for the majority party, is a huge breach of trust between the caucuses.”

Photo by Natalie Williams/VTDiggerThe Rutland school board moved Friday to impose a contract on Rutland City’s teachers, a day after an overwhelming majority of the union’s members voted to strike next week without a deal. The two sides have been negotiating a new teachers’ contract for 18 months. In a Friday afternoon meeting, the Rutland Board of School Commissioners decided to impose terms for this and the next school year on the teachers’ union, the board announced. “The board has a fiduciary responsibility to make a fair contract that is sustainable,” Board Commissioner Charlene Seward told VTDigger Friday morning. “We don’t want taxes to go up, and that’s what will happen. We don’t want to make layoffs. There is not a secret pile of money we are sitting on.”READ MORE





 


Rutland teachers vote to strike

May 8, 2025, 5:43 pmMay 8, 2025, 6:53 pm 



The union’s leadership objected to the school board’s vote, saying in a press release that imposing terms for two years — and not just one — defies Vermont law. They cited a primer of labor law provided by the Vermont Labor Relations Board.Seward said the board released two separate contracts (one for each year) to comply. She added that because Rutland’s voters approved an education budget for the 2025-26 school year, the board believes it can create a contract for that year.The school board and union had been expecting to continue working through the details after school Friday. But the board now says the imposition of contract terms puts an end to those talks.The teachers’ union’s statement said leaders still hope to negotiate and avoid a strike starting May 14. The union posted a photo of their negotiators waiting to begin Friday evening talks with the board, even though the board said the talks would no longer be happening. It is unclear when they will resume.Seward said the board tabled Friday’s talks after not receiving a response from union representatives to an email about timing. “Today(‘s decision not to meet) was not on a contentious basis,” she said. “We definitely want to keep talking, hopefully soon.”The negotiations have exhausted the tools for mediation set out in state law, which concluded with an independent fact finder whose report was delivered to each side last month. For the union, that meant the next step was deciding whether to strike. For the board, it was imposing contract terms for a period of one year. Each tactic is designed to force an agreement. The board’s new terms include a salary increase of 4.8% for the first year and 4% in the second year. It’s a step back down from the offer the board made earlier this week: 5% increases in base salaries for both school years, on the condition that a strike is avoided. They are also offering one additional sick day, rather than the fact finder’s recommended two.The union is asking for larger salary increases to keep teachers’ pay in line with their peers across the state, and in line with a living wage for Rutland. The union has agreed to the terms outlined by the independent fact-finder. The primary dispute comes down to what those salary increases include. The union is asking for a percentage increase over and above the annual step up in wages that would occur each year. The board is offering a percentage increase that includes the step increases. The board’s terms also outline deeper restructuring to these salary grid steps for incoming teachers. “Our hope is that they reverse course,” union president Sue Tanen said in the press release. “Otherwise, we will do what we promised – begin our strike on Wednesday.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rutland school board imposes contract as teachers prepare to strike.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rutland-High-School_Natalie-Williams-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-09 20:05:19.630067

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives has issued messages honoring high school sports teams, Olympic gold medalists, farmers, anniversaries, and even notable animals.
In an unusual move on Friday, it declined to bestow honors on conservative political commentator Suzanne Downing. 
In a 21-17 vote, the House tabled a citation from Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River that praised Downing.
Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, led the vote to turn down the citation. 
“I have not objected to dozens of citations for people who had views strongly opposed to mine … I objected to this citation because there is a long record of outright dishonesty with this particular person, and it’s caustic in our discourse,” he said on the House floor.
When it became clear that there were enough votes to vote down the citation altogether, members who supported Downing asked that it be tabled out of courtesy.
Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, was the lone member of the House’s Republican minority who voted for the tabling motion. 
“I think that was the way to go, to not go down the road of rejecting a citation,” he said.
Downing, who has a background in journalism and Republican politics, founded the website Must Read Alaska in 2016 to spread conservative news and commentary, mostly in support of conservative members of the Alaska Republican Party.
In 2023, she sold the website to Jon Faulkner, a prominent Republican donor and owner of the Land’s End Resort in Homer.
Allard said in a text that Downing deserved the recognition.
“There’s an entire page in the U.S. Congressional Record dedicated to Suzanne Downing and her many extraordinary contributions to the state of Alaska,” Allard said. “She has obviously moved the needle, much to the irritation of a few Democrats. Zack Fields has been the target of some of her criticism over the years, and so naturally he is taking this quite personally. Sad!”
Legislators present on the House floor Friday said they couldn’t recall the last time the House failed to approve a citation for someone. 
In 1994, as an April Fool’s Day joke, a lawmaker submitted a citation praising conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, entitled “Honoring Excellence in Broadcasting.”
Several House members, including multiple Democrats, cosponsored the citation before realizing it was about Limbaugh, then voted it down.
“I’d rather see his very ample butt flossed with barbed wire,” said then-Rep. Joe Sitton, D-Fairbanks, before voting against it.
After Limbaugh’s death, the House did eventually vote to honor him with a citation.
On Monday, Fields noted that he voted for that citation as well as another posthumous honor for conservative radio talk show host Dan Fagan.
“Someone who’s willfully and repeatedly dishonest, I just I’m not going to vote for that, and I don’t think it’s appropriate for the Legislature to commend them for being willfully dishonest,” he said.
While individual legislators have occasionally voted against particular citations, it is extraordinarily unusual for a legislative body to vote them down collectively, even when the person being honored has been convicted of crimes.
In 1994, legislators censured Sen. George Jacko for sexually harassing a legislative page. On Jacko’s last day in office, they passed a citation that praised Jacko for having “a great sense of humor as well as the esteem of his staff and colleagues.”
Former state Rep. Tom Anderson was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the VECO corruption scandal. Last year, after Anderson’s death, the Legislature unanimously passed a citation honoring his life.
Legislative citations have occasionally drawn ire, too.
In 2008, legislators issued a citation praising attorney Wayne Anthony Ross. The following year, they rejected Gov. Sarah Palin’s decision to name him attorney general, marking the first time the Legislature had ever turned down a cabinet appointment.
“The hypocrisy there is quite glaring. I believe they need to be called out on that,” Palin said at the time.

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)Hilcorp has bought out one of the last small independent natural gas operators in the Cook Inlet basin outside of Anchorage — furthering consolidation among the companies that supply urban Alaska with the fuel needed for home heating and electricity generation.
Subsidiaries of Gardes Holdings, a Louisiana-based oil business, had operated the North Fork unit on the Kenai Peninsula — a small development that produces some 2 million cubic feet of gas a day, or a little more than 1% of the demand of Enstar, urban Alaska’s fuel supplier.
Gardes had said it was struggling to raise money to drill new wells, and its subsidiary, Vision Resources, sold its leases to Hilcorp in a transaction approved last week, according to documents posted by the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas. Hilcorp affiliates have also acquired a 7-mile pipeline associated with the North Fork unit.
A Gardes official, Mark Landt, referred questions to Hilcorp.
In a prepared statement, Hilcorp spokesman Matt Shuckerow said the company is looking to drill new wells as soon as this winter.
“Hilcorp is excited about the opportunity to further develop the North Fork Unit — a field that is largely undeveloped but shows potential for new production,” Shuckerow said. “Hilcorp is optimistic about bringing additional natural gas to market to help meet the energy needs of Southcentral Alaska families, homes, and businesses.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) “Shame, shame, shame,” a red-shirted group chanted from a Senate gallery after a full day waiting for senators to debate a bill impacting carbon sequestration pipelines. 
A group of landowners has been pushing lawmakers to take up the issue around property rights for four years. They, along with farmers and union workers in favor of the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, showed up to the Capitol in droves Friday, expecting to hear debate on House File 639. 
After breaking for a closed-door caucus after almost every action on the floor, senators decided to adjourn until Monday, without having debated the eminent domain bill or budgets. 
“You’re disrespecting our time,” a landowner yelled from the gallery following the pound of the gavel.

HF 639 would set requirements for pipeline insurance and permit limits and change the definitions of common carrier in the state to require hazardous liquid pipeline operators prove they will transport commodities owned by shippers not affiliated with the carrier. 
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which was granted eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission in June, would connect to nearly 60 ethanol facilities and stretch around 2,500 across Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska. The pipeline would transport sequestered carbon dioxide from the facilities to  underground storage in North Dakota.
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, proposed a major amendment to the bill in committee, and an additional amendment Friday that removes many parts of the version passed from the House. 
Under Bousselot’s amendment, which must be approved on the floor, projects could seek voluntary easements from outside of the project corridor, which he said would allow them to avoid using eminent domain.

His amendment also requires the project operators to repair damaged land for the lifetime of the project. The Iowa Utilities Commission would have to make a decision on permit applications within one year and members would have to be present at hearings under the amendment, which would apply to all projects seeking eminent domain.
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, proposed a strikethrough amendment Friday that instead added language similar to House File 943, to ban the use of eminent domain for pipelines carrying liquified carbon dioxide. 
“I guess four years and another day is what we will be doing again next Monday,” Sherri Webb, a landowner opposed to the pipeline said following the adjournment. “We’re just gonna have to wait another day, and it’s not right.” 
Farmer support
Farmers and biofuel advocates who gathered in the Capitol rotunda earlier in the day said the carbon sequestration capabilities offered by the pipeline would open the door to expanded biofuel markets, like sustainable aviation fuel. 
A number of farmers were among the more than 1,300 landowners who have already signed easement agreements with Summit. 
Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a signed landowner and corn farmer in O’Brien County, said he signed easement agreements with Summit for nearly three miles of pipeline through his property.
“We need to get this project done for a positive future for not only farmers, but the biofuels industry and good-paying jobs for rural America,” Nieuwenhuis said. 
Farmers pointed to low corn prices from lack of market demand as a strong reason for the pipeline, as it would make it easier for ethanol producers in Iowa to enter the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association earlier this week published a study highlighting the same issue. While the ethanol industry had another good year in 2024, the study said the associated economic effects of biofuels were diminished by the “stagnant” corn market.
“This project, hooking these plants onto it, is going to change and open up markets,” Mark Wigans, a signed landowner and an ethanol plant president, said at the rally. “Agriculture’s in terrible shape right now, and we need change and this is going to give it to us.” 
Also in attendance were members from several union locals, in favor of the pipeline for the construction jobs it would supply.
Other business
The 110-day legislative session was scheduled to end May 2, marking the end to some per diem payments to lawmakers. The failure to bring an eminent domain bill to the Senate floor likely sets back efforts to end the session early next week.
Though the Senate did not vote on the eminent domain bill Friday, lawmakers did approve one measure, House File 856, a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion activities and offices in state agencies and community colleges. The Senate amended the bill to remove private colleges from the measure and returned it to the House. 
The chamber also voted along party lines to confirm three of the governor’s appointees – Cheryl Elsloo to the Iowa State Civil Rights Commission, Christine Hensley to the Iowa Board of Regents and Whitney Smith McIntosh to the state’s Human Rights Board.
However, there were several other measures on the calendar – including budget bills – that were not brought up for debate. Senate File 645, the economic development budget, Senate File 646, the agriculture and natural resources budget and Senate File 647, the education budget were not brought up before the chamber adjourned Friday.
There were amendments filed on these three bills to reflect the budget compromise reached with House Republicans Thursday. While these amendments are spending figures that represent an agreement between House and Senate Republicans, the majority caucuses in both chambers, the Senate would not be able to pass these or other budget bills before getting the support of the 12 GOP senators who pledged to vote against appropriations bills until the eminent domain legislation is brought to the floor.
Most of the spending bills for fiscal year 2026 have not yet been approved in either chamber. The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet Monday, May 12 to discuss four budget bills. The Senate Appropriations Committee also still must hold a meeting to approve standings appropriations bill that includes the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) per-pupil funding for Iowa’s K-12 system, the House priority of $14 million for paraeducator pay, and other various state spending obligations.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)“Generational” April storms that brought historic rainfall and a record number of tornadoes to states in the Central Mississippi river valley like Arkansas were made 40% more likely due to the warming climate, according to a new report from an international coalition of climate researchers.
The analysis, published Thursday by World Weather Attribution, which is housed under Imperial College London, says the rainfall was “the worst ever recorded in this region,” with economic damages estimated between $80 and $90 million across the affected states. The vast majority occurred in Arkansas, which had roughly $78 million in agricultural damages.
Researchers, who analyzed weather data and climate models for the study, told reporters during a briefing Tuesday that it would cost Arkansas farmers $42 million to replant.
Meanwhile, the University of Arkansas System, which was not part of the study, came to similar conclusions. Ryan McGeeney, a communications specialist for the University of Arkansas System’s Division of Agriculture, said they estimated there were roughly $79 million in agricultural damages, mainly as a result of flooding.
The timing of the flooding mitigated the impact, McGeeney said. Winter wheat crops in the affected areas were a total loss, he said, while corn also suffered damage but could be replanted. The soybean crop was rebounding, but the jury was still out on whether the rice crop would be affected, he added.
In the grand scheme of things, McGeeney said, $79 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the economic impact of agriculture as a whole in Arkansas — $24.3 billion.
Bernadette Woods Placky, the chief meteorologist for Climate Central, which participated in the research, credited the National Weather Service for accurate and early warnings that likely saved numerous lives.
“Staff in local National Weather Service offices worked around the clock to provide life-saving information and services,” Woods Placky wrote. “This is an example of how critical these employees are and why recent workforce cuts risk undermining their ability to keep people safe.”
Multiple experts have raised alarms in recent months about proposals to cut funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — of which the NWS is a part — fearing that cuts to NOAA will hamstring the weather office’s ability to make accurate forecasts. 
Many local NWS offices are already understaffed, and a hiring freeze that has been in place since the start of the second Trump administration has left the service unable to hire the specialized technicians needed to repair its radar systems or to fill open forecasting positions.
According to the analysis, the similar extreme rainfall events are “relatively rare, expected to occur in today’s climate only once every 90-240 years.” However, in a cooler climate, the analysis found, “extreme rainfall such as observed would be even rarer.”
“Fossil fuel warming is clearly driving more intense, and increasingly costly, extreme weather across the US,” said Ben Clarke of the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London.
  Storm formation 

The April storm event was significant for a number of reasons, said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist and a weather and climate engagement specialist for Climate Central. Not only was it one of the most intense spring rain events ever recorded for the region; by the end of the day on April 2, the NWS had issued 728 severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings — the third-most ever.
The region saw “relentless” rounds of storms April 3-6, dumping more than a foot of rain on some areas, Winkley said. These persistent storms were part of what is called a mesoscale convective system — a massive storm that is larger than an individual thunderstorm, but smaller than an extratropical cyclone.
While storms in Arkansas and the southeast tend to move west to east, a persistent “ridge” of near-record-high pressure settled east of Arkansas and the other affected states. According to Winkley, this high pressure area forced a low pressure system (thunderstorms, like tropical storms, are often associated with low pressure systems) to stall over Arkansas and the other states instead of continuing to move eastward.
The high pressure ridge caused warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to be drawn into the lower levels of the storm, providing most of the fuel needed for the storms to continue to dump torrential rainfall for days, the analysis found.
The area where the high pressure and low pressure met — the “stalled front” — became the pathway that the rounds of storms travelled along, continually dumping rain on the same area for days because the front was stuck in place, he said.
Meanwhile, researchers said that while the states impacted by the rainfall event were not coastal states, the storm itself was helped along by historically warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which increased the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and drove the storms. 
Arkansas town hit hard by tornado making progress

According to Climate Central, the average temperature in Arkansas last month was 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, compared to its 30-year average. Rainfall, comparatively, was nearly 250% higher than average for the month.
Warmer temperatures and Gulf waters are contributing to more convective available potential energy (CAPE) days where there is sufficient instability and moisture in the atmosphere to spawn severe weather conditions, Winkley said. Northeast Arkansas, where the worst flooding occurred last month, in particular is seeing this trend, he said. 
An increase in CAPE days doesn’t necessarily mean there would be an increase in severe thunderstorms or tornadoes, just that the potential for those storms to form was occurring more frequently.
He did, however, say that when storms did form, they tended to be much more severe.
Arkansas has been hammered by severe weather in recent years. Numerous tornadoes devastated communities in 2023, 2024 and 2025, including in Little Rock, while severe river and flash flooding has occurred on multiple occasions in the last 12 months. June 2023 saw weeks of persistent severe weather, with damaging straight-line winds and hailstorms that dropped hailstones as large as four inches. 
While some federal assistance to respond to last month’s flooding was approved, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is appealing the Trump administration’s denial of assistance for those affected by an earlier round of storms in March. That line of storms spawned multiple violent tornadoes that tore through Cave City and other, smaller towns in the region. 
The denial of federal aid comes as the Trump administration debates eliminating FEMA, which has disbursed billions of federal aid in the wake of natural disasters to affected communities. Meanwhile, the administration announced Thursday that it would stop tracking the costs of the most expensive natural disasters.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas State Library Board members on Friday voted to recommend a 10.39% across-the-board cut in state aid to public libraries in fiscal 2026, which starts July 1.
The recommendation would allow 20 libraries currently ineligible for state funds to receive the money. State Librarian Jennifer Chilcoat presented the proposal as one option for complying with a 2023 state appropriation bill that called for new eligibility criteria to be adopted by July 1, 2024. The current State Library appropriation act now calls for the new rules to be adopted by July 1, but the rulemaking process has been stalled for more than a year.
The board also approved $1,386,177 in fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter state aid payments to currently eligible libraries.
Friday marked the last meeting of the Library Board’s current members, and it will be up to a new seven-member board to decide this summer whether to follow the recommended reduction in funds. The cut is necessary to stay within the State Library’s fiscal 2026 appropriation, Chilcoat said.
Act 903 of 2025 ends the terms of the current board members and requires Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appoint new members in August.
The board’s next quarterly meeting would fall in August, which would also be when the board typically awards the first-quarter state aid payments to eligible libraries.
Current eligibility standards for state aid require public libraries to be supported by a one-mill county or city property tax. Language in the 2023 State Library appropriation bill, and each subsequent year’s appropriation, calls on the board to establish new rules that “allow a public library to adequately demonstrate a source of revenue in lieu of the requirement to maintain a one-mill county or city property tax.”
Chilcoat told board members Friday that her proposal would allow the agency to comply with that language in the absence of the new eligibility rules and stay within its $5,641,919 appropriation for fiscal 2026. The 10.39% cut would be a one-time distribution formula, she said, totaling $5,641,180.
Some Arkansas libraries still waiting new state funding rules now a year overdue

Chilcoat also presented another proposal, which would eliminate the $18,000 awarded to library directors who hold master’s of library science degrees, but said she preferred the across-the-board cut as “more fair” to everyone, especially smaller libraries.
Either proposal would include 20 libraries not currently eligible for state aid, 11 of them in Benton County, where libraries tend to be local and supported by their local governments, Chilcoat said.
Another library on that list is the one in Ash Flat. Republican Sen. John Payton of Wilburn specifically mentioned that library when he proposed adding language to the 2023 State Library appropriation bill to revamp the eligibility rules.
Payton said he wanted to help constituents in Ash Flat, which has a population of just over 1,100 and a library funded by the city government.
“We want [libraries] to receive local support,” Payton told a Joint Budget subcommittee at the time. “We don’t want them dependent on the grants and aid that might come through the State Library system, but it’s impossible for them to pass and maintain one mill if they’re a city of less than 5,000.”
Eligibility for state aid would also allow the Ash Flat Library to apply for state and federal grants it currently cannot access, Terry Hill, chairman of the library’s governing board, told the Advocate.
Five of the board’s seven members attended Friday’s meeting virtually: Chairwoman Deborah Knox of Mountain Home, Jo Ann Campbell of Fort Smith, Pamela Meridith of Cherokee Village, Shari Bales of Hot Springs and Sydney McKenzie of Rogers. Only Lupe Peña de Martinez of Mabelvale attended in person.
The board’s most controversial member, former state senator Jason Rapert, was not present. Rapert, founder of a national Christian organization of state legislators, has repeatedly called for depriving funds to libraries that have “sexually explicit” books where children can see them as well as libraries affiliated with the American Library Association. He’s also called for defunding libraries that sued the state over Act 372 of 2023.
Rapert supported legislative efforts this year to change or eliminate the State Library Board.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMatthew Binginot found joy and belonging at the Governor’s Institutes of Vermont as a high school student attending the summer arts camp there 20 years ago.Binginot, a producer, designer and media creator with a studio in Burlington, said he was lucky to attend the summer arts program that he said was “life changing because I always loved music but it was my first time experiencing music production.” The organization hosts multiple residential summer learning programs at college campuses all over the state in areas ranging from climate science to engineering and serves 600 students annually. But the arts institute is the oldest and expects to welcome about 190 high school students this summer.The arts funding is now gone, said Binginot, who works as the outreach and communications manager for the institute that published a public appeal for donations on Thursday.From local libraries and community theater to summer camps, performing arts and the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, letters from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities announcing federal rollbacks have struck a rude blow to statewide programming.The cuts have a serious impact across Vermont and across the nation, said Susan Evans McClure, executive director of the Vermont Arts Council, who moderated a discussion with a call to action hosted by U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., at the Chandler Center for the Arts in Randolph Friday afternoon.U.S. Rep.

In his first term, President Donald Trump tried to close the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.The loss of critical federal grant funding has left organizations across Vermont reeling since they received the funding termination notices.Affected organizations include Acorn Youth Crafts, the Fletcher Free Library and the Flynn in Burlington, Shelburne Museum, Henry Sheldon Museum in Middlebury, Vermont Works for Women, Vermont Folklife and the Vermont Symphony Orchestra.People visit the grounds of the Shelburne Museum including the Colchester Reef Lighthouse on Aug. 6, 2020. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont Humanities, which relies on federal funding for about 42% of its annual budget, has lost about $800,000 for the rest of the year, according to Executive Director Christopher Kaufman Ilstrup, who represented the organization Friday in Randolph.The group has lost two full-time positions and is revising its budget, looking for other sources and matches for an emergency federal fund that has since emerged, he said.“It’s very discouraging to have this attack happen on federal funding,” he said. “We do know that Vermonters care deeply about the arts and humanities and they are stepping up, but there’s no way to replace that federal funding with resources from within our community, which is why we’re having to change our budget.”Funding for three of the Flynn’s dance performances, two of which have already taken place, has been scrapped, according to the letter they received last week, said Executive Director Jay Wahl, who put out an advocacy appeal on social media soon after.“The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President. Consequently, we are terminating awards that fall outside these new priorities,” the letter he received stated, rescinding $25,000 that supported the 2024-25 season’s October performances of Ballet Hispanic, the April 15 Complexions Contemporary Ballet show, and the upcoming May 27 Agathe and Adrien performance called “N.Ormes.”The nonprofit typically receives between $20,000 and $30,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts annually.“It is alarming to me that our commitment to support dance and the human body in all its forms no longer aligns with the goals of this administration,” Wahl said. “It’s not going to stop our commitment to audiences and artists, that’s just who we are. We’ll just figure it out.”The letter was a complete surprise for Miranda Miller, director of Acorn Youth Arts, based in East Corinth. The $10,000 National Endowment for the Humanities grant it had secured would have helped create a literary arts program for youth in Orange and Washington counties and across Vermont.“We had created our promotional materials and were in the process of sending them out to school principals to recruit youth when we got the notice. So that just sort of stopped everything in our tracks,” she said.The Fletcher Free Library in Burlington in 2020. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAfter a decade of steady support, recipients at the Governor’s Institute were stunned the National Endowment for the Arts rescinded $30,000 that supports its immersive two-week summer arts program. The rollback has caused chaos as officials scramble to find alternate funding, Binginot said.“Terminating federal funding for arts and culture organizations, with little or no notice, has a negative impact on our state’s creative economy and means that Vermonters will have less access to the arts at a time when we need them the most,” Evans McClure said in an email.The Vermont Arts Council has grant funding available, and she encouraged arts organizations to apply.Despite the recent cuts and rollbacks, speakers at the meeting in Randolph remained hopeful and called for public action on the arts and humanities in the face of ongoing threats and defunding by the Trump administration.Leaders of organizations discussed the recent loss of federal funding with a call to action to support the arts and humanities in Vermont at a conversation hosted by U.S. Rep.

Kaufman Ilstrup said he expects to see more opposition to the cutbacks and more organizing for the arts and the humanities in Vermont and beyond.“People are fired up.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — God and religion “may” have a new path into Nebraska’s public schools after the Education Committee on Friday sent a package to the legislative floor that includes a revamped “release time” proposal.
The package’s most controversial part was its inclusion of State Sen. Loren Lippincott’s Legislative Bill 550, which would let students be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework.
Religion in schools
Christian education organization Lifewise Academy, with ties to the populist right, is lobbying for similar bills in conservative-led states nationally. Lippincott has acknowledged the group’s influence on the issue.

He was pleased that the bill made it out of committee Friday with “a few minor changes” and said he hoped lawmakers would give it a chance. Amendments adopted Friday essentially watered it down to existing law.
“We’ll see what happens once it gets on the floor,” said Lippincott, of Central City.
Committee members had battled back and forth for weeks on whether to include Lippincott’s proposal in a bill largely built around Omaha State Sen. Ashlei Spivey’s former LB 440 to boost paid leave for teachers.
Spivey’s bill
The Spivey bill would give teachers up to three weeks of paid leave to deal with significant life events and pay for it using a new payroll fee on teacher salaries to cover the costs of paying long-term substitutes. The fee also would help pay for special education teacher recruitment and retention.
The importance of that underlying bill to teachers, now in LB 306, put the Nebraska State Education Association on the same side as some of the Legislature’s members who want more Christianity in schools. Also part of the deal was the Legislature’s Retirement Systems Committee.

Tim Royers, president of the NSEA, had no immediate comment on the bill’s advancement. He had said earlier Friday that his union was only willing to accept Lippincott’s “release time” bill if allowing students to leave school for religious instruction was optional, not required.
As such, the committee amended Lippincott’s part of the package to change its “shall” language to a “may” on the requirement that schools let students leave. Other changes clarified that they had to leave for at least 42 minutes and that they couldn’t miss core classes.
Proposal aimed at getting more religion in Nebraska schools sidetracks Ed Committee

The three amendments to Lippincott’s proposal are a big reason why the bill secured at least six votes to get out of committee — and might get a seventh. It needed five to advance to the legislative floor.
Republican State Sens. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the chair, Jana Hughes of Seward, the vice chair, Dan Lonowski of Hastings, Glen Meyer of Pender and Rita Sanders of Bellevue all voted to advance the package.
Progressive split
Democratic State Sen. Margo Juarez of South Omaha voted yes as well. The lone no vote came from progressive nonpartisan State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who warned about the door to more religious bills in schools.

Hunt acknowledged that Lippincott’s bill does not change the process for students leaving under current law — parents can sign a kid out for any reason — but the proposal endorses what she called “missionary work.”
She said the organization behind the bill, Lifewise, brings a bus for students and entices them with a popcorn party or other incentives to grow membership. Students left behind feel pressured, she said.
Lonowski said he didn’t see Lifewise getting involved in Nebraska, but that he might be wrong. Hunt said he was wrong. Jesse Vohwinkel, LifeWise Academy’s Vice President of Growth, testified in favor of Lippincott’s bill during its public hearing in February. 
GOP senator calls proposal pragmatic
Lonowski said the bill was pragmatic, as public schools are losing students when families want religion. Murman said it gives parents and school boards “a little bit of cover” to get the programs off the ground.

Juarez said if other religions were not allowed, she would oppose the bill. She noted Satanists have already said they would use provisions of Lippincott’s original bill if it required schools to open doors to groups.
Given the time constraints of budget bills and the likelihood of the education bill facing a filibuster, Speaker John Arch will have to decide whether scheduling the bill is worth the floor time. 
Arch said late Friday that he would need to wait until the bill is officially reported out of committee and he has a chance to review it to determine whether to schedule it. The committee was holding open its vote until Monday to let State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln weigh in.

Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Ashley Hinson, both Republicans, helped introduced the “More Opportunities for Moms to Succeed” (MOMS) Act in the Senate and House respectively, legislation that they said would help provide more services and support for expecting and new mothers.
The legislation would create a grant system for nonprofit entities that provide support and assistance for prenatal and postpartum care, as well as support during early childhood, with a focus on providing funding for support and equipment for prenatal care options in rural areas, including telehealth options.

Grassley said the measure would help encourage and aid parents both before and after the birth of their child.
“Parenthood is a blessing, and it’s critical that women have the support they need during this crucial time,” Grassley said in a statement. “Our legislation would expand access for moms looking for resources and services in their area. I’m proud to be pro-life, pro-mother and pro-family.”
The proposal is similar to the MOMS program approved by the Iowa Legislature and Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2022 that provides funding for maternal care nonprofits that encourage alternatives to abortion. This state program has faced criticism from Democrats and reproductive care advocates who said state money is going to “crisis pregnancy centers,” nonprofit entities that some former patients have said shared inaccurate information and misrepresented themselves as licensed medical providers.
Democrats in U.S. Congress have criticized previous attempts to make a federal MOMS program along similar lines, with a group of female Democratic senators saying in a 2024 statement the proposal would encourage pregnant women “to register their pregnancies with the government in order to push them toward anti-abortion propaganda and dangerous crisis pregnancy centers.”
The 2025 bill is backed by several anti-abortion groups, including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, the March for Life Action, and the National Right to Life Committee, according to a news release by Grassley on the bill.
Hinson said in a statement that she supported the measure as a way to “save moms and babies and help advance a culture of life of America.”
“When a woman finds out she is pregnant, she should be surrounded with resources and support, and feel confident in her access to care,” Hinson said. “I’m proud to co-lead the MOMS Act to help more women choose life, have a healthy pregnancy, and create the foundation for strong families.”
Nunn tours MercyOne Medical Center, promotes protection for Medicaid, SNAP
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, introduced a resolution May 2 that he said will help protect Medicaid and SNAP benefits for some individuals during upcoming budget negotiations.
The proposed “Defending Medicaid and SNAP Resolution” would prohibit consideration of budget reconciliation bills that reduce Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits or enrollment for people age 19 or younger, age 65 or older, pregnant women and individuals with disabilities. The rule would apply to budget reconciliation bills and related amendments and reports during the current term of Congress.
Nunn said this provision would help ensure people in the most need of assistance retain access to these public benefit programs while still allowing Congress to “address abuse, reduce improper payments, and enhance program integrity,” according to a news release on the proposal.
The Iowa Republican said the bill will provide some protections for Iowans receiving assistance through SNAP and Medicaid, but would allow Republicans to move forward with efforts they say will help address fraud and abuse of these public programs.
In a news release on the resolution, Nunn cited two figures — a Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimate that between $233 billion and $521 billion was lost to fraud in programs including Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security between fiscal years 2018 and 2022, and a report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of an improper payment rate of 5.09% for Medicaid in fiscal year 2024 — as evidence that there was a need for Congress to address abuse in these systems.
“Every dollar lost to an improper payment or a criminal scamming the system takes resources away from Iowans who need these programs to put food on the table or access healthcare,” Nunn said in a statement. “The mission we have in front of us in the budget process is to find and eliminate fraud while protecting benefits for those who deserve them. President Trump has endorsed this vision, and I’m proud to fight for it in Congress.”
Nunn, and many other Republicans in Congress, have faced heavy criticism over cuts to federal programs and proposed reductions in federal spending on programs, including Medicaid.
However, Nunn said he supports continuing to provide Medicaid and SNAP for Iowans who are in need. He visited MercyOne Medical Center in Des Moines on May 2 and published a video speaking with Drs. Hijinio Carreon and Mustafa Eldadah at the facility. He said he was committed to making sure funding for these programs was being used in a way that “truly helps those most in need — those families, those with urgent need and those who are vulnerable members of our society, from birth through death.”
Eldadah, a pediatrician at MercyOne, said he serves many families in the Des Moines metro who would not be able access needed services without Medicaid.
“We have many families that rely on Medicaid as their source of medical coverage, and we appreciate that service,” Eldadah said. “And we always feel like those patients cannot be taken care of without that benefit or coverage — so definitely, we appreciate any efforts to maintain that service to our patients.”
Nunn said in a statement his conversations with doctors and patients showed “why defending these critical programs is so important, and how my legislation will ensure D.C. cuts do not impact vulnerable Iowans.”
However, Democrats criticized Nunn, saying this provision will not prevent cuts for Medicaid and SNAP coverage for Iowans. Justin Chermol, a spokesperson with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized the resolution in light of Nunn’s support for Republican budgets.
“If Zach Nunn really wanted to save Medicaid and SNAP, he should have voted ‘NO’ on the Republican budget that cuts both,” Chermol said. “No matter how hard he tries to run away from it, Zach Nunn’s vote to rip away health care and take food off the table of working families will cost him his job next year.”

Crackdown proposed on cross-border bottle redemptions
Ever since Connecticut doubled its refund on bottles and cans to 10 cents last year, beverage distributors have been raising the alarm about a nagging problem: people driving in from out of state with bags full of recyclables seeking a pay day.
Distributors — who collect deposits from stores and handle refunds — say the issue amounts to fraud, with a single truck full of containers purchased without deposits potentially worth up to $150,000.
A proposed solution, Senate Bill 1115, continued its way through the legislature this week with the endorsement of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
The bill would place more reporting requirements on redemption centers, while also offering compensation to distributors who end up paying out more deposits than they take in from the sale of eligible drinks.
Despite the support of the beverage industry, the bill has drawn opposition from redemption center owners who describe its additional reporting requirements as a burden to their business.
The committee passed the bill without any objections on Monday.

Loans for the wrongfully incarcerated
The Senate voted unanimously Wednesday to pass a bill that would require the banking commissioner to report on complaints made against companies that offer loans to individuals who were wrongfully incarcerated, with the expectation of receiving part of a settlement at the end of a lawsuit against the state.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said that some of the stories he’d heard were “horrifying.”
“Historically it’s been pretty easy to convict someone wrongfully but very difficult to make up for that,” he said, adding that he wanted to make sure the state’s money was going to the correct person.
Amanda Wallwin, state policy advocate with the Innocence Project, wrote in testimony on the bill that people who were exonerated and released often find themselves unable to pay for health care, housing or transportation.
Some of those people will take out loans at rates that Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, referred to as “usurious.”
“Certainly in my heart of hearts I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to limit the interest and the terms on these loans to that, that we allow for the highest participants in our marketplace,” said Kissel.

Two AI bills pass to the floor
The Judiciary Committee moved two artificial intelligence bills to the floor on Tuesday afternoon. S.B. 2, proposed by Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, seeks to regulate generative AI including deep fakes, and provide state educational resources.
Sens. John Kissel, R-Enfield, Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven, and Melissa Osborne, D-Simsbury, spoke in opposition to the bill, emphasizing that AI is still a developing technology and legislation could ward off business from Connecticut. Opposition cited the previous reservations of Dan O’Keefe, Gov. Ned Lamont’s chief innovation officer, and compared upcoming changes brought about by AI to the Industrial Revolution. Kissel also spoke of the Trump administration’s policy priority in this area. The bill passed committee 16-6.
S.B. 1484 seeks to prevent the electronic monitoring and algorithmic discrimination of employees. The bill was originally referred to the committee of Labor and Public Employees before passing to the Judiciary Committee. The bill passed committee 13-5.

NAACP Youth Day
Members of the Connecticut NAACP Youth and College Division on Wednesday gathered at the state Capitol for a legislative day, speaking to lawmakers about four bills they want to see passed.
The bills deal with food insecurity, early educator pay, student loan reimbursements and funding for programs for disconnected youth.
Young people from Connecticut colleges, universities and high schools across the state spoke about the bills at the Legislative Office Building and actions they want lawmakers to take to make their futures better. Kellie Taylor, president of the Connecticut NAACP Youth and College, said the desire for a day to interact with legislators came in part from national politics. Members wanted to know their lawmakers, to be able to interact with them.
“So the overall purpose of today was that a lot of youth, especially Black and brown youth, they feel they’re out of touch from legislation,” Taylor said. “With the recent Trump administration, they’ve heard a lot of news. They’re wondering, ‘What can we do?’”

Street takeovers
The Senate voted 35-1 Wednesday to pass a bill putting in further measures and penalties to prevent street takeovers and punish the people who participate.
The bill allows municipalities to destroy all-terrain vehicles, dirt bikes and mini-motorcycles used in street takeovers if the owner doesn’t pick them up within 30 days. It also allows towns and cities to adopt ordinances to fine people participating in street takeovers up to $1,000 for a first violation, $1,500 for a second violation and $2,000 for a third violation, as well as impounding their cars. Participants may also have their licenses suspended for 45 days or revoked after a third offense.
“Turn on the news or you open up some social media, and you see a scene that you would think is out of a movie. People are lighting fires in the middle of the road, and cars are doing doughnuts around the fire,” said Sen. Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven.
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, brought up the provision in the bill that allowed municipalities to destroy ATVs and motor scooters, saying this would prevent them from ending up back in the hands of the perpetrators after being seized.
But Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, said he was concerned someone might steal a vehicle to use in a street takeover, that vehicle might be seized and the true owner never notified. Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said the bill said a city or town had to notify the owner of a vehicle before they were allowed to destroy it.

Transgender athletes in women’s sports
Peyton McNabb of Murphy, North Carolina, stood at the State Capitol on Thursday listing the injuries she received while playing in a high school volleyball game against a transgender athlete: a concussion, brain bleed, permanent whiplash, partial paralysis on the right side, visual impairment and cognitive difficulties.
“ I don’t know if I ever will be the same, and it should have never happened,” she said.
McNabb spoke at a press conference alongside Republican legislators and advocates from groups like the Family Institute of CT and CT Catholic Public Affairs Conference to protest allowing transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports.
Republicans criticized their Democratic counterparts for voting down an amendment in the House of Representatives that would have prohibited transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports in Connecticut.
Also present was Christine Mitchell, a parent whose daughter, Chelsea, competed against transgender athletes as a track and field runner at Canton High School.
“Over the course of Chelsea’s high school career, she had to race against these two boys in nearly every major championship she went to,” Mitchell said, referring to the transgender women who competed in the track meets. “She raced them dozens of times over and over again, and on four occasions, Chelsea was the girl that would’ve had the state championship title if the boys had not been in the race.”
Mitchell and several other parents filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, claiming that the organization’s policy of allowing transgender females to compete in girl’s high school competitions had deprived several girls from winning state level championships or being able to advance to the next stage of competition.
The lawsuit was initially dismissed, but the same judge who originally heard the case later revoked the dismissal, allowing it to proceed. Mitchell said the case is currently in federal court.

(Photo by David Houseknecht/United States Geological Survey)Anchorage financial firm McKinley Alaska Private Investment made an effort to take over the Alaska liquefied natural gas export project — a bid that the state agency leading the development ultimately “tossed aside,” said McKinley’s chief executive, Rob Gillam, in favor of another company.
Gillam wrote to the board members of the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp., or AGDC, in early March. His message said he was seeking an opportunity “to share my firm’s fully funded offer” to acquire a majority of the AGDC subsidiary holding the $44 billion LNG project’s assets, according to a copy of his message obtained by Northern Journal.
In his message, Gillam said that his company spent the past year conducting research on a “potential bid” for the project before being instructed by AGDC in December to “stand down and do no further work on our nearly finished proposal.”
Up until that point, Gillam said, “we were not told of any impending deadline or given any heads-up that the significant time and financial resources my firm was spending in due diligence would be tossed aside and our proposal not even considered by AGDC.”
AGDC subsequently announced that it had reached an agreement with another company, Glenfarne, to take over the project’s development.
A spokesperson for McKinley, Stacia Gillam, declined to comment. A spokesman for AGDC said that the agency had responded to Rob Gillam but declined to share a copy of its message.
“AGDC closely examined all documented and written proposals that we received,” said the AGDC spokesman, Tim Fitzpatrick. “Once Glenfarne stepped forward, interest in the project greatly accelerated. A project of Alaska LNG’s size will have ample opportunity for investors to get involved.”
McKinley is one of Alaska’s few homegrown finance firms. It manages a chunk of the Alaska Permanent Fund’s portfolio, though one of its biggest investments as part of that initiative, in  processing company Peter Pan Seafood, ended catastrophically, with plants sold and shuttered.

Jim Pillen on Friday extended a burn ban for central and western Nebraska for another 10-day period, through midnight on May 20.
The new executive order renews a previous mandate prohibiting permitted burns in central and western Nebraska that was set to end at midnight on May 10. Burns have been prohibited in the affected areas since April 23. A subsequent executive order, on April 29, lifted the ban for eastern Nebraska. Burns remain prohibited where the National Weather Service has issued an active red flag warning.
‘We need Mother Nature’: Pillen enacts burn ban amid raging fire in north-central Nebraska

On May 1, Pillen granted fire chiefs discretion in granting burn permits to irrigation districts to clear vegetation from ditches, which remains in effect. Burning must be supervised on-site by the permitting authority.
The initial burn ban came after a prescribed fire got out of control April 21 in the Plum Creek area near Johnstown in Brown County.
The entire state is in “abnormally dry” to “extreme drought” conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The burn ban runs south along U.S. Highway 81 from the South Dakota border to Highway 92. It then goes west to U.S. Highway 281 and runs south to the Kansas border.
A total of 62 counties are in the burn ban, 10 of which face partial bans (denoted by asterisks): Adams*, Antelope, Arthur, Banner, Blaine, Boone, Box Butte, Boyd, Brown, Buffalo, Cedar*, Chase, Cherry, Cheyenne, Custer, Dawes, Dawson, Deuel, Dundy, Franklin, Frontier, Furnas, Garden, Garfield, Gosper, Grant, Greeley, Hall*, Harlan, Hayes, Hitchcock, Holt, Hooker, Howard*, Kearney, Keith, Keya Paha, Kimball, Knox, Lincoln, Logan, Loup, Madison*, McPherson, Merrick*, Morrill, Nance, Perkins, Phelps, Pierce*, Platte*, Polk*, Red Willow, Rock, Scotts Bluff, Sheridan, Sherman, Sioux, Thomas, Valley, Webster* and Wheeler.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. Senate voted to expand motorized access in Utah’s Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, passing a resolution on Thursday to overturn a Biden-era policy that closed a handful of roads to certain off-road vehicles. 
If signed by President Donald Trump, the resolution would open up some of the more remote regions of the recreation area to dirtbikes, side-by-sides and other off-road vehicles, the latest development in nearly two decades of controversy over motorized access in the area. 
Under the Biden administration’s rule, 25 roads amounting to roughly 26 miles would be off limits to specific vehicles — conventional vehicles like trucks or SUVs are still allowed to travel the routes. 
But specialized off-road vehicles like dirtbikes, ATVs or side-by-sides are restricted. Environmental groups, along with lawmakers opposed to the resolution, say these vehicles have potential to cause severe damage to the region’s most sensitive and pristine environments. Republicans, as well as motorized recreation activists, have called it another example of federal overreach that ignores the will of locals. 
Last week, the U.S. House passed companion legislation sponsored by Utah GOP Rep. Celeste Maloy. Both resolutions state the Biden administration’s rule “shall have no force or effect,” invoking the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn federal rules.

Managed by the National Park Service, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was formed in 1972 and borders multiple national parks and monuments, like Bears Ears, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands. The area’s biggest draw is Lake Powell, the country’s second-largest reservoir, which attracted more than 4.7 million visits in 2025, according to National Park Service data. 
For years, environmental groups have criticized the National Park Service over what they say is a loose regulation of off-road vehicles around the recreation area. And in 2005, groups sued the park service over its lack of enforcement — in 2008, the service settled and agreed to create an off-road vehicle management plan. 
Then in 2021, the first Trump administration released a new plan that opened up much of the recreation area to all kinds of motorized use. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued two years later, arguing the administration’s plan failed to take all of the environmental impacts into consideration — the National Park Service settled again, agreeing to close the Lake Powell shoreline to motorized use, unless water levels were “sustainable” and put restrictions on ATV and side-by-side use in certain areas.
In January, the rule was finalized. It affects a small section of the recreation area, preventing off-road vehicles and ATVs on segments of the Poison Spring Loop and a section of the Flint Trail, remote and challenging, yet popular, motorized routes in the recreation area. About 4,930 acres of shoreline were also covered. 
For members of the Utah congressional delegation, the rule was antithetical to the concept of a recreation area.  
“If it says, ‘National Recreation Area’ on the map, people should be able to recreate there,” said Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in a statement, calling environmentalists’ push for a management plan “a classic case of sue-and-settle policymaking where bureaucrats caved to activists and cut Americans out of the process.”

Sen. John Curtis, also a Republican, said the resolution will help ensure public lands are more accessible. 
“Utahns have responsibly accessed Glen Canyon for decades, and Washington’s one-size-fits-all restrictions threatened not only that access but also the livelihoods and traditions of rural communities. This legislation restores the balance between conservation and responsible recreation — something Utahns have always led on,” Curtis said in a statement. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance pointed out that more than 250 miles of roads within the recreation area still remain open to all vehicles, and the group criticized Republicans for chipping away at National Park Service protections. 
“Congressional Republicans, who have previously said that the National Park Service was immune from their destructive agenda, made it clear: they lied. Led by the Utah delegation, they voted to undermine the Park Service and instead bowed to extreme motorized recreation in some of the most remote and wild parts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area,” said Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for the alliance. “Today’s action means that Orange Cliffs, Gunsight Butte, and Canyonlands National Park’s Maze District will be impaired by noisy, destructive off-highway vehicles. It’s a dark day for all who love Southern Utah and Glen Canyon’s wild places.’’

(Photo courtesy of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman)Democrats seeking the governorship this year quickly condemned fellow candidate Newark Mayor Ras Baraka’s arrest by federal immigration officials Friday, while Republican candidates blasted Baraka’s actions as “shameful” and praised agents for arresting him.
Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said in a statement that Baraka had “committed trespass” at Delaney Hall, a private 1,100-bed immigrant detention center in Newark. Baraka, who alleges the building’s owner opened it without obtaining required city permits first, has been protesting outside the facility this week and making failed attempts to enter and inspect the building.
Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, a Democrat, called the arrest “wrong” and said it sets a “dangerous precedent.”
“Regardless of your views on ICE, the law is the law — and any facility operating in a New Jersey municipality must follow it. If Delaney Hall doesn’t have proper local authorization, Mayor Baraka had every reason to be there, and every right to demand accountability.”
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat, demanded Baraka’s immediate release.
“It’s absurd that he’s being held. As I’ve said before, the Trump Administration should not be using Delaney Hall, a crowded private prison, as an immigrant jail. It’s an environment ripe with mistreatment and abuse,” Gottheimer said.
Baraka is reportedly being held at a separate ICE facility in Newark. On Friday afternoon, dozens of his supporters gathered outside it, chanting for his release.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, in a statement called Baraka’s arrest “an absolute outrage.”
“The Trump administration’s decision to reopen Delaney Hall, a private, for-profit prison to detain immigrants won’t make New Jerseyans safer, and it won’t fix our broken immigration system,” Sherrill said.
Sean Spiller, a Democrat and the president of the statewide teachers union, said he will appear outside Delaney Hall Saturday morning to protest Baraka’s arrest and he called on his opponents to join him.
“What we saw at Delaney Hall goes beyond politics. It’s about right and wrong, and what I saw was wrong. To see Mayor Baraka taken out in cuffs because he wants to see with his own eyes, as the mayor of Newark, the conditions in Delaney Hall, that was wrong,” Spiller said in a video posted to social media.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, said he has always known Baraka to “stand up and fight for what he believes in.”
“Donald Trump’s disregard for the rule of law was on full display this afternoon,” he said. “The Mayor has every right to enforce the laws of his city and should be released immediately.”
There are five Republicans running in the June 10 primary for the party’s nod for governor. Two of them fired their criticism at Baraka.
“In Newark, the airport is in the midst of an unprecedented & dangerous meltdown, the public schools are failing students & families, and there is crime in the streets every day. And yet its Mayor and leading Democrat candidate for Governor,  @rasjbaraka, is busy shilling for illegal Immigrants at an ICE detention center with a cheap publicity stunt. Shameful,” former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli said.
Bill Spadea, a Republican former radio talk show host, thanked Habba for “ensuring that the rule of law can continue.”
“All of the other candidates should join me in condemning Ras Baraka and stand in solidarity with ICE, Tom Homan, Alina Habba and everyone working to enforce the law and end illegal immigration in New Jersey,” Spadea said.
Three Republican candidates — State Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union), former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and contractor Justin Barbera — did not immediately issue statements on Baraka’s arrest.

Bob Ferguson to veto a bill that would limit health insurance reimbursement rates for state workers and public school employees.
The bill is designed to reduce health care costs for the state. But the Washington State Hospital Association says it shifts the burden to care providers and that hospitals could lose around $100 million per year if the change becomes law.
“Just because [the state is] paying less doesn’t mean it costs less to provide the care,” said Ashlen Strong, vice president of government affairs at the association. 
Reducing payments to hospitals for state and school employees would likely increase the cost of care for others because hospitals would negotiate with other insurers to make up the difference, according to the hospital association. If those negotiations aren’t successful, hospitals could look at reducing jobs or services.
Supporters of the policy argue that health care is unaffordable and that this bill would help reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients. They also say that hospitals could lower executive pay before turning to layoffs and service reductions. 
Independent rural hospitals would be exempt under the bill. In Washington, two hospitals were recently found to have negative operating margins in Chelan and Clallam counties, according to reports published by the state auditor in May. 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems were “completely upended,” said Chelene Whiteaker, senior vice president of the association. And with costs for labor, supplies and equipment increasing, hospitals say they have been struggling financially. 
Hospitals would also be subject to higher business and occupation tax rates that the Legislature approved, which would be around $60 million in taxes every year, according to industry estimates.

,DC,2025-05-09 22:47:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump again tries to defund NPR and PBS, sparking a new congressional battle",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-again-tries-defund-npr-and-pbs-sparking-new-congressional-battle-0,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump urged Congress to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting during his first term, but was largely unsuccessful.Now, in his second go-around, Trump is once again asking lawmakers to scrap federal spending on the private, nonprofit corporation that Congress established in the 1960s.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting allocates funding to National Public Radio, or NPR, and the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS, as well as more than 1,500 local radio and television stations throughout the country.Trump’s renewed focus on public media — in his budget proposal, an executive order and an expected rescissions request — has led the organizations that benefit from the CPB to start talking more than they have in recent years about their funding and their journalism.Katherine Maher, president and CEO of NPR, rejected the idea that ending funding for the CPB would have a significant impact on the federal ledger, since the “appropriation for public broadcasting, including NPR and PBS, represents less than 0.0001% of the federal budget.”Maher also opposed what she viewed as the Trump administration seeking to influence journalists and news organizations.“The President's order is an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities,” Maher wrote in a statement. “It is also an affront to the First Amendment rights of station listeners and donors who support independent news and information.”Paula Kerger, CEO and president at PBS, also defended the CBP as well as the news programs that receive its funding.“There’s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,” Kerger said. “This public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.”NPR receives about 1% of its direct funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, while PBS receives about 15%. Those numbers fluctuate for the local stations, which tend to get more, but not all, of their operating budgets from CPB funding.Senate likely to balkHouse Republicans, who have sought to zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in recent appropriations bills, are likely to get on board. But senators, who write broadly bipartisan bills, haven’t taken that step and appear unlikely to do so this year — possibly helping public media resist Trump’s cutback attempts, as it did during his first term.The differences between the House and Senate will lead to heated debate for months to come about future spending on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the dozens of other programs Trump told lawmakers to stop funding in his budget request.Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, ranking member on the panel that funds CPB, told States Newsroom during a brief interview she hopes lawmakers “can effectively fight back against that proposed budget.”“I find that some of my Republican colleagues, especially those from rural states, hear from their constituents that they are reliant on public broadcasting, especially radio for local information, news, etcetera,” Baldwin said. “And there's not a lot of other radio resources out there. But I think the same can be said about the public television offerings.”Opinions among Republicans vary, though.Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, who sits on the spending panel, said funding for CPB “may have made sense at one time, but the American taxpayer has no business spending half a billion dollars a year subsidizing media.”Kennedy said he doesn’t expect rural residents will lose access to local television and radio programming should Congress eliminate the funding.""Rural communities have the same access as everybody else to cable, to streaming, to getting their news off of this thing,"" Kennedy said, pointing to his cell phone. ""It's just an argument by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to hold on to a government subsidy.”Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, pushed back against defunding.She wrote in an op-ed published in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner that while she shares “the desire to reduce government spending, defunding the CPB, and particularly the essential reporting it allows locally owned radio and television stations to provide in Alaska, is not the place to start.”Alaska’s local stations received $12 million last year from CPB, which made up between 30% and 70% of their total budget, in addition to individual donation and state funding, according to the op-ed.“Not only would a large portion of Alaska communities lose their local programming, but warning systems for natural disasters, power outages, boil water advisories, and other alerts would be severely hampered,” Murkowski wrote. “What may seem like a frivolous expense to some has proven to be an invaluable resource that saves lives in Alaska.”CPB has a state-by-state breakdown on its website detailing how much it provided during each of the past six years. The individual profiles show what portion of each state’s funding went to different programs, like the Next Generation Warning System, radio programming, Ready to Learn and Television Community Service Grants.Public media among multiple Trump targetsTrump’s skinny budget request, released last week, calls on Congress to cease funding the CPB as well as dozens of other organizations, including the National Endowment for Democracy and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.The section on CPB says the request is “consistent with the President’s efforts to decrease the size of the Federal Government to enhance accountability, reduce waste, and reduce unnecessary governmental entities.”Trump has also signed an executive order directing the CPB Board of Directors as well as executive departments and agencies to halt funding NPR and PBS.The order stated that the “viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter. What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, wrote in a statement responding to the executive order that Trump didn’t have the authority he was trying to wield.“CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority,” Harrison wrote. “Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.“In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade ‘any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors…’ 47 U.S.C. § 398(c).”There are also several news reports that the Trump administration will send a rescissions request to Capitol Hill, asking lawmakers to pull back funding already approved for CPB. But the Office of Management and Budget hasn’t yet taken that step.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting received steady funding from Congress starting at its founding, before the last Trump administration asked lawmakers to phase out its appropriation.The last Trump administration’s first budget request called on lawmakers to “conduct an orderly closeout” by providing $30 million for CPB that would have gone toward salaries, rent and other costs.The proposal argued that “private fundraising has proven durable, negating the need for continued Federal subsidies.”“Services such as PBS and NPR, which receive funding from the CPB, could make up the shortfall by increasing revenues from corporate sponsors, foundations, and members. In addition, alternatives to PBS and NPR programming have grown substantially since CPB was first established in 1967, greatly reducing the need for publicly funded programming options.”Funding increased despite TrumpCongress didn’t go along with the fiscal 2018 budget request for the CPB, and it wouldn't for the rest of Trump’s first term.In March 2018, lawmakers approved $445 million, followed by the same amount in the next year’s bill. Congress then lifted spending to $465 million in December 2019 and then again just before Trump left office for a total funding level of $475 million.Those allocations continued rising during the Biden administration, reaching a $535 million appropriation in March 2024, the last full-year spending law enacted before Trump returned to the Oval Office. House Republicans did, however, try to phase out funding for CPB during the second half of President Joe Biden’s term. The House GOP provided a two-year advanced appropriation until 2023, when Republicans announced they wanted “the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to compete with other programs in the bill for annual funding.”Those efforts didn’t work and the final spending bill, which became law in March 2024, included funding for CPB.Senate Democrats wrote after negotiating the bipartisan agreement that it “protects funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to support more than 1,500 locally owned TV and radio stations nationwide—rejecting House Republicans’ proposal to zero out funding and weaken Americans’ access to local reporting.“The bill maintains a critical investment of $60 million for digital interconnection and $535 million as a two-year advance appropriation, of which roughly 70% is provided directly to local public TV and radio stations.”Final resolution far offCongress is expected to begin work on its dozen annual appropriations bills sometime this summer, which collectively total about $1.8 trillion and make up about one-third of all federal spending. The House Appropriations Committee will likely propose phasing out CPB funding, or at least its advanced appropriation, in its bill.The Senate Appropriations Committee tends to write more bipartisan bills, so as long as several of the panel’s members advocate for CPB in its funding measure, the program will likely receive its advanced funding in that bill.Final agreement between the House and Senate is supposed to come before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1. But that rarely happens and lawmakers often use a stopgap spending bill to push off final negotiations until mid-December.That’s likely the earliest this year the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and those who rely on it will learn if Congress will reduce or eliminate its funding. That is, unless lawmakers fail to reach agreement on that particular funding bill.Congress would then have to use a stopgap spending bill, which mostly keeps funding levels on autopilot, until it can enact a full-year bill.",,,,2025-05-09 19:04:56.568197

But that’s not the case for the many tourists, from near and from far, who also traverse the halls under the Golden Dome each year.It got us thinking: what do these people, with eyes clear and hearts full, really think about the place? To find out, we turned to a reliable, and highly scientific, source: reviews of the building published on Google Maps.Most visitors seem to have had a great time. With some 160 ratings published as of Friday, the Statehouse scores an average of 4.7 stars out of 5. Many reviewers commend the building’s rich history, forested backdrop and ease of access compared with capitols in other states.“This is one of the coolest places I have ever been to,” wrote one reviewer who, accordingly, afforded the building a full five stars. “Besides the history, we mostly enjoyed the elegant furnishings,” said another five-star rating, which would surely delight the State Curator’s Office.“Very nice place. Have some words for the representatives inside but that’s another matter,” says another five-star review, leaving readers on a tantalizing cliffhanger.Some reviewers seem to have dropped stars from their reviews as a result of situations that, frankly, seem to reflect their own decisions or lack of planning, but not the building itself. “Dropped my ice cream walking up the stairs.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office has received a $100,000 grant to combat human trafficking in Arkansas, he announced Thursday. 
Griffin secured the grant while attending a bipartisan attorney general conference in Rome and Vatican City that was organized by the Attorney General Alliance and focused on fighting human trafficking worldwide, according to a press release from the AG’s office. 
“We are the most effective in our fight against international human trafficking right here in Arkansas when we are maximizing relationships, sharing information and learning best practices,” Griffin said. 
During the trip, which was “at no cost to taxpayers,” Griffin said he met with experts who specialize in “illicit massage parlors” and invited some of them to conduct trainings and share insights in Arkansas. 
Arkansas police announce human trafficking resource in line with governor’s legislative goals

In January 2023, Griffin announced the creation of a statewide group to combat human trafficking called Statewide Tactical Operations Partnership (STOP) that was to be composed of representatives from federal, state and local law enforcement. 
More recently, Griffin announced in January that four suspected human trafficking perpetrators were taken into custody following a statewide raid called “Operation Obscured Vision.” The initiative focused on a dozen “illicit massage parlors” in Jonesboro, Russellville, Hot Springs, Rogers, Harrison and a Little Rock hotel. Officials identified 17 purported trafficking victims who were 29-65 years old, and 16 accepted services from medical staff and advocacy groups that partnered with the operation, Griffin said.
Also in January, just days after the governor cited public safety as one of her priorities for the 2025 legislative session, Arkansas State Police announced a new website that provides human trafficking victims with county-level resources. 
Legislators approved a number of laws related to human trafficking during the legislative session that adjourned Monday, including one that would require information about the National Human Trafficking Hotline to be posted in a nail salon or massage business licensed by the Arkansas Department of Health.
Other new laws create enhanced penalties for recruiting trafficked people from certain places, and require those convicted of violating the Human Trafficking Act of 2013 to pay mandatory restitution to victims, among other things.

This comes just over a week after the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, opened its doors as the largest detention center on the east coast. […]","Newark Mayor Ras Baraka being taken into custody by federal agents at Delaney Hall, an immigrant jail in Newark, on May 9, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman)Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey and one of six Democrats running to be the state’s next governor, was arrested and detained by federal immigration agents Friday, according to his campaign.
This comes just over a week after the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, opened its doors as the largest detention center on the east coast. Baraka, whose city filed a lawsuit challenging whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits before opening, has spent the week protesting outside the jail and attempting to gain entry, to no avail.
A photo taken by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, who was also at Delaney Hall Friday, shows a handcuffed Baraka being led away from the facility in handcuffs. It’s unclear whether he has been charged with any crime. He was taken to a Department of Homeland Security Investigations office on Frelinghuysen Avenue in Newark, said Kabir Moss, a Baraka spokesman.
Acting U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Alina Habba said on social media that Baraka “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center.”
“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,” said Habba.
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in April that she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state ban on local law enforcement assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Under a 2018 attorney general directive, state, county, and local cops are barred from aiding federal agencies in civil immigration arrests or providing access to state or local resources and databases.
In February, private prison firm The GEO Group announced it had secured a 15-year contract with ICE to use Delaney Hall as a 1,100-bed detention center amid ramped-up immigration enforcement. Trump has made mass detention and deportation of immigrants — including some here legally — a pillar of his second term in office.
Delaney Hall, which held immigrant detainees from 2011 to 2017, reopened May 1, despite Newark officials’ attempts to block the opening through the lawsuit. ICE officials have confirmed that detainees are being held there, but have not said how many.
Murphy called Baraka’s arrest unjust and demanded his release. He noted that Baraka was among throngs of people and politicians who have protested outside Delaney Hall in recent months.
“Four years ago, I was proud to sign a law banning private immigration detention centers in New Jersey. And just last week, my Administration was leading the fight to defend that law before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals,” Murphy said in a statement. “Mayor Baraka is an exemplary public servant who has always stood up for our most vulnerable neighbors. I am calling for his immediate release by federal law enforcement.”
About 200 people gathered under the pouring rain outside Delaney Hall late Friday afternoon chanted: “Free Mayor Baraka!” and “No justice, no peace!” Some vowed they would not leave until he is released. The Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Courtesy photo)Right now, the City of Billings MET Transit buses can’t serve nearby Lockwood because of a 1973 law.
Legislation awaiting a decision by Gov. Greg Gianforte would change that, as well as an issue regarding transportation districts highlighted during the past few years in Bozeman. If signed, House Bill 764 would make changes to Montana’s urban transportation districts and bus systems. 
Under current law, transit systems owned by a municipality can’t serve communities outside the city limits. Legislators also used the bill as an opportunity to revisit laws surrounding urban transportation districts.
The new law would open up cities with larger transportation systems — like Billings — to expand their reach outside town. Rusty Logan, an assistant director with the City of Billings who leads MET Transit, said the legislation could potentially lead to new routes.
“It allows the city to more openly negotiate inter-local agreements to provide regional transit service,” said Logan, who is also the president of the Montana Transit Association. “As far as the urban transportation districts goes, the intention of the bill was to make it easier to establish an urban transportation district; and in saying ‘easier,’ just easier to get the vote on the ballot so that the voters could decide.”
Currently, municipal bus routes can’t go further than eight miles from city limits. The bill adds language allowing municipalities to exceed that mileage if funded by another state, federal or non-profit source.
The bill was brought by Rep. Brian Close, a Bozeman Democrat, whose community was part of the reason the legislation was brought in the first place. 
“It’s been 50 years since you looked at these statutes,” Close said during a House hearing on the bill on March 4. “And I think the statutes need just a small amount of reform.”
The 2020 census put the Bozeman population at more than 50,000 people, an important milestone as they were now federally required to create a Metropolitan Planning Organization. It also opens up the city for increased federal funding, including for transportation.
While the Bozeman area already had some transit services run by a non-profit, a new funding structure had to be created in order to continue receiving federal funding. 
Gallatin Valley Urban Transportation District was formed in the wake of the changes to Bozeman’s population. Creation of the district required 20% of all registered voters in the boundaries of the proposed district to sign a petition to get it on the ballot. It was a drawn out process, said Sunshine Ross, who is the transit director at Gallatin Valley Urban Transportation District.
“A lot of effort, a lot of time, but it really did pay off,” Ross said.
Gallatin County voters approved the district, with 79% voting yes. HB 764 will simplify the process by allowing a county commission to put creation of a transportation district directly on the ballot. 
“It eliminates this really onerous threshold,” said Jordan Hess, who is the CEO of Mountain Line and a former city council member in Missoula.
Gallatin Valley was the fifth transportation district in the state, which includes larger cities like Missoula and smaller ones like Glendive, which is served by Dawson Urban Transit.
The bill also gave a clear definition of “direct transportation service,” saying it was 1.5 miles from the nearest route used by “a vehicle that provides general or special service to the public on a regular and continuing basis.”
Clarity was needed in cases where a property owner wanted to get out of the boundaries of the transportation district, which can be used to generate funding through taxes.
“Our board has had to essentially define the term in statute by policy, since it is not defined in statute,” Hess said. “We’re happy to be in a situation. We’re happy to be in an environment where that’s clarified and we’re not having to interpret unclear statutes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/exterior_electric_3.jpg,,,2025-05-09 19:04:56.568197

Senate Democrats opposed the legislation, saying it limits academic freedom and freedom of speech. Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said during debate those restrictions are “completely contradictory to our constitutional mandate and our democratic principles of the United States.”
Echoing previous comments on other DEI-focused legislation, Quirmbach said eliminating the ability for agencies like law enforcement and school districts to use a DEI practice like recruiting from certain communities will have negative consequences, as staff won’t be as well-equipped to understand other cultures.
Sens. Molly Donahue and Sarah Trone Garriott said the legislation would harm higher education institutions working to graduate well-rounded students who are prepared for the workforce and world.
Iowa is a state without enough people to work in it, Trone Garriott said, and DEI programs and practices help keep young people in the state and attract new residents to it.
“Policies like this are already hurting Iowa, and we can see it as employers are struggling to attract workers, and our young people move away and don’t come back, and our colleges and universities are having a very hard time attracting students, and our economic growth is lagging behind other states,” Trone Garriott said. “This is moving in the wrong direction.”
Rozenboom said in closing comments he heard “a lot of fearmongering, a lot of exaggeration, hyperbole and that sort of thing” from those opposing the bill, when in reality what it serves to do is show that state entities “do not exist to promote politically divisive ideologies.”
“I think House File 856 is required because of the directions some have gone, in the extreme, to push DEI initiatives in our state institutions,” Rozenboom said.

Free.,Treasury advises Congress must deal with debt limit before August or face default,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/treasury-advises-congress-must-deal-debt-limit-august-or-face-default,,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department announced Friday that Congress must address the debt limit before August, setting a firm deadline for Republicans to wrap up work on the “big, beautiful bill” that will raise the nation’s borrowing limit by up to $5 trillion.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote in a letter to congressional leaders that “there is a reasonable probability that the federal government's cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted in August while Congress is scheduled to be in recess.“Therefore, I respectfully urge Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July, before its scheduled break, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.”The projection marks the first time the Trump administration has weighed in publicly on when the government will likely reach default since the last suspension expired in January. In the months since then, the Treasury Department has used accounting maneuvers known as extraordinary measures to pay all of the country’s bills in full and on time.Treasury’s projection is similar to a report the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released in March predicting the country would reach default in August or September unless Congress acted before then.Reconciliation packageRepublicans are hoping to lift the debt limit without having to negotiate a bipartisan agreement with Democrats, which is typically how lawmakers have addressed the debt limit during the past couple decades.GOP leaders plan to raise the debt limit by between $4 trillion and $5 trillion in the 11-bill reconciliation package they’re using to address tax law, overhaul higher education aid and cut federal spending.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., expects his chamber will vote on that legislation before the end of May, though Senate leaders haven’t put a timeline on when they’d bring the bill to the floor in that chamber.GOP senators are likely to propose several amendments to the package, and any changes by the Senate would require the bill to get a final sign-off in the House before it could head to President Donald Trump’s desk.The Treasury Department’s projection that a debt limit default will likely take place if no action is taken before August puts a firm deadline on when Republicans will need to reach final agreement.Caution against waitingBessent also cautioned lawmakers against waiting until the last minute to get their work done.“Prior episodes have shown that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can have serious adverse consequences for financial markets, businesses, and the federal government, harm businesses and consumer confidence, and raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers,” he wrote. “A failure to suspend or increase the debt limit would wreak havoc on our financial system and diminish America’s security and global leadership position.”A default on the country’s debt would limit the federal government to spending only the money it has on hand, likely leading to delayed, incomplete, or nonexistent payments on thousands of programs, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, troop pay, veterans benefits and nutrition programs, among many others.It would also lead to a downturn in the global economy with a recession being among the better scenarios.A default is vastly different from a partial government shutdown and would lead to more significant consequences for federal spending and the economy.",,,,2025-05-09 19:04:56.568197

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Two state lawmakers who work in health care want Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s help to ban sugary drinks, candy and “other non-nutritious items” from a nutrition program for low-income people.
Sen. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, and Rep. Taylor Rehfedt, R-Sioux Falls, sent Rhoden a letter this week asking him to seek a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to prohibit families on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) from purchasing the items.
“This policy reform is about promoting healthier outcomes, encouraging smarter choices, and protecting the integrity of a program by ensuring responsible use of taxpayer dollars,” the letter read. “South Dakota should align its policies with common sense and nutritional science.”

At least four other states had asked the USDA to let them ban some foods from the assistance program as of late April: Iowa, Nebraska, Arkansas and Indiana, according to Reuters. President Donald Trump’s administration has called on states to request such waivers, and said it’ll work to approve them in a push to “Make America Healthy Again.”
Forty-one million people nationwide use the program in a typical month. Over 37,600 South Dakota households participated in the program in March, according to the state Department of Social Services, which includes 33,675 children. The average household received $395.38 through the program, costing about $14.9 million in federal funds. States pay for about half of administrative costs.
Critics of the waivers and bans on “unhealthy” food say the restrictions stigmatize low-income people and could create inefficiencies in implementing and tracking the program because states spend more administrative time establishing, monitoring and updating the list of restricted food items. Research from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that increases in monthly SNAP benefits increase nutritious food consumption, such as vegetables and healthy proteins, among participants while reducing food insecurity and fast-food consumption.
Some rural South Dakotans live in areas with limited access to supermarkets, where gas stations fill the void with more expensive but less nutritious food options, according to a 2008 South Dakota State University report on food deserts in the state. At that time, nearly half of South Dakota counties were considered food deserts.
In an emailed statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Rhoden’s spokesperson Josie Harms said the governor is “grateful” for the federal administration’s initiative, but did not say whether he will seek a waiver.
“Our state will continue to review our SNAP eligible items to ensure that nutritious options are available to our families,” Harms said.

Davis said Rhoden’s administration responded to the letter with a request to further discuss how a waiver might be implemented in the state. She hopes to work with the state government and other retailers and stakeholders to walk through the implementation process, identify what items to ban and to hear what the department projects as “additional implementation costs.”
“We shouldn’t let the fears of a difficult implementation stop us from trying to implement good policy,” Davis told South Dakota Searchlight. “At the heart of this request is looking out for the health and betterment of South Dakotans, kids and families that are financially vulnerable.”
As a certified registered nurse anesthetist at the Sanford Vermillion Medical Center, Davis said she’s seen the impact a sugary diet can have on children’s health, which leads to costly health care bills for families — or the government if the children are on Medicaid. For example, she’s anesthetized children for dental work, she said, because of “Mountain Dew put in their baby bottles.”
“Whether or not that Mountain Dew or whatever was purchased with SNAP benefits, it’s hard to say,” Davis said, adding that if the SNAP ban on such items is implemented, “then I guess we’ll know.”
Davis said it’s “not uncommon for government programs to have guardrails in place.” She said she doesn’t know what the timeline would be to request a waiver and implement a ban.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)On the last day of classes for the spring semester, organizers for the New Mexico Stand Up for Science tabled at the University of New Mexico, asking more students to join efforts to protest White House efforts to dismantle funding mechanisms for science research.
“The intent really is to make sure that people don’t lose steam throughout the summer,” said Nina Christie, a post-doctoral researcher studying substance use.
The group is part of a national movement seeking an expansion of research science funding  and reinstating research cuts under anti-diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility.
UNM could face $20 million in lost funding under NIH rule

The cuts, led by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, have impacted billions of dollars in research — including a UNM neuroscience researcher studying impacts of repeated traumatic brain injuries, who spoke at an earlier protest at the New Mexico Legislature.
About two dozen students stopped by over the course of 45 minutes. Some UNM employees also visited, including undergraduate advisors Madison Castiellano-Donovan and Dylan Velez. Velez told Source NM some of the psychology students whom they advise are expressing uncertainty in finding future jobs, wanting to graduate early or “considering switching majors altogether” due to the cuts to higher education.

Matison McCool, a post-doctoral researcher in substance abuse research, said lost funding will close doors for upcoming students.
“Without general training grants in place, without that infrastructure, there simply won’t be pathways to get into science anymore, for people who want to do that,” he said.
McCool said he also hoped the effort to organize will push the university to further protect funding.
“I want to hear concrete steps the administration is going to take and plan on taking to help continue funding researchers who lost their grants, and finding the resources for funding science,” he said.
McCool said the recent 2026 Budget Request from the White House proposes Congress halve the National Science Foundation by more than $4.7 billion, and cut the National Institutes of Health budget by more than $17 billion dollars.
“That will devastate cancer trial research, substance trial use research — that is a fact,” he said. “We cannot fund these studies that are solving these problems, people will die if these studies don’t exist.”
His own five-year research grant hasn’t been impacted yet, but he’s concerned that research will only get more limited, and he worries the grant could be rescinded at any time.
“The hardest part is looking at these White House proposed budgets and thinking ‘I don’t have a job in five years,’” he said. “This may be the only science I ever get to do.”

Patterson/Valley News A Vermont judge has sided with VTDigger and ordered the Vermont Department of Public Safety to release state police audio and video recordings of the arrest more than a year ago of Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos on a drunken driving charge.Judge Timothy Tomasi, presiding in Washington County Superior civil court in Montpelier, where the lawsuit seeking the recordings was filed, issued the decision Friday. Vermont Journalism Trust, VTDigger’s parent organization, filed the lawsuit against the state Department of Public Safety after VTDigger had been denied access by the Vermont State Police to video recordings from Vekos’ arrest in January 2024.Tomasi in his 13-page ruling, granted summary judgment to the Vermont Journalism Trust and denied a summary judgement request from the state Department of Public Safety, effectively ruling in VTDigger’s favor as a matter of law. The judge also stated in his decision that the Vermont Department of Public Safety “shall produce all withheld records to VTDigger within 10 days.”VTDigger submitted a request for the withheld records later Friday afternoon, but did not immediately receive any of the recordings.Adam Silverman, a state police spokesperson, stated in an email Friday afternoon, “The Department of Public Safety is aware of the decision and is in the process of reviewing it.”The news organization’s legal team included Heather Murray and Jared Carter of the Cornell First Amendment Clinic in Ithaca, New York, and attorney Timothy Cornell of Cornell Dolan, P.C in Boston.“Releasing body cam footage promotes transparency and holds officers and the public official arrested in the case responsible for their actions,” Murray said Friday. The state Department of Public Safety was represented by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which is also prosecuting the criminal case against Vekos.The state Department of Public Safety had argued, in part, that releasing the recordings of Vekos’ arrest to the nonprofit news organization ahead of any trial could unfairly impede the state’s attorney’s ability to obtain a fair and impartial jury to hear the case. VTDigger, meanwhile, contended that the withheld recordings should be publicly released pursuant to the state’s Public Records Act.Following extensive briefing and oral arguments in the case, Tomasi ultimately ruled in VTDigger’s favor. “There is no allegation whatsoever to the effect that disclosure will make the selection of a fair and unbiased jury impossible or unreasonably onerous,” Tomasi wrote in his decision. “The videos include the audio and visual aspects to what interested members of the public already know.”Charging documents publicly filed in the case referred in text to the audio and video images captured by the police recordings. Vekos was arrested on the night of Jan. 25, 2024, on the drunken driving charge after she allegedly drove impaired to the scene of a suspicious death investigation in Bridport.According to charging documents, she refused state police requests to perform field sobriety tests or to take a breath test. Also, the documents stated, she would not agree to be photographed or fingerprinted once at the state police barracks in New Haven, where she was processed for the charge of driving under the influence.She has since pleaded not guilty to the charge, which remains pending. A hearing in the case is set for later this month.Vekos has continued to serve as the state’s attorney in Addison County while the case has been pending.David Sleigh, an attorney for Vekos, said Friday afternoon he had “taken no position” on the public records lawsuit.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont judge rules in VTDigger’s favor, orders release of police video and audio of prosecutor’s arrest.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Timothy-Tomasi.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA Colchester man is facing a charge of first-degree murder for allegedly stabbing to death a woman on Thursday afternoon who, he told police, he had met online earlier in the day.Elijah Compagna, 27, pleaded not guilty late Friday morning to the murder charge during his arraignment in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. The woman he was charged with killing was referred to in charging documents only as “Jane Doe.”Police said in a release that the identity of the woman was being withheld pending confirmation of her identification and notification of her relatives. During Friday’s hearing, Judge Timothy Doherty granted the prosecution’s request to hold Compagna without bail pending a further hearing in the case.In addition to the first-degree murder charge, Compagna was also accused of violating his probation stemming from an earlier simple assault conviction. Colchester Police Detective Sgt. Jesse Treier wrote in an affidavit in support of the murder charge that around 5:20 p.m. Thursday police received a call about a woman screaming at a residence on Florence Lane. Officers responding to the residence reported they spoke to Tony Tsiba Kanga and Compagna and one of them said there was a woman inside who needed help, the affidavit stated. Inside a second-story bedroom police found an unresponsive woman with duct tape over her mouth and blood on her neck, Treier wrote. Police also found a “switch knife” on a counter in the bedroom, the charging document stated. A paramedic arrived at the scene and pronounced the woman dead.Kanga told a different Colchester police officer that he was Compagna’s caregiver. “Tony said that Eli is allowed to be alone for up to 30 hours at a time and is considered independent,” the affidavit stated Kanga told that officer. “Tony advised he primarily does Eli’s grocery shopping but Eli cooks his own meals. Tony was not able to tell me the reason he is Eli’s caregiver due to HIPAA reasons.”Ring camera footage showed a woman arriving at the residence at about 4:45 p.m. Thursday, and Kanga told police he heard fighting and banging shortly after 5 p.m., the affidavit stated.Kanga said he ran upstairs to where the noise was coming from but the bedroom door was locked, according to the charging document. “Tony said he ran downstairs to try to get something to open the door and then ran back upstairs to try to get in again,” the affidavit stated, and that Compagna came out of the room soon after. Kanga told police he then texted his wife to call 911 and stayed with Compagna downstairs until police arrived.“Tony advised me that EIi has a violent past but has never been violent towards him,” the charging document stated. According to the affidavit, Kanga had lived at the Florence Lane residence with Compagna since April 11. “Tony reported that Eli has had family members come and pick him up to bring him places but today was the first day that he had anyone over.”Compagna, when later questioned by police, told them his shared living arrangement had been set up by the Howard Center, and Kanga was a shared living provider, the charging document stated. Howard Center, in a statement Friday, said that for the organization “the health, safety, and well-being of our clients, staff, and community are at the heart of our values and are our highest priorities.”The statement added, “We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred in Colchester and recognize the profound impact it has on our community. The organization also said in the statement that due to state and federal privacy statutes they are not able to “share protected health information or identify individuals who have or are receiving services through Howard Center.”Compagna admitted to police that he attacked the woman, striking and stabbing her several times, according to the affidavit. He also reported meeting the woman earlier in the day online, the filing stated.The affidavit also stated Compagna told police, “I did it, it’s wrong,” and “I shouldn’t have done it.” If convicted of the offense, Compagna faces a sentence of 35 years to life in prison.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Colchester man pleads not guilty to first-degree murder in stabbing death of woman.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/costello-courthouse-1-20230725.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

Ned Lamont to cap the amount residents pay for out-of-network medical care is facing strong pushback from providers and hospital administrators who say the bill will result in reduced access for patients, financial burdens for providers and increased leverage for an already-powerful insurance industry.   
The measure, which has received support from health care advocates across the state, would restrict providers from charging more than 240% of Medicare rates for out of network care.
“It’s a way to make sure that you as a patient have a little more control over the cost of these things,” Lamont told reporters following an event at the Capitol on Wednesday, adding that he is open to negotiating. “We’re trying to bring down the overall cost of health care. I thought this was one reasonable way we could do that.” 
Providers say the cap would squeeze revenues for an industry that already faces financial pressures, like rising costs, workforce shortages and inadequate Medicaid reimbursement The measure could lead to closures of physician practices, emergency departments and entire hospitals, as well as make it harder for Connecticut to retain and recruit physicians, said several physicians who spoke out against the proposal during a press conference at the Capitol this week. 
“The result for Connecticut residents will be longer wait times, fewer specialists and reduced access to care,” said Khuram Ghumman, president of the Connecticut State Medical Society. “Make no mistake: These caps do not protect patients.” 
The Connecticut Hospital Association estimated that the cap could lead to more than $700 million annually in reduced payments to hospitals. 
“Hospitals and health systems cannot sustain the robust health care delivery system that Connecticut residents enjoy if they cannot cover their costs,” stated CHA in written testimony opposing the bill. 
Ghumman, a family medicine physician in East Granby, also said the proposal gives even more leverage to an insurance industry “that already undermines patient care by denying treatments, restricting medications and imposing burdensome prior authorizations.” 
Susan Halpin, executive director for the CT Association of Health Plans, supported the cap in written testimony, calling it an “important first step” towards ensuring a balanced and competitive health care landscape. Halpin did, however, request “continued discussion” on whether 240% of Medicare is where the cap should be set. 
The out-of-network cap is one of a handful of legislative efforts by Lamont this session to curb health care costs, which continue to burden families across the country. In Connecticut, total health care expenditures per capita grew 7.8% between 2022 and 2023, more than double the target growth set by the state of 2.9%. 
In 2021, hospital inpatient prices in Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport were 27%, 42% and 43% greater than the national median for hospital inpatient prices in U.S. metro areas, respectively, according to a report by the Office of Health Strategy. In comparison, Boston’s hospital inpatient prices were 9% higher than the national median. 
Lamont has also proposed several provisions aimed at tackling the high cost of prescription drugs, including one that would limit price increases for generic and off-patent drugs to the annual rate of inflation. 
Medicaid reimbursement rates
Some legislators and providers who oppose the out-of-network cap said the state should instead focus on increasing the reimbursement rates that it pays providers to treat Medicaid patients. 
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said that, because the state underpays providers to treat patients with Medicaid, those same providers have to charge private payers higher rates to subsidize the gap. If the state increased Medicaid rates, it might drive costs down for private payers. 
“The first thing the state needs to do is look at where our reimbursement rates are and bring them to where they should be. And that should alleviate some pressure off of our health care system so that private provider rates could come down,” Candelora said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror. 
Legislators and physicians for years have been sounding the alarm that the prevailing reimbursement rates are too low, making it unaffordable for providers to treat patients with Medicaid coverage, thus decreasing access to care for those residents. 
In 2007, Connecticut set the Medicaid reimbursement rates for most physician services at 57.5% of the Medicare rate at the time. The rates have not been broadly adjusted since, meaning many practitioners in the state receive Medicaid payments that are pegged to Medicare rates from 18 years ago — though certain providers, including primary care physicians and OBGYNs, have received rate increases.
In his budget, Lamont proposed an increase of $35.4 million in state funding for Medicaid reimbursement to providers over the FY 2026-2027 biennium. The Appropriations Committee adopted a budget that would add $15.4 million next fiscal year and $30 million in the following. 
A group of Democratic legislators have proposed bringing rates up to at least 75% of Medicare over 3 years, which would require a much more significant increase than either Lamont or the Appropriations Committee has proposed. 
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said she and other legislators on the committee are pushing for the state to invest $30 million in FY 26 and perhaps an additional $50 million in FY 27 to ensure Medicaid rates can meaningfully increase.
“[That funding] gets us on the path of a three year phase-in,” Gilchrest said. 
House Republicans proposed a budget that would invest $137.5 million over the biennium to boost reimbursement rates, a figure Candelora said is based off of a rate study finalized by the Department of Social Services earlier this year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctors-anwar-gordon-presser-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

Rob Perry speaks during the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday, May 8. Photo by Corey McDonaldShawn Burke has been Burlington’s interim chief of police for just over a month. Two weeks into the job, he had to use Narcan, the life-saving treatment that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, for the first time in 10 years.Driving around Orchard Terrace early in the morning, he witnessed a man he thought was sleeping and went to check on him. As he tried to wake him up, Burke realized the man was overdosing and ran back to his vehicle to retrieve a dose of Narcan.“It’s sad,” he said, speaking to a crowded conference room at City Hall Wednesday night. “People have made decisions in life, but I really believe that ultimately, they never envisioned this.”Burke’s experience, recalled during the packed Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting, underscored what has become a new normal in the city of Burlington. At the meeting, more than three dozen people gathered with various city officials to discuss the city’s newly approved plan for an overdose prevention center and, more broadly, the overwhelming substance use crisis that has plagued the city’s downtown core.Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke speaks during the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday. Photo by Corey McDonaldOn April 28, the Burlington City Council unanimously approved preliminary plans for the center, green lighting the project’s planning phase, which is expected to take nine to 12 months. It’s seen by many as a crucial development to curbing the city’s staggering overdose and substance use crisis.“This is a hugely important step on this journey that we’ve been undergoing here as a community,” Council President Ben Traverse said at last week’s council meeting. “I think every one of us has either been directly impacted by the loss of someone to this crisis, or if not us individually, we certainly know someone who has lost a loved one to this crisis.”Now the question becomes where to put it. Finding a location for the center could quickly become a major hurdle.City officials and others close to the project say it makes little sense to site the facility anywhere other than downtown, which officials have called the epicenter of the substance use crisis in Burlington.“This won’t work if it’s not somewhere downtown,” said City Councilor Evan Litwin, who represents Ward 7 — outside the downtown core — before voting on the center’s approval last week. “It’s not going to work if it’s in an area that isn’t accessible and near the folks who need the services.”“All the studies around OPCs that are operating in other parts of the world … (show) it has to be where the activity is,” Central District City Councilor Melo Grant echoed at the neighborhood meeting for Ward 3, which is part of the Central District and includes the downtown core. “The Central District is the epicenter of the epidemic, not only in Burlington, but in Chittenden County and probably Vermont, given the number of incidents,” Grant said.Melo Grant speaks during the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday. Photo by Corey McDonaldBut for downtown residents and property owners, that idea will be a tough sell, and the prospect of locating the center downtown is already facing opposition. Neighbors say that’s in part due to their experiences with existing harm-reduction programs like needle exchanges, where sterile syringes are provided to prevent the spread of disease like HIV or Hepatitis C. There is one run by the Howard Center’s Safe Recovery program on Clarke Street and one run by Vermont CARES on Bank Street.The Ward 3 neighborhood group approved a resolution that “vigorously opposes” the center’s establishment in the downtown core. The resolution calls for the city to place it near a medical facility, instead.“This is for us to draw our line in the sand,” said Zach Cummings, a member of the neighborhood group. “Ward 3 residents and downtown residents cannot take anymore pressure from unaccountable … social services.”‘It can save lives’The idea of an overdose prevention center has been a dream of advocates for years, before newer synthetic drugs like fentanyl and xylazine started mixing into the local drug supply.While fatal overdoses statewide have begun to decline for the first time since 2019, overdose deaths remain well over levels in years past. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that overdose deaths in the state have soared, from 78 in 2015 to 257 in 2023.The idea came closer to a reality last year, when lawmakers established a legal framework and funding needed for the facility. Lawmakers overrode Gov. Phil Scott’s veto in June to pass that law.The bill allocated $1.1 million from settlements with pharmaceutical companies that produced and sold opioids to fund the center in fiscal year 2025. The bill’s language also states that the funding for the project should continue to be available through at least 2028.The center will be operated in partnership with Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform, a Burlington-based provider of harm-reduction treatment and recovery services. Visitors will be allowed to smoke or inject pre-obtained illegal substances there while being observed by trained staff equipped to respond to overdoses and other emergencies. Sterile syringes will be kept in-house at the overdose prevention center for people to access.“Somebody is there, physically present, able to reverse an overdose,” Tom Dalton, the group’s executive director, said in an interview. “That’s part of what excites me, is knowing that people are going to have an option that can help them survive.”The center will also host a number of other services, said Theresa Vezina, the city’s special assistant on overdose prevention center implementation, including wound care and other medical services and substance use treatment options. Case managers will be on hand to direct those utilizing the center to mental health services, housing support and other social services, she said.Vezina said the goal is to eventually have food, showers and laundry available, to create a place that can function as a one-stop shop for harm-reduction and treatment services.“We know that this can make a difference,” she said. “It can save lives.”Theresa Vezina speaks at the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday, May 8, 2025. Photo by Corey McDonaldBut concerns and questions remain about its location, which will need City Council approval. Litwin said he expects it to be “a tough conversation.”“There is not necessarily going to be broad agreement on the council about where to put it,” he said in an interview. “I also think we’re going to run into NIMBYism. I think some of that NIMBYism will be misplaced, and some of it will be very well placed.”‘We already have crime’The question of location, and community opposition to its placement downtown, represents perhaps the last major roadblock to the center’s opening.Vezina, at the neighborhood meeting, said the new law requires the city to conduct a comprehensive service assessment for its location, with a robust public engagement process before any site decision is made.While Vezina anticipates the center will eventually be placed somewhere downtown, she said city officials are still months away from finding a location. A major part of the planning phase, she said, will be finding a suitable building that can be retrofitted to meet the needs of the center.She told residents that the city would prioritize engaging with the community, and noted “past mistakes” the city has made, referring to the process for locating an emergency shelter on Elmwood Avenue, known as the “pods.”“Public discourse is going to be really important,” she said. “We don’t all have to agree. I think that there are absolutely concerns that people have that are valid. We want to make sure that we are hearing your concerns, otherwise we won’t be able to address them.”Residents at the neighborhood meeting, however, pointed to Clarke Street, where “things have gotten worse,” Amy Kimmel, who owns property on the residential block with her partner Rob Perry, wrote in an email to city councilors. “There is constant loitering and open drug use on the Howard Center property everyday, throughout the day.”Perry said neighbors have been at a loggerhead with the Howard Center for months over what they describe as negligence. The Howard Center has not prevented bad behavior from spilling out onto neighboring properties, nor has the center reined in syringe litter in the neighborhood, Perry said.Perry has since garnered more than 200 signatures on a petition calling for the removal of the needle distribution program from Clarke Street.“You talk about the drug user being the only victim,” Perry said to Burke at the Ward 3 meeting Wednesday night. “I don’t think that’s true. I think the neighborhood, the people who are around, are also victims of very clear abuse.”The organization has operated the needle exchange program on Clarke Street for more than 20 years, “playing a vital role in advancing public health,” said Mike Glod, a senior development and communications director with the Howard Center, in a written response to VTDigger.Glod said the site has seen a significant rise in need in the past two years and acknowledged the site has “has not been immune” to the quality of life issues, an “unfortunate reflection of the broader crisis gripping our city.”He added that the Howard Center is committed to being a good neighbor and said they were taking steps “to safeguard both those seeking our services and the surrounding neighborhood.”The situation on Clarke Street has drawn criticism from city officials, including both councilors Litwin and Grant.The Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday, May 8, 2025. Photo by Corey McDonaldLitwin, who commissioned a Board of Health report that calls for enhanced efforts to collect syringe litter, said, “If they’re not going to be able to operate by a standard of being a good neighbor, I don’t know how long they can operate there.”Grant, the Central District councilor, in an interview, agreed that the Howard Center should be doing more to prevent issues on the block that affect neighbors’ quality of life.“As a provider, they need to move people along,” she said. “Things like shopping carts and things like that, that’s not OK. As a provider, you need to take more responsibility for that space.”But Grant noted removing the program would lead to an even more devastating health emergency. Syringe service programs have been shown to prevent the spread of diseases like HIV or Hepatitis C, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Drawing similarities to the debate over the overdose prevention center, she also pushed back against the logic that the needle exchange is causing the problem, rather than the drug epidemic itself.“This idea that we’re going to have more crime — we already have crime,” Grant said in an interview. “We already have quality of life issues that already exist. The idea that this will make it worse is simply not true.”‘Expectation setting’Vezina stressed in an interview the importance of following research when searching for a location.“We all know there are going to be community concerns, but we’re going to be following the data,” she said. “We’re going to be utilizing the hot spot data about where overdoses are happening.”City officials have offered the prevention center as a solution not just to the overdose crisis, but also to broader issues such as syringe litter, the strain on the city’s emergency services, as well as on harm-reduction service providers.“I don’t think anybody wants to stand up an overdose prevention center in their community, because at the end of the day, it means we have a serious overdose problem,” Litwin said. “But what I have tried to impress upon people is that they will benefit from this in many ways.”Vezina said issues raised by residents could be addressed by the new facility.“Some of these behaviors and things that are happening at other service providers’ locations, hopefully they won’t happen there anymore, because there will be an OPC,” she said.That may not be convincing enough for residents. Christopher Haessly, a downtown resident and member of the Ward 3 neighborhood group, said the resolution the group passed Wednesday “seeks to strike a balance between those in favor of the OPC and those opposed.”While he understands the importance and need for the overdose prevention center, Haessly said a downtown location will “adversely impact the Church Street Marketplace.”READ MORE

During the meeting, Elmwood Avenue resident Trudy Richmond asked Burke for his thoughts on putting “that shoot-up site” downtown “that’s going to draw more people, unsavory folks to our area.”Burke said there are “a lot of friction points here in Burlington because we are the hub for all the social services, regardless of what neighborhood we might be in.”“If we’re going to incentivize and resource folks for success, what in turn should the community expect from the people?” he said. “That’s a bigger question than location, and more about expectation setting.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington’s overdose prevention center has City Council approval.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Lansing) speaks to reporters in Lansing following Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's State of the State address on Jan. 24, 2024. (Photo by Andrew Roth)U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin says legislation she co-sponsored seeks to prevent President Donald Trump from “lining his pockets” with money from cryptocurrency assets.
The End Crypto Corruption Act would prohibit the president, vice president, senior executive branch officials, members of Congress, and their immediate families from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets. That includes cryptocurrencies, which are traded on peer-to-peer networks and exist outside of traditional financial institutions, not overseen by third parties or government regulators.
The legislation comes after Trump launched his own meme coin cryptocurrency in January, and plans to hold an event May 22 at his golf club in Virginia for more than 200 of the largest investors, with the 25 highest holders gaining admission for a private reception. Bloomberg reports the majority of those top holders used foreign exchanges that bar users from the United States, “suggesting many purchasers are based abroad.”
“To be honest, I don’t even think that this should be a partisan issue,” Slotkin told the Michigan Advance. “No matter who the president is, they shouldn’t be allowed to create a marketplace and what amounts to direct payments to the president and his family.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Slotkin, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, says it is an unprecedented situation.
“You’re talking about folks with foreign interests, foreign businesses, foreign assets, buying themselves a seat close to the president. You’re not just talking about him lining his pockets, you’re talking about the threat of foreign influence on the president of the United States,” Slotkin said.
Trump has said through a White House spokesperson that his children are managing his assets through a trust, so there is no conflict for him.
Introduced Wednesday, the legislation only has Democratic sponsors, and Slotkin says even in a GOP-controlled Senate, bills like this should find at least some support from across the aisle.
But to date they have not.
“I have not seen that type of behavior from my Republican colleagues in the hundred-plus days we’ve been in this Senate,” Slotkin said. “I think [Alaska’s Republican U.S. Sen.] Lisa Murkowski said the quiet part out loud, that they’re scared of [Trump] putting a spotlight on them, and I think it’s up to the Democrats to highlight these issues of corruption at the highest levels.”
Slotkin said while there does seem to be bipartisan interest in creating some form of regulation to cryptocurrencies in general, the End Crypto Corruption Act needs to be a priority.
“We’ve got a more immediate crocodile closer to the boat, and that’s the president of the United States, selling his own currency and marketing his own currency and using it as a form of payment to line his pockets,” Slotkin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AMR_0302-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

“Sixth generation Iowan David Barker has a proven 40-year track record as a successful entrepreneur and led the fight on the Iowa Board of Regents to undo restrictive COVID-19 mandates on students,” Ernst said in the release.
Barker, who has served on the board of regents since 2019, was confirmed by the Iowa Senate to continue his tenure on the board in late April. His term is set to expire in 2031.
He also works as a partner in Barker Companies, which oversees and develops real estate, and was previously an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to his board of regents biography.
In response to whether Barker is planning to step down from the board, board of regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said in an email he is still a member. Sherry Bates, president of the board of regents, congratulated Barker for the nomination in a statement.
“He will bring his tremendous knowledge, expertise and passion to that role,” Bates said. “It’s great that a fellow Iowan has been selected for this position, and we wish him well.”

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.

“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.

– Kelsey Morgan, EverFree CEO and co-founder


A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.

In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.

Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

Lobbyists reported spending nearly $1 million so far in 2025, the highest total in at least five years even though the year is far from over.
State law requires lobbyists to disclose their expenditures by May 7 of this year, covering the period including the 2025 legislative session. Lobbyists must disclose costs for things like meals, entertainment, advertisements or other items of value they procure to influence lawmakers. 
As of Friday morning, about 70 of roughly 665 registered New Mexico lobbyists had not yet filed their legally required disclosures, according to Alex Curtas, spokesperson for the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office.
So far this year, lobbyists spent a little more than $965,000, according to the latest filings. They are required to disclose expenditures again in October and then in January 2026. 
The biggest spender, by far, this year was Missi Currier, CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. According to her latest spending report, she paid the McGuire Woods Consulting firm for multiple campaigns against various “anti-industry” bills, often costing several thousands dollars at a time. She also disclosed a $166,000 payment to a consulting firm for a paid advertisement campaign. 
NM Governor nixes new license plates, state bread, lobbying disclosure

In total, according to Secretary of State records, Currier paid more than $360,000 to influence lawmakers this year. That’s more than one-third of the total lobbyist spending so far this year. 
Notably, Currier voluntarily disclosed some of the bill numbers she was lobbying against during the 60-day legislative session. 
They are House Bill 34, which would have required new environmental and health reviews to the state Oil Conservation Division’s review process; Senate Bill 48, which creates a community benefit fund to tackle climate change; House Bill 35, which would prohibit oil and gas operations within a mile of schools; and Senate Bill 4, the Clear Horizons Act.
All but Senate Bill 48 failed in the Legislature. 
Lawmakers this year tried to enact requirements for lobbyists to disclose what bills they were lobbying on, along with their employers’ positions on those bills. National government transparency group Open Secrets recently ranked New Mexico near the bottom of the list nationally when it comes to lobbyist transparency.
60 days later, Cicero Institute’s reason for NM lobbying still hidden from public

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier this year vetoed House Bill 143, the lobbyist disclosure bill. She wrote that, while she supported the bill’s intent, it would impose “an onerous requirement” on lobbyists and their employers and that some of its provisions were unclear. 
Without the requirement, much of the spending disclosed this week was categorized with vague descriptions such as “dinner for lawmakers,” or “lunch for Governor’s staff.”
New Mexico law also does not require lobbyists to disclose how much they’re being paid. That means that, even as the number of disclosed lobbyist spending is increasing, it’s still just the “tip of the iceberg,” said Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-NM), a cosponsor of the lobbyist disclosure bill. 
“As eye popping as those numbers may be,” Steinborn told Source NM on Friday, “I would submit it dwarfs what is being spent to hire the lobbyists themselves.”
Mason Graham, spokesperson for good government group Common Cause, said the increase in lobbyist spending is disturbing given how little lobbyists are required to disclose and also reflects the sheer amount of power lobbyists have over a volunteer Legislature.
“Something that we continue to advocate for is increasing the length of the legislative session and for legislators to receive a salary,” he said. “Without those two things, legislators are really kind of reliant on lobbyists.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — As the University of South Carolina’s first day of a police leadership program came to an end, the 15 officers in the class started to wonder, “What have we gotten ourselves into?” said Major Lee Catoe, one of the program’s students.
That first class, which taught officers about different types of leadership styles, was just a taste of the intensive 17-month course in which police officers from across the state learned leadership skills and how to handle difficult policing situations, said Catoe, who has spent 18 years with the State Transport Police.
Started with $10 million from the state Legislature in 2023, the Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program teaches officers evidence-based practices on policing. Lessons include how to effectively communicate with each other and members of the public and how policing relates to civil rights issues, according to its website.
The program’s second cohort of officers graduated Friday, bringing the total graduates in the pilot program to 31. The first cohort of 16 officers finished the course in March.
Staff at the university’s law school, in talking to state law enforcement officials, realized police had few professional development opportunities focused on what it takes to be a great leader, said William Hubbard, dean of the university’s law school.
So, they decided to fill in those gaps, he said.
The course was open to officers who are already in a leadership position at their agency or aspire to be in one and have the skills necessary. By cultivating great leaders, the program aims to encourage more people to become police officers and stay in the profession, Hubbard said.
“That’s what we’ve sought to do,” Hubbard said.
Unlike other professional development courses, professors give students real-world scenarios to solve using what they learned about best practices and how their actions affect everyone involved, Catoe said.
“A lot of times, you like to live in black and white, very ordered and structured,” Catoe said. “Every once in a while, you have to go outside of that to find a solution that’s beneficial to the person, not violating their rights and that supports law enforcement’s objective.”
The program consisted of seven weeklong courses, spread out over the course of 17 months.
Along with teaching leadership skills, staff also offered help in writing grants for departments and other resources for officers.
“It’s really a treasure trove for law enforcement,” Catoe said.
Among the topics covered are what drives people to commit crimes, how mental health and community trust can affect people’s interactions with police officers and the history of racial profiling, according to the program’s website.
Many of the courses were eye-opening, Catoe said.
For instance, one week, officers learned how to use social media to connect with their communities. They used the university’s social media lab to see which posts did well and which didn’t, which Catoe hadn’t considered previously.
“Sometimes we have to adapt on the fly and do something,” Catoe said he learned. “When we find what works, we continue to use it.”
Filling in those gaps, including teaching leaders how to work together, is essential, said Gov. Henry McMaster.
He recalled a major drug bust he led as the state’s U.S. attorney in the 1980s that came together only when different agencies figured out how to collaborate instead of working parallel to one another.
Operation Jackpot, as the bust was known, led to the conviction of more than 100 people who were smuggling drugs into the country.
“You’ve got to make the ends meet,” said McMaster, the keynote speaker for Friday’s graduation. “There can’t be gaps.”
The program was meant to test curriculum for a master’s degree in public safety executive leadership, with the university plans to start offering this fall, according to an application the university submitted to its board of trustees.
The master’s course will use officers’ feedback from the pilot program to develop its curriculum, broadening it to twice as many people in the coming years, according to the application.
“I truly believe that as this program is pushed out across the state, it is going to be monumental for our officers,” said Aiken Lieutenant Jennifer Hayes, one of Friday’s graduates.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2284-scaled-e1746825127400-1024x728.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

In January 2022, the Iowa Board of Nursing revoked the practical nurse’s license it had granted to Enome Massango of West Des Moines in 2018, as well as the registered nurse’s license it had granted him in 2021.
According to board records, Massango later admitted he had paid a man named Musa Bangura for transcripts and diplomas as a “short cut” to completing his education at schools that federal officials likened to a diploma mill.
According to the board, Massango acknowledged his educational program as a licensed practical nurse consisted of a single-day “review course.” Board records indicate Massango had to take the LPN exam twice, and the RN exam four times, before passing the tests. After obtaining his nursing license in Iowa, Massango spent four years working at various locations, including Valley View Village, an assisted living center and nursing home located in Des Moines.
The board concluded Massango had engaged in fraud when he knowingly purchased fraudulent documents in order to qualify for licensure in Iowa, adding that his case was “particularly egregious.” Massango, the board said, “received little to no classroom instruction and did not undergo any clinical training.”
When the board revoked Massango’s license in 2022, it stipulated that before he could apply for relicensure, he’d have to obtain the proper educational credentials and appear “before the board for a reinstatement hearing” to establish that his licensure was in the public interest.
Board records show that on April 11, 2024, the board voted to grant Massango a new registered nurse’s license authorizing him to resume practicing in Iowa.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/09/ct-1199-nursing-home-strike-deadline/,The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed to push a May 19 strike deadline at 51 Connecticut nursing homes back until May 27.,"The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed to push a May 19 strike deadline at 51 Connecticut nursing homes back until May 27, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday.
A spokesman for SEIU 1199NE confirmed the delay, which the Lamont administration sought. 
“Earlier this week, I met with union leadership representing Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers and expressed to them that I agree that their current wages do not match the value of the service they provide and that I join them in their effort to seek an increase in their compensation,” Lamont said. “Additionally, I informed them that I believe there is a consensus among legislative leaders who also feel the same and that we are working to negotiate a state budget that includes support for this workforce.”
The governor added that “Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers do strenuous work on behalf of our most vulnerable residents, and my administration is committed to reaching a positive resolution on their behalf as soon as possible.”
Union president Rob Baril said Friday that “we had a couple of conversations with the governor’s office, and we were extremely clear” about wage and benefit concerns.
The union wants to boost starting pay for caregivers to $25 per hour and, over several years, elevate most employees to about $30 per hour. Most nursing home workers in the state currently earn between $18 and $22 per hour, a wage that leaves many members in poverty.
Though wage and benefit negotiations technically are between private sector nursing homes and their staff, the state often plays a role in resolving labor-management disputes in this industry.
That’s because, on average, more than 80% of nursing home revenue involves patients whose care is covered by federal and state Medicaid dollars. 
Baril added the Lamont administration indicated it’s working hard to identify the resources necessary to bolster wages and benefits. “We are going to take them at their word,” Baril said.
Providing the type of raises the union seeks would require a major new public investment in nursing homes.
SEIU 1199NE estimates it would require an extra $550 million in Medicaid payments over the next two fiscal years combined, an annual average of $275 million, to fund the improved wages and benefits workers are seeking.
About 50% of Connecticut’s Medicaid expenses in most program areas are covered through federal reimbursement, which would make the effective annual cost to the state about $137.5 million.
Meanwhile, Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority are already struggling to develop a new state budget that complies with the constitutional cap that keeps most spending growth in line with household income and inflation. They hope to adopt a new two-year state budget before the regular 2025 session ends on June 4.
Earlier this month, the union set a May 19 strike deadline. The potential work stoppage would affect roughly 5,700 nursing home workers.
But this year’s state budget negotiations are far most complex than usual, given the uncertain future of Medicaid, a federal health care entitlement program run in cooperation with states.
Congress set a goal of achieving cuts to Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over the next decade. Lamont’s administration has modeled potential cuts, based on various proposals on Capitol Hill that could cost Connecticut anywhere from $186 million to $880 million per year.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, the state’s largest nursing home coalition, thanked state and union officials for their continuing efforts to avoid a strike.
“Separating nursing home residents from their caregivers causes real harm and trauma,” Barrett said. “Workforce development, including wage and benefit enhancements as an employee retention and recruitment policy for both union and non-union employees, is essential to addressing the care needs of Connecticut’s dramatically aging population.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210310_1199Rally_Hartford_YK_007.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

“We understand this news may be disappointing for our young musicians who were looking forward to this event,” the message states. “We share in their disappointment and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. It was made out of an abundance of caution to protect the health of our students and families.”
As of Friday afternoon, North Dakota’s confirmed measles case total remains at nine, all of which are in Williams County.
The first confirmed case of measles in North Dakota was reported May 2, with three additional cases confirmed over the weekend. That total increased to nine cases Tuesday, including potential measles exposures to three Williams County schools. All nine cases are people who were not vaccinated. 
Williston Basin School District 7 required about 180 unvaccinated students to quarantine for 21 days. That number has dropped to 150 after some parents provided proof of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine for their children, said Paula Lankford, spokesperson for the district. Those students will be allowed to return to in-person instruction.
No new confirmed measles cases over the last three days is a good thing, said Molly Howell, immunization director for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, but it does not mean the state is out of the woods yet.
About 180 students under quarantine amid measles outbreak in Williams County

“The incubation period for measles, the time period from when you were exposed to when you develop the disease, can be as long as 21 days,” Howell said.
Howell said to declare an outbreak officially over, two full incubation periods must pass with no new cases, which for measles would be 42 days.
Lankford said the annual Band Day Parade on Saturday will continue as scheduled with more than a dozen bands from across the state and the drum line for the New York Giants participating in the event.
“At this point, as a city or school district, nothing is being canceled, postponed or held back in any of the plans,” she said. Lankford added that high school sports and other afterschool activities were not affected by the quarantine.
In a notice posted to its website, the city of Williston shared North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services guidance that recommends “all residents and travelers to Williams County ensure they are vaccinated against measles.”
Residents wishing to not attend the parade and remain home due to safety concerns can watch a livestream of Saturday’s Williston Band Day parade through the Williston Convention and Visitors Bureau Facebook page.
Lankford also said there have been no issues in providing course materials to the students under the 21-day quarantine to ensure they can complete the school year.
The last day of school for the district will be May 23.
The measles outbreak prompted the Upper Missouri District Health Unity to host special walk-in vaccination clinics in Williston on Thursday and Friday.
Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, said the organization administered about 120 MMR immunizations on Thursday and, as of Friday afternoon, the foot traffic at the walk-in site had been “steady all day.”
“We’re seeing a lot of those 6-month to the 11-month (kids) getting that first dose and then that 12-month and older getting that second dose early,” Clark said.
She said some attendees were also getting caught up on other vaccinations, such as COVID-19 immunizations, while they attended the clinic.
The Upper Missouri District Health Unit holds regular walk-in vaccination clinic days at its Williston office on Thursdays from 3 to 5:30 p.m.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its weekly measles cases on Friday and reported an additional 66 measles cases were confirmed this week, bringing the nationwide total to 1,001 confirmed cases across 30 states.
Of those cases, 30%, 299 cases, involve children under the age of 5. School-age children between ages 5 to 19 represent 38% of the total measles cases nationwide.
Hospitalizations were required in 13% of all measles cases across the country. Children under 5 years of age accounted for more than half of the total hospitalizations.
Three deaths have been connected to the nationwide measles outbreak. None of the deaths involve cases in North Dakota.

The private university in the city’s urban core announced Friday that it plans to use philanthropic donations for the so-called “quadrangle” — which will become its epicenter of activity, hosting events such as graduation and alumni reunions, in addition to broader community activities.

Construction is to start in July near 22nd and Burt Streets, with a projected opening in fall of 2026. 
Calling the project among the largest physical reshapes of the campus, Creighton officials say it will include 5.7 acres of natural grass, an amphitheater, pavilion, stage, fountain plaza and an ellipse with an art installation.
 “The quadrangle will be Creighton’s own Central Park, a reimagining of campus green space that will live at the intersection of academic and residential life,” said Creighton president, the Rev. Daniel Hendrickson.
Designed by OJB Landscape Architecture and constructed by Kiewit Corp., the new feature is to be created on the site of what now are Creighton’s baseball practice and softball fields. Those are to be removed after the College World Series in June. 
New softball competition fields and a baseball practice area are under construction now in a community athletic complex near 17th and Cuming Streets, according to a media statement. 
The quadrangle green space will be surrounded by four residence halls, one set for completion this fall, as well as the School of Dentistry building, the Ahmanson Law Center and the Harper Center, which is home to the Heider College of Business.
“This transformation will forever change how our students, faculty, staff, alumni and guests experience campus,” Hendrickson said. “The quadrangle not only gives Creighton a prominent gathering space; it creates a crown jewel at the heart of the city’s urban core, where the University has invested more than $500 million since 2015.”
 The project comes as student surveys in recent years have pointed to additional natural green space as a way the campus could be improved.

 “We are always aiming to meet the needs of the thousands of students who attend Creighton, and who live and learn on this campus,” said Diane Duren, chair of the Creighton University Board of Trustees. “Campus-redefining projects such as the quadrangle will ensure that future Bluejays know when they choose Creighton, they are choosing an educational experience like no other, on one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.”
The project is part of recent construction momentum that includes the freshman residence Graves Hall, the CL and Rachel Werner Center for Health Sciences Education, the Jérôme Nadal, SJ, Jesuit Residence.
Other major improvements include renovations to the St. John’s Fountain and Plaza, the Skutt Student Center and, currently, Creighton Hall.
Creighton said the activity coincides with “record enrollment,” noting that over the past 25 years, the university has enrolled 22 of the 23 largest freshman classes in its history. This year’s enrollment reached 8,580 students, about half of them undergraduates.
 “These students are coming to Creighton from all over the nation,” Hendrickson said. “Approximately 80% of our students come from out of state, and 50% of all graduates stay in Nebraska.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)GARNETT — Kansas farmers are sharing opinions ranging from concerned to “pi**ed” about trade tariffs with U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, who toured a corn farm Friday southwest of Kansas City.
“When I’m talking to folks, I hear everything from concern and a cautious approach to how to navigate this tariff climate that we’re in, all the way to folks who are really, like, really worked up and are pi**ed,” Davids said, standing on a gravel road near the Phelon family corn farm outside Garnett.
Davids began visiting a variety of ag operations in 2023, including a goat farm in Miami County, a poultry and livestock operation in Anderson County. She serves on the House Agriculture Committee and wanted to learn more about farmers and their needs, she said.
The farmers she’s met with expressed concerns about potential future impacts on the international markets for their products because of tariffs, Davids said.
“The time and investment it takes to get those customers in international markets, it’s not a lightswitch, and it takes a lot of work and effort and rebuilding of relationships to get those same customers back and continue to have that level of market share,” she said. “The impacts are there and people are feeling it.”
Davids spent Friday morning with Adam Phelon and his father, Raylen Phelon, discussing the farm bill and other issues while touring their fourth-generation corn operation.
“I would say that right now, the prospect of a farm bill is very much dependent on how the Congress moves forward on reconciliation,” Davids said. “We’re supposed to have a markup on the reconciliation bill next week. I think when it comes to the farm bill, we have a really strong starting place in this Congress.”
Davids said Republicans and Democrats see crop insurance as a top priority, for instance, and there is agreement on other agricultural provisions.
“I think that there’s a reason to be realistically optimistic, but similar to last Congress — it’s not the farm bill that is holding up the process of getting a farm bill done,” she said. “It’s that there are other legislative things going on before we can do the farm bill.”
Adam Phelon, who is a Kansas Soybean Association board member, said he would like to see Congress pass a farm bill but added that multiple issues are being watched by farmers.
“It’s not just tariffs — it’s trade, it’s EPA regulations, it’s the energy costs, it’s infrastructure. I mean, infrastructure is such a huge one for us,” he said. “And that goes to not just our roads around here, but that goes to rail, that goes to ships that are coming into ports, you know, everything that goes on there. All that’s important to us as farmers.”
But the priority right now is getting a farm bill, he said.
“We need updated reference prices,” he said. “We need to make sure that there’s a strong safety net, and we need to make sure the crop insurance is protected because we have weather uncertainties. Without having crop insurance and making sure there’s a strong safety net underneath us — those things can be life or death in terms of a farm and how we operate.”
 
Statewide insights
Kaleb Little, CEO and administrator of the Kansas Soybean Association, was at the Phelon farm for the tour. He said he is hearing similar concerns as those expressed by Adam Phelon from others in the organization.
“There’s always so much uncertainty in farming and agriculture,” Little said. “There’s so much that’s just out of their hands. And then throw in what the federal government is and isn’t doing is just another layer of uncertainty in there, whether trade or not, getting a farm bill done, or bio fuels policy,” Little said. “Farmers are always optimists, right? Because they have to be.”
A lot of association members are hanging onto what Little termed “cautious optimism” that things will come out better. Still, he said, there is angst and concern.
For soybean farmers, half of their products go to the international market, he said. There were long-term impacts from tariffs put in place during President Donald Trump’s first administration. 
“The world dynamics really changed,” Little said, adding that pre-2018 tariffs, about 60% of China’s soybean market came from U.S. farmers.
“That got cut in half,” he said of the impacts of previous tariffs. “Some of the good that came out of that was soybean farmers and groups like the United Soybean or the American Soybean Association, those organizations really worked to diversify the international market. So U.S. soy is going to a lot more individual markets than it did pre-China. There are some positives there, but it’s a lot more work to maintain 50 countries as customers versus 12 or 15, especially when you talk about infrastructure and things like that.”
 
In his blood
Uncertainty is a part of running a farm, whether it be weather- or politics-related. But it makes planning difficult.
“The uncertainty is a huge issue,” Adam Phelon said. “So, yeah, maybe we won’t be making some bigger purchases that we planned on before, just so we can plan for the future in case, you know, things get worse before they get better.”
Even knowing the challenges, Adam Phelon never doubted that he’d continue his family’s farming tradition.
“This ground that we’re standing on today has been in my grandma’s family for around 100 years now,” he said. “Yeah, we’ve got VHS tapes of me in a crib being hauled up the side of a combine. I remember getting dropped off at youth group, and the look on my youth group teacher’s face when she saw me climb right into a tractor to go to work. Her jaw dropped. I was probably 11 or 12 years old.
“I love being out here working in the dirt, and seeing the crop grow from a seed to a final product, and taking pride in that,” Adam Phelon said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Phelon-use-1024x779.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 17:07:24.022656

[…]","The OOCL Iris container ship based in China is the largest vessel to visit the Port of Charleston, able to carry up to 16,828 cargo containers measured in 20 foot increments. (Photo by Matthew Peacock/Provided by S.C. State Ports Authority)CHARLESTON — President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff policies are roiling global trade, forcing South Carolina businesses and nearly every sector of the state’s logistics network to question where they go from here.
“It was like stopping a Ferris Wheel, and you’re sitting at the top,” maritime industry analyst Jim Newsome, former president of the S.C. State Ports Authority, said of the frozen future many industries are facing since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on April 2.
“Everybody is bracing for the impact,” he said.
Unlike their West Coast counterparts, the Port of Charleston has yet to see any major impacts from the Chinese shipping slowdown resulting from Trump’s 145% tariffs on that country’s imports.
That’s because transits to West Coast ports are shorter, and those ports typically have a much greater exposure to Chinese goods.
Year-over-year cargo levels measured by the equivalent of 20-foot-long containers — or TEUs in maritime jargon — moving through Charleston’s terminals have held steady or even increased this spring as retailers and others frontloaded shipments ahead of the tariffs.
That’s about to change, analysts say, because cargo that takes weeks to arrive along the East Coast will now be hit with the tariffs.
By June, ports in Charleston, Savannah and along the East Coast could see noticeable drops in cargo if tariff policies don’t change.
On average, about half of the freight bound for Charleston’s port either originates in or has major stops in China, which reported Friday that April shipments to the U.S. dropped by 21%.
Ocean liners in recent weeks have canceled about 17% of the container ships scheduled to travel to East Coast ports because of cargo shortages, according to Copenhagen-based maritime research group Sea-Intelligence.
Flexport, a San Francisco-based leader in supply chain management, says at least one weekly container service calling on Charleston has suspended trips altogether through mid-June.
Barbara Melvin, president and CEO of the State Ports Authority that owns and operates the Port of Charleston, declined to comment on tariff impacts.
But John McCown, a non-resident senior fellow at Arlington, Va.-based Center for Maritime Strategy, has a bleak outlook.
“I’m thinking a 25% overall (drop in cargo) could be conservative if things stay the way they are,” said McCown, author of the John McCown Container Report.
“I suspect the actual numbers will show reduced economic activity across the entire container shipping supply chain that will touch every port,” McCown said. “In addition, the tariffs will also result in noticeable inflation.”
‘Dropping like flies’
Some cracks are already starting to show.
A few trucking fleets at Charleston’s port, particularly those that handle Chinese imports, are seeing as much as 30% to 40% slowdowns, according to Rick Todd, president and CEO of the South Carolina Trucking Association.
“General trucking remains in a ‘worst ever’ freight and rate trough,” he said. “Combine that with relentless cost increases and we are finding smaller and more marginal fleets dropping like flies.”
About three-fourths of cargo at Charleston’s port moves by truck.
“The tariff/trade slowdown, with uncertainty, will exacerbate capacity leaving the market,” he said.
Todd’s counterpart in Georgia said that state is also “starting to see some ripples” in trucking volumes.
“But I think probably in another two to three weeks those ripples are going to start to turn into waves,” Seth Millican, president and CEO of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
The Georgia Ports Authority has also seen little impact to date from tariffs, posting record volumes in March.
Griff Lynch, the authority’s president and CEO, said the port is talking with customers about how to mitigate tariff costs and using Savannah’s Garden City Terminal West to store containers and manage supply chain fluctuations.
Railroads that serve Charleston’s port say it’s hard to measure future tariff impacts.
“Tariffs could be a headwind to volumes for the rest of the year,” Ed Elkins, executive vice president and chief commercial officer for Norfolk-Southern, told analysts.
The biggest risk is an overall economic slowdown due to tariffs, he added.
CSX Corp. CEO Joe Hinrichs said near-term demand is “pretty strong” but “the keyword you’re hearing from everybody is uncertainty.”
Job cuts at Volvo
About half of all imports to the U.S. are parts needed by manufacturers, including the Palmetto State’s $27 billion vehicle industry. Most of that cargo is moved by truck.
Volvo Cars this week announced layoffs totaling 5% – roughly 100 people – at its Berkeley County manufacturing campus, citing “challenging macro conditions” including tariff threats.
“The adjustment is due to changing market conditions and evolving trade policies, including tariffs,” a Volvo spokesperson said. “Our aim is to build where we sell, and we will continue to balance our ongoing investments in the U.S. with the need to optimize costs and drive greater efficiency in the current environment.”
Volvo also plans to add new models to its Lowcountry plant, which currently builds the battery-powered EX90 sport-utility vehicle, to offset tariffs on foreign-made cars.
BMW – the state’s largest automaker and the nation’s top vehicle exporter, primarily through Charleston’s port – said this week it has been making a case for tariff relief with White House officials but acknowledged the current status would have a “notable” impact on its second-quarter earnings.
Front-line workers at the port will also take a hit if tariffs lead to less cargo.
The International Longshoremen’s Association supplies thousands of dockworkers in Charleston, and those workers typically are paid only when there are ships to load and unload.
The ILA, which supported Trump’s election, has not issued any formal statement on tariffs. And Ken Riley, president of the union’s Charleston branch, did not respond to a request for comment.
A cloudy crystal ball
Tariffs that are announced one day and paused or canceled days later are adding confusion to South Carolina’s trade outlook.
“Nobody has an accurate crystal ball on the effect of these unprecedented catalysts,” McCown told Freightwaves.
Some of the biggest import commodities at Charleston’s port are Chinese tariff targets, including toys, apparel, footwear, televisions and other electronics. Combined with a 10% universal tariff on goods from most other countries, U.S. imports are projected to plummet.
Analysts disagree on how big the drop will be. The National Retail Federation puts the number at 20%. JP Morgan pegs it at up to 80%.
Walmart, which operates a 3 million-square-foot import distribution center in Ridgeville that supplies goods to 850 stores, said it is negotiating prices directly with overseas suppliers to blunt tariff impact.
Smaller businesses don’t have that luxury.
“It’s clear this is going to be a severe problem for small businesses because they don’t have the capacity to make bulk purchases or change their supply chains,” said Frank Knapp, president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce. “You’re going to see businesses shutting down.”
Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary and a South Carolina native, is in Switzerland this weekend meeting with Chinese officials to talk trade. Bessent has said he doesn’t expect a major breakthrough, telling Fox News: “My sense is that this will be about de-escalation.”
Trump preempted Bessent’s talks Friday by posting on his Truth Social account that 80% tariffs on Chinese goods “sounds right” – the first indication that his stance is softening.
But lowering tariffs from 145% to 80% tariffs is still unsustainable and unlikely to move the needle on trade.
Newsome, the former port director-turned-president of Jim Newsome 3 consultants, said Trump’s tariffs are based on the flawed premise that they will bring manufacturing back to the United States.
“Forget about it,” he said. “You might be able to bring back some high-value manufacturing with a high potential for automation. But it’s never going to be the case that you’re going to bring a toy made in China back to the United States.”
There’s also no way to balance trade with China, he said, because that country “doesn’t have the consumption power we do.”
The per-capita U.S. income of $43,289 is more than 7.5 times greater than China’s.
“How do you balance that?” he said. “I think that kind of narrative got us off on the wrong foot.”
Newsome said he’s hopeful that reality is finally getting through to the president, and he thinks there will be too much pressure from retailers and other businesses for Trump’s China policy to persist. Retailers need holiday-shopping goods in their warehouses this summer, and they aren’t likely to sit by quietly if tariffs interrupt those shipments.
“The best outcome, the hopeful outcome, would be they have a good discussion (in Switzerland) and agree that things got out of hand a bit,” Newsome said. “Let’s push the tariffs off for 90 days to give some time to negotiate. That gets us past the Christmas shipping season.”
McCown agrees there will be intense political pressure to end the Chinese tariff war, but he’s skeptical that cooler heads will prevail.
“At all times and even before this nonsensical tariff policy went into effect, strong reasoned advice not to go down this path has been largely ignored,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ship-in-Charleston-Harbor.jpg,,,2025-05-09 17:07:24.022656

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark and one of six Democrats running to be New Jersey’s next governor, was arrested and detained by federal immigration agents Friday, according to his campaign.
This comes just over a week after the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, opened its doors as the largest detention center on the east coast. Baraka, whose city filed a lawsuit challenging whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits before opening, has spent the week protesting outside the jail and attempting to gain entry, to no avail.
A photo taken by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), who was also at Delaney Hall Friday, shows a handcuffed Baraka being led away from the facility in handcuffs. It’s unclear whether he has been charged with any crime and where he is being held.
Acting U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Alina Habba said on social media that Baraka “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center.”
“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,” said Habba.
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in April that she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state ban on local law enforcement assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Under a 2018 attorney general directive, state, county, and local cops are barred from aiding federal agencies in civil immigration arrests or providing access to state or local resources and databases.
In February, private prison firm Geo Group announced it had secured a 15-year contract with ICE to use Delaney Hall as a 1,100-bed detention center amid ramped-up immigration enforcement. Trump has made mass detention and deportation of immigrants — including some here legally — a pillar of his second term in office.
Delaney Hall, which held immigrant detainees from 2011 to 2017, reopened May 1, despite Newark officials’ attempts to block the opening through the lawsuit. ICE officials have confirmed that detainees are being held there, but have not said how many.
The Attorney General’s Office and the governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

“Jefferson Moss brings a rare combination of public service, private sector experience, and a deep understanding of innovation and education,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “He’s been a driving force behind many of Utah’s most forward-thinking initiatives, and I’m confident he’ll lead the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity with the same vision, energy, and commitment to our state’s future that have defined his career.”
Moss will replace GOEO’s former executive director, Ryan Starks, who left earlier this month to “pursue other professional endeavors,” according to a news release issued May 2. 
While announcing Starks’ departure, Cox lauded him as an “invaluable asset to the state and our economic development efforts. … We wish him the very best in his future pursuits.” 
Starks, according to his LinkedIn page, originally intended to launch his own consulting business before he was offered a position leading the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, which he accepted. 
Moss, during his time in the Legislature, focused on policy impacting education, energy, government spending and economic development. He was first elected to the House in 2017. He served in House leadership roles since 2019, including as vice chair of the Executive Appropriations Committee, a powerful budgeting body. 
To choose a new majority leader, the House Republicans’ caucus will hold a special leadership election in coming weeks. 
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, praised Moss in a post on X, saying he has a “unique ability to bring people together, think outside the box, and solve complex challenges.” 
“While we’ll miss his leadership in the House, I know he will continue to serve Utah with the same passion and purpose in his new role,” Schultz said. 
Moss also currently works as associate commissioner of innovation, commercialization and economic development for the Utah System of Higher Education and as managing director of the Utah Innovation Fund. He’ll “continue in a leadership role with USHE in addition to leading GOEO,” according to the governor’s office. 
Previously, Moss also held leadership positions at Utah Valley University, was a strategist at KeyBank and Credit Suisse, and was a founder of several businesses.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Every kid has heard “No means no!” when they want something their parents don’t think they should have. This week that phrase got a couple high profile uses when Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, told Donald Trump right to his face that Canada was not and never would be for sale and Montana’s Congressman Ryan Zinke forcefully said “no” to the sale of public lands in the West.
In this day and age seeing U.S. politicians keep their campaign promises — or honor their oaths of office — is becoming increasingly rare.  But on “keeping public lands in public hands,” Rep. Zinke did just that.
The measure in question was part of the “big, beautiful bill” touted by Trump to give yet more tax breaks to the already wealthy. The new twist was to sell hundreds of thousands of acres of federal lands in Nevada and Utah for mining, logging, drilling and development to finance those tax breaks.
Doug Burgum, the Secretary of the Interior, has publicly declared public lands and resources as “natural assets” that can be used to pay down the national debt. Consequently, GOP Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada and Celeste Maloy of Utah inserted the public land sale as an amendment since it was not contained in the original draft of the bill due to bipartisan opposition.
Montana’s Congressman and former Secretary of the Interior called the move to sell public lands “a red line” and was adamant: “It’s a no now. It will be a no later. It will be a no forever.’’   As Zinke explained his firm opposition: “I prefer the management scheme and I give as an example a hotel. If you don’t like the management of a hotel, don’t sell the hotel; change the management.”
At almost the same time, Canada’s Prime Minister, Mark Carney was using almost the same words in his White House meeting. After listening to Trump’s blather about how Canada should be our 51st state, how much he “loved Canada” and how erasing the “artificial” border line would make one beautiful piece of real estate, Carney used Trump’s own real estate line to fire back: “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.  We’re sitting in one right now.  Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it’s not for sale, won’t be for sale,” adding: “Canada’s not for sale. It never will be for sale.”
Carney won office largely on his opposition to Trump’s intentions to take over Canada, saying during the election that: “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.”
Both Zinke and Carney are dead right.  Polls show 74% of Americans oppose the sale of our public lands — and Carney’s election speaks for itself.  He won by fighting Trump’s nasty threat to take over our northern neighbor that 77% of Canadians oppose.
For a guy who’s always been told he can have everything he wants, the double-barrel blast should be a wake up call.  The world is not one big real estate sale to be marketed solely to make greedy billionaires even more money.  Kudos to Zinke and Carney — and hopefully a sign to the rest of Congress and the world that it’s time to tell our spoiled child of a president “No means no!”

Kay Ivey delivers the State of the State address in the Old House Chamber at the Alabama State Capitol on Feb. 4, 2025 in Montgomery, Alabama. (Will McClelland for Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey Friday signed a bill reducing the state sales tax on groceries.
HB 386, sponsored by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, will cut the state share of the tax from 3% to 2% effective Sept. 1. 
“When we can reduce taxes in Alabama and provide some relief to the hardworking people of this state, I am all for it. I was pleased to sign House Bill 386 to take another notch off our state grocery tax,” Ivey said in a statement.
Alabama is one of just a few states that still taxes groceries. Until September 2023, the state taxed groceries at the full 4% state sales tax that’s been around since 1939. Combined with local taxes, the total tax on food in Alabama ran as high as 10% in some places. In Montgomery, a family spending $600 a month on groceries could pay up to $60 in taxes.
The Legislature in 2023 reduced the state sales tax on groceries from 4% to 3%. But it also required growth of at least 3.5% in the Education Trust Fund (ETF), which gets most of the grocery tax.  
Compared to the previous fiscal year, the current 2025 ETF has grown 3.28% this year, compared to the 2024 ETF at the same point, but budget chairs indicated they were comfortable with moving forward.
Under the new legislation, the tax bill on $600 worth of groceries in Montgomery will go from $54 to $48.
Lawmakers also changed the bill to allow local governments to reduce their sales and use tax on groceries, effectively combining HB 387 with the legislation — which the House passed in March and a Senate committee in late April.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Washington and 14 other states are suing the Trump administration over the president’s declaration of an “energy emergency” to speed up permitting for fossil fuel projects.
Issued the day of his inauguration, President Donald Trump’s executive order says inadequate domestic energy development and an unreliable grid warrant the national emergency. The order argues these issues are most pronounced in the Northeast and on the West Coast.
“Dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population,” the order reads.
The order pushes federal agencies, like the Army Corps of Engineers, to use “any lawful emergency authorities” to “facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.”
In practice, this has meant bypassing or quickening reviews under the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Historic National Preservation Act for planned energy projects and giving the public less time to weigh in, according to the complaint filed Friday in federal court in Seattle. Washington and California lead the 15-state lawsuit.
The lawsuit cites a proposed 100-mile transmission line that would mostly run under the riverbed of the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. The project could be expedited despite water quality concerns.
Attorney General Nick Brown noted Trump’s order emphasizes oil and natural gas, while excluding renewable energy like wind and solar.
“This is not a serious or lawful effort by the president,” Brown said in a press conference Friday. “It is all about limiting competition and shackling America to dirty fossil fuels forever.”
Last month, the Interior Department announced it would fast-track the approval of coal, gas, oil and mineral projects on public lands in light of Trump’s emergency declaration. Environmental reviews that can typically take a year would be shrunk to two weeks.
Meanwhile, the United States produces more oil and gas than any other country and production is growing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The energy emergency order is separate from one the president issued last month targeting state climate policies, including potentially Washington’s Climate Commitment Act.
Casey Sixkiller, the director of the state Department of Ecology, said the emergency declaration is “an abuse of authority.”
“Environmental regulations aren’t red tape,” Sixkiller told reporters. “There are guardrails that protect our air, water, land and keep people safe.”
Bill Iyall, chair of the Cowlitz Tribe, said it’s difficult to weigh in on what projects will mean for the tribe’s land when they only have a week or two.
“We are there to advocate for our cultural and natural resources,” Iyall said. “Looking at a project individually, if you did it carefully and planned it carefully, you would be able to minimize those impacts and get a facilitated permit.”
The lawsuit asks a judge to declare the president’s order illegal and stop the issuance of emergency permits. The states are not seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately stop the Trump administration’s actions, as it has in other cases.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
This marks 17 lawsuits Brown has filed or joined against the Trump administration since January. Four of those came this week, over freezing permitting for wind energy development and funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, as well as dismantling the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Trump’s immigration enforcement casts shadow over Vermont housing discrimination bill 

by Carly Berlin 
April 10, 2025, 4:57 pmApril 10, 2025, 4:57 pm 



Legislative leaders have indicated that S.127, which passed the Senate in late March and is currently winding through the House, will be the central housing bill in 2025. But at the same time, the Senate is continuing to work on a separate version of a similar bill, H.479, muddying the path to the final product.Here’s a look at the top changes this year’s housing package would make – including where lawmakers are still debating the details and where Gov. Phil Scott’s administration stands.Financing infrastructure The hallmark piece of S.127 is a new initiative aimed at financing infrastructure for housing, particularly in smaller towns. The Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, or CHIP, is essentially a scaled-down version of Vermont’s longstanding tax increment financing program. The goal is to allow municipalities or developers to borrow money for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks for a particular housing project. Then, the increased tax revenue from the new development would pay off the debt for the infrastructure.Advocates for municipalities and housing boosters have pushed hard for the new initiative, and developers big and small have said the new financing tool could help make more housing projects pencil out. Critics have argued that if some development aided by the program would have still happened even without it, the initiative does not justify the foregone property tax revenue to the state’s overstretched Education Fund. The House’s tax-writing committee is contemplating restrictions on the proposal, including a test to determine whether a project would have occurred anyway, along with affordability rules and geographic boundaries.Getting the CHIP proposal passed is a main priority for Scott’s administration, said Alex Farrell, commissioner of the Department of Housing and Economic Development. But he cautioned against narrowing who can take advantage of it too much.Alex Farrell, commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development, speaks before the Senate Natural Resources Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 26. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“It’s concerning to me when we try to solve every problem with a single program,” he said.This year’s budget also directs $10 million in loans and grants for infrastructure projects that support housing.Changing who can challenge new housingRight now, if a person has an issue with a new housing project and wants to take its developer to court over a local permit, they have to meet one of a few key criteria: they must be a direct neighbor, or they can gather 19 other people to sign a petition to trigger an appeal.Many housing proponents have argued that these provisions make it too easy for “not in my backyard”-style legal challenges to interfere with badly-needed new homes. The House has advanced a change that would scrap the “abutter” and “petition” appeal options, as they’re often called, with a different legal standard: an opponent must show they will be personally harmed by the development. Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais, chair of the House General and Housing Committee, speaks during a committee meeting at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 26. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMihaly, a champion of the change, sees it as narrowing the scope of who can lob an appeal. If an individual is concerned about stormwater runoff from a new building, for example, “I would have to show that runoff comes onto my property, or I actually swim in that water or drink it, or something like that,” he said. But Farrell and members of the Senate’s housing committee have expressed concerns that the House’s change could in fact open a new avenue for opponents to appeal, without any geographic bound on where an appellant lives. That committee has advanced language that maintains a proximity requirement, which must now get vetted by the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee. Immigration protections Lawmakers have incorporated a bill that seeks to expand housing access for immigrants without legal status into the omnibus package. The legislation would amend the state’s fair housing laws to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of citizenship or immigration status when someone is seeking to rent or buy a home. S.127 also spells out that a landlord needs to accept a range of forms of identification on a rental application in order to conduct credit and background checks – not only a Social Security number. That follows testimony from immigrants who’ve told lawmakers that landlords have frequently passed them over when they couldn’t provide the identifier. But lawmakers took a step back from an outright ban on landlords asking for Social Security numbers that advocates had originally pushed.In a move to assuage landlords and lenders spooked by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, the bill also spells out that federal laws and regulations take precedence over the state’s protections. Farrell said on Wednesday that the administration does not yet have a position on the new protections.Spending debatesIn parallel with the housing packages, lawmakers have finalized their state budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.The budget gives about $15 million to two pandemic-era housing development programs that had since run out of funds, one that provides low-interest loans to developers of rental housing for people with moderate incomes, and another that gives subsidies to builders of homes for purchase by “middle income” buyers.Construction on a housing project in Colchester on May 31, 2022. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThat’s less than half of what Scott advocated for the pair of programs at the outset of the legislative session, prompting Scott to say several weeks ago that the cut was one of his chief gripes with lawmaker’s budget proposal.The budget also gives $4 million to the Vermont Housing Improvement Program, which provides modest grants to rehabilitate rental housing that has fallen into disrepair. But because that funding is one-time and not designated as an ongoing expense, as the administration had requested, the unpredictability may jeopardize maintaining staff positions into the future, Farrell said.Lawmakers also directed about $27 million to the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board for deeply-subsidized housing, far less than what affordable housing advocates have said is needed to fill a backlog of projects.Odds and endsS.127 also takes steps to streamline remediating contaminated brownfield sites for future development, directs the state to look at what it would take to create a land bank to buy up abandoned properties, and sets up studies looking into accessibility standards for residential buildings and housing options for people with developmental disabilities. Notably, the bill does not take up further reforms to Act 250, a subject where Scott saw more room to push after last year’s major overhaul. Some of his asks got taken up in a late-in-the-game land-use bill that has thus far seen little action.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lawmakers piece together housing bills that take on permit appeals, immigrant protection and funding.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/burlington-apartments-1-20211119.jpg,,,2025-05-09 17:07:24.022656

But the health center’s administrator, Zachary Moser, said a recent decision to freeze family planning funds has the center fearful it won’t be able to continue covering family planning services for its rural southeastern Missouri population.
In late March, the Trump administration froze about $27.5 million in Title X funding to a number of states, including several million dollars to Missouri that are distributed by Missouri Family Health Council. 
The Title X program was created more than half a century ago as a funding stream to support access to family planning options, including contraceptives, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings related to reproductive health.

While some have speculated the administration was trying to target abortion providers, only seven of the 52 recipients of Title X grants through the Missouri Family Health Council are Planned Parenthood clinics. A breakdown of how funding is distributed between clinics was not made available.
The majority of the recipients are health centers like Moser’s. Moser said in the short-term, Dent County has redirected some general revenues toward family planning services and continues to offer them to patients for free.
“Will we be able to do that indefinitely?” he asked. “No.”
For example, instead of Title X funding covering the cost of an IUD — a contraceptive device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy — the patient would instead have to foot the bill, choose a less-effective but more affordable or go without. 
Moser said some of the longer-lasting contraceptive devices can cost upwards of $1,000 out of pocket, a price that isn’t feasible for most of the people the center serves. 
Limiting or eliminating family planning services can impact entire communities and public health. 
Michelle Trupiano, executive director of the Missouri Family Health Council, said if the freeze continues, she anticipates immediate health consequences like increased unintended pregnancies, later-stage cancer diagnoses, more overall disease and worse maternal health outcomes. 
Missouri Family Health Council has been leading the state’s Title X planning program for nearly 45 years. Their network of 52 clinics includes health departments, community action agencies, federally-qualified health centers and hospital-based clinics. They also work with family planning clinics, including seven Planned Parenthood locations.
“The Trump administration and Elon Musk are using Title X to push their own political agenda and impose their personal beliefs on everyone at the expense of people who need critical access to care,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. ” …. If blocking health care for low-income patients is what the Trump administration means by ‘making America great again,’ then we want no part of it. It’s cruel, it’s calculated, and it won’t stop us from fighting for our patients.” 
Trupiano said she’s not sure why Missouri was targeted while other states with Planned Parenthood clinics were left untouched. But the letter Trupiano received announcing the freeze cited compliance concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI. She said the grant they were awarded includes “access, quality and equity” among its priorities. 
Through Title X funding, Missouri clinics served nearly 34,800 patients in 2024. Of those, 83% were female, 75% were under the age of 34 and 45% were uninsured.
Last year, 58% of the patients served were white and 30% were Black. 
“We know the devastating impact and consequences that will result if this is not swiftly resolved,” Trupiano said.
The funding to Missouri Family Health Council was paused the day before year four of a five-year grant cycle began on April 1. 
The Dent County Health Center applied for Title X funding after hiring a full-time nurse practitioner in 2022. Not only does the grant help them increase health care access for patients, but Moser said it also backs up an ongoing effort to inform more young people on pregnancy prevention. 
In his corner of southeast Missouri there’s still a lot of stigma around premarital sex, Moser said, making it difficult to educate teenagers on pregnancy-prevention. Among those teens who do seek out contraceptive access at the health center, he said many don’t want to go through their parent’s insurance policy because they want to keep their choices private. 
“We won’t have any way to serve those patients,” Moser said. “It’s going to limit access for sure, which is going to drive up the teen pregnancy rate, drive up unwanted pregnancies and have other unintended consequences.”
Missouri’s teen pregnancy birth rate has steadily declined over the past several years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though it still remains among the highest in the country.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, director of Right By You, a Missouri-based nonprofit that in part advocates for contraceptive access, said some of the most common calls to the organization’s hotline revolve around navigating birth control access.
She said a continued freeze could have “catastrophic” effects, potentially shuttering programs or clinics whose efforts help reduce unintended pregnancies.
If the freeze continues, Kraft Sheley said, that likely means navigating fewer people to pregnancy-prevention options and increasingly directing them to abortion options. While abortion is now legal in Missouri, access is still difficult for many people, as only three Planned Parenthood clinics have resumed procedural abortions and medication abortions remain unavailable.
Missouri abortion ban clears House, heads to Senate despite concerns from top Republican

Trupiano has spent the past few weeks helping clinics like Moser’s navigate the abrupt funding change as they work to determine how to stretch resources in order to continue providing free family planning services to patients. 
“They already were working in the leanest possible way to provide this critical care,” she said. “These cuts are very devastating, and for a lot of the health departments and other safety net clinics, this isn’t the only infrastructure cut that they are facing.” 
That rings true in Dent County, where Moser said Title X is one of a handful of programs under threat right now. He remains particularly concerned about continued federal funding for the county’s lead testing and vaccine programs, both of which rely entirely on grant funding.
Trupiano and others have been drawing attention to Missouri’s public health safety net for years, raising concerns that clinics and providers are stretched beyond capacity. Funding freezes such as this only cause longer wait times and more people who ultimately go without timely care as the burden shifts off one clinic and onto another, she said. 
For example, if a clinic relying on Title X funding were ultimately to close, those patients would be forced to find another provider. In many places, new patient wait lists are already months long. For those without reliable access to transportation, getting to a different clinic further away might be too much of a burden to continue care.
While the greatest harm will be inflicted on the most vulnerable Missourians, Trupiano said, “the impact is going to be borne by everybody.”

For years, outdoors enthusiasts in New Mexico have pushed to overhaul the state Department of Game & Fish — an agency plagued by leadership turnover, funding woes and the scorn of hunters and tree-huggers alike.
Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”

New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.

Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.










We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it's the only one we've got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director


This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.

Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

Conroy's name was added to the state law enforcement memorial at the Capitol in 1987. This image is from the 2025 ceremony adding two names to the memorial.  (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Sadness and alarm accompanying the execution-style shooting of Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Conroy O’Brien on May 24, 1978, was matched by despair and shock of state law enforcement leaders when informed of the decision to parole murderer Jimmie Nelms.
Kansas Highway Patrol Col. Erik Smith, Attorney General Kris Kobach and Sage Hill, president of the Kansas State Troopers Association, objected to the three-member Kansas Prisoner Review Board’s order to authorize release of 78-year-old Jimmie Nelms.
Nelms was convicted of premeditated felony murder and sentenced to two life terms in prison for killing O’Brien near Matfield Green during a traffic stop. O’Brien had pulled a speeding vehicle over on the Kansas Turnpike. While he wrote a citation, three men — including Nelms — overpowered the trooper. O’Brien was forced to walk into a roadside ditch and kneel on the ground. He was pistol-whipped by Nelms, who then shot the trooper twice in the back of the head at close range. O’Brien was 26.
Hours later, Nelms and his partners eluded KHP Trooper Charles Smith following a chase on county roads and a shootout. The trio fled on foot and were captured.
Smith, who leads the Kansas Highway Patrol, said the agency opposed Nelms’ request for parole at multiple hearings, including the March session prompting the parole order. He said the board’s decision relayed to him this week by the secretary of the Kansas Department of Corrections was like a gut-punch.
“There is no conceivable world in which the release of a convicted cop killer – an executioner – is acceptable,” Smith said. “Yet, the legal framework allowing parole existed at the time and has now come full circle. So, while we may vehemently disagree with the board’s decision, we must live with it by continuing to support his surviving family and his blue family.”
Kobach said it didn’t make sense to release of a person who killed a law enforcement officer and was sentenced to prison for life.
“There is something deeply wrong with this picture. Those who murder law enforcement officers should expect to receive the death penalty, not to be walking free on the streets of Kansas,” Kobach said.
Kansas didn’t reinstate capital punishment until 1994, and the state hasn’t executed anyone since 1965.
Hill, president of the state’s trooper association, said it was unfathomable the review board betrayed O’Brien’s family, friends and “anyone who ever has or ever will wear the badge of a Kansas state trooper.”
“It does not go unnoticed when life sentences in Kansas aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, even for cop killers when there is no question of guilt,” Hill said.
Hill said the decision of review board members Carolyn Perez, Jeannie Wark and Mark Keating was “disgraceful and disgusting.”
“We hope you feel profound shame from this day forward whenever you see a young Kansas state trooper on the side of the road protecting our community,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/law-enforcement-memorial-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 16:08:06.834392

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Democrats in the South Carolina House are calling for the censure of a Republican legislator accused of disparaging fellow lawmakers, which he denies.
A resolution filed Thursday afternoon accuses Rep. John McCravy of using “antisemitic, racist and sexist statements that were so egregious as to amount to personal attacks.” The Greenwood Republican says he didn’t use any of the terms he’s rumored to have said.
Democrats “demand there be an investigation and swift justice,” Rep. Jermaine Johnson of Columbia, the measure’s chief sponsor, told reporters gathered in the Statehouse lobby. “We deserve better, and we will demand better.”

Johnson’s resolution was sent to the House Ethics Committee in the last hours of the 2025 legislative session. It’s unclear when in the off-session the committee will meet. It is the only committee divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats in the supermajority GOP chamber.
The resolution seeks censure on the grounds that McCravy violated a House rule that requires legislators to “act with decorum at all times when the House is in session.”
House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, a member of the Ethics Committee, said a censure is the least that should happen after McCravy used a racial slur when answering a reporter’s question.
While he did not name the reporter, The Post and Courier reported after the news conference that the slur came during an unreported and unrecorded part of an interview with McCravy last week. According to the newspaper, the legislator said the term as something he would not use toward a Black colleague.
The interview was about House Majority Leader Davey Hiott’s departure from the Family Caucus, which he co-founded with McCravy in 2017.
Hiott said part of his rift with McCravy stemmed from comments he made last session when referring to two legislators he didn’t believe should lead House Judiciary subcommittees. McCravy denied using any derogatory terms while voicing his concerns over policy differences.

Johnson’s resolution wraps up the various accusations as “antisemitic, racist and sexist.”
“When it goes to the committee, we want to know what exactly happened and action to be taken from a strong stance of this body that hate won’t win,” said Rep. Hamilton Grant, D-Columbia, a co-sponsor.
Asked about the resolution, Hiott said “it’s an ethics situation now.”
Ethics Committee Chairman Jay Jordan, R-Florence, “will handle it just like any other ethics complaint,” said Hiott, R-Pickens. “He will allow the process to work. So, as far as I’m concerned, it’s off the House, and it’s into the Ethics Committee.”
The resolution followed Wednesday’s mass resignation from the Family Caucus, which was over activists’ tactics in pushing for an abortion ban. The 29 legislators who co-signed the resignation letter to McCravy said the caucus under his leadership “has grown increasingly exclusionary and divisive.” It made no mention at all of alleged comments.
Activists’ push for near-total abortion ban leads to split among SC Republicans

The rebuke was over McCravy’s continued affiliation with hardcore abortion opponents, whose tactics included going to House GOP leaders’ churches on Palm Sunday to distribute fliers that accused leadership of blocking a vote on McCravy’s bill banning nearly all abortions.
“We reject the intrusion of that brand of activism into our state, our churches, and our conservative movement,” reads the letter provided to reporters.
The letter came after McCravy declined leaders’ request to rein in the activists. McCravy has told the SC Daily Gazette he doesn’t think it’s appropriate or ethical to tell the activists what they should or shouldn’t do.
It’s unclear when the House last censured anyone.
Democrats introduced a similar resolution in 2021 calling for the censure of a different Republican legislator over comments he posted on Facebook. Nothing came of it, but that legislator lost his bid for re-election in 2022.
In 2017, then-Speaker Jay Lucas was preparing to introduce legislation taking the exceedingly rare move of expelling a legislator, something not done in the state House for more than a century. The legislator, who was charged with beating his wife bloody, resigned rather than face expulsion.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark and one of six Democrats running to be New Jersey’s next governor, was arrested and detained by federal immigration agents Friday, according to his campaign.
This comes just over a week after the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, opened its doors as the largest detention center on the east coast. Baraka, whose city filed a lawsuit challenging whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits before opening, has spent the week protesting outside the jail and attempting to gain entry, to no avail.
A photo taken by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), who was also at Delaney Hall Friday, shows a handcuffed Baraka being led away from the facility in handcuffs. It’s unclear whether he has been charged with any crime and where he is being held.
Acting U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Alina Habba said on social media that Baraka “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center.”
“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,” said Habba. 
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in April that she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state ban on local law enforcement assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Under a 2018 attorney general directive, state, county, and local cops are barred from aiding federal agencies in civil immigration arrests or providing access to state or local resources and databases.
In February, private prison firm Geo Group announced it had secured a 15-year contract with ICE to use Delaney Hall as a 1,100-bed detention center amid ramped-up immigration enforcement. Trump has made mass detention and deportation of immigrants — including some here legally — a pillar of his second term in office.
Delaney Hall, which held immigrant detainees from 2011 to 2017, reopened May 1, despite Newark officials’ attempts to block the opening through the lawsuit. ICE officials have confirmed that detainees are being held there, but have not said how many.
The Attorney General’s Office and the governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Unvaccinated students at Missouri Ridge Elementary, Williston Middle School and Williston High School were told they need to isolate for 21 days to ensure they were not infected, said Paula Lankford, spokesperson for Williston Basin School District 7. The precaution is to prevent students from unknowingly spreading the virus to others.
Health officials on Tuesday confirmed nine cases of measles in Williams County in northwest North Dakota. Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, said the measles cases are considered part of an outbreak because health officials believe community spread is occurring without direct contact with known carriers of the illness.
Four people diagnosed with measles were in Williston schools while infectious, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said.
The entire campuses of the affected schools were considered exposed, Lankford said.
The quarantine requirement affects some unvaccinated fourth grade students who were touring Williston Middle School on the day of the exposure, Lankford said. It also affects a few other students who don’t attend the affected schools but shared a bus ride with an exposed student, she said.
“Each of the schools is going to work with those families that are excluded to ensure that they have educational opportunities for their kids and connections with teachers through digital means,” Lankford said.
The Williston school district has a total enrollment of about 5,300 students.
Lankford encouraged parents, students or community members to contact their school or health care provider if they have questions.
“What’s obviously on our side is that there is not that much school left,” Lankford said. “We are done here on May 23rd.”
If Williston High School seniors under quarantine do not show any symptoms after their 21-day isolation, they will be allowed to participate in graduation commencement at the end of May, she said.
Of the confirmed cases, two are children under 10; five are between ages 10 and 19; one is between 30 and 39 and one is between 40 and 49, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The first case reported Friday was a Williams County child who is believed to have contracted measles from an out-of-state visitor. All are people who were not vaccinated, health officials say.
The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rate for Williams County kindergarten students is 81% for the 2024-25 school year, down from 87% two years ago, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services. The rate is 95% for seventh graders and 97% for 11th graders. Public health officials say 95% is needed to prevent community spread.
The Upper Missouri District Health Unit, which serves Williams County as well as Divide, McKenzie and Mountrail counties, is holding walk-in vaccination clinics at 110 W. Broadway, Williston, from 1-7 p.m. Thursday and 8:30 to 6 p.m. Friday.

“I feel like we maybe will be busy,” Clark said. “We’re fielding some phone calls today with people with questions, but you never know what that’ll look like when it actually becomes time.”
Clark said anyone experiencing cold symptoms or anyone who has been in contact with a carrier of the illness should not attend the vaccination clinic. Clark said those people should quarantine themselves for 21 days to prevent further spread of the disease.
“I think the biggest thing is, if they are a case contact or they are sick, don’t come to the clinic,” she said.
The vaccinations are not free of charge, she said, so clinic attendees will want to bring their private health insurance cards with them. Depending on their ages, those without health insurance could be eligible for reduced pricing through a state-funded vaccination program.
“I think there’s a lot of concern and I just recommend people go to trusted sites to get their information,” Clark said of community members who may be vaccine hesitant. She added the North Dakota Health and Human Services website is a good source for those looking for more information on the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.
Those planning on attending the walk-in MMR vaccine clinic in Williston can fill out the organization’s immunization consent form ahead of time to speed up the process once they arrive. The form can be found on the Upper Missouri District Health Unit website.
CHI St. Alexius Health medical center in Williston also urged people with symptoms to stay home and call a health care provider prior to coming to the clinic. CHI needed to temporarily close its Williston walk-in clinic on Wednesday after a possible measles exposure was reported, according to a social media post by the health care provider.
Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. For information about measles, vaccines or local clinic availability, contact the HHS Immunization Unit at 701-328-2378 or visit hhs.nd.gov/measles.
Health officials also urged anyone who visited the Williston Walmart between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on April 29 to monitor for symptoms and contact a health care provider if symptoms develop.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Army will hold a listening session in Charleston next week to get public input regarding proposed changes to the federal Clean Water Act that could redefine what waterways are subject to regulations and protected from certain kinds of pollution nationwide.
Two listening sessions will be held on Wednesday at the Kanawha County Courthouse, the first from 2:30 to 4:15 p.m. and the second from 4:15 to ,6 p.m., according to a news release from the EPA. Attendees can participate virtually or in person by registering for the listening sessions here.
The federal agencies, according to the news release, are looking to “understand real-world perspectives and experiences” regarding how the “Waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, are defined in the Clean Water Act. 
Since the 1970s, WOTUS has been used to refer to nearly all waterways in the nation, including wetlands and smaller streams and tributaries that run adjacent to them. The term, however, has never been clearly defined, making regulation of certain waterways more difficult.
In 2023, a decision from the Supreme Court of the United States narrowed the protections and regulations for wetlands, which provide habitats for thousands of species of animals and plants and can play a crucial role in controlling floodplains in areas prone to flooding as well as naturally filtering drinking water.
The Supreme Court decision led to an amendment to the federal rule from the EPA, which has since been mired in litigation and contention. Under the amendment offered in 2023, more than half of the nation’s remaining wetlands have no EPA regulations or protections over them. 
In March, the EPA — operating under President Donald Trump’s direction — issued a new interpretation of the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision that further erodes protections, which experts say will disproportionately impact rural communities. 
Wetland conservancy groups and environmentalists from across the country have spoken out against the changes to the federal Clean Water Act. Meanwhile, the American Farm Bureau Federation — a lobbying group representing industrial farming throughout the nation — wants to see the changes made to relieve what they say is a burden for the farm industry, which is responsible for runoff and toxic pollution into thousands of tributaries and wetlands nationwide.

The Senate District 8 seat, which represents Okmulgee, Okfuskee and McIntosh counties and portions of Creek and Muskogee counties,  has been vacant all session, following the resignation of former Sen. Roger Thompson, R-Okemah. 
Republican Bryan Logan of Paden, Democrat Nathan Brewer and independent Steve Sanford, both of Henryetta, are on the ballot.
Logan, 41, is self-employed and a pastor at Paden Holiness Church.
He said he is running “to make a difference in the district.”
He said his top issues are education, health care, roads and infrastructure.
Brewer, 41, said the murder of his daughter at the hands of a sex offender motivated him to run.
Brewer, who is a small business owner and works full time for Okmulgee County, said not enough is being done to protect children and the community from sex offenders.
Brewer’s 15-year-old daughter, Brittany, was one of seven people killed in a murder-suicide on a rural property in May 2023.  Authorities said Jesse McFadden, who was a registered sex offender, killed his wife and five teenagers before killing himself. Brittany was visiting the property when the slayings occurred.
Brewer said he plans to prioritize increasing  mental health care availability in rural communities and growing funding for volunteer and rural fire departments.
Sanford, 58, is a member of the Henryetta City Council and owns Rustler’s BBQ.
“If you want to make a difference, you have to put yourself in a place where you can,” he said.
He would like to increase the availability of vocational education and help the community grow.

Schmidt was born in Germany but has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager. He is a legal permanent resident with a green card. On March 7, Schmidt, who currently lives in New Hampshire, was returning from Luxembourg when immigration officials detained him at Boston Logan International Airport and took him to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, according to his attorney.
His family told reporters and attorneys that upon being detained, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, violently interrogated, denied his medication for anxiety and depression, and given little food or water. They said officials asked him to relinquish his green card, and they didn’t know why he was being detained.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied the allegations.
“These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs for Customs and Border Protection previously said in a statement to the Bulletin. “When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”
The officials did not publicly provide justification for his detention.
Schmidt is not the subject of any active criminal proceedings. However, according to court records in California, he faced misdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence in 2015 and 2016, respectively, among other minor charges. His family said those cases had been resolved.
GBH News was the first to report the news of Schmidt’s release.
His detention came amid the Trump administration’s high-profile immigration agenda. That agenda has included a slew of deportations and immigration actions, including sending hundreds of men to a famously brutal prison in El Salvador. Among them is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the administration has acknowledged was mistakenly deported. International students who protested on their college campuses against Israeli military strikes on Palestinian civilians have also been detained.
Additionally, other Germans have faced issues at U.S. borders. The New York Times reported that two German tourists — Jessica Brösche, who was held for 46 days, and Lucas Sielaff, who was held for 16 — were detained at the border trying to enter the country for vacation. Tourists from Germany are typically allowed visa-free travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days, but they were held in detention centers for weeks and then deported.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis continued his full-fledged campaign on Friday to get the Florida Legislature to back his idea of providing immediate targeted property tax relief this year to Floridians, and for lawmakers to jettison their proposed sales tax cut.
Speaking in Tampa earlier this week, the governor declared that any tax package sent to his desk that features a sales tax component would be “dead on arrival.” That comment has now led to an apparent breakdown between legislative leaders in trying to come together on the state budget, which forced them late last week to extend the legislative session into June.
DeSantis and Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia said in Tampa this week that they have encountered very few members of the public who say they’d rather have a cut in the sales tax vs. property taxes, and a public opinion survey of Floridians released on Friday seems to back up the anecdotal evidence.
In the survey of 1,200 Floridians taken in April for the James Madison Institute, 46% said they support eliminating property taxes while 32% supported reducing sales taxes. Another 12% said they preferred keeping things status quo.
When asked whether they support eliminating property taxes by expanding the homestead exemption for primary residents, 65% said yes while just 24% opposed that proposal. Another 11% were unsure.
However, following that question up, 60% said that they were concerned about how elimination of property taxes would affect potential cuts to local services, such as law enforcement and public schools. Only 33% of voters said that they were not concerned about that outcome.
If policymakers want to eliminate property taxes, they would need to raise $43 billion (or $2,015 per Floridian) to maintain public services now funded with property tax revenue, the Florida Policy Institute recently wrote in a report titled, “A Risky Proposition.”
House Speaker Daniel Perez said last week that because the Florida Constitution prohibits the Legislature from exercising direct control over property taxes, any such reform would need to go before the voters on the November 2026 ballot. That’s why, he said, there is a need for his Select Committee on Property Taxes to study the issue.
The 37 lawmakers on the committee will prepare a Joint Resolution by this fall to allow lawmakers to put the question on the ballot next year. It would require 60% support to pass.
DeSantis has said that the committee has been set up to fail, noting that Perez appointed several “far-left Democrats” who the governor predicts will end up voting against such a proposal.
The James Madison Institute survey was conducted by Targoz Market Research of 1,200 voters, 43% of whom said they were Republicans, 33% Democrats, and 23% independent voters. It has a +/- margin of error of 2.77%.

(Photo: Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)A trio of federal judges appeared skeptical on Friday of arguments advanced by attorneys for the state of North Carolina in a voting rights case involving the issue of voting by people with past felony convictions. The state is seeking to overturn a lower court ruling that struck down a statute criminalizing voting by disenfranchised felons as racially discriminatory.
The case concerns a state law making it a felony for anyone who has lost their right to vote following a criminal conviction to cast a ballot unless they have had their right restored. The North Carolina A. Phillip Randolph Institute (APRI), a nonprofit affiliate of the AFL-CIO, filed suit in 2020 on the grounds that prosecuting individuals who unknowingly vote while ineligible is an unconstitutional violation of due process and equal protection rights. The nonprofit also contended that the law has a chilling effect on North Carolinians with criminal convictions who have since regained their eligibility.
In 2023, the General Assembly passed an updated version of the law — explicitly excluding unintentional voting violations from prosecution — and set it to take effect for any offenses taking place on or after Dec. 1 of that year. Federal Judge Loretta Biggs ruled in April 2024 that the prior statute unconstitutionally discriminated against Black North Carolinians on both grounds, and permanently enjoined its enforcement, finding that the legislature did not repeal the previous law when it rewrote it.
The North Carolina State Board of Elections appealed the ruling, arguing that: a) the district court should not have granted relief in light of the new law, b) APRI no longer had a concrete interest in the case, and c) the matter should be declared moot. The board did not dispute the contention that because North Carolina has no statute of limitations for felonies, voters could still face prosecution for ballots cast in past elections.

The panel on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals — judges James Wynn Jr., Pamela Harris, and DeAndrea Benjamin — grilled lawyers for the board and the state Conference of District Attorneys Friday on why they would want the law to remain on the books when it was replaced by a new statute in 2023, unless they sought to prosecute under the old law.
Terence Steed, an attorney with the North Carolina Department of Justice representing the board, noted that APRI was not challenging the new law and said “there’s no evidence in the record” that the previous law would be enforced, even if it legally could be.
“Can I ask why you’re here, then?” Harris asked. “If there will not be prosecutions under the old law, I truly don’t understand why you’re here.”
“There’s important principles of mootness in this case,” Steed replied. “When our office defends statutes, which it is frequently called upon to do, it is not uncommon — just as it is in Virginia and all the other states in the circuit and across the country — that the General Assembly, during the pendency of that litigation, might step in and amend the law to correct what the plaintiffs are concerned about.”
Harris said while that may be true, she had “never seen anything like this” in which a state nonetheless appeals an injunction against enforcing a law that has been made obsolete. She asked why the old law could still be enforced after the passage of its replacement, to which Steed replied that he was “not sure how it would work under North Carolina law, and that’s not an issue I was prepared for” — a statement that Wynn chided him for.
“I don’t understand at all what you’re arguing here when you say you don’t understand how it operates under North Carolina law,” Wynn said. “You’re representing the state of North Carolina, we expect you to know that.”
Judges also pressed Elizabeth O’Brien, an attorney with NCDOJ representing the Conference of District Attorneys, on whether she was arguing the state should be able to prosecute offenses prior to 2024 under the old law.
“I think that the way the statute was amended provides that those prosecutions could occur,” O’Brien said.
  Judge James A. Wynn Jr. expressed skepticism toward attorneys for North Carolina, noting that if they did not uphold the district court ruling, prosecutions could continue under the old statute. (File photo)
“That’s the point we’re making,” Wynn interjected. “You’ve just admitted, you just presented why it’s not moot. You say they could occur, and so if they can occur if we don’t uphold the district court, then essentially, you’re saying you should have two statutes you can prosecute under.”
Jonathan Youngwood, the attorney representing APRI, said if anything, the new law creates more of an interest in relief to prevent voter misinformation about their voting rights. He cited the confusion in the courtroom as evidence that voters with criminal convictions whose rights had been restored could easily be misled into thinking it was still unlawful for them to vote.
“North Carolina has no statute of limitations on felony charges. That means any person who voted in a prior election and some DA, someday decides could be subject to this old discriminatory law, could be prosecuted,” Youngwood said.
He said the General Assembly’s amendment was insufficient to counter this issue, arguing that because it said it is “effective to acts going forward,” it does not repeal the previous statute by implication. And he noted that at the time of discovery in 2022, there were 200 active cases related to the law. “All those cases could be live,” Youngwood said.
“Your Honor, I wish we could make some deal that there wouldn’t be future prosecutions. The only way we know it is the way we pursued it in the district court, which was to seek an order making it clear,” Youngwood said. “We hoped the case wouldn’t be appealed, it was appealed, and so we’re taking up your time this morning.”
Wynn asked whether it would be sufficient to uphold the district court order on only one of the grounds: either as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause or a violation of the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Youngwood replied that while he did not presume to tell them how to write their decision, either would be adequate relief so long as it would “permanently wipe the statute from the books.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fourth-Circuit-richmond-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

(Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Washington and 14 other states are suing the Trump administration over the president’s declaration of an “energy emergency” to speed up permitting for fossil fuel projects.
Issued the day of his inauguration, President Donald Trump’s executive order says inadequate domestic energy development and an unreliable grid warrant the national emergency. The order argues these issues are most pronounced in the Northeast and on the West Coast.
“Dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population,” the order reads. 
The order pushes federal agencies, like the Army Corps of Engineers, to use “any lawful emergency authorities” to “facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.”
In practice, this has meant bypassing or quickening reviews under the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Historic National Preservation Act for planned energy projects and giving the public less time to weigh in, according to the complaint filed Friday in federal court in Seattle. Washington and California lead the 15-state lawsuit.
The lawsuit cites a proposed 100-mile transmission line that would mostly run under the riverbed of the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. The project could be expedited despite water quality concerns.
Attorney General Nick Brown noted Trump’s order emphasizes oil and natural gas, while excluding renewable energy like wind and solar. 
“This is not a serious or lawful effort by the president,” Brown said in a press conference Friday. “It is all about limiting competition and shackling America to dirty fossil fuels forever.”
Last month, the Interior Department announced it would fast-track the approval of coal, gas, oil and mineral projects on public lands in light of Trump’s emergency declaration. Environmental reviews that can typically take a year would be shrunk to two weeks.
Meanwhile, the United States produces more oil and gas than any other country and production is growing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The energy emergency order is separate from one the president issued last month targeting state climate policies, including potentially Washington’s Climate Commitment Act.
Casey Sixkiller, the director of the state Department of Ecology, said the emergency declaration is “an abuse of authority.”
“Environmental regulations aren’t red tape,” Sixkiller told reporters. “There are guardrails that protect our air, water, land and keep people safe.” 
Bill Iyall, chair of the Cowlitz Tribe, said it’s difficult to weigh in on what projects will mean for the tribe’s land when they only have a week or two.
“We are there to advocate for our cultural and natural resources,” Iyall said. “Looking at a project individually, if you did it carefully and planned it carefully, you would be able to minimize those impacts and get a facilitated permit.”
The lawsuit asks a judge to declare the president’s order illegal and stop the issuance of emergency permits. The states are not seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately stop the Trump administration’s actions, as it has in other cases.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
This marks 17 lawsuits Brown has filed or joined against the Trump administration since January. Four of those came this week, over freezing permitting for wind energy development and funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, as well as dismantling the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3210-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

Patrick Morrisey on Friday issued guidance for how families who object to vaccines on religious and philosophical grounds can receive exemptions to the state’s school immunization requirements.,"A nurse administers a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to a patient in Utah.  (George Frey | Getty Images)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Friday issued guidance for how families who object to vaccines on religious and philosophical grounds can receive exemptions to the state’s school immunization requirements.
While the state’s compulsory school vaccination law has not changed, the governor does not intend to rescind his executive order granting religious and philosophical exemptions, according to a news release Friday.
“I am calling on the State Superintendent of Schools and the county boards of education in this state to work with the Bureau for Public Health to ensure that religious rights of students are protected,” Morrisey said. “Students will not be denied access to public education because of their religious objections to compulsory vaccination.”
In his letter Friday, Morrisey acknowledged that the state cannot compel private schools to exempt children without a statutory change, but he urged the schools to “honor the religious beliefs of their students and not turn them away because of their strongly held objections to vaccines.”
West Virginia state law includes one of the strongest school vaccination policies in the nation. All states require children attending school to be vaccinated for a number of infectious diseases, like polio and measles. West Virginia was one of only five states that allowed only medical exemptions to those vaccination requirements.
In a Jan. 14 executive order, Morrisey directed the State Health Officer and the Bureau for Public Health to establish a process for religious exemptions and come up with necessary rules and legislation to facilitate them. West Virginia’s last health officer, Dr. Matthew Christiansen, resigned in December. Morrisey has not appointed someone to fill the role.
State lawmakers rejected a bill that would have established religious exemptions in state code. The measure, Senate Bill 460, passed in the Senate but was rejected by the House of Delegates with a vote of 42 yeas and 56 nays.
The disagreement between the state’s executive and legislative branch has led to confusion among the state’s schools and daycare facilities. Some private schools in particular have said they’re not following the executive order.
The Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston — which operates 24 schools throughout the state — will not accept religious exemptions for required school vaccinations despite the executive order, Tim Bishop, communications director for the church, told West Virginia Watch this week.
West Virginia state School Superintendent Michele Blatt put out a memo to county boards of education on May 2 saying that since the state Legislature didn’t adopt the bill allowing religious exemptions, students who enroll with an exemption prior to May 1 would be allowed to finish the school year. But, the memo continued, students would not be allowed to enroll in the upcoming school year without the required immunizations. Before the day was over, Blatt rescinded the memo at Morrisey’s request and said the school system would work collaboratively with the governor’s office to issue guidance to counties about how to comply with the order.
According to the governor’s guidance, parents seeking a religious or philosophical exemption to a vaccine should send an email to vaccineexemption@wv.gov with the following information:


Name and date of birth of the student seeking an exemption


Name of the student’s parent or guardian


The school the student intends to enroll in


 A mailing address for the parent or guardian.


The Bureau for Public Health will mail a letter to the parent telling them whether the exemption has been granted, and a copy of the letter will be sent to the school, Morrisey’s letter says. Exemptions will be granted on a per-year basis.
Morrisey told public school officials that when a student receives an exemption, the exemption should be honored by the school the student is enrolled in and the student should be allowed to attend virtual and in-person classes without the vaccination they’re exempted from getting.
Morrisey’s executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a 2023 law signed by former Gov. Jim Justice. The law prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion unless it serves a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive way of achieving that interest. In his letter Friday, Morrisey argued that the order takes precedence over state law because the legislature wrote that the EPRA applies “notwithstanding any other provision of law.”
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, told West Virginia Watch earlier this week the Legislature has the authority to set the school vaccination policy and the governor does not. Garcia, an attorney by trade, said the matter would likely have to be settled by a lawsuit.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vaccination-shot.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Movement on a project to block invasive carp from the Great Lakes could be on the horizon, according to the Detroit News, which says President Donald Trump is expected to sign a memo Friday afternoon directing his administration to “expeditiously implement” measures to prevent their migration and expansion into the region. 
The memo offers its express support for the $1.15 billion Brandon Road Lock and Dam project, “provided that the State of Illinois does not stand in the way of its construction.”
Last July, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the state would cosponsor the project alongside the United States Army Corps. of Engineers and the state of Illinois. The project targets a critical pinch point near Joliet, Ill., and would implement a series of complex deterrents against invasive carp and other nuisance species. 
Whitmer pledged $64 million in support of the project, matching $50 million from Illinois and unlocking $274 million in federal funding for the effort.
While Michigan announced its first construction contract for the effort back in December, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a vocal Trump critic, has refused to move forward on the effort without a commitment from the president to supply the funds appropriated to the project, including $226 million allotted through President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan infrastructure law. 
During a meeting with Whitmer and Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall in April, Trump pledged to protect Lake Michigan, and by extension all of the Great Lakes, from the invasive fish. However, Pritzker remained unswayed, despite pressure from members of Michigan’s Republican Congressional delegation. 
Members of the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives advanced a bipartisan resolution on Wednesday calling on Pritzker to move forward with the project to prevent the carp from spreading into the Great Lakes. 
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that if invasive carp move into the Great Lakes, they could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region including rivers and inland lakes, and its $20 billion fishing and boating industries. 
The fish can grow up to 60 pounds and eat 40% of their body weight each day. A single female can produce one million eggs, with only 10 females and 10 males needed to establish a population in the Great Lakes.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.
“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.
A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
 Funding to help victims recover

Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.
In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
 Underreported to police

Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.
Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

Without directly addressing the merits of Iowa’s law restricting the dissemination of government records in languages other than English, the court found that the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa lacked standing to bring its lawsuit challenging the state’s application of the English Language Reaffirmation Act.
Joe Enriquez Henry, president of LULAC Council #307, said he was disappointed in the court’s decision.
“There are over 50,000 registered voters in the state of Iowa whose primary language is not English,” Henry said. “This issue has an impact not only on Latinos but other ethnic groups and new citizens. This is a constitutional issue. You know, the right to vote is a constitutional issue, and language should never be a barrier to exercising that right. So, for the Supreme Court to say we lack standing to bring this case is totally wrong.”

Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said in a statement: “I appreciate the court’s thoughtful consideration of this case. Today’s ruling affirms our efforts to administer Iowa election laws securely, fairly, and in accordance with state and federal laws. We remain committed to maintaining a careful balance between protecting election integrity and supporting voter participation among all eligible Iowa voters.”
Friday’s ruling is tied to a 2007 case in which LULAC was not a party. In that case, a group that included then-U.S. Rep. Steve King, four county auditors, three state legislators and U.S. English Only Inc. filed a lawsuit against Iowa’s secretary of state and the Iowa Voter Registration Commission challenging the provision of voter registration forms in languages other than English.
The district court dismissed the claims of everyone but the county auditors, ruling only they had the standing to challenge the practice, and in 2008 ruled in favor of the auditors, finding that the Iowa English Language Reaffirmation Act unambiguously required all official government documents to be in English. While noting that language barriers could “serve as an impediment to voting” and that exceptions outlined in the law “might justify the use of non-English voter registration forms,” the judge noted that the secretary of state had never raised that argument.
The district court enjoined the secretary of state and the Iowa Voter Registration Commission “from using languages other than English in the official voter registration forms of this state.”
Thirteen years later, in 2021, LULAC sued Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the Iowa Voter Registration Commission, and several county auditors, arguing the law, correctly interpreted, allowed for the dissemination of voting materials in languages other than English.  The district court ultimately granted LULAC’s requests to dissolve the 2008 injunction.
Pate’s office appealed, and in addressing the matter, the Iowa Supreme Court said the primary question it faced was whether LULAC had standing to seek dissolution of the 13-year-old permanent injunction issued in the initial case and to seek a court interpretation of a law that did not cause any injury to LULAC itself.
In its ruling Friday, the justices concluded the district court’s 2008 decision “had no effect on LULAC’s rights, status, or legal relations … LULAC asks us to direct Secretary Pate to administer the law as LULAC wishes and to allow county officials to have the discretion to administer the law as LULAC wishes. In effect, LULAC is asking the judiciary to exercise the executive functions of the government at LULAC’s behest. This the court cannot do.”
As for LULAC’s argument that it had standing in the case due to the injury it suffered by having to spend money translating documents for members, the justices noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled that a litigant “cannot spend its way into standing simply by expending money” in response to a law it is attempting challenge.
In finding that LULAC lacked standing to bring its lawsuit, the justices reversed the rulings of the district court and remanded the case back to district court for an order of dismissal. All of the justices concurred in the opinion, except for Justices Thomas D. Waterman and Edward M. Mansfield, who did not take part.

These mega-plants could soon compete with existing industries to buy timber, wood chips, and sawmill residues as raw material for wood pellet manufacture.  The wood pellets would be exported and burned in power plants in Asia to generate electricity. 
Some critics have raised concerns about how these industrial-scale wood pellet plants could lead to the overharvesting of Pacific Northwest forests, similar to how large swaths of forests in the southeastern U.S. were logged despite promises that the plants would only use leftover timber scraps. This is a serious concern, compounded by recent federal cuts that could lead to lax forestry oversight. But another equally important concern on the minds of Washington residents is this: How will our health be harmed?
These concerns are not hypothetical. Those of us who live in the communities targeted for pellet-plant construction are learning about the serious health impacts associated with these plants. We have spent hours on the phone talking with people who live in the South, where the wood pellet industry is already established.      
There’s no way around it – producing wood pellets from forest biomass is dirty, noisy and bad for our health. Making industrial wood pellets releases hazardous air pollutants, dust and fine particles. Colleagues from the South who live near these facilities describe how dust is ever-present in the air, clinging to every surface and burrowing deep into residents’ lungs.
Micro-particles are released by industrial biomass plants, worsening asthma, causing other significant respiratory issues and can even trigger heart attacks in vulnerable individuals. The release of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less is of particular concern because these particles penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream.
Other pollutants emitted in large quantities include acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, both probable carcinogens, and acrolein, a toxic substance that affects the eyes, skin, nose, and throat and can cause respiratory disease. 
And then there’s the noise. Hammer mills, the machines that break down trees and wood chips into the wood fibers used to make the pellets, are described as “like the loudest train whistle you’ve ever heard, but constant.” The facility proposed for Hoquiam, similar in size to the plant proposed for Longview, is less than a mile from the Hoquiam High School and Middle School buildings and even closer to the Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge, one of the most important stopovers for migratory birds on the entire Pacific flyway.  
One of the pellet companies trying to set up in Washington, Drax Global, a U.K. company positioning to open the Longview plant, currently operates wood pellet plants in several southern states. In the last few years, the state of Mississippi fined Drax $2.5 million for violating air emissions limits, and Drax agreed to pay $3.2 million in pollution-related settlements in Louisiana.
Fortunately, we’ve learned about the harms to communities from these plants before they’ve taken root in the Northwest. In Hoquiam, local and national conservation groups challenged an air discharge permit for Pacific Northwest Renewable Energy on the grounds that its pollution estimates were too low. A Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board hearing for this appeal is planned for May. 
Drax was similarly moving forward with its facility in Longview but withdrew its permit following scrutiny by its regional clean air agency.
We oppose the construction of these wood pellet plants in Hoquiam and Longview because of the pollution these plants would bring, and because the industry has not been honest about the health harms they cause in nearby communities.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1302915966-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

Spencer Cox and his cabinet hold a news conference to announce GRIT, a new government efficiency initiative, at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on May 9, 2025. (Courtesy of the Governor's Office)Gov. Spencer Cox signed an executive order on Friday launching a new government efficiency initiative called GRIT — Utah’s take on DOGE. 
But when pressed on whether it will lead to employee layoffs, Cox said he didn’t expect so because he sees the Government Reform, Innovation and Transparency project as yet another budgeting exercise on top of several that state leaders already practice to spend taxpayer dollars wisely in Utah’s $30.8 billion budget. 
“I’m not out there looking to just cut a whole bunch of jobs,” Cox told reporters during a news conference at the Utah Capitol, though he added, “we may need to move some people in some other ways that will be better. … But we’re trying to empower our employees to make things better, not trying to make our employees scared of their jobs.” 
Trump insists ‘good people’ shouldn’t lose their federal jobs, despite mass firings

But “the short answer is yes,” Cox said when asked whether GRIT was Utah’s version of the Department of Government Efficiency that was launched under President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to slash federal spending. 
However, Cox also said he hesitated to directly compare the two initiatives, because Utah leaders already do “about 10 things every year that the federal government hasn’t done in about 50 years” to audit government programs for efficiency. 
“DOGE is awesome and I desperately want DOGE to work,” Cox said. “We have a bloated federal government that is a disaster. We’ve been begging for something like DOGE for decades, and I’m so excited that it’s actually happening.” 
But as far as Utah is concerned, he said, “we do DOGE like six times a year in this state every single year.”
“We DOGE the hell out of our budget every single year,” Cox said, to chuckles from his cabinet leadership members standing behind him. “We were DOGE before DOGE was a thing. We were DOGE when it wasn’t cool, and we will be DOGE long after it is cool.” 
The Republican-controlled state already has several layers of yearly budgeting processes where both the executive and legislative branches hunt for cuts.

The governor’s office does it while preparing its budget recommendation to the Legislature. Lawmakers sitting on legislative committees go through their own process, line item by line item. Then legislative leaders on the powerful Executive Appropriations Committee make the near-final decisions, deciding what new funding requests get prioritized, what doesn’t, and what should be cut. Then the Utah Legislature votes as a whole on the state’s budget, which is balanced every single year. Finally, the governor can also use his pen to veto budget line items, if he wishes. 
Plus, legislative auditors also pick several agencies a year to find inefficiencies, which Cox likened to “going to get your physical exam when you’re 50.”  
So why GRIT? Cox said it’s because “the question I always have is, how can we be better?”
“You don’t stay No. 1 by just doing the things that you’ve always done,” he said. “We have to be constantly improving.” 
For 18th year, Utah ranks No. 1 for best economic outlook. What could threaten its top spot?

That was one piece of praise that leaders from the “limited government” think tank, the American Legislative Exchange Council, offered to Utah when they ranked the state’s economic outlook No. 1 for the 18th year in a row last month. Cox pointed to that ranking — and the U.S. News & World report ranking Utah the No. 1 best state in the nation for a third straight year earlier this week — as evidence that Utah is the “best managed state.” 
“(ALEC) said if we had just stopped 18 years ago, where we were when we were first No. 1, we would now be 22nd or 23rd,” the governor said. “So we’ve been able to maintain that by constantly reinventing ourselves, looking for ways to do things better.” 
Through Utah’s existing fiscal conservatism, “we’ve already done all the low-hanging fruit.” 
“That’s the difference between this and DOGE,” he said, saying the federal government has “so much low-hanging fruit,” while Utah will have to reach higher. “It’s going to be harder for us, for sure, but we know it can be done.” 
Pressed on whether GRIT could mean cuts to services — including social services — Cox said that’s not the aim. 
“It’s not (about) reducing services. It’s improving services,” he said, adding that he’d like to see any savings found to be recommitted toward making programs better, like perhaps moving people up on social services’ wait lists. 
“That’s ultimately what we’re trying to do, is not to just cut back what’s already working and helping people,” Cox said, “it’s so we can help people more and fill some of those gaps that are already out there and broken.”

What will GRIT do? 
Cox called GRIT “a comprehensive effort to make Utah’s government more efficient, more accountable, and more responsible to the people that it serves.” 
The governor said GRIT will have a “bottom-up” approach, involving state government employees to ask “tough questions about what is actually working, what’s wasting time and money, and what needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.” 
“If something isn’t delivering value to the citizens of this state, we should stop doing it, and do something else with those limited resources that we have,” he said.

With GRIT, “we are really going to empower even more our cabinet members and our employees — every one of our employees.” 
“We’re expecting them to bring real solutions,” he said. “And we’ll be holding them accountable to doing exactly that.” 
Additionally, Cox said state leaders will welcome feedback from Utahns about what is and isn’t working for them. 
Under Cox’s executive order, all state agencies will be required to: 

Submit at least one efficiency improvement project to the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget no later than July 1. 
Direct each division, office or bureau to independently launch at least one additional internal efficiency project. 
Participate in the state’s Efficiency and Process Improvement Collaborative, an advisory committee made up of representatives from state agencies that is tasked with fostering a culture of continuous improvement. 
Use public feedback gathered from the state’s Customer Experience Initiative, a program the Legislature created in 2020 that collects feedback from Utahns’ experiences with state employees and issues annual reports for improvement. 
Report “measurable results related to cost savings, time savings, and improved service delivery,” according to the governor’s office. 

The governor’s office encouraged Utahns to participate in the initiative by using QR codes that will be posted on receipts and in government buildings across the state, wherever Utahns engage with state services. They can also submit feedback online. 
For transparency, Cox also said the state will be “standing up dashboards” to show the initiative’s progress, “how much money we’ve been able to save, and how much time we’ve been able to shave off.” 
Cox said state leaders have “purposefully” not set a firm dollar amount of how much taxpayer money they’d like to save through the GRIT process because he said he wants to let agencies go through the exercise first. 
“We will eventually get to a goal, but I want to hear the best ideas,” he said, though while looking around at his cabinet members he added “we want this to be uncomfortable for the people standing behind me.” 
“That’s how you sharpen the saw.”

For years, outdoors enthusiasts in New Mexico have pushed to overhaul the state Department of Game & Fish — an agency plagued by leadership turnover, funding woes and the scorn of hunters and tree-huggers alike.
Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”
New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.
Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.




We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director



This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.
Political appointees set state wildlife policy. Critics say that’s a problem.
Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

Efforts to lobby Wyoming’s congressional delegation and administratively reauthorize the Wind River Reservation-focused office have not yet resulted in any assurances. 
The post Tribes urge Trump to undo planned DOGE closure of Fish and Wildlife’s Lander Conservation Office appeared first on WyoFile .","FORT WASHAKIE—Art Lawson sometimes feels like he’s doing the work of five people in his job overseeing wildlife on the Wind River Indian Reservation, a Yellowstone-sized landscape that’s home to the full suite of native species, from grizzly bears to wolverines. 
The Department of Government Efficiency’s planned closure of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Lander Conservation Office after its lease ends in March could increase the Shoshone and Arapaho Fish and Game director’s workload further yet. 
“That would give me three more jobs to do,” Lawson told WyoFile from his office this week. “It would put us in a world of hurt, without those guys.” 
The possible loss of the Lander Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office, which is devoted to assisting the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes, was worrisome enough that Lawson decamped from his west-central Wyoming home this spring to try to sway the outcome. 
“We hadn’t gotten any responses,” Lawson said. “I even flew to DC to get questions answered.”

But meetings with U.S. Sen. John Barrasso and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman — two-thirds of Wyoming’s congressional delegation — yielded nothing, he said.
“They didn’t have any information to give,” Lawson said. 
The absence of information suggests that Wyoming’s delegation is also being kept in the dark about the reported federal office closures — there are at least seven — affecting their constituents.
Started by biologist Richard Baldes in the 1970s, the office and the Fish and Wildlife Service’s presence in the area were instrumental to the establishment of a tribal game code and the return of species like pronghorn and bighorn sheep, which had been drastically reduced by decades of unregulated hunting. 
“Dick Baldes, and everything he’s done in the past, it could all be wiped away in the blink of an eye,” Lawson said. “It’s pretty scary.” 
Lawson, who is a Northern Arapaho member, is not alone in encouraging the federal government to reconsider the planned closure of the Lander facility. This spring, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s business council signed off on a resolution that emphasized its support for the federal facility.

“Be it further resolved, that the Shoshone Business Council urges the federal government to restore funding for the Land[er] Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office and cease efforts to eliminate, reduce, or dismantle this office so that these critical activities and federal trust responsibilities continue,” the resolution reads. 
According to its website, the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Lander Office and the agency’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program have assisted in the restoration of over 50,000 acres of sage-steppe, 1,700 acres of wetlands and 26 miles of river. 
Support from the Eastern Shoshone Business Council was unanimous, the resolution stated. 
WyoFile’s efforts to reach the Northern Arapaho Business Council, whose members share the Wind River Indian Reservation with the Eastern Shoshone, were unsuccessful. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service’s leadership under the Trump administration is likely to include at least one official who’s familiar with the agency’s Lander Conservation Office. Wyomingite Josh Coursey, a longtime president of the Muley Fanatic Foundation, was presidentially appointed to a yet-to-be-titled Fish and Wildlife Service post last month. And the nominee for director, Brian Nesvik, is a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s cleared his first two congressional hearings and is awaiting confirmation from the full U.S. Senate.

Jason Baldes — Richard Baldes’ son — played a role in the Eastern Shoshone’s resolution. He said it remains to be seen if Nesvik will use his influence to advocate for the Lander office’s continuation. (Disclosure: Jason Baldes’ wife, Patti Baldes, is a member of WyoFile’s board of directors, which has no editorial oversight.)
“I would think that [Nesvik] would be amenable to understanding the tribe’s position, and that he wouldn’t dispute the importance of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s presence,” Jason Baldes said. “But how far is he going to take that? Is he going to ensure that the Lander Field Office remains?” 
In 1982, the Service’s Lander Conservation Office had been slated to close, according to Richard Baldes. Ultimately, however, it survived thanks to support from the tribes and Wyoming’s congressional delegation.

Some 43 years later, the push from Lawson, Baldes and the Eastern Shoshone Tribe has not yet produced the same outcome. Administratively, Fish and Wildlife staffers have also put in a request to reauthorize the Lander Conservation Office, according to a source familiar with the situation. WyoFile is granting the person anonymity because of fear of reprisal. But at least so far, efforts to protect one of Fish and Wildlife’s only offices focused on tribal land wildlife have fallen flat.
“It’s still canceled,” the source said. “Everybody is frustrated.” Fish and Wildlife’s public affairs office in Washington, D.C. — the regional communication teams were recently eliminated — did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiry by the time this story was published.

A legislative committee voted to draft 10 bills related to Wyoming’s elections at its first off-season meeting Thursday. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers go full steam ahead on election reform — again appeared first on WyoFile .","LANDER—Wyoming lawmakers filed a record number of election-related bills in this winter’s general session, but they showed little sign of slowing down Thursday on plans to remake the state’s election system. 
During its first meeting of the legislative off-season, the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee voted to draft 10 pieces of election legislation. The bills range from banning ballot drop boxes and restricting independent candidates, to codifying hand-count audits of ballots and curtailing the use of student IDs and Medicaid and Medicare insurance cards as acceptable forms of voter identification. 
The slate represents just a fraction of the 45 bills filed in 2025, but is a considerable number for a committee to undertake heading into a legislative budget session when bills face a steeper initial hurdle compared to a general session. 
The legislation will, however, have the advantage of being well-trodden ground for lawmakers. Each of the 10 bills will be modeled after 2025 measures that failed only a few months ago. Several have long been hailed by Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who encouraged lawmakers Thursday to reconsider roughly 20 bills from the last session. 
That was too big a bite for the committee. 
“It’s kind of unrealistic for any committee to carry 20 bills into a session, especially a budget session,” Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, told the committee. “And we haven’t even touched on all the other issues we’ve got today.”
Electricity issues alongside 911 system funding and outage reporting were topics scheduled for that afternoon, while on Friday, the committee was set to discuss elected officials’ associations, public record laws and commercial transaction regulations. 
Meanwhile, the secretary encouraged lawmakers to keep the door open on some of the more sweeping election measures from 2025, including a ban on all electronic election equipment, including voting machines, tabulators and pollbooks.
“It’s something that we really need to be examining,” Gray said when pressed by House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, to clarify his stance on banning such equipment.

Gray also pointed to a forthcoming report from U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard regarding electronic voting equipment. The report is the result of an executive order by President Donald Trump from March that would largely put elections under presidential control. 
Gray’s predecessor, Ed Buchanan, put considerable efforts into debunking misinformation about Wyoming’s electronic voting equipment, including publishing a collection of facts about election integrity and security on the office’s website. After Gray took office, the website vanished. 
Ahead of the 2020 election, as the website detailed, Wyoming replaced its outdated voting equipment, none of which has the hardware or software required to allow internet connectivity, nor does the tabulation computer in each county have the hardware or software required to allow internet connectivity.
Gray’s comments Thursday followed a demonstration by several county clerks of the voting machines used across the state. 
“We have no intention of swaying your opinions about electronic voting systems, or to sell you on anything,” Platte County Clerk Malcolm Ervin told the committee. 
“Instead, we just want to provide information about what we are doing to allow you further context when you make decisions regarding those systems,” he said. “Again, our goal is not to lobby you, but our goal is to provide information.” 
Ervin pointed to a survey published by the Wyoming Survey & Analysis Center at the University of Wyoming in November ahead of the general election. It found that almost 90% of Wyoming adults believed their county’s tally of ballots for president in the 2025 election would be very or somewhat reliable. 
“This survey shows that confidence in elections grows when administrators of that election are close to home,” Ervin said. 
As part of their demonstration, the clerks walked lawmakers through their election timeline, dotted with dozens of deadlines. 
The clerks also used an electronic tabulator identical to the ones used in Wyoming’s elections to hold a mock election. Committee members filled out ballots deciding their favorite pet and school subject, and were then tasked with looking over the shoulders of election staff as they parsed out the results.

An identical election would be held at Baldwin Creek Elementary, Fremont County Clerk Julie Freese told lawmakers. 
“You might be a tough crowd, but the toughest crowd you’ll ever find is the group of fifth graders,” Freese said. “You’ll get every question under the sun. They are pretty amazing.”
For about half the Joint Corporations Committee, this is their first term as lawmakers, so Thursday’s meeting was also their first interim meeting. Plus, the majority of the committee is now made up of members and allies of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — the further-right wing of the Republican party in the Legislature. And most of the election bills of the 2025 session were sponsored by Freedom Caucus associates, who have said voters gave them a loud and clear mandate via the very system they want to reform. 
Several of those voters testified at the meeting. 
“The silent majority is finding their voice and speaking up and saying, ‘We need changes. We need things done,’” Patricia Junek told the committee. 
Junek lost a bid for the Legislature in 2022, and has since led a charge in Campbell County to count ballots by hand.
“I’m not going to single out any one bill that was presented by our secretary of state. I support every single one of them,” Junek said. 
But none of those bills focus on fixing the real issues with Wyoming’s elections, Phyllis Roseberry told the committee. 
“We do have a problem, and that is that our people are not turning out to vote. Twenty-seven percent of eligible voters in Wyoming voted in the primary this last year,” Roseberry, a former Washakie County pollworker, said. 
Roseberry was among the roughly 30 members of the League of Women Voters who filled the room in support of the county clerks. 
The committee’s next meeting is set for August, when members will have the option to draft additional election-related bills. At the very least, the committee will discuss the possibility of removing political parties from the election code after the Wyoming Republican Party disregarded a state law and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling at its officer elections in Cody last weekend. The matter is now the subject of a lawsuit.

CHICAGO — The Trump administration took the unprecedented step of halting work on the next National Climate Assessment last week, dismissing all 400 volunteer scientists who were tasked with writing the new version of the report.

Illinois State Climatologist Trent Ford was among those dismissed in his volunteer capacity with the federal program. On April 28, Ford and his colleagues received an email saying the upcoming Sixth National Climate Assessment, due to be released in 2027, is “currently being reevaluated in accordance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990.”

The Global Change Research Act mandates that the National Climate Assessment be published every four years to inform the public of the ongoing impacts, risks and responses to climate change. In the last 35 years, the federal government has never failed to publish the nation’s preeminent report on climate change, but its fate was brought into question last month when it was reported that NASA canceled a critical contract for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversees the assessment.

“It’s disappointing from a personal standpoint,” said Ford, who served as a technical contributor to the Fifth National Climate Assessment published in 2023. He said he was looking forward to taking on a larger role as an author of the Midwest chapter in the next report, which was due in 2027.

He and the other authors of the Midwest chapter had already begun planning what topics the next report should focus on, like the effects of extreme heat on farmers and farm workers, livestock and even mental health, “something that the Midwest chapter hadn’t done previously,” Ford said.

Illinois researchers have always played a role in the National Climate Assessment. University of Illinois emeritus professor Donald Wuebbles has contributed to all five previous reports, including serving as a lead author of the fourth assessment in 2017.

He said his greatest concern is that the report could now move forward under a different team of scientists hand-picked by President Donald Trump, who has a history of denying climate change as a “hoax.”

“There’s a group of denialists out there,” Wuebbles said. “They let their politics affect their science.”

The National Climate Assessment is meant to help policymakers understand the immediate threats of rising global temperatures to the environment in their region and implement solutions at the local level.

“Almost all impacts of climate change are local,” Ford said.

In Illinois, those impacts include heavy rainfall and flooding, heat waves and drought in the summer, and natural disasters like tornadoes, which can lead people to become displaced and cost the state billions of dollars in damage, according to Ford.

A 2021 Illinois climate change assessment, which Wuebbles led and Ford co-authored, cites extreme flooding in the spring of 2019 as an example of how climate change is already impacting Illinois. Crop yield losses that year led to a record number of Prevented Plant claims and crop insurance payouts to farmers by the state. Similar events are expected to occur more often and with more intensity if global temperatures continue to increase at the current rate, the 2021 assessment found.

“Climate change isn’t going to stop by ignoring it,” Ford said. “If we don’t have the assessment, we don’t know what to expect, and therefore we can’t plan. Is it (climate change) going to cost $5 billion to the economy, or is it going to be $10 billion?”

The Trump administration is reportedly not going to track the cost of major natural disasters any longer.

Ford shared Wuebbles' concerns that the next assessment, if published, could be influenced by Trump’s anti-climate change regulation agenda. He also said without the involvement of a diverse group of researchers, the next assessment could fail to represent the interests of the states.

“We are, as experts, tasked with assessing what kinds of problems and solutions are worth including in the National Climate Assessment,” Ford said. “But if this is being disbanded, who’s going to be leading this?... Probably not people from Illinois.”

Trump’s White House has fueled these concerns, saying climate change regulations threaten the president’s goal of “unleashing American energy.” He described state and local climate policies as “burdensome and ideologically motivated,” saying they” “threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.”

This is paired with a recent move by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zelden to repeal the endangerment finding of 2009, the agency’s official recognition of greenhouse gases as harmful to human health and the planet.

Proposed Illinois legislation could fill gaps in research

Amid national setbacks to climate change research and environmental policy, Illinois lawmakers are continuing to advance progressive climate legislation at the state level, such as Illinois Senate Bill 1859, referred to as the Climate Displacement Act. That measure cleared the state Senate and is awaiting action in the House.

If passed, the act would establish a state task force to assess and provide recommendations for how Illinois can prepare for the impacts of climate change — specifically, an anticipated influx of climate-displaced people moving to the Midwest from other parts of the U.S.

Sponsors say the bill was informed by the Fifth National Climate Assessment, which projected a trend of increased migration of people away from coastal areas over the next 20-30 years, due to greater frequency of natural disasters. The task force would evaluate ways Illinois might proactively respond, and what the cost burden of that response would be. An initial report of its findings would be due in 2026.

“There’s not a lot of states that are proactively doing this kind of planning despite, you know, the looming danger,” said Senate bill sponsor Sen. Graciela Guzmán, D-Chicago.

Rep. Blaine Wilhour, R-Beecher City, criticized the measure in an Energy and Environment committee hearing.

“Is this task force going to study the outmigration as a result of some of our climate policies in this state, specifically the outmigration of good union jobs?” he asked.

House bill sponsor Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said the proposed task force would work to project those trends. Wilhour said if the task force were to include relevant union stakeholders, he would consider supporting the bill.

The bill passed the House Energy and Environment Committee, and now moves to the House floor.

Illinois has a track record of enacting progressive climate policies, which Ford said is the silver lining to an otherwise difficult situation for climate scientists.

“They don’t have to follow the science,” he said. “But they’re at least informed by the science at the state level in Illinois. We’re at least doing that.”

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Twenty-one agency leaders, health industry professionals, disability advocates and others will look to contain Medicaid spending on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy — while ensuring continued care for thousands of young, autistic Hoosiers — the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) announced Friday.
Gov. Mike Braun directed the agency to create the working group in a February executive order. A report featuring three cost-containment recommendations is due by December.
ABA therapy is commonly used to improve social, communication and learning skills in children and young adults with autism or other developmental disorders. Some critics, however, object to the teaching tool and say it encourages compliance over independence. Additionally, some practitioners coupled it with electroshock therapy as late as 2022.

Indiana Medicaid spending on ABA therapy has risen over time:
2019: $120 million
2020: $102 million
2021: $276 million
2022: $420 million
2023: $639 million
Source: Indiana Capital Chronicle reporting

Nevertheless, it’s increasingly popular. Families, however, often struggle to access the therapy because of the price, limited insurance coverage and other health care industry stumbling blocks.
State coffers are also taking a hit.
Indiana Medicaid expenditures for ABA therapy rose from about $14 million in 2017 to $120 million in 2019, according to FSSA, then dipped to $102 million in 2020 — still the second-highest in the nation, per U.S. Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General.
The cost surge prompted the federal office to audit Indiana’s 2019 and 2020 ABA payments. The 2024 report found at least $56 million in improper payments — citing problems with documentation, diagnostic evaluations, staff credentials, referrals and more. It recommended that Indiana refund more than $39 million to the federal government.
Soaring totals since then have prompted greater scrutiny from Hoosier leaders worried Medicaid costs are growing too much, too fast. The financial pressure has only worsened.
A grim April revenue forecast forced lawmakers to cut $2 billion in spending out of the state’s next two-year, now-$44 billion budget.
Braun’s order charged the working group with evaluating cost-containment strategies that “minimize the negative impact felt by enrollees and their families.”

He directed the group to evaluate the “best” clinical care models to provide the right therapy in the right setting at the right ages. The order sought recommendations for “a better coordinated experience” for children, “but in a financially sustainable manner.”
Under the order, group members must also consider potentially implementing quality metrics for ABA services, caps on the number of therapy hours per week, caps on the number of months children can receive the therapy, an appeals process for “extenuating circumstances” along with new provider enrollment and billing requirements.
The “comprehensive review” of ABA therapy in Indiana should “identify key drivers of Medicaid expenditures,” Friday’s news release read. 
An evaluation must be completed by September 30. A written report has to include three recommendations for “meaningful” cost-containment, plus the advantages and disadvantages for each recommendation. That’s due to Braun by November 30.
The working group’s members include:

FSSA staff, some of whom lead disability and Medicaid utilization efforts
Health care industry representatives, including a pediatrician, psychiatrist and a health insurance company lobbyist
Autism, other disability and special education organization advocates
State lawmakers
Other parents

Controversy over ABA cuts ensnarled Braun’s predecessor, former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Families rallied repeatedly, urging Holcomb and his FSSA to reconsider.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new Oklahoma law will prohibit schools from inflicting physical pain as punishment for students with disabilities.
Although the practice is already banned in the state’s regulations for schools, attempts by the Oklahoma Legislature to add the rule to state law failed in previous years. State law had barred schools from using corporal punishment on students only with “the most significant cognitive disabilities.” 
Senate Bill 364 extends the corporal punishment prohibition to students with any type of disability defined in a federal law known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Thursday permitted SB 364 to take effect without his signature. The bill had passed the state Senate in a 31-16 vote and the House 63-25 after lengthy debates in both chambers.
It outlaws the “deliberate infliction of physical pain by hitting, paddling, spanking, slapping or any other physical force” as a method of discipline for students with disabilities.
“While many schools already prohibit corporal punishment, there are still instances where it is used against children who may struggle to control their behavior or grasp the consequences of their actions,” said Sen. Dave Rader, R-Tulsa, an author of SB 364.
Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, has been an outspoken opponent of the measure. He said the bill was overbroad because it extends to students who have no type of cognitive disability. He said it also limits parents’ choice to decide how schools should discipline their children.
State law previously allowed parents to waive the corporal punishment ban by giving written consent. SB 364 removes that provision.
More than 100 school districts in Oklahoma permit corporal punishment.
The rate of students disciplined with this method has declined nationwide, and 27 states ban the practice entirely, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. 
Students with disabilities were overrepresented among the children who experienced corporal punishment at school, as were Black and Indigenous students, federal data shows.

Matt Bronson, a disabled U.S. Air Force veteran, and Liz Bronson, a nurse practitioner at Children’s Nebraska, say that each day is a fight for their “beautiful little son,” Teddy, including any measures possible to reduce his seizures. That included a groundbreaking half-day neurosurgery at Children’s just a few years ago with a robotic surgical assistant.
At a public forum this weekend for medical cannabis regulations, which the Bronsons say could help ease Teddy’s pain, Matt Bronson said his son is at 85% higher risk of losing his life each night. But each morning, Liz and Matt greet their son.
“I get to see my son smile, I get to hear him babble, and damn it, he is seven and a half years old and he’s walking,” Matt Bronson told an often raucous, cheering public forum crowd in Omaha on May 4. “Three years ago, he was in a wheelchair.”

Data shows Teddy is improving, “but any seizure can take him,” Liz Bronson said. Quoting the family’s California-based epileptologist, Liz Bronson said, “We can either pass evidence-based, well-regulated legislation, or we can sign more death certificates.”
“We come here before you today to say that, ‘I’m sorry, but Teddy matters,’ and that our family matters and that the suffering individuals in this state matter,” Liz Bronson said.
A continued fight
In a more than decade-long fight for medical cannabis in Nebraska, through three election cycles, numerous legislative bills and multiple court fights, the Bronsons are among those who have consistently fought for access to the medicine.
Voters overwhelmingly approved legalizing medical cannabis in November. It was approved by 71% of voters, and just a slightly smaller percentage, 68%, approved the basic outlines of a regulatory system.
The Bronsons were among hundreds of Nebraskans who attended public forums May 3 in La Vista, May 4 in Omaha or May 5 in Lincoln. Most shared a similar message: Medical cannabis is legal in Nebraska, and the “will of the voters” must be implemented.

But how the state should do so differed among the dozens of speakers who addressed a bipartisan group of 13 state senators spread between the three events on Legislative Bill 677, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, a bill meant to clarify regulations. Senators estimated at least 300 attendees.
Some speakers linked the fight with legislative efforts to water down minimum wage and paid sick leave protections passed in the 2022 and 2024 statewide elections. 
Others linked LB 677 to LB 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, a priority of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who has escalated his opposition to LB 677 and all products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. LB 316 essentially reclassifies “hemp” as “marijuana.” Opponents call it a “de facto ban” on nearly all THC or hemp products.
Hilgers said Wednesday that it was never his intention to use LB 316 against the ballot measures. Hansen is working to make explicit in Kauth’s bill that it does not conflict with the ballot measures or LB 677.
Nebraska attorney general steps up medical cannabis opposition, regulatory bill awaits debate

Hilgers said his “heart goes out” to anyone in pain who feels they can’t access something they feel could alleviate the hurt. However, he said he must uphold federal laws against marijuana despite dozens of states approving medical or recreational cannabis.
“I think two plus two is four, even if everyone else says two plus two is five,” Hilgers said this week when he launched a law enforcement campaign against LB 677.
Speakers at this month’s forums blasted LB 677 for its compromises, including prohibiting smoking cannabis, specifying 15 “qualifying conditions,” allowing no more than 30 medical dispensaries and requiring a patient or caregiver to pay up to $45 for a registry card under the new state regulatory system.
Among those was Ethan Stankus of Bellevue, who said that if he’d known there would be a smoking ban, conditions list or other “needless compromises,” he would have voted “nay.”
“This is not what we voted for,” Stankus said, holding up a breakdown of the amendment to LB 677, asking why Nebraskans needed to take time to reexplain their vote.
‘100% of the apple’
For Hansen and supporters, the need for the bill is complicated, illustrated, for instance, when many attendees criticized the regulations for being housed in a new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that shares resources and staff with the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission.
That was part of the ballot measure, partly in response to consistent opposition to medical cannabis from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Across the dozens of speakers, only one, the state’s former longtime state epidemiologist in DHHS, Tom Safranek, raised hesitation about the voter-approved laws, for a “potential for societal damage.” 
DHHS also opposes LB 677.

Due to constitutional constraints with ballot measures — including the need to stick to a “single subject” — supporters were limited in what they could present to voters. Supporters of LB 677 say it would provide clearer guidance before the commission acts.
The proposal also seeks to aid a voter-enacted deadline for the commission to write the regulations, which is currently July 1. The commission, in court filings, has said the ballot measure provided “no ability to carry out any duties” set forth in the new laws, particularly with its lack of funding.
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, who worked with Hansen on the bill, said Sunday there is “no way” the measure’s required regulations can be completed in time.
LB 677 seeks to delay the required regulations by three months, while also more explicitly setting the parameters of the new regulatory system. The voter-passed laws’ wide flexibility to let the commission draft all regulations could end up with a system stricter than LB 677 proposes.
For instance, one of the governor-appointed members, Lorelle Mueting of Omaha’s Heartland Family Service, said in an online comment against a separate LB 705 this year that her agency does not support legalizing marijuana “in any form for medical purposes” without federal approval. 
Mueting opposed LB 677 at its hearing.
Hansen said the time is right “to get off our butts” and unite Democrats and Republicans and reach the 33-vote threshold needed to pass LB 677 and help Nebraskans. 
The system needs to start right and show “the world hasn’t ended,” Hansen said. “Everyone’s not dying. People aren’t smoking doobies on the corner like a lot of my conservatives think.”
“We’re not going to eat 100% of the apple,” Hansen said Saturday of the efforts. “We get 75%, 80%, make sure the people who need it, you get it.”
‘Pigs must be flying’
Marcie Reed of Blair, one of Hansen’s constituents, spoke of her 12-year-old son Kyler, who has epilepsy and takes six medications a day. Since 2019, the family has prepared to use a rescue medication for Kyler, a controlled substance, if Kyler’s seizures last more than five minutes.
“You don’t ever get it until you’re in that situation,” Reed, who worked on the recent cannabis ballot measures, said. “One day, somebody you love might have epilepsy or cancer, and I think that if you truly think about it, you will realize you wish that you could have this to give to your loved one and not keep fighting for it.”

While tense at times, the weekend also brought moments of levity, such as Shannon Coryell of Omaha, a self-described “bleeding heart liberal” who said that “pigs must be flying” because she agreed with Hansen, a Republican with a Libertarian bent.
Tom Becka, a former host on conservative talk radio in Omaha and a longtime broadcaster, spoke to Hilgers and Ricketts, saying that the movie-musical “Reefer Madness” wasn’t a “documentary.”
“More people have died from the onions on the McDonald’s hamburger than have died from medical cannabis,” Becka said to a laughing crowd.
No deaths from overdoses of marijuana have been reported, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, though some edibles have led to an increasing number of emergency room visits.
‘Fight like our lives matter’
Multiple Nebraskans also encouraged lawmakers to act quickly, as some patients who could have gotten help or tested out the medication have died in 12 years of legislative waiting.
Jill Hessing of Lincoln spoke of her mother, an open-minded Republican and licensed practical nurse who died of cancer in 2006. While some speakers said they would just go to Missouri for marijuana anyway, Hessing said that wouldn’t be the case for her mother, a “kind, compassionate, law-abiding woman.”

Lia Post of Springfield read a written letter Monday on behalf of her friend Angie Cornett of Norfolk, who missed the meeting to bury her mother.
Cornett, a nurse, wrote that her mom endured severe and chronic pain for decades. When she tried cannabis for the first time 25 years ago, at age 50, it eliminated the severe burning pain in her feet caused by severe nerve damage from her back and apathy from diabetes. 
Cornett said her mom described the new pain relief as “stepping on cold slushy watermelon.”
A “cocktail” of addictive pain relief medications was part of her mom’s medical regimen, Cornett said, adding she couldn’t help but wonder how her mom’s life could have changed with medical cannabis.
“She knew exactly what she was voting for, and as I bury my mom today, I want you to know that she is just one of many patients who have died waiting for the right to access plant-based medicines in Nebraska and access to a God-given plant that was used medicinally since the ancient times,” Cornett wrote Monday.
Post, a frequent medical cannabis advocate at the Nebraska State Capitol, said she is one of a handful of longtime advocates who have been told by lawmakers to mind their interactions and cool frustrations or methods of advocacy, such as Post telling Republicans that patients are dying.

Even so, Post said the roadblocks won’t make her back down from a disease — complex regional pain syndrome — that will one day take her life.
“Fight for us. Fight like our lives matter,” Post said Saturday. “None of you are God, and you do not deserve to play God in this anymore.”
Seeing patients
Dominic and Shelley Gillen of Bellevue have been in the fight for 12 years, similar to the Bronsons, for their now 23-year-old son Will, who similarly has a severe form of drug-resistant epilepsy and is referred to by friends and family as “God’s Will.” 
In that time, Dominic Gillen estimated, his son has faced more than 450,000 seizures and “a body littered with scars.”
Dominic Gillen said he considers Hilgers’ efforts against the medical cannabis campaign and its many volunteers, patients and caregivers, the type of “lawfare” that Republicans lamented under former President Joe Biden. At each event, Gillen told senators to see the patients, “not look through them.”
“Will has never spoken a word, but he’s touched countless lives in this state and other states through his story,” Dominic Gillen said. “Will is truly the greatest of blessings. He’s perfect even in his imperfection.”

Hansen, too, urged Nebraskans to share their stories and photos with lawmakers, particularly Republicans. “Out of curiosity,” he asked Sunday whether those in attendance would support recreational marijuana if LB 677 failed and the regulations became too restrictive.
Nearly everyone raised their hands. Hansen said he’s telling his colleagues to pass LB 677 and regulate medical cannabis, or the voters will end up legalizing recreational marijuana. Hilgers and other opponents of medical cannabis and recreational marijuana have said LB 677 would open the door to recreational use already.
Court battles continue in front of the Nebraska Supreme Court and in courts in Hall County, against a notary, and Lancaster County. The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office has argued the laws are preempted by federal law and threatened to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission if it issues dispensary licenses.
Notaries targeted in those cases have pledged innocence, including Jacy Todd of York, a notary who faces first-of-their-kind criminal charges in Grand Island. None of the four notaries targeted in the case before the Nebraska Supreme Court has been criminally charged, though a lower-court judge tossed some of their signatures. Hilgers said the lack of charges shouldn’t be “read into.
Hilgers, joined by various sheriffs on Wednesday, said that medical cannabis and LB 677 are “going to make Nebraska less safe, more dangerous. It’s going to handcuff the good men and women here that are in front of you and all their colleagues around the state.”
‘Let’s take away this pain’
Todd, a disabled veteran, was among those asking lawmakers to act and include post-traumatic stress disorder in the list of acceptable conditions for use, the removal of which Hansen said was one of the “negotiating factors” that was needed to get LB 677 out of the General Affairs Committee.

Two amendments from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha would add PTSD to the list. The first directly, the second by removing the list altogether and leaving the decision between doctors and patients.
Matt Bronson, who served in the military, left for war at age 19. He said he broke his back in 2007, struggles with PTSD, is a recovering alcoholic and has lost most sensation in his legs. He was given many options, including opiates and other addictive pain medications. Before Teddy was born, he said he tried to take his life.
Medical cannabis is not about Matt Bronson or Teddy getting high — “I give two s— about getting high,” his father says.
However, Bronson says he can’t take the addictive medications, get significant back surgery or be put in a wheelchair for 18 months because he and Liz Bronson need to care for Teddy at a moment’s notice, who comes first above his own health.
“Let’s take away this pain,” Matt Bronson said. “I don’t want to remember those brothers and sisters I lost in war. I don’t want to remember every single damn casket I put on the back of C-17 flying home covered in the damn flag. I love my country, but God damn, Uncle Sam, let’s do something about this s—.”

David Rozas, an attorney representing Alireza Doroudi, said in a statement Thursday that Douroudi made the decision after a hearing in Jena, Louisiana, where he was taken by authorities after ICE agents took him into custody in March.
“Mr. Doroudi made the difficult decision to ask for and was granted voluntary departure and return to Iran in order to avoid prolonged and unnecessary detention,” Rozas said in the statement. “He turned and looked at me and said, ‘I love this country, but they don’t want me here, so I will go home.”’

A message was sent Friday to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment.
Rozas said no evidence was ever presented in court that indicated Doroudi, a doctoral student studying mechanical engineering, was a national security risk while he resided in the U.S..
He said the charge that the agency brought against Doroudi was that his F-1 student visa had been revoked and an allegation that he was “not being in status.” But Rozas said the revocations would only take effect upon his departure from the United States, not while he was in the country.
“The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acknowledged this and indicated during the master hearing their intention to drop the charge. This acknowledges that the initial reason for arrest 45 days ago was an error,” Rozas said.
Rozas said that the judge in the case required DHS to submit in writing to the court the agency’s intent to rescind the charge and have a second hearing to address the issue even though the charge that Doroudi is not “in status” and that “it no longer holds weight without the F-1 revocation, because he was clearly still in status.”
Rozas also stated in his statement that Doroudi’s legal team had submitted evidence on multiple instances and requested a subsequent bond hearing to have him released as the court decides his case. However, the judge refused and stated that the request needed to be filed formally with the court, leaving Doroudi to remain in custody of DHS.
“In the face of this legal uncertainty and prolonged detention, Mr. Doroudi chose to leave voluntarily. This is not only a loss for him personally, but a setback for our system,” Rozas statement said. “When due process is delayed or denied, when charges are sustained without standing, and when individuals are forced to choose between uncertain length of detention in a country they feel no longer wants them, or leaving voluntarily, we must ask what kind of precedent we are setting not just for foreign students, but for fairness and justice in America.”

(Photo by Getty Images)A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to change oversight of child welfare in Maine to mirror the approach taken by its neighboring state. 
Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) said she modeled her bill after the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate. LD 1893, which has two Republican and seven Democrat cosponsors, would transfer Maine’s existing child welfare ombudsman into a new, independent agency with expanding responsibilities to advocate for Maine children. 
The proposed Office of Child Advocate would have the authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate, make public reports and advise the executive and legislative branches on how best to provide services to the state’s youth. 
“This bill builds a foundation for meaningful oversight and reform while ensuring children’s voices and interests remain at the forefront,” Gramlich told the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee during a public hearing Friday morning. 
After renewed scrutiny in recent years, there have been multiple proposals from lawmakers and agency leadership to improve the state’s embattled child welfare system. Last year, frontline workers came forward with accounts of onerous workloads that culminated in December with a letter of no confidence in the agency’s leadership. 
The proposed restructuring comes after the committee backed a proposal to update the state’s definition of child abuse and neglect that legal experts have argued is easy to conflate with poverty. 
Christine Alberi, the state’s current child welfare ombudsman, supports the bill to transition her position into an Office of Child Advocate because it preserves the work her office is already doing while adding “necessary functions.” For example, the new office would allow for juvenile justice investigations and access to facilities such as Long Creek Youth Development Center, the South Portland-based youth correctional facility. 
However, Alberi said that adequate funding would be crucial to the office’s success. During the hearing, she said it wasn’t clear where those resources would come from, since the ombudsman office has struggled with a lack of funding for staff since 2012. 
The current child welfare ombudsman program in Maine operates as a nonprofit that assists and investigates complaints against how child protective services cases are handled. It submits an annual report that includes an analysis of case specific reviews and other details about its interaction with the Office of Child and Family Services. 
Having served as New Hampshire’s first child advocate, Moira O’Neill said she believes Maine could have avoided a lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice over the state’s children’s behavioral health services had there been a proactive resource checking on the children in the care of the Department of Corrections. The suit was settled last November. 
O’Neill, who helped craft the model in New Hampshire before stepping down in 2021, supported Maine adopting that structure. She said Maine’s current ombudsman office leaves many children, especially those in the juvenile justice system, without an ally. 
Republican lawmakers in New Hampshire have expressed interest in cutting the Office of Child Advocate when looking for ways to trim the state budget.
Gramlich said the Office of the Attorney General suggested modest amendments to the bill that she is happy to work with the committee to incorporate. 
The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the state’s child welfare agency, spoke neither for nor against the bill. Director of Government Relations Abby Stivers said the department would like more time to review the proposal, but cautioned that the new framework being proposed likely requires more consideration than the department can give it in the remaining time for this legislative session. 
Stivers said the authority granted to the child advocate in this legislation could be wide reaching and questioned whether it is necessary given the multiple forms of oversight that already exist for child welfare services. The agency is subject to federal oversight, multiple citizen review panels and was subject to extensive investigative work from the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee last session. 
However, Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot) reintroduced a bill he brought forth last session to create an Office of the Inspector General of Child Protection. 
“The problems with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services are going to require far more than cosmetic surgery being suggested by some,” he told the committee when introducing LD 770.
An inspector general at the state level would send a “clear and articulate message” that the accountability and transparency of Maine’s child welfare system needs to be substantially changed, Baldacci said. He referenced a 2024 report from the federal watchdog that indicated Maine struggled to comply with best practices in the vast majority of abuse and neglect cases. 
Under this proposal, the inspector general would be appointed by the governor to serve a five year term, with the potential for reappointment. It would also take on matters related to juvenile justice and have subpoena powers.
No one from the public testified on the bill. Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, provided written testimony opposing the legislation. She wrote that it isn’t clear what benefit the role would offer to the “robust and comprehensive oversight of child welfare that already exists.”
The proposal last session ultimately died after it was not endorsed by the Health and Human Services Committee.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)On Thursday, 27 Democratic New Mexico lawmakers wrote to the 14-member board that governs state water policy, urging members to reconsider in an upcoming meeting its recent decisions regarding oil and gas wastewater.
Last month, the Water Quality Control Commission continued deliberations on a proposed rule to expand the uses of oil and gas water outside the oilfields. Deliberations have been ongoing since December 2023, when the New Mexico Environment Department petitioned to expand legal uses beyond oilfields.
With New Mexico water sources expected to become increasingly strained by more demand and shrinking supplies from a hotter, drier climate, the relationship between oil and gas and its wastewater has sparked a major policy debate in the past few legislative sessions and in the WQCC’s rulemaking.
The state’s oil and gas production generates billions of gallons of wastewater, which is extremely salty and can include radioactive materials and heavy metals from underground; chemicals used in the fracking process; or cancer-causing or toxic compounds mixed in from the oil and gas, such as benzene.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has floated using treated oil and gas wastewater in manufacturing and other industries in her Strategic Water Supply proposals, but lawmakers stripped produced water from the final bill. Water and conservation groups that opposed the idea said that treatments for the water remain unproven and the waste poses threats to human and environmental health.
The WQCC rule-making deliberations  included several weeks-long hearings in 2024 with hours of testimony from scientists, water experts, environmental officials and industry representatives. In April, recent edits to the rules culminated in the board adopting positions to allow for some pilot projects to discharge treated produced water into the groundwater, and allowed for so-called “closed-loop” projects to bypass the permitting process.
Lawmakers weigh in
The letter, signed by Democrats in both chambers, called the board’s limitations for these pilot projects  “insufficient,” and said they contradict existing law and potentially risk human and environmental health.
“The decision to allow ANY discharge of treated oil and gas waste to ground or surface water prior to the development of treatment and quality standards is both irresponsible and dangerous in the extreme,” the letter said.
The letter cited testimony from New Mexico State University researchers, experts from the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association and even NMED, which requested the rule change, that produced water contains toxic chemicals and treatment options have not been proven safe nor effective.
“Until credible, scientifically based standards for treatment and water quality are adopted, we believe it is premature to issue permits for any pilot treatments outside the oilfield,” the letter said, and suggested research can be done in the labs or in the field under existing laws.
Lawmakers also said if the WQCC does allow pilot projects, then those projects must not discharge waste to surface or groundwater and must follow a permitting process, to allow for public notification and the right to protest.
“The Commission’s decision on the issue is contrary to the legislature’s intent and the letter of the law,” the letter stated.
The letter cited motions filed by environmental groups and suggested that any law adopt more stringent permitting standards. The letter also recommended that the WQCC include tests of 600 substances in the treated water.
WQCC Chair Bruce Thomson, an environmental engineer, said lawmakers raised “some good points,” in the letter but that he disagrees with the characterization of oil and gas wastewater.
“My biggest concern with the letter is that they claim that treatment technologies do not exist. I will agree that treatment technologies are in an early stage of development,” Thomson told Source, saying the board heard testimony of 15 to 20 studies about potential technologies “to treat it to a very high level of quality.
Thomson said the objections to the lack of permits would likely be discussed in the next deliberation.
Melissa Troutman, a climate and health advocate at WildEarth Guardians, told Source NM her group also argued to the WQCC that the leftovers from any produced water treatment process would meet the qualifications for hazardous waste.
“Our argument at Guardians is that it would be creating a new hazardous waste, but the rule isn’t applying hazardous waste laws, and that’s illegal,” she said, saying it would no longer have the exemption under oil and gas exploration.
Troutman said there’s still time to reshape the outcome.
“The door is still open for deliberation, and hopefully we can bring these points forward,” Troutman said. “Hopefully, when they do issue a final rule, it’s much, much closer to what we actually need.”
The WQCC is next scheduled to meet Tuesday, May 13 to continue deliberations.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)A $2.8 billion tax cut deal reached between Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez last week to help bring the 2025 regular session to a close is now off the table.
The breakdown means legislators are nowhere near coming up with a new budget, which needs to be in place by July 1 or the state risks a government shutdown.
The Friday morning announcement from legislative leadership came as Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to tour the state attacking the House, and Perez by extension, for pushing a reduction in the state’s sales tax rate instead of backing the governor’s two-step plan to provide property homeowners relief. 
Perez had championed a permanent reduction in sales taxes and last week Albritton said he was backing it. But in a memo to House members, Perez said Albritton has told him “he is breaking his commitment to the House that he publicly announced.”

“I was disappointed when the Senate President informed me of his decision to no longer bring the House’s historic tax proposal to the Senate floor,” Perez wrote. “As I’m sure you can appreciate, this blew up the framework for the budget deal we had negotiated.”
Albritton sent his own memo to his members shortly thereafter explaining that he was backing away from the agreement with Perez for an across-the-board sales tax cut because the governor had indicated the bill would be “dead on arrival.”  
Three concerns
Albritton’s letter outlines three main concerns he heard from senators about the $2.8 billion tax agreement, of which $2.5 billion would be recurring.
“An across-the-board sales tax cut of one quarter of one penny is not meaningful, felt, or seen by families and seniors when compared with other available options. A $2.5 billion recurring tax cut is not sustainable when combined with the projected budget shortfalls already on the horizon. A $2.5 billion recurring tax cut may constrain options for the major property tax reform the Governor, House, and Senate, and most importantly – the Floridians we represent – are asking us to put forward.”

Albritton continued:
“Throughout the entire course of negotiations with the House, the Senate has been and remains committed to tax cuts that offer broad-based and meaningful tax relief for families, seniors, and small businesses. As negotiations move forward, [Appropriations] Chair [Ed] Hooper and I will continue seeking your advice and feedback. 
“It is important to me that we develop a tax relief package that is sustainable for the long term and leaves room in our balanced budget for the voters to consider meaningful property tax relief on the ballot at the next general election. We will continue to work towards a final budget and tax relief package the House, Senate and Governor can support.”
The two sides need to reach a deal on the size and scope of tax cuts in order to reach a deal on budget “allocations” that determine how much money will be included in the final appropriations act.
The Senate and House on May 2 voted on a resolution (HCR 1631) that lists 16 bills the chambers will consider in an extended session. Included in the list is Albritton’s priority legislation to infuse $200 million in infrastructure in areas of the state that are less developed. Albritton has dubbed the bill “Rural Renaissance.”
Albritton said that day that the chambers had reached an agreement for a budget that included $2.8 billion in relief, which he noted is “the most historic tax relief package in the history of our state.”

The one must-pass bill
Nearly 2,000 bills were filed in the House and Senate for consideration during the 2025 session. Most of them didn’t pass — indeed, just 255 made it across the legislative finish line before the session adjourned.
But there’s just one bill the Legislature is required to pass each year and that’s the state fiscal year budget, officially known as the General Appropriations Act.
The chambers passed drastically different proposed spending plans for state fiscal year 2025-26 with a $4.4 billion gap between the two blueprints. 
Perez has championed rolling back the state’s sales tax by 0.75%, to 5.25%. The speaker’s plan would roll back all other sales tax rates by the same amount — commercial rent from 2% to 1.25%; electricity from 4.35% to 3.6%; new mobile home purchases from 3% to 2.25%; and coin-operated amusement machines from 4% to 3.25%.
The Senate floated a more modest $2.1 billion plan centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of this plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
Meanwhile, DeSantis has pushed for elimination of property taxes, a proposal he has continued to champion this week at press events across the state, appearing Friday in Jacksonville.

Special elections will proceed,Geoff Pender,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/09/federal-court-approves-mississippi-legislative-redistricting-special-elections-will-proceed/,The panel has held that none of the state’s prior maps gave Black voters a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice.,"A panel of three federal judges has approved a revised legislative redistricting plan from the Mississippi Election Commission, which will allow special elections to move forward this year for 15 legislative seats.
The court in April had ordered state officials to develop yet another legislative map to ensure Black voters in the DeSoto County area have a fair opportunity to elect candidates to the state Senate.
The panel, comprised of U.S. District Judge Daniel Jordan, U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden and U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Leslie Southwick, previously ruled that when lawmakers redrew their districts in 2022 to account for population shifts, they violated federal civil rights law because the maps diluted Black voting power.
To remedy the violation, the court allowed the Legislature to propose a new House map redrawing House districts in the Chickasaw County area and a new Senate map redrawing districts in the DeSoto County and Hattiesburg areas.
Earlier this year, during the 2025 session, the Legislature attempted to comply with the order and tweaked those districts. However, the plaintiffs still objected to parts of the Legislature’s plan.
The plaintiffs, the state chapter of the NAACP and Black voters from around the state, did not object to the Hattiesburg portion of the Senate plan. But they argued the Chickasaw County portion of the House plan and the DeSoto County portion of the Senate plan did not create a realistic opportunity for Black voters in those areas to elect their preferred candidates. 
The judges accepted the Chickasaw County redistricting portion. Still, they objected to the DeSoto County part because the Legislature’s proposed DeSoto County solution “yokes high-turnout white communities in the Hernando area of DeSoto County to several poorer, predominantly Black towns in the Mississippi Delta,” which would make it hard for Black voters to overcome white voting blocs. 
The panel, comprised of all George W. Bush-appointed judges, ordered state officials to, again, craft a new Senate map for the area in the suburbs of Memphis. The panel has held that none of the state’s prior maps gave Black voters a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice.
The court in its latest ruling set deadlines and a schedule for special elections for Mississippi legislative seats impacted by the new maps.
The deadline to publicize and share the maps with local election officials is May 12. Candidate qualification to run will run from June 2-9  and the slate of candidates will be submitted by June 13. Absentee voting for the Aug. 5 primaries will begin June 21.
Absentee voting for general elections will begin Sept. 20 and general elections will be Nov. 4.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06174816/AP_21239459273852-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-09 13:19:49.636542

PFAS, a family of chemicals which are heat and oil resistant, are commonly used in products like nonstick cookware, carpeting, waterproof clothing and food packaging. The chemicals break down very slowly and can accumulate in the blood and organs of people and animals. Alongside products manufactured using PFAS, the chemicals can be found in food, drinking water and in the soil and water near waste sites.
Labeled as an emerging contaminant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, PFAS has been linked to several health conditions including harm to the immune system, increased risks of certain cancers  —including prostate, kidney and testicular cancers — decreased fertility, high blood pressure in pregnant women and developmental delays or effects on children.

The state has previously estimated there are more than 11,000 sites within the state contaminated by PFAS, with the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team identifying 300 sites where groundwater has been contaminated by the hazardous chemicals. 
“In Michigan we know all too well the urgent, growing threat PFAS pose. It’s more important than ever we’re taking serious action in Congress to keep PFAS out of our homes, water, and environment, hold polluters accountable, and clean up existing contamination,” Dingell said in a statement.



Over the next two years, the task force’s priorities will include:

Advancing comprehensive legislation to end harmful PFAS pollution.
Educating lawmakers and the public on the serious health and environmental consequences of PFAS exposure.
Securing historic federal investments in research, remediation, and prevention.




“Our country needs to address the problems PFAS chemicals create head-on, which is why I’m proud to co-chair the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force with both Republicans and Democrats,” McDonald Rivet said. “We will work together to raise awareness of the risk of PFAS chemicals and advocate for commonsense solutions for our constituents.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-09-123321.png,,,2025-05-09 13:19:49.636542

In this image WSU students walk to class on campus. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas conference of the American Association of University Professors condemned the targeting of college and university international students and scholars by the administration of  President Donald Trump.
The statement signed by Mary Turner, president of the Kansas AAUP, said it was wrong for the federal government to refuse scholars entry into the United States, revoke student visas or to take students into custody for proceedings that could include deportation.
“These actions, which are brazen attacks on the First Amendment and the right to learn, have been enacted by hidden bureaucrats and masked agents and have proceeded without any semblance of due process,” the statement said. “In addition to their impact on international students, they also strike at the heart of academic freedom and the international community of scholars.”
The Kansas conference of AAUP urged colleges and universities in the state to refuse to assist with the “assault on higher education.”
“At a moment when the future of higher education and free speech are in peril, Kansas higher education institutions have obligations beyond doing no harm,” the Kansas AAUP statement said. “If they fail to protect these international students and scholars, they jeopardize the safety and academic freedom of all students and scholars.”
Kansas higher education institutions enroll approximately 8,600 international students, Kansas AAUP said. It is not clear how many of these students had visas revoked by the Trump administration.
 
WSU’s visa revocations
Gamal Weheba, president of the AAUP-AFT chapter at Wichita State University, said the organization issued a resolution in support of international students in Wichita. He said in an interview that 27 graduate students at WSU had visas revoked during the spring semester.
“The international students are really scared,” said Weheba, a professor of engineering. “We care about the students, all of them, but especially international students.”
The majority of WSU’s international graduate students were enrolled in data science and computer science programs within the College of Engineering, Weheba said.
“We have to take a stand here,” he said. “Our basic message now to students is we’re here, we have your back.”
The AAUP resolution from Wichita State said the university administrators should commit to helping international students with degree completion, maintaining positions or stipends, and supporting legal action to challenge removal or rejection of student visas.
It said WSU President Richard Muma ought to issue a statement “clarifying student rights and legal protections to the student body, staff and faculty of the institution.”
The resolution asked WSU to provide direction to faculty on how to accommodate students who were unable to complete academic work in the spring semester.
Weheba said international students had studies interrupted after revocation of a visa or were afraid to attend classes for fear of drawing scrutiny or being taken into custody.
“This visa removal process has placed students in a legal limbo and induced fear and anxiety into the campus student community and adversely impacted the institutional mission,” the resolution said.
Neither WSU nor the Kansas Board of Regents immediately responded to requests for comment about the AAUP statements.
 
Kansas AAUP demands
Specifically, Kansas AAUP asked higher education administrators to cease turning over personal student information in response to federal investigations of alleged violations of Title VI the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Trump administration has relied on an interpretation of Title VI to launch inquiries into whether colleges or universities discriminated on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally funded programs.
Kansas AAUP urged higher education administrators to avoid voluntary cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement engaged in activities that could lead to deportation of students or scholars.
In addition, the statement asked colleges and universities in Kansas to not comply with Trump’s executive order calling on campus administrators to monitor and report on international students and staff.
Colleges and universities in Kansas should keep international students enrolled in the event of a visa revocation, legal status termination, detention or deportation, Kansas AAUP said. If possible, the statement said, students and scholars should be allowed to continue their studies remotely.
“Work swiftly and affirmatively — through lawsuits, if necessary — to stop the termination of legal status of students and scholars without any due process,” the statement said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/WSU-campus-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 13:19:49.636542

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)An Iowa-licensed social worker accused of having personal or sexual relationships with two clients has agreed to surrender her license.
Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals charged Stephanie A. Davies, formerly Stephanie A. Levy, with engaging in sexual activity with a former client within five years of the client relationship ending, and with having her social work license revoked in the state of Nebraska.
Nebraska Bureau of Public Health records show the bureau revoked Davies’ Nebraska license as a master social worker and mental health practitioner in March 2024 for alleged immoral or dishonorable conduct, exploitation and failure to keep adequate records.
The Nebraska records indicate Davies was working in private practice as a mental health practitioner and was a leader in the Nebraska First Responders’ Support Network when the alleged violations occurred. The bureau alleges that while speaking to a therapist, Davies disclosed that in the fall of 2020, she had become attracted to a female first responder to whom she provided services between July 2019 and February 2022.
In February 2021, the bureau alleged, the first responder admitted to her ex-wife she was having an affair with Davies, and in September 2021, Davies and the first responder attended a wedding together as a couple. In January 2022, Davies allegedly moved out of the home she shared with her husband and, on occasion, began staying at the first-responder’s home.
According to the bureau, Davies admitted to a state investigator, “I recognize that this is against the rules, I own it and, yeah, that is where we are at.”
As part of the Nebraska board’s investigation of the matter, an investigator spoke to another of Davies’ clients who allegedly said he and Davies had once maintained a “weird, blended relationship” and that, “yes, professional lines were probably crossed.”
To resolve the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals’ charges against her, Davies recently agreed to surrender her license.



Social workers sanctioned by board
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently sanctioned two other licensees:
— Michelle Munsen, a licensed mental health counselor who practiced in Sioux City, was employed at Stokes & Associates where she allegedly failed to create and complete the appropriate notes for counseling services she provided. The board charged Munsen with professional incompetence. To resolve the case, Munsen agreed to complete six hours of educational training on recordkeeping and the board issued her a warning.
— Terris Sallis, a master’s level social worker who practiced in Newton in 2024 when the board charged him with practicing outside the scope of his license. According to the board, Sallis owns his own practice, Integrated Treatment Services, which contracted with an independent social worker.
Under Iowa regulations, a master’s level social worker cannot oversee the practice of independent social worker and cannot complete the clinical hours required for license when supervised by an employee due to the inherent conflict of interest. Sallis agreed to have his license placed on probation for three years and to complete at least 3,000 hours of additional clinical practice while overseen by a new clinical supervisor.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/license-applictation.jpg,,,2025-05-09 12:21:58.948661

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge said Thursday that federal immigration officials likely acted unlawfully when they terminated the records of five international Rutgers University students and one recent graduate.
The students — all from China or India — sued the federal government in April after their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, were abruptly terminated, placing their academic and professional careers in jeopardy. The database hosts information colleges use to track students’ compliance with their immigration status, and deleting students’ records effectively ends their protected status and any benefits that come with it, like the ability to work.
U.S. District Court Judge Katharine S. Hayden on Thursday granted the students a preliminary injunction barring the government from enforcing or implementing any legal consequences as a result of the deleted records. Hayden’s order also requires the government to restore the records and give the students at least 20 days’ notice if the records are terminated again.
Her 33-page decision came after the two sides met in court in Newark Wednesday.
Attorneys for the students applauded the judge’s order, which they say will allow them to safely return to research, work, and their public lives. 
“The government not only failed to provide notice or explanation when it terminated our clients’ records, but then gave shifting rationale for doing so, underscoring how arbitrarily this administration is treating students,” said Molly Linhorst, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “But like all other people in the United States, regardless of immigration status, our clients are entitled to the Constitutional guarantee of due process of law.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has purged thousands of SEVIS records. Affected students had no ability to appeal the termination, and were told their visas had been revoked for “failing to maintain status.”
Two weeks ago, the Trump administration reversed course and reinstated students’ status following a flurry of lawsuits around the country. But the Rutgers students and graduate continued their legal challenge, contending that the notations left in their records would continue to cause them harm and serious legal consequences.
At least two of them already faced some fall-out — one student was fired after their status was terminated, and another lost their research assistant position, along with their annual $40,000 stipend. All of them expressed concerns that they still fear being picked up by federal agents, and that they’ll likely run out of money after losing employment. 
Hayden said the plaintiffs would likely succeed in their claim that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security violated administrative procedures when terminating the students’ records. She said the law requires agencies to make reasoned decisions and that “actions be set aside if they are arbitrary or capricious.” 
Hayden said the government supplied no reason for the termination of the students’ records, nor for their reinstatement. 
The Rutgers students, here on F-1 visas, said they were in good standing, compliant with the law, and had not been charged with any crimes. Some had minor or dismissed charges, like a driver’s license violation, which would not have jeopardized their protected status.  
“Plaintiffs’ visas were not revoked, so the remaining ground would be the criminal records check – but the so-called ‘criminal records’ of plaintiffs involved incidents that did not meet the requirements for termination of status under” the law, Hayden wrote. “Defendants do not contend otherwise.” 
In his second term, Trump has been executing his campaign promise to detain and deport immigrants, including those with legal status. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also confirmed plans to revoke visas for students, particularly those who participate in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses.
More than 23,000 international students attended New Jersey colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Institute of International Education. New Jersey ranks 17th in the country for accepting international students, who spent nearly $1 billion last year, the group says.
Rutgers University officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

(John Gray/Verite News)A Louisiana House committee shelved a bill Wednesday that would have made it illegal for someone to “intentionally” expose another person to an “incurable” sexually transmitted disease after steep concerns that criminalization could worsen the state’s proliferating STD rates.
This was the second time Rep. Patricia Moore, D-Monroe, had introduced such a bill in five years, despite opposition from public and sexual health advocates as well as people living with STDs. Moore said at a House Administration of Criminal Justice committee meeting that she wants to create a law that offers people recourse for when someone “knowingly and intentionally” doesn’t disclose their STD status.
The bill would have created a new felony, carrying up to 10 years in prison and $5,000 in fines, for someone who knows they have an “incurable” STD and exposes someone else without their knowledge and consent. Those penalties would have increased if the person exposed to the STD is a minor, over 65 years old or has an intellectual disability. The exposure under either charge would have needed to come through sexual contact, donating bodily fluids such as blood or sharing needles.
After pushback during public testimony, Moore voluntarily deferred House Bill 76.

In 2023, Louisiana had the highest rate of chlamydia cases in the country and ranked in the top 10 for syphilis, HIV and gonorrhea, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The legislation comes as other states have repealed or modernized their own laws criminalizing STDs, especially HIV, over the past decade to align with the current medical landscape. An attempt to update Louisiana’s own law criminalizing HIV failed last year.
Before the bill was deferred, Moore amended it to just focus on “incurable” STDs, removing a proposal to create a new misdemeanor charge for exposing someone to a curable STD. The four most common incurable sexually transmitted infections are hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV. While no treatments exist to eliminate these viruses, all are treatable and manageable with medication, and HPV can sometimes clear up on its own.
But the groups who opposed the bill, including several members of the Louisiana Coalition Against Criminalization and Health, said the bill would have the same problems as another state law on the books that criminalizes “intentional exposure” to HIV.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Data on how many people have been charged under the law is challenging to compile, but UCLA’s Williams Institute identified 147 allegations of HIV-related crimes between 2011 and 2022 in Louisiana, though researchers said that number could be higher.
Dietz, the coalition’s state coordinator, told the committee that said both the current law and bill contain “legal loopholes” that allow the law to be used against people living with HIV in their personal relationships, in part because it’s on the person living with the STD to prove they received the accuser’s consent.
In 2024, Dietz and other members of a state task force charged with researching the criminalization of HIV found that Louisiana’s current legal approach “can actually interfere with work to end the HIV epidemic,” according to its report.
“We’ve already made recommendations for the way the existing law allows for environments of coercion because again … proving that you disclosed your status is challenging,” Dietz said. “Even if you were to have proof in your hand, even if someone were to write it down, what if someone ripped it up? Or you lost it?”
St. Tammany Parish resident Katie Darling, who also serves as the vice chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party, shared the testimony of one of her residents who said she had been living with HIV for 25 years. Darling said the resident had her first husband sign an affidavit acknowledging that he knew she had HIV and consented, even though she was taking medication that prevented transmission. When the marriage turned physically abusive, the resident testified that her former husband threatened to take her to court over her HIV status.
“Thankfully, I had the document he signed on file at my doctor’s office. But what if I hadn’t?” Darling read from the testimony. The St. Tammany resident has now had her second husband sign a similar affidavit.
Those who opposed the bill also acknowledged that there is a need for people to have justice when they are unknowingly given an STD, whether that’s under new legislation or current laws around sexual assault.
Jennifer Tokarski, who is living with HPV, testified in support of the bill. She shared the story of her former husband who had sex outside of their marriage, refused to admit it and ultimately transmitted the virus to her.
“After five years in what I believed was a faithful relationship and Catholic marriage, I became severely ill,” Tokarski testified. “My husband attended appointments, rejected STD testing, reassuring doctors we were monogamous.”
When she learned of his infidelity, she said he battered her and filed for divorce.
“Only then did I learn he had infected me with a lifelong and incurable STD,” Tokarski said. “This is not just a private betrayal, this is a public health failure.”
Moore and Tokarski said they believed such a law would help promote honest conversations about sexual health that would lower the spread and give survivors a voice.
Studies have shown that criminalizing STDs do little to lower the number of cases and increase stigma. During testimony, public health advocates said Louisiana should invest more heavily in resources for testing and treatment as well as sexual health education, which isn’t required in schools.
At Wednesday’s meeting, Moore said she planned to work with the bill’s opponents to improve the language and possibly return the legislation to the committee if there’s time before the session. Otherwise, Moore said she will bring a form of the legislation back next year.

Labor plays defense at the Capitol
Two years ago, Minnesota Democrats were basking in the national spotlight after passing a sweeping progressive agenda — with a one-seat Senate majority no less — that created a paid family leave program; guaranteed all workers paid sick leave; banned noncompete agreements; and extended government health insurance to undocumented residents.
Now, labor unions and their Democratic allies are just trying to hold the line after a bruising election ended their unified control of government and will force them to make concessions to Republicans to pass a two-year budget.
But even some Senate Democrats in swing districts are pushing to sand down policies they previously voted for as they face ongoing pressure from the business groups to ease up on regulations.
Six Senate Democrats voted with Republicans on Tuesday to pass a bill that exempts small farms and micro-businesses from the 2023 law requiring employers to provide paid sick and safe leave per year.
Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato, an author of the sick leave bill, also introduced a bill with Republicans to water down the paid family leave program slated to start next year. The bill would exempt businesses with 15 or fewer employees and reduce the total number of weeks employees could take off in a year from 20 to 14.
“We have a saying down in Mankato that you can’t have good jobs without good employers,” Frentz said in an interview. “Small businesses are clamoring for us to revisit those two programs.”
The paid leave bill didn’t get a committee hearing, showing there’s little appetite among his Democratic colleagues to discuss changing the program, but it could find new life in last minute budget negotiations.
In the evenly divided House, Democrats have remained largely unified, though that isn’t enough to pass bills.
The House labor bill, which will be debated on Friday, includes a provision that would exempt workers who make more than $200,000 a year from the ban on noncompete agreements passed in 2023.
Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, said Democrats resoundingly rejected changes to paid family leave, sick leave and a proposal to weaken the Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board. But they had to give up something to reach a budget deal.
“This year Republicans have spent all their time working to take away protections and benefits that Minnesota workers won last session, while DFLers have been fighting to pass a budget that protects them,” Greenman said.
House Democratic leaders also agreed to roll back unemployment insurance for bus drivers, teachers’ aids and other hourly school workers in 2029 as part of an education budget deal. But rank-and-file Democrats refused to send the bill to the floor with that provision, forcing more negotiations.
And a final sticking point will be over whether to continue allowing undocumented residents to buy into MinnesotaCare, the state’s health insurance for low-income working people.
Angie Craig racks up early labor endorsements for Senate
U.S. Rep. Angie Craig had a chummy conversation with Teamster President Sean O’Brien on his podcast “Better Bad Ideas” on Wednesday as she courts labor unions in her campaign for U.S. Senate.
Craig gave her assessment of the 2024 election. Like many moderate Democrats and O’Brien, she says the party suffered because they stopped focusing on pocketbook issues.
O’Brien is both cause and effect of the Republican Party seeking to win over working class voters, which President Donald Trump has done to great effect and in the process transformed America’s politics during the past decade.
O’Brien was the first Teamster president to speak at the Republican National Convention in 2024, and the international union declined to endorse a presidential ticket after releasing polling showing nearly 60% of their members supported Trump.
(Still smarting from Gov. Tim Walz’s jab that union leaders who didn’t endorse in the race lacked courage, O’Brien said on the episode that Walz looks like a “creepy wrestling coach for junior high.”)
Craig committed to winning support from these Trump-supporting workers, which means sometimes alienating party loyalists by supporting some of Trump’s policies.
“If you take the opposite position every time the administration acts, you lose the ability to reach back and win the people (Trump) won the national election with,” Craig told O’Brien.
And she checked the boxes on O’Brien’s agenda: reining in Big Tech; going after Amazon; banning autonomous vehicles; supporting energy infrastructure projects; and implementing “strategic” tariffs.
Craig has already won the endorsement of the Teamsters Local 32 in Minnesota, along with nine other local labor unions representing more than 150,000 workers. The endorsements landed just two days after she launched her campaign and included the more moderate building trades — carpenters, operating engineers, painters and sheet metal workers — but also the local union of federal employees, whom Craig has defended against indiscriminate cuts by the Trump administration.
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, the other major contender in the Senate race, hasn’t announced any labor endorsements yet, but the far larger, more progressive unions like SEIU and Education Minnesota haven’t weighed in.
Trump’s tariffs have truckers on edge

Truckers in Minnesota are bracing for a massing slowdown in work as businesses suspend orders from overseas because of Trump’s tariffs. Ocean carriers have canceled trips at a faster rate than during the COVID-19 pandemic, and cargo at the massive Port of Los Angeles is down 35% in early May.
New Brighton-based shipping company Big Blue Box Vice President Ted Longbella said truckers in Minnesota will feel the effects of the tariffs around June, when the surge of goods that were panic-ordered before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement turns into a trickle.
There are more than 56,000 semi-truck drivers and another 18,000 light truck drivers in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development, meaning widespread layoffs and reductions in income could ripple throughout the greater economy.
Macalester College staff file for union election
More than 270 Macalester College employees could unionize with the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, the largest union of state employees.
Workers filed a petition on Monday with the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private sector unions, to hold an election after the college declined to voluntarily recognize their union. If successful, the union would represent non-managerial staff across campus, from athletics to alumni relations and library services.
“Macalester staff built a thoughtful, disciplined organizing effort and they didn’t back down when management refused recognition,” said MAPE President Megan Dayton in a statement announcing the union filing. “Now, we’re ready to win this election.”
The union drive is more than two years in the making, according to the Mac Weekly, and comes on the heels of undergraduate student workers voting to unionize, the first effort of its kind in Minnesota.
Macalester spokesman Joe Linstroth said the scope of the union is “yet to be determined.”
“Should there be an election, we plan to encourage all eligible employees to vote so that they are able to have a say in whether they wish to be represented by a bargaining unit,” he wrote in an email.
Pope Leo XIV’s pro-labor predecessor
In taking the name Leo on Thursday, the new pope signaled his intention to continue his predecessor Pope Francis’ zealous advocacy for the poor.
Pope Leo XIV’s name honors the previous Pope Leo, who led the Catholic Church from 1878 to 1903, when workers were fighting back against ruthless industrial capitalism of the Gilded Age.
Pope Leo XIII wrote the encyclical Rerum Novarum — sometimes titled “On the Condition of the Working Classes” — in 1891, in which he praised unions and sharply criticized unchecked greed and the exploitation of the working poor.
“A small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself,” he wrote. “To misuse men as though they were things in the pursuit of gain, or to value them solely for their physical powers — that is truly shameful and inhuman.”
He also shunned the socialist aim to eliminate private property altogether, saying it would unjustly deprive workers of the “liberty of disposing of his wages, and thereby of all hope and possibility of increasing his resources and of bettering his condition in life.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250501_0394-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-09 12:21:58.948661

The mayor, in an email to staff, said city government had ""grown unsustainably"" over the last 10 years, adding nearly 100 full-time positions that have contributed to persistent structural budget gaps.

Photo via Adobe StockThe city of Burlington has cut 25 full-time positions as it faces a multi-million-dollar budget gap for the second year, and difficult financial questions ahead.Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, in an email sent Thursday night, announced to city staff and the city council that 12 union employees, as well as 13 non-union positions across a number of departments, were being eliminated. The cut positions represent roughly 5% of the city’s workforce.Seven of those positions were vacant, the mayor said.“This was an incredibly challenging process and resulted in some of the hardest decisions I have had to make as mayor,” Mulvaney-Stanak wrote in her letter to staff. “I understand that this may be upsetting news to receive, and that you will likely have questions about what this will mean going forward.”It was not immediately clear which departments were affected. A message sent to local representatives of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal union was not immediately returned.The layoffs come as Burlington faces a difficult financial future. The city needs to address a $8 million budget gap for fiscal year 2026 as its budget process begins in earnest this month.“We’ve known for some time that if we wanted to address affordability concerns and keep down the ever-increasing cost of city government that we were going to have to make some difficult decisions,” Council President Ben Traverse said in an interview.This budget season marks the second year that the first-term Progressive mayor is responding to a multi-million-dollar budget gap. Last year, the city increased existing taxes and fees and used nearly $4 million in one-time funds to fill a $14.2 million budget gap for fiscal year 2025.While this year’s budget gap is more manageable, the mayor said the “solutions to balance the budget are much fewer this year.”Over a 10-year period, the city added 98 full-time positions to the city’s general operating budget, including 37 positions created with one-time funding sources through federal or state grants or pandemic relief funding. There are just over 500 full-time positions in city government, according to the release.“The city has grown unsustainably” over the last 10 years, Mulvaney-Stanak said.In the letter, the mayor cast some blame on the city’s “outdated” charter, which she said limits the city’s ability to use property taxes “to support city expenses in a fair and predictable way for residents and city government.”City taxes increased by 6% in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, and by 11% last year.The mayor convened a tax fairness working group in February to explore ways that Burlington could redistribute its property tax structure. A recommendation from that group is expected within the next several weeks.Democratic Councilor Evan Litwin said in an interview that he had concerns the city wasn’t cutting enough, but added that budget presentations from the mayor’s office and city departments have not come expeditiously enough to make informed decisions.“My worry is we’re not having these hard conversations” between the legislative and executive bodies, he said. “We’re not being given a lot of time. We have tough decisions ahead of us.”Other city officials reacted with concern. Progressive City Councilor Gene Bergman questioned how the work done by the 25 eliminated positions would be fulfilled.“What I need to know is, what are the functions that are being eliminated that we are just not going to do, and who’s going to pick those up somewhere?” he said in an interview.This story will be updated.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington cuts 25 full-time positions as city faces a difficult financial future.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Burlington-Vermont-City-Hall-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 12:21:58.948661

The tentative plan, which according to those involved has the blessing of the governor’s office, would commit the state to $15 million a year to a newly created Clay County sports authority for the next 20 years. That money would be used to help finance a new stadium in order to prevent the team from moving to Kansas. 
It’s unclear if the legislative package will include money to help the Kansas City Chiefs remodel Arrowhead Stadium in Jackson County. 
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office did not respond to requests for comment. 
Legislation sponsored by state Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall, would be the vehicle for the funding. The underlying bill, which passed the Senate and could be taken up as early as Monday in the House, would authorize Clay County to establish a county sports complex authority for the purpose of “developing or maintaining sports, convention, exhibition or trade facilities.”
Any stadium funding plans would be added to the bill as an amendment in the House, said state Rep. Brad Christ, a St. Louis County Republican handling the legislation in that chamber. 
Christ said his involvement with the stadium funding is “very minimal,” and he has not been kept in the loop on any details of the proposal. 
All signs point toward Clay County as the preferred location for the new stadium, Gregory said, with the idea that moving the Royals would also clear the way for the Chiefs to remain in Arrowhead, demolish Kauffman Stadium and build a covered entertainment center.
“It’s not ‘downtown,’ but Clay County works a lot better,” Gregory said of a possible North Kansas City site. “There can be better parking. You’ll have the Kansas City skyline just two miles away. They could run the streetcar out to it. It just works.”
Some sort of local support would likely still be needed, Gregory said. But he’s optimistic that can get done, because “when I was knocking doors in Clay, the most frequent question I got was ‘what are we going to do about the Chiefs and the Royals.’”  
Both teams have publicly expressed interest in moving from Missouri to Kansas after Jackson County voters rejected a proposal last year to extend a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a downtown Kansas City baseball stadium and upgrades to Arrowhead. 
Kansas lawmakers responded by expanding a tax incentive program in the hopes of convincing one or both teams to relocate. The leases for both teams’ Jackson County stadiums run through the end of the 2030 season. 
Regardless of the details of any potential plan, the idea faces incredibly long odds with so little time left in the session. The House and Senate must adjourn for the year at 6 p.m. next Friday.
The tight timeline is especially problematic in the Missouri Senate, where any opposition could turn into a run-out-the-clock filibuster.
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat who co-sponsored the Clay County sports authority bill with Gregory, said she’s not been involved in recent discussions and had doubts there was time to still get something done so late in the session. 
Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, said there have been ongoing talks all year about the idea of trying to keep the Royals in Missouri. But she has not been directly involved in formal discussions of a new plan this week, she said.
And taking a stadium funding plan from start to finish in less than a week, O’Laughlin said, will be incredibly tough. 
“That would be pretty quick,” she said with a laugh.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Royals-NKC-Rendering-1024x576-1.jpg,,,2025-05-09 12:21:58.948661

(Photo By USAf/Getty Images)The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday asked a federal judge in Virginia to immediately halt what it calls a sweeping campaign of classroom censorship in military-run schools — including at Crossroads Elementary in Quantico — stemming from executive orders issued by former President Donald J. Trump earlier this year.
The motion for preliminary injunction, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, follows a lawsuit brought last month on behalf of 12 students enrolled in Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools. 
The students, from pre-K to 11th grade, are children of active-duty service members stationed in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan.
The ACLU’s new filing alleges that books and curriculum touching on race, gender and civil rights have been systematically scrubbed under the guise of enforcing executive orders 14168, 14185 and 14190, which instruct federal agencies to purge references to “gender ideology,” “divisive concepts” and diversity programming.
In Virginia, that has included removing materials from the library at Crossroads Elementary School in Quantico and canceling student events.
“The Trump administration cannot violate the First Amendment by removing books and curricula it doesn’t like,” said Matt Callahan, senior supervising attorney at the ACLU of Virginia. “Students have a right to see themselves reflected in their libraries and classrooms, and they also have a right to learn from the perspectives of people who aren’t like them. That’s no less true for military families than for anyone else.”
Among the 233 books listed as removed or “quarantined” in the latest motion are “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee, “Looking for Alaska” by John Green and “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A Hip-Hop History” by Jeff Chang. The plaintiffs say the materials most frequently targeted are by or about women, people of color and LGBTQ individuals.
Jessica Henninger, a Virginia-based military parent and one of the lead plaintiffs, said her family had remained silent for months out of fear. But after watching DoDEA schools cancel Juneteenth and Holocaust Remembrance Day events and take down posters of Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistan education activist shot by the Taliban and winner of the Nobel Peace Price age 17, and Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, she decided speaking out was no longer optional.
“We make sacrifices as a military family so that my husband can defend the Constitution and the rights and freedoms of all Americans,” Henninger said. “If our own rights and the rights of our children are at risk, we have a responsibility to speak out.”
In court filings, the ACLU argues that the censorship campaign has disrupted students’ academic progress — particularly those preparing for Advanced Placement exams — and created a chilling effect in classrooms. Some students now hesitate to ask questions about race or gender, worried that even inquiry could trigger administrative pushback.
“These are American students in American schools, and they have the same First Amendment rights as their peers,” said Emerson Sykes, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “Families in DoDEA schools have the right to access books about race and gender and the right to learn about the vibrantly diverse world around them.”
Virginia plays a central role in the case. Not only are some of the plaintiffs based in the state, but the case is being heard in the Eastern District of Virginia — a jurisdiction with a history of high-profile First Amendment rulings. Attorneys believe the court could set a national precedent on how far federal agencies, including the military, can go in shaping the content of public education.
While DoDEA officials have said the policy is about “safeguarding children,” critics say it’s political overreach, forcing public servants’ children to bear the brunt of ideological battles. 
The ACLU says the orders violate the Supreme Court’s 1982 decision in Island Trees School District v. Pico, which barred school officials from removing library books simply because they dislike the ideas within.
“This kind of political meddling is antithetical to the First Amendment,” said Corey Shapiro, legal director of the ACLU of Kentucky. “And in DoDEA schools, which are some of the most diverse and high-performing schools in the nation, the impact is magnified.”
If successful, the injunction could compel DoDEA to immediately restore books and classroom materials removed this year — including at Virginia installations — and affirm the rights of military families who, attorneys say, have been sidelined in a fight over what their children are allowed to read and learn.
“Our children are not political pawns,” Henninger said. “They deserve to learn the truth — and we intend to make sure they can.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Historical Society (IHS) will keep its building — and take ownership of the land it sits on — after a compromise with the governor’s office.
The agreement follows earlier consternation over the historical society’s Indianapolis headquarters during the 2025 legislative session.
​​Gov. Mike Braun’s original budget proposal for the upcoming biennium included provisions that would have terminated a longstanding lease agreement, under which IHS paid $1 annually to lease the state-owned land that houses the nonprofit’s 165,000-square-foot building. The lease also obligated the state to cover approximately $1 million per year in maintenance and operational costs.
House and Senate Republicans included similar, jeopardizing language in their budget drafts.
Braun’s office later clarified that the state did not intend to force the institution to give up its building. The final version of the budget retained provisions in current law that permit IHS-state leases and only struck the maintenance requirements.
“We are very pleased to have a final agreement with the state to set in motion a process to transfer to us the land we operate on currently. They have been terrific partners throughout,” said Jody Blankenship, president and CEO of IHS. “This agreement will put us on a path to carry out our mission for decades to come.”
State’s proposed budget could cost Indiana Historical Society its building

Braun signed the next two-year state spending plan this week. It takes effect July 1, at the start of the next fiscal year.
“We are pleased that the state and the Indiana Historical Society finalized an agreement that begins the process to transfer land from the state to the Society. We appreciate the partnership of the Indiana Historical Society Board and its leadership,” said Griffin Reid, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, in a written statement to the Capital Chronicle. “The necessary legislative changes, as reflected in the budget bill, allow the Indiana Historical Society to continue its mission to preserve and promote Indiana’s rich history.”
The historical society owns the downtown Indianapolis building where its headquarters, museum and archives are housed. It does not, however, own the land on which the building sits.
Language in the earlier budget drafts would have cancelled the existing lease agreement between the state and IHS.
According to contracts reviewed by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, any expiration or termination of the lease would have required IHS to “surrender to (the state)” the land in question.
Separately, a provision in state law required the historical society to “convey” its building title to the state after the structure was constructed. That law dated back to 1992, and the IHS building opened to the public in 1999.
The title was never transferred, however. Braun’s budget deleted that conveyance language from Indiana Code.
Braun’s office maintained that the state simply wanted to reduce or eliminate costs of contractual maintenance for the IHS building, and that the governor did not intend to assume the IHS building or the state land on which it sits.

He was 70.Gene’s most important roles were friend, mentor, son, husband and, above all, father. (Well then, why don’t you lede with the most important stuff? he says. Give me a break! I say.)Gene was born Sunday, Aug. 22, 1954, in Rockville Centre, N.Y., to Eugene Charles Cassidy, a federal immigration judge, and Helen (Almond), who was raised on an upstate New York dairy farm. The family, including older sister Maureen, lived in Natick, Mass., where young Gene attended St. Patrick’s School and sang in the boys’ choir. He attended Xavier High School in Concord, Mass., before graduating from Boston College High School in 1972.Smart and funny, Gene was defined by curiosity toward the world and generosity for the people in his life. From the start, he was an unusual thinker, an exceptional writer and an insatiable reader, though an apathetic student. (Too many adjectives, he says. I say: Too bad!) He nearly graduated from Boston University before dropping out to live among friends at the beach, including on Cape Cod and in Key West, Fla. He went windsurfing and scuba diving, catching lobsters to eat. He worked with Maureen at Anthony’s Pier 4 restaurant in South Boston and as a Boston cabbie, once ferrying a famous Celtics player to McDonald’s before a game.Gene was tall and handsome (made shorter in middle age after falling out of a tree). In the early ’80s, while eating pizza barefoot at a bar, he met Nancy (Porcella) and fell in love. They were married in 1982 and moved to Framingham, Mass.

Cassidy,” the columns grew to a regular job. Gene directed his zany skewering humor toward everyone from speeding drivers to corrupt executives and moved readers with his observations of daily life, including about his family. Op-eds written by his dog, an Akita named Bob, under the byline “B. Cassidy” were among his many hits. Gene soon led the night desk in the critical position of news editor, working overnight to shape stories and the daily report. He also shaped a generation of the paper’s reporters and editors, many of whom recalled him as a top mentor and beloved source of fun with talent to match. He could be gruff, with a newsroom temperament that ranged from seething exasperation to unbridled generosity and warmth. One former reporter recalled nights “often spent looming nervously over his shoulder as he not so delicately edited our copy and taught us life lessons about great storytelling.” He assisted the paper’s evolution to The MetroWest Daily News in 1998. After shaping the news all night, Gene was an active stay-at-home father all day, an uncommon sight in that era. Not just uncommon, Gene’s fatherhood was extraordinary. He nurtured deep bonds with Maggie and Charlie that lasted a lifetime. The trio walked to school, to Learned Pond and around Callahan State Park, often with Cocoa the dog. The family drove along the beach on Martha’s Vineyard each summer. Their cookouts were huge. (He says: Nice mix of short and long sentences!!!) Gene was very involved in Maggie’s soccer teams from youth through high school, including as a coach, criss-crossing Massachusetts in his nine-seater GMC Suburban with a gaggle of girls and equipment. He loved driving convertibles and drove Route 20 nearly cross-country with Charlie and the corgis, Lilo and Louie, in his wood-paneled Chrysler LeBaron in 2005. After divorce, Gene moved to White River Junction, Vt., in 2014 to be near Maggie, whom he’d helped to get a job at the Valley News. Charlie followed years later, and father and son moved in together in East Thetford in 2021, soon joined by Lottie the cat. In recent years, Gene rekindled an important friendship with Nancy.Gene Cassidy, of East Thetford, left, sings a Beatles song as he settles into an ice bath with support from Arjan van der Schoot, of South Woodstock, right, and Marion Griswold, of Greenfield, Massachusetts, back left, and Maria Coffin, of Hamden, Connecticut, back right, look on in White River Junction on Friday, Dec. 6, 2024.

Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley NewsIn the Upper Valley, Gene cherished time with Charlie; Maggie; his son-in-law, Chico Eastridge; and the Eastridge family. He made many friends while working briefly at the Hotel Coolidge and for 10 years at the Co-op Food Stores’ WRJ location. He loved chatting and laughing with colleagues, shoppers and his children in the grocery aisles, where he worked until his passing. (Hey, this thing is getting too long, he says. I know, I know, I say.)Gene’s final chapter, a joyous one, was marked by live music, dinners with friends and Royalton Community Radio. “All Vermont Music,” the Tuesday morning show he launched in 2021, defied its name with three-hour sets that spanned eras, genres and geography. (He once wrote that the show’s “eclectic” characterization meant “for God’s sake buddy, pick a lane.”) He recently helped relaunch a talk show about words and mentored until the end, encouraging a young colleague to pursue the writing she wanted to do.Throughout his life, Gene loved giving people gifts, silly or momentous. He picked up trash on walks and took it home to throw away. He volunteered, made art, cared for animals and tried to look out for people. To honor him, please do the same. (OK, Magg, time to wrap it up, he says. I don’t want to, I say. But I will.)In addition to many dear friends and family, Gene is survived by Charlie, Maggie, Nancy and Chico. We extend our deepest thanks to the EMTs who responded to Dad’s stroke; the medical professionals at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s emergency, neurology and neurocritical units; and the Byrne Center staff who compassionately assisted Dad’s journey. We were so grateful to be with him.In lieu of flowers, please donate to Royalton Community Radio (royaltonradio.org/donate) or the Jack Byrne Center (dartmouth-hitchcock.org/palliative-care/donate). And play badminton. He wanted to start a club!Come celebrate Gene’s life at the Hotel Coolidge in White River Junction, Vt., on the afternoon of Saturday, June 21, 2025. Details TBA.

Byron Donalds leading Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, 44%-25, in the race for the Republican nomination for governor in 2026.
That’s from a new poll conducted for the James Madison Institute (JMI) in the middle of May among 516 Republican voters.
That’s after those Republicans were informed that Donalds has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump for the governor’s race. The poll says initial results from GOP voters surveyed before learning of the Trump backing had Ms. DeSantis narrowly leading Donalds by a single point, 29%-28%.
Ms. DeSantis is not a declared candidate yet for governor, but she has not dismissed the possibility of running next year to succeed her husband, Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited from running again.
She has faced more media attention over the past month than at any other time as First Lady over the past six years. That’s because of reports about potential misappropriation of funds involving Hope Florida and the Hope Florida Foundation, the social welfare charity that she has been associated with.
Gov. DeSantis has accused House Republicans, the “liberal media,” and Democrats of launching “baseless smears against Hope Florida and by extension myself and the First Lady,” he said at a press conference in Kissimmee last month.
Donalds announced his candidacy for governor on Feb. 26, five days after  Trump endorsed him. Since his announcement, Donalds has reported raising more than $12 million as of the end of March, with most of that money flowing into his affiliated political committee.
The James Madison Institute commissioned two public polls, one in April and one in early May. The April poll results were taken when South Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo was still in the Democratic Party and a potential nominee for that party’s gubernatorial nomination next year.
The May poll shows former Northwest Florida U.S. Rep. and now cable news pundit Matt Gaetz in third place at 10%; Jeanette Nuñez, the former lieutenant governor and now interim president of Florida International University, in fourth place with 9% support. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez is next with 5%.
Democratic field
As mentioned above, the JMI poll surveyed voters in both April and May. In April, it surveyed 464 Democratic voters, who gave Pizzo 41% support.
In distant second place at that time was Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava with 15%. Former Republican U.S. Rep. turned Democrat David Jolly was next with 7%, followed by former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham at 5%.
Jacksonville state Rep. Angie Nixon and former South Florida state Sen. Lauren Book were next at 4%. South Florida state Sen. Shevrin Jones was at 2% and House Leader Fentrice Driskell was at 1%.
But with Pizzo’s departure, a follow-up survey in May of 396 Democratic voters showed Mayor Levine Cava now leads the Democrats with 32%. Gwen Graham is next at 13%, followed by Jolly at 10% and former state Sen. Lauren Book at 7%. However, 20% were undecided.
The survey in both months was conducted by Targoz Market Research of 1,200 voters, 43% of whom said they were Republicans, 33% Democrats, and 23% independent voters. It has a +/- margin of error of 2.77%.

Flowers and brunch are lovely, but what moms across Delaware really want this Mother’s Day is a break—from the chores, the schedules, and the mental load.
According to a new survey, Lewes tops the list as the most desired escape for mothers in search of some much-needed rest and relaxation.
The survey, conducted by Present.com, asked 3,025 mothers to share their ideal “momcation” destinations in Delaware.
READ: Delaware ranks #1 in nation for hospital quality by U.S. News & World Report
Lewes, a quiet seaside town known for its scenic views and laid-back charm, was the clear favorite.
Trap Pond State Park and Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge rounded out the top three.
With its calm beaches, historic streets, and tranquil trails through Cape Henlopen State Park, Lewes offers the kind of peaceful atmosphere many moms say they rarely get to enjoy.
“Whether it’s a bike ride along the bay or just sitting by the water with a good book, Lewes gives moms space to breathe,” the survey report noted.
Runner-up destinations also highlight a preference for nature and solitude.
Trap Pond State Park, with its bald cypress trees and quiet kayaking spots, is a haven for outdoorsy moms.
Meanwhile, Bombay Hook’s wide wetlands and birdwatching trails promise serenity for those seeking complete stillness.
But the destinations are just part of the story. T
he survey reveals that modern motherhood often leaves little room for recharging. Moms report getting just under six hours of alone time each week—far less than the nearly 8.5 hours they say they need to truly feel rested.
The biggest barriers to self-care are time, guilt, and financial constraints.
When asked how they’d spend a full day to themselves, moms favored simple pleasures: watching TV, sleeping in, spending time outdoors, or enjoying a hobby.
Their top dream gift? A clean house, followed closely by a full day off without responsibilities.
“Mother’s Day is about more than gifts—it’s about giving moms a real moment to recharge,” said Sanjit Sandhu of Present.com. “Whether that means a peaceful beach, a cozy nature walk, or just time without a to-do list, our survey shows moms are craving space to slow down and feel appreciated.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01e3c19c3855eea267b9d1d0ea36352c.jpg,,,2025-05-09 11:08:45.647714

Robert Prevost, the Chicago-born missionary who spent his career ministering in Peru and took over the Vatican’s powerful office of bishops, was elected the first pope from the United States in the history of the Catholic Church on Thursday.
Prevost took the name Leo XIV.
Archbishop Christopher Coyne, head of the Archdiocese of Hartford, said he was not expecting a decision to come so soon.
“I have to say when the announcement was made that Cardinal Prevost was to be our next pope, I was stunned. The first words out of my mouth were a two-letter phrase of which the first word is ‘holy.’ And I will leave the second word to your imagination,” he told reporters just hours after the white smoke emerged from the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican. “I never thought for a minute that an American would be elected pope.”
Coyne spoke at the Archdiocese of Hartford Pastoral Center in Bloomfield. He said he knows the new pope to be level-headed and well-qualified for the role.
“On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate our fellow American, Robert Francis Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV, on his elevation to the office of St. Peter,” Coyne said. “My hope is that he will show to the world a side of America that is merciful, charitable, generous and peaceful.”
Coyne said he hopes the election of an American pope will invigorate the Catholic faith in Connecticut and across the country. The new pope is also a citizen of Peru, where he served the church for many years, and Coyne noted the significance for the Peruvian community in Connecticut.
“I think the very fact that they were watching this man from Peru, who was a bishop in Peru, who is a citizen of Peru, speaking to them in Spanish — their hearts must have been just as full as mine is, as his being an American.”
Brian Stiltner, a theology professor at Sacred Heart University, said the newly-elected pope is known for his compassion towards marginalized groups such as immigrants.
“He’s a person with a global view of the economy and politics in the church,” Stiltner said. “From what we’ve seen of his public comments in social media in recent years, he is very much in the spirit of Pope Francis.”
Stiltner said the new pope will lead the church during a time of heightened divisions between conservative and liberal Catholics in the United States, but increased growth in Africa and Asia.
Prayers for Pope Leo XIV
In eastern Connecticut, Bishop Richard Reidy of the Catholic Diocese of Norwich offered prayers for the new pope. Reidy, who was appointed bishop just a few months before the death of Pope Francis, said the Catholic church is renewed and called the pope’s selection a visible sign of unity and hope.
“May his leadership draw the Church ever closer to Christ, and may he be strengthened in his mission to proclaim the truth in love to a world in need of mercy, peace, and faith,” Reidy said.
New Haven-area U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Catholic, says she is also praying for the new pope.
“I am praying for your success, your wisdom, and your moral clarity in guiding the church through these trying times,” DeLauro wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
DeLauro noted the last pope to take the name Leo is considered the father of Catholic social teaching, who affirmed the dignity of workers in the late 19th century. DeLauro, a Democrat, said she hopes the new Pope Leo carries on that tradition.
Gov. Ned Lamont said the pope’s selection is a celebratory day for millions of Catholics all over the world.
“My prayers are with Pope Leo XIV as he guides the church and leads with wisdom, faith, and compassion,” Lamont said.

(Courtesy of South Dakota NewsMedia Association)Delayed Postal Service deliveries of small-town newspapers are frustrating readers, undermining subscriptions and hurting advertising revenue, according to publishers across South Dakota.
“It’s taking nine days to get a paper from Armour to Sioux Falls,” said Julie Hinckley of Rocket Printing, which prints several small-town publications. “That’s unacceptable for timely news.”
Armour and Sioux Falls are about 95 miles apart. Many smaller publishers, like those that work with Rocket Printing, depend on the post office for deliveries to subscribers who’ve moved away to Sioux Falls or other locations but still want to receive their hometown paper. Some larger newspapers that formerly hired employees to deliver the paper now count on the post office even for local deliveries, due to tighter budgets, a migration to online readership and a lack of people interested in having a paper route.
The Postal Service had announced last year it would pause — at least until this year — a controversial plan to downgrade several mail processing centers, including one in Huron. The pause followed pushback from the state’s congressional delegation. 
In a Feb. 21 press release, the Postal Service announced a $3 billion cost-cutting initiative, but also mentioned $3 million in planned upgrades to the Huron facility. The release did not mention the removal of any sorting operations.
Then, in early April, a postal employee emailed David Bordewyk, executive director of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, to say that some sorting operations were halted in Huron, and some newspapers and other bulk mail were going to a postal facility in Fargo, North Dakota, before being routed back to South Dakota for final delivery.
The change adds days to delivery, according to newspaper publishers.
“We’re getting calls left and right,” said Barb Pechous with the Wagner Post. “Advertisers are starting to pull back.”

Dan Bechtold with the Winner Advocate said readers are assuming their subscription has lapsed when papers don’t arrive on time. 
“If something is coming up people want to know about, they’re going to miss it,” he said.
After reaching out to member newspapers, Bordewyk heard from at least a dozen papers reporting problems. He also reached out to the state’s congressional delegation, whose staffers said the Postal Service claimed the problem stemmed from newspapers not properly sorting their own mail. 
Bordewyk said that explanation “doesn’t make any sense,” because papers have been sorting the same way for years.
“Are they changing the rules in the middle of the game?” he said. “If things need to be fixed, tell us. Work with us.”
Bordewyk said the Postal Service has not provided newspapers with any updated guidance on how to prepare mail. He hopes to arrange a meeting between the papers and the Postal Service. 
The Postal Service responded to a request for comment by asking for more specific questions from South Dakota Searchlight, but did not immediately respond upon receiving those questions.



 Newspaper delays in South Dakota

The South Dakota NewsMedia Association has collected reports of postal delivery delays from member newspapers, including:

The Timber Lake Topic reported more readers switching to email delivery due to delays, but noted that many subscribers are elderly or lack reliable internet.
The Highmore Herald reported a subscriber in South Dakota who hasn’t received the last four issues.
The Aberdeen Insider said papers delivered just 50 miles away are taking seven days to arrive, resulting in a loss of subscribers. 
The Sanborn Weekly Journal, based in Woonsocket, said it had received at least six non-delivery calls in one week alone, far above normal.
The True Dakotan in Wessington Springs reported delays of at least two days and said a major delivery to Mitchell never arrived.
The Pioneer Review in Philip reported that its shopper publication didn’t reach Wall one week. A local postmaster confirmed that papers are now trucked from Huron to Fargo.
The Wagner Post reported papers taking up to nine days to reach customers.
The Grant County Review in Milbank received non-delivery complaints from as far as Vermont and Oregon.
The Sioux Valley News in Canton said cross-border deliveries to Iowa and Minnesota now take five days.
The Marshall County Journal in Britton noted delays forcing staff to re-mail individual copies in envelopes.
The Brookings Register said subscribers reported no delivery for a week, with delayed bundles arriving out of order.

(Screenshot of meeting)Starting next month, regents on New Mexico university boards will have to complete 10 hours of training to prepare them for their roles in guiding academic institutions. 
Senate Bill 19, sponsored by Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces), directs the New Mexico Department of Higher Education to develop those training hours to include topics such as state law, financial management, institutional governance and student success. The HED is tasked with providing the training and ensuring regents comply. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed SB19 on April 8 and the bill goes into effect on June 20. The bill states that current regents must complete the training by Dec. 31 this year. 
Higher Education Department Spokesperson Auriella Ortiz told Source NM in a written statement that members of the department have started considering requirements and platforms for the training, which she said is projected to be completed by the end of the year.
“Since the agency has provided a similar type of training for regents in the past, this process is not new to us,” Ortiz wrote.
Steven Neville, a former state senator who represented San Juan County, recently took over as chair of the Western New Mexico University Board of Regents. The entire board consists of four new members after previous members resigned or concluded their tenure in late 2024 and early 2025, following the board’s controversial decision to award outgoing university President Joseph Shepard a $1.9 million severance package. Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a civil suit against Shepard and the board in an effort to recover the state funds. A hearing is scheduled in June to consider Shepard’s motion to dismiss the case against him.
Neville told Source NM that he has a lot of knowledge about state law and financial management from his time as a lawmaker and member of the Legislative Finance Committee, which he will use in his new role, but university management is still different. 
“There’re certain things about the way universities run that are totally different than my county commission experience or my city council experience or even my state senate experience,” Neville said. “I’ve been on several boards and commissions through the years, but nothing is exactly the same.” 
He added that all four members of the board need some aspect of the future training, despite everyone’s background. He said the HED provided all new regents with a short orientation over a couple of hours when they were first appointed, but hopes that future training also involves more explanation of higher education policies and funding “intricacies that are a little different from one agency to the next.”
Ortiz reiterated to Source that the HED already provides training to newly appointed and reappointed regents covering topics such as governance, ethics, fiscal management and state and federal laws. 
“Adding a requirement of 10 hours will enhance a governing boards’ understanding of their appointed or elected positions in addition to the tools they need to better champion students, faculty and staff on their campuses,” Ortiz wrote. “It is important to note that Higher Education Secretary Stephanie M. Rodriguez and our colleagues at the department are always available to assist governing board members at any time beyond the training sessions.”
During the session earlier this year, Steinborn told Senate Education Committee members that he introduced the bill to ensure regents are prepared for their work in hiring university presidents, setting tuition and other actions that fundamentally impact students and faculty. SB19 was one of several bills and resolutions introduced this session that would have addressed the process for how regents are chosen and the preparation they receive for fulfilling their roles.
Steinborn also introduced Senate Joint Resolution 7, which would have required the governor to choose regent nominees from a pool of candidates approved by a nominating committee. House Joint Resolution 12, introduced by Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), would have codified regents’ fiduciary duties; moved regent removal proceedings to the district courts; and allowed the attorney general or a majority of the board to initiate the removal of a regent. Both resolutions would have required a ballot vote to amend the state constitution, however both died in committee.
“I think we owe it to our universities and our kids and taxpayers that we have the best regents we can get and that they’re trained,” Steinborn said during the committee meeting.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-09 13:42:09+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Devastating’: Blue Cross moms now face out of pocket costs for breastfeeding help,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/09/blue-cross-moms-now-face-out-of-pocket-costs-for-breastfeeding-help/,Mississippi moms will no longer be able to use Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi insurance to cover lactation services after they leave the hospital.,"Mississippi moms will no longer be able to use Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi insurance to cover lactation services after they leave the hospital. 
The Lactation Network, a third-party biller that allows Mississippians with certain insurance to see non-physician lactation consultants, will no longer accept Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi patients. The network was previously subsidizing the unpaid portion of the claim for these moms’ visits, but it said that it can no longer afford to do so.  
The Lactation Network did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Mississippi Today by the time the story published. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi is the state’s largest private insurer. Lactation consultants and breastfeeding advocates worry the reduced coverage will worsen Mississippi’s breastfeeding rate – already one of the lowest in the country. The loss in coverage could have profound impacts on the health of mothers and children, experts say. 
“It’s such a complex puzzle of how to improve maternal and infant outcomes, but we know that breastfeeding is an integral, foundational part of that,” said Dr. Christina Glick, a retired neonatologist and lactation consultant in the Jackson area. “ … Lack of reimbursement will interfere with delivery of care, which will reduce breastfeeding rates.”

Breastfeeding has been proven to lower the incidence of diseases, infections and depression in both mother and baby. But it’s not always straightforward, and the list of potential challenges is not short: oversupply, undersupply, allergies and sensitivities, problems with pumping upon return to work, milk blisters and a host of other issues. Ninety-two percent of new mothers report having trouble breastfeeding three days postpartum and needing support.
Shay Bequette, a 25-year-old from Hattiesburg with Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance, overcame multiple hurdles to breastfeed her baby, born in January.
“I was struggling,” Bequette said. “I’m the first in my family to breastfeed. And my son was really small … I knew something was wrong intuitively, but I just couldn’t understand because I was producing (milk), but he was constantly crying. I was breastfeeding for an hour and a half on each side and he was still crying like he was in pain.”
Emotions and stakes are high for mothers learning to breastfeed. Moms who struggle to breastfeed often report feeling a sense of failure, while also facing intense pressure to make sure their baby is gaining adequate weight. 
Though she didn’t want to, Bequette considered switching to formula – and says she would have if she wasn’t able to access affordable lactation support. 
“I was losing my marbles, I was crying, I was frustrated,” Bequette said. “My whole family was like, ‘you know, you’re just going to have to switch to formula, obviously it’s not working.’”

Instead, Bequette found Maranda Nybo, an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) based in Pass Christian who expanded her practice to include a once-weekly trip to Hattiesburg. Bequette credits all of her current breastfeeding success to Nybo.
“She saved my sanity, and she saved his life,” said Bequette. 
Now, Bequette will have to discontinue her care – and Nybo worries for the future of her practice, where she estimates between 80 and 90% of her clients use Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance.
“Sunday, Monday and (Tuesday) I’ve had 12 moms schedule appointments with me … every single one of them have been denied as of today,” Nybo told Mississippi Today. “All of them, except one, have canceled their appointments with me.”
The Lactation Network announced April 30 that working with certain insurance companies is no longer affordable.
“Historically, nearly 1 in 4 out-of-network visits that TLN covers go unpaid by health plans,” read an April 30 email from TLN to providers. “For a long time, we’ve subsidized the cost of care, hoping these plans would come around and reimburse us for this vital care. But that’s not sustainable — we can’t continue absorbing the costs that these plans should be covering.”
A spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield Mississippi told Mississippi Today the company wasn’t aware of the changes and has no formal agreement with TLN. 
“Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mississippi Members continue to have access to lactation consultation services when they use a Network Provider,” a Blue Cross spokesperson said.
The only in-network lactation consultants currently covered by Blue Cross are physicians, who do not generally operate outpatient clinics focused solely on breastfeeding care.  
While new mothers usually get some form of support while they’re still in the hospital, most breastfeeding problems don’t develop until well after they leave, explained Erin Mattingly, a Jackson-based IBCLC. 
“I hear all the time that parents think breastfeeding is going fairly well in the hospital and then they get home and things fall apart,” she said. “And a lot of that is because during their time in the hospital, for the vast majority of mothers, their mature milk supply has not even arrived yet. So, it’s after the mature milk comes in that they start to have issues.”
After parents leave the hospital, the next appointment is typically scheduled two weeks later with a pediatrician. The majority of mothers who are struggling to breastfeed will give up if they don’t get help in that interim period, Mattingly said. 
Even if moms continue breastfeeding for those two weeks, they don’t always get comprehensive lactation support during the pediatric visit.
Bequette says when she broached the subject with her obstetrician and her pediatrician, each of them referred her to the other for guidance. That’s not unusual, according to Mattingly. 
“Doctors are fantastic at what they do, but they don’t have the same lactation training that lactation consultants have,” Mattingly said. “And in addition to that, they don’t have the time. If they have 10, 15 minutes with a patient, that’s not enough time to observe a feeding, problem solve what could be going on, and create a strategy going forward.”
An average lactation session with Mattingly or Nybo runs between 60 and 90 minutes and costs between $100 and $125 without insurance. 
That may be an affordable out-of-pocket cost to some, but it will put support out of reach for many moms who are already at a disadvantage for breastfeeding. 
“As a private practice, for me this is devastating,” Nybo said. “But it’s also really devastating for the moms.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/09082035/IMG_0328.jpg,,,2025-05-09 10:02:47.633415

The western Oregon transit service is warning of potential service cuts if the state does not provide more funding. (Tillamook County Transportation District)Compared with major American cities, the ridership on public buses in Minot, North Dakota, can seem relatively minuscule.
But the 82,000 rides taken each year allow people without cars to get to work, help those with disabilities get around and connect patients with crucial health care.
“The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system,” said Brian Horinka, the city’s transit superintendent.
Like in many cities — from sprawling metropolitan areas to smaller and rural communities — the financial future of public transit is questionable in Minot, population 48,000. While increasing, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. Federal funding and state budgets remain uncertain, while inflation is pinching transit services.
For example, Horinka said he’s looking to buy a new 30-foot heavy-duty bus. He expects it will cost up to $700,000 because of inflation. Just five years ago, a similar model could be had for about $400,000, he said.
“We’re in dire straits, from a financial standpoint,” he said.
North Dakota’s four largest cities, including Minot, asked lawmakers for millions in extra grant dollars this year to keep transit buses rolling. The state enacted a new law awarding $2 million in grants — a welcome reprieve, but far less than the $15 million initially requested.
Republican state Rep. Dan Ruby, a sponsor of the legislation, said cities will likely need to increase local funding for bus systems.
“I don’t think it’s enough,” he said. “I think it is going to just be somewhat of a stopgap for some of them to be able to function.”
The law also calls for a study to develop a proposed funding formula for fixed-route bus systems. Ruby said he would prefer a permanent funding model that doesn’t require cities to continually rely on legislative grants.
“We also want to make sure that they’re not sitting on funds or running inefficiently just because they have the funding,” he said. “That’s the key to get support from most of the legislators, to show that they really do have a need and there’s no way to find any more cuts in their operations without affecting the people that need the rides.”
It’s indicative of discussions occurring in state capitals across the country as public transit faces existential funding challenges.
Public transit systems in major cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco face the potential of deep service cuts without more funding. But the problems also extend to smaller systems that connect people in rural America and smaller cities.
 
Partisan debates over transit funding
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the transit financial crisis affects residents in all 67 of the commonwealth’s counties.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said at a news conference in April.
Transit funding has been stuck in a partisan battle in Harrisburg.
In November, to stave off cuts, Shapiro ordered the transfer of more than $150 million in federal highway funds to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, which serves the greater Philadelphia area with bus and regional rail lines. He’s also backed legislation to increase transit funding, which has found support in the Democratic-controlled state House but so far has not advanced in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
Late last month, House Republican Leader Jesse Topper proposed partially privatizing the Philadelphia-area transit agency rather than increasing funding, which he said in a statement would “only serve to patch over the problems of a system chronically in crisis.”
“The same old, same old is clearly not working,” he said, according to a report by public radio station WESA.
The transit agency has said it already operates one of the most efficient systems in the nation. On a special website it created to call attention to its $213 million budget deficit, SEPTA said there’s “nothing left to cut from the budget but service.”
The authority has said it may be forced to cut services by 45% and raise fares by 20% without help from the state.
Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents a portion of North Philadelphia, said that would be “catastrophic” for the region.
“It makes this not only a less appealing place to live for people who are considering moving here,” he said, “but it also makes it difficult to live for folks who call this area home.”
Kenyatta, who dismissed the idea of privatization, said the state has a moral and economic obligation to ensure sustainable funding for public transportation.
“We’ve done patches here and there,” he said. “And that patchwork approach is not one that inspires the type of confidence and allows our transit agencies to do the type of long-term planning that they need to do.”
 
Transit’s pandemic ‘death spiral’
Mass transit saw some of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 as people worked from home and avoided public spaces.
The federal government provided nearly $70 billion in pandemic aid to transit programs, which saw revenues drop sharply because of reduced fare collections.
But with the rise of remote and hybrid work, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels even as costs for labor and equipment skyrocket. A recent Bloomberg News analysis estimates the nation’s largest transit systems are facing a $6 billion shortfall — only heightening fears of a so-called death spiral in which a combination of service cuts and fare increases cause further erosion of riders and revenue.
In Oregon, Democratic lawmakers have proposed increasing the state’s dedicated transit payroll tax. Billed as “a starting point,” the plan would increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.18% — estimated to raise $269 million over each two-year budget cycle.
“That’s appreciated, but it’s nowhere near what it needs to be,” said Brian Vitulli, general manager of the Tillamook County Transportation District in western Oregon. “There could be some service reductions in the near future if we don’t get more funding.”
Aside from rising costs, Vitulli faces major hiring challenges: The district has 19 drivers but could use eight to 10 more. With too few drivers, bus service has been cut to six days a week.
For some riders, the transit services provide a lifeline. After last year’s closure of Tillamook’s only dialysis center, for example, the agency began offering rides to other dialysis clinics well outside its service area.
That has driven up costs and tied up drivers, making services such as the on-demand Dial-A-Ride less available for other residents.
“We’re kind of the only option for these dialysis patients,” he said. “And we’re kind of prioritizing those trips rather than somebody who just wants to go to the Elks Club for lunch or something.”
Vitulli also serves on the board of the Oregon Transit Association, which is lobbying instead for a 0.4% increase in the transit payroll tax phased in over eight years. The association said the current 0.08% proposal could force transit providers across the state to cut services by as much as 25% in the next few years as inflation and decreased fare collections push many into deficits.
TriMet, which operates rail, bus and paratransit services across 533 square miles of the Portland region, said it would still need to cut services even if the lawmakers’ proposed 0.08% funding increase were approved. The agency faces a deficit of nearly $75 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
Oregon lawmakers are broadly concerned about federal spending cuts, which could turn the state’s modest budget surplus into a gaping deficit, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. Nearly a third of the state’s budget comes from federal money.
Democratic state Rep. Susan McLain said budget uncertainty has heightened scrutiny of all state spending this session. She is one of the authors of the state’s transportation proposal, crafted after nearly two years of meetings across the state. Aside from increasing the transit payroll tax, it calls for boosting the gas tax and hiking vehicle registration costs to help pay for road improvements.
McLain, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Transportation, said budget negotiations are ongoing, with aims of having hearings later this month.
While the state wants to do more to ensure everyone can access medical care, schools and jobs, McLain noted that belt-tightening is imperative for all manner of agencies, including transit.
“We’re really trying to dig in and find ways to do more with less,” she said, “but also to make sure that we’ve got sufficient, adequate types of investment in areas that we value.”

The judge’s concerns came days after a hearing in which Dianne Wilkerson and Joseph Feaster, the court-appointed receiver, took the stand.
The post Former state senator defends position at nursing home in receivership  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","DIANNE WILKERSON, the former state senator who now works at a financially struggling Boston nursing home, defended her salary after a Superior Court judge raised concerns. A year ago, after the Benjamin Healthcare Center was placed into receivership to avoid closing the long-term care facility, the court-appointed receiver hired Wilkerson as his executive assistant. But her role at the facility, located in Boston’s Mission Hill neighborhood, has come under scrutiny over the last several months. Christopher Belezos, the judge overseeing the receivership case, asked for more details about her salary information, citing testimony she had given in response to “allegations of nepotism and self-dealing.” The judge’s concerns, outlined in an April 22 filing, came days after a court hearing in which Wilkerson and Joseph Feaster, the court-appointed receiver, took the stand to deny allegations of financial mismanagement and nepotism. Separately, the nursing home’s administrator, Delicia Mark, also complained that Feaster and Wilkerson created a hostile work environment, an allegation which Feaster categorically denied. Feaster has known Wilkerson since their days on Beacon Hill in the Dukakis administration. Wilkerson, once considered a rising political star, resigned in 2008 from the state Senate seat she’d held for 15 years after she was indicted on federal corruption charges. Asked about her hiring and her history last year, Feaster said Wilkerson had “served her time” between 2011 and 2013 in prison. Noting that Wilkerson testified under the pains and penalty of perjury, Judge Belezos pointed to Wilkerson’s statement that she earned $82 an hour and worked 90 hours per week. Last September, Wilkerson told CommonWealth Beacon that she worked “probably 70 to 80 hours a week.” “If such testimony is accurate, it raises significant concerns as to the rate of remuneration being paid to Ms. Wilkerson by an institution in receivership” and projected to lose roughly $4.4 million in 2025, Judge Belezos wrote in his filing, asking for tax forms and her most recent paystubs. Wilkerson filed a May 3 affidavit in response saying she wanted to “clarify” her testimony. Her testimony of “90 hours” was meant to be in reference to 90 hours over a two-week pay period, and she worked an average of 45 to 50 hours per week, she wrote. She added that as a salaried employee, she is not paid overtime.  She also submitted a lengthy list of her job responsibilities, including negotiating contracts with vendors, working with a bookkeeper to collect money owed to the Benjamin, and serving as a point of contact for information and document requests from banks, state. and federal officials looking into the facility’s former administrator’s financial activity before receivership. Her paystub and other salary information were filed under seal for privacy reasons. In the affidavit, Wilkerson reiterated her denials of nepotism and self-dealing. The allegations were sparked by an anonymous letter from employees pointing to the hiring of Wilkerson relatives to work in the facility, as well as a snow removal contract given to a company run by two of her sons. When she was on the stand last month, Wilkerson said she was not involved in the hiring of her relatives, and the hiring of the relatives was not a conflict of interest. She defended the hiring of her sons’ snow removal company, citing a “flash snowstorm” during the Benjamin’s 2024 Christmas party. The questions about her role were raised as Feaster, the receiver, is talking to companies interested in taking over the 164-bed facility, which will turn 100 years old in 2027. It is the only nursing home in the Northeast serving predominantly Black residents. The terms and conditions of any takeover include keeping the Benjamin name and ensuring the real estate that the building sits on remains dedicated to the facility. There is no mortgage on the facility, according to Feaster. Proposals were originally due May 8, but Feaster has extended it to June 5. Any sale requires approvals from the state’s highest court, the state attorney general, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The next court date is set for May 15 in Suffolk Superior Court. The post Former state senator defends position at nursing home in receivership  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/janey-7.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-09 10:02:47.633415

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — An herbal substance used as both a stimulant and sedative will likely soon be illegal for anyone under 21 in South Carolina.
The two psychoactive compounds in kratom, which comes from the leaves of a tree in Southeast Asia, can provide energy in low doses or mimic the effects of opioids in large doses. Lawful and unregulated, the potentially dangerous drug is available for anyone to buy at stores statewide.
Legislation sent Thursday to Gov. Henry McMaster would change that.
The bill approved unanimously in both chambers would ban stores from selling kratom to anyone under 21 and from displaying kratom products in a place where minors can access them.
While kratom products, often sold in capsules or gummies, would still be legal for adults, the bill sets requirements for the packaging. The containers must have “clear” labeling that includes ingredients, the amount of kratom, recommended amount for safe usage, and servings per container.
The bill also bans selling kratom products mixed with other things.
Violators could be fined $1,000 on the first offense and $2,000 for each additional offense.
“There are no restrictions or regulations around any type of kratom product,” Sen. Russell Ott, the bill’s lead sponsor, told the SC Daily Gazette. “A 14-year-old could walk into a store, buy it — buy as much as they want — and it’s legal in the state of South Carolina.”
The law takes effect 60 days after the governor signs it. Ott said that should give owners of the stores that sell the products time to comply.
“We’re not going to have to wait another seven months with minors being able to access something that clearly has an impact,” said the St. Matthews Democrat. “I think it’s appropriate to say, ‘It’s not for the kids.’ I’m excited about the bottom line of getting it out of here.”
There are no federally approved uses of kratom. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against taking it, and the Drug Enforcement Agency considers it a drug of concern.
However, people use the drug to increase energy and alertness (in low doses) and as an alternative to opioids (in high doses) for pain relief and to manage withdrawal from opioids, according to the National Institute of Health. But it is also potentially addictive, linked to liver toxicity, seizures and could even be deadly.
Kratom was responsible for more than 4,100 deaths between 2020 and 2022, according to a Washington Post analysis of 44 states and Washington D.C. That is a fraction of the nearly 320,000 overdose deaths the Center for Disease Control and Prevention tallied during the same period.
Something brand new
Ott, a former House member newly elected to the Senate in November, said he first heard of kratom in 2018, when he got a call from a constituent about an addicted family member.
After that, he started noticing neon kratom signs regularly.
“I started asking some questions, but didn’t really get a lot of answers,” Ott said, adding he “just clearly realized that this was something kind of brand new.”
Then, about 2 ½ years ago, Ott got another phone call about it, this time from a friend’s son who admitted to having a kratom addiction.
Over a 90-minute conversation, the man detailed how the habit hurt his confidence and wallet, but said it’s still less dangerous than opioids and other drugs.
“He gave me both sides of it,” said Ott.
As kratom’s popularity has increased, states nationwide have tried to figure out how to tackle it.
At least six states, including Alabama and Arkansas, have banned kratom, according to an April report from the Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association. And in 18 more states the selling, manufacturing or possessing kratom is regulated, the report found.
Ott first proposed regulations on selling kratom last year.
The bill received a single hearing in the House before dying with the end of session. However, Ott noticed that more legislators were getting calls about kratom.
“We finally started getting a little traction, finally started getting people to ask more questions about it,” he said.
House moves quickly
A companion proposal to Ott’s was filed in the House in February. However, Rep. Heath Sessions, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he thought it had little chance this year.
But once the Senate unanimously approved the bill two weeks ago, supporters in the House jumped on the chance to make the bill law, the Rock Hill Republican told the SC Daily Gazette.
The lead sponsor of the House bill, Rep. Don Chapman, R-Townville has been pushing to regulate kratom since 2023.
Chapman, an architect, had a client with a son that became addicted to kratom while in high school and was eventually sent to rehab.
“He was taking so many pills because he built up a tolerance to it, and then just took more and more,” said Chapman, adding that he knows of constituents who have died from kratom overdoses.
This bill doesn’t stop anyone 21 or older from using it, Chapman said, likening it to alcohol.
But it does ensure that children are kept safe, the primary reason he advocated for the bill to be fast-tracked through the House.
“Time is at the essence when you’re trying to protect our young kids,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1298-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 10:02:47.633415

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Permafrost thaw is expected to impose costs of $37 billion to $51 billion to Alaska roads and buildings through the middle of the century, according to a newly published study.
The calculated toll, detailed in a study published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment, is higher than previous estimates of thaw costs to Alaska permafrost. That is because of a more complete inventory of roads, buildings and structures like storage tanks, made possible by improved satellite imagery and other technology, said lead author Elias Manos of the University of Connecticut.
Past studies have estimated several billion dollars in estimated costs. A 2023 study of thaw damages to infrastructure across the Arctic, for example, estimated costs to Alaska transportation facilities at between $14 billion and $24.5 billion by midcentury, with another $3 billion in costs from damages expected to buildings.
As information about existing infrastructure increases, estimates of costs are likely to do so as well, said Manos, who is pursuing the research as he works toward a doctoral degree. Better permafrost modeling could also help refine cost estimates, he said.
An important aspect of the study is that thaw damages analyzed are already ongoing, Manos said.
This number is what has already occurred or what is occurring in the moment, as opposed to what’s happening or going to happen the future,” he said.
The study compares expected costs under two climate scenarios, one with lower carbon emissions that eventually level off, creating less dramatic global warming, and the other with carbon emissions continuing at about their current rate, resulting in higher levels of warming.
It also compares effects in different parts of the state.
Measured by dollars, the Fairbanks North Star Borough stands to bear the highest costs, at over $7.4 billion for buildings and over $6 billion for roads through the 2060s, under the higher warming scenario. That reflects the concentration of infrastructure in that relatively high-population area, Manos said.
Measured per capita in the higher-warming scenario, the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area has the highest anticipated costs of permafrost-thaw damages to buildings and houses, the study found.
Even a more southern part of the state, where permafrost exists only in sporadic pockets, is vulnerable to damages, the study found. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough expected to have approximately $1 billion in permafrost-related costs through the 2060s, almost entirely from damage to roads, according to the study.
While enhanced information about infrastructure has enabled a more refined estimate for thaw-related costs, the infrastructure tally in the new study is incomplete.
It does not include the North Slope oil fields, oil pipelines, the Red Dog Mine or other large industrial sites. Manos said he has analyzed those and plans to include them in future studies. This study is more focused on communities “where people actually live,” he said.
Those communities are also where much of the cost of permafrost thaw is borne, sometimes without much assistance, said study co-author Anna Liljedahl of the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
Homeowners can buy flood insurance, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency provides aid to cover damage caused by various weather and climate events, Liljedahl noted. “But when it comes to permafrost, it’s not part of the language at the federal level,” she said.
The federal Stafford Act, under which FEMA provides disaster aid, addresses acute events like storms, not ongoing and more gradual events like permafrost thaw.
Thaw can be expensive to homeowners, nonetheless, she said. She cited cases in Fairbanks where people bought property without understanding the permafrost below. “Suddenly, there are sinkholes appearing, and their foundation is sinking in,” she said.
The analysis of thaw-related costs to infrastructure is continuing.
The Alaska-focused study is part of a more comprehensive circumpolar mapping project by Manos that also includes Canada and Russia.
Up to now, lack of data about infrastructure has posed a challenge, especially in Russia, he said. That is why satellite imagery is valuable.
“That’s kind of the beauty of satellite-based Earth observation, or as people call it, remote sensing,” he said. There is now commercial satellite imagery spanning the Arctic, he added.

Last week the Northern California beach town of Santa Cruz enacted a tax on sodas, ice teas and other beverages with added sugar. Voters approved the 2-cent-per-ounce tax in November, despite the beverage industry pouring at least $1.2 million in opposition.
Besides generating an estimated $1.3 million for the city, the tax aims to curb the overconsumption of sugary drinks, which research has shown to work. Drinking too many sugary drinks can lead to heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, said Blythe Young, a lobbyist for the American Heart Association, a key proponent of the tax.

Young: “The average American consumes a bathtub full of sugar from sugary drinks annually, or 30 gallons.”

But the tax also exists in defiance of state law — sort of.
Let’s back up: In 2018 California lawmakers brokered a deal with the beverage industry to preemptively ban local governments from implementing local grocery taxes until 2030.
That law included a provision requiring the state to withhold local sales tax revenue from any city imposing its own new grocery tax, even if a court determined that the tax “is a valid exercise of a city’s authority.”
Charter cities — which under California’s constitution are granted more flexibility from some state laws — took that part personally. Especially Santa Cruz, at the time poised to put a soda tax proposal before voters, which it then had to scrap.
But, in 2023 a state appeals court ruled that the withholding revenue part of the law was unconstitutional, giving Santa Cruz’s city council the green light to move forward with a soda tax. So, the law against cities enacting their own grocery tax is still in effect, but the law has no teeth (perhaps appropriate for a law effectively protecting sugar consumption).
In a statement to CalMatters, the American Beverage Association said it is assessing next steps, decrying Santa Cruz’s tax as illegal and an “unfair burden on working families struggling with record-high prices.”
A legal dispute would serve as yet another instance of a city attempting to carve out more autonomy. Cities have recently fought to enact their own housing policies, election rules and book bans. But instead of coming to blows with the state (or the federal government at times), Santa Cruz would be facing a multibillion-dollar industry.

Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson, Vice Mayor of Santa Cruz: “We’re ready for that. … It does not have to be the case where people with money or special interests can dictate how a city, county or state makes decisions. It should not be.”

Prisons not ready for disasters, report finds

As President Donald Trump directs the Department of Justice and FBI to reopen the aging Alcatraz as a prison, a review of 30 active state prisons found that California’s corrections system is woefully unprepared for natural disasters, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Published last week, the report by an independent oversight agency said that issues with transportation, overcrowding and an emphasis on reshuffling prisoners within prison walls during a disaster instead of an outside location, are some of the shortcomings of the prisons’ emergency preparedness.

The report: “The department is unable to evacuate the incarcerated population and staff at most prisons within the first critical 72 hours of an emergency. Without the ability to quickly evacuate prisons, it is likely that wildfires, floods, and earthquakes will result in loss of life within the incarcerated population.”

In 2023 storms threatened to flood two San Joaquin Valley prisons. The prisons ultimately remained safe, but the event underscored the department’s need to develop better evacuation plans.
Some human rights advocates say the findings are still troubling, confirming what they’ve argued for years about the department’s inability to face climate hazards.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Observe New Mexico Elections on Thursday released a report on its findings from the state’s 2024 election that mostly gave high marks after observing operations at a majority of voting sites during early voting and on election day.
Specifically, the nonprofit election transparency group dispatched 50 watchers to 91 sites in 24 counties during early voting, and had 160 election site watchers in 29 of New Mexico’s 33 counties on election day.
“This important, nonpartisan information-gathering effort — led by and for New Mexicans — found that elections went well, votes were counted, and problems were limited,” ONME co-leader Carmen Lopez said in a statement. “We are pleased to see that the findings reflect sufficient staffing levels, poll timeliness, proper functioning of tabulators and voter privacy. All of these things in conjunction made it possible to ensure every vote was counted and New Mexicans’ voices were heard this election cycle. The findings of our report — showing both successes and room for improvement — will allow us to make the voting process and poll worker training even stronger and more transparent in the years to come.”
Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told Source New Mexico she had not seen the report yet, but had heard about its findings.
“That’s what we always shoot for,” she said when Source conveyed the report’s overall positive findings. “So, that’s good.”
The report did identify a handful of issues, such as same-day registration overwhelming the system, as Source reported last year.
The ONME report recommends  “the state ensures robust stress-testing of the bandwidth available to accommodate processing of same-day voter registrations and works closely with county clerks to increase the levels of staffing necessary to process same-day registrations in a timely manner.”
Toulouse Oliver said the state suffered server problems during the morning of the Nov. 5, 2025 general election, followed by a large volume of people participating in same-day registration. According to data provided at the time, 52,705 people used same-day voter registration in last year’s general election — and approximately half of them did so on election day.
County clerks had already fallen behind due to the server issues, Toulouse Oliver said, and the volume of people registering to vote overwhelmed them. “I’m not criticizing the clerks at all,” she added. “This is not their fault, but they did not have enough staff to process the amount of registrations that came in through the day and with the backup and everything it did get bogged down.”
For the next election, she said, the state will need to ensure the servers are robust enough and clerks will need to have adequate staffing, in so far as the budget allows. That being said, she does not anticipate a repeat of the same-day registration overwhelm from last year’s Election Day.
“I really feel like 2024 was an anomaly when it comes to same day registration,” she said, compared with years past. Moreover, starting this summer, the state will have automatic voter registration through the Motor Vehicle Division. “So I really feel like between just that election being an anomaly and AVR, and now that we know we need more resources on [same day registration], moving forward, just in case, I think it’s going to be much better.”
The ONME report also identified confusion by some presiding judges at polling places over the use of provisional ballots, which also were used in higher numbers last year, as well as seven locations that lacked sufficient provisional ballots. Toulouse Oliver said she had not heard previously of any locations running out of provisional ballots. She said given the challenges clerks were facing with same-day registration, her office was repeatedly advising the use of provisional ballots. “That’s what they are there for,” she noted. Legislation that would have provided additional training on issues like provisional ballots did not pass the Legislature, Toulouse Oliver said, but nonetheless, her office plans to keep reinforcing “the provisional process as the option for… if SDR is not working.”
ONME also recommended the state and county clerks, during early voting and on election day, use trained translators who are familiar with elections terminology after “watchers were unable to validate that written and oral translation services into Native languages were provided in all areas of the state covered as minority language jurisdictions under Section 203 of the federal Voting Rights Act.”
Toulouse Oliver told Source NM she thinks “we do a really good job of that in our Native communities, because that’s who we hire is people who can speak and interpret.” She said her interpretation of Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act is that clerks need to have people available, but not necessarily physically present, to provide other translation services as needed.
“And I have been under the assumption that every county that falls under that section is doing that, and apparently that’s not the case. Apparently we need to do a better job of that,” she said.
Toulouse Oliver said while her office already works with academic institutions, including the University of New Mexico, for analyses of elections, she’s happy to receive the additional outside observations.
“They make some really good points,” she said. “And…from our perspective of trying to make the argument to the Legislature,’we need this or we need that,’ it’s not just coming from me. It’s coming from other sources.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/elex3LR-2048x1356-1-1024x678.png,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

“You've got plenty of money. Stop the nonsense and start figuring it out and start rolling up your sleeves,” said Rep. Michael Soter in response to the Cannabis Control Commission’s ask for more money. 
The post Cannabis commission, elected leaders out of sync on budget ask appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKERS work to craft a budget, facing an ever-shrinking pile of money coming from the federal government and rattled by economic uncertainty, the leaders of one of the state’s most troubled agencies – the Cannabis Control Commission – are saying that they cannot make crucial improvements without more money from the Legislature. But legislators, so far, aren’t buying it. According to Travis Ahern, the CCC’s new executive director, the agency needs more money to make key IT infrastructure updates that will fix some of the issues that the agency has come under fire for, like failing to collect $550,000 in licensing fees. The commission has asked the Legislature for over $30 million for Fiscal Year 2026, with $2 million allocated towards the IT upgrades.  Just a few months out from the often-stretched deadline to finalize the budget, the CCC’s ask looks unlikely to come through. Budget proposals from the governor, the House, and the Senate have all capped the commission’s budget at $19.88 million.  From his perch at the CCC, Ahern describes the roughly $9 million gap as a roadblock to needed upgrades. “The best way to optimize operations of this regulatory body is by investing in IT infrastructure,” he said. “We are looking to do the procurement to replace or enhance those systems, but as of right now, especially with [how] the FY26 budget looks, we don’t have the funding to do that. … When people ask [me] how can I reorganize or how can I create efficiencies within the organization, without the proper [IT] tools, it’s really difficult to say.” The implications if the agency doesn’t receive this funding go beyond IT infrastructure updates, said Ahern. A training initiative for people from disadvantaged backgrounds who want to participate in the cannabis industry is also at risk of being put on hold. The commission has previously said that a budget shortfall led to jobs going unfilled and mandated research and public awareness campaigns being put on hold.  Legislators are publicly frustrated with the agency, which has drawn unfavorable attention with allegations of harassment, slow regulatory rollouts, power struggles between commissioners following the suspension of the commission chair over allegations of racial insensitivity, and operational failures.  Inspector General Jeffrey Shapiro called the CCC a “rudderless ship” in June 2024. He urged the Legislature to put the agency under receivership and to reorganize the commission’s leadership structure. This March, he called on the agency to conduct an audit over the issue of uncollected fees and to make fixes to its IT systems. State Rep. Michael Soter of Bellingham, a Republican who is on the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy, said that the commission needs to try hard to prove that it is functional before the Legislature allocates any more money to the agency, especially in a year when the state expects limited revenue growth.  “They need to evaluate what they’ve been doing, and I think they need to kind of look through where they need to make some efficiencies to get the money that they need to make things work,” Soter said of the CCC. “Throwing more money at a problem that no one has put a plan together to fix is not a great way to approach this.” State Sen. Michael Moore of Millbury, who has pushed for a bill that would establish an internal audit unit within the commission, said that the commission should look into spending their budget more efficiently to find the money for a new IT system.  “It’s very difficult when you have an agency that’s had the problems that the [CCC has] had to then come back and ask for additional money when you’ve seen money squandered,” said Moore. “We’ve seen money that was supposed to be brought in as revenue not brought in,” he said, referring to the uncollected licensing fees. “It would be very hard for anyone to give additional resources when they’ve had the managerial problems that they [have] had.” Soter said that other legislators didn’t seem particularly keen on increasing the CCC’s budget. When the budget proposal was presented to the House, he said, there was agreement on the commission’s line item. “They need to get their act together and earn the respect back to show us that they actually need this,” said Soter. “It’s an excuse to say we can’t do this because you’re not giving us more money. …You’ve got plenty of money. Stop the nonsense and start figuring it out and start rolling up your sleeves.” Ahern said that he is ready to roll up his sleeves and make the commission more efficient, but that a better IT infrastructure will give him more information to institute changes. It’s “impossible” to respond when people ask “Do you have enough people? Do you have too many people? Should you be shifting priorities within the organization?” said Ahern. “If we were able to more efficiently deal with all of the things that we rely on those IT platforms for, then that would change the way that I would approach managing the organization, administering our mission.” One of the chairs on the cannabis policy committee, Rep. Daniel Donahue of Worcester, affirmed his support for the budget as it stands and said that legislators are still considering making reforms at the embattled state agency. “The requested IT infrastructure improvements are better suited to the resources made available through IT bonds,” said Donahue in an emailed statement, referring to bond bills targeting IT upgrades. In December 2024, the commission’s Acting Chair Bruce Stebbins sent a letter to the chairs of the legislative cannabis policy committee, arguing that the both the commission’s responsibilities and inflation have increased year over year, but the agency’s budget has mostly remained flat at around $19 million. “Although the cannabis industry has experienced significant growth and tax revenues have steadily increased, the commission’s budget has not proportionally increased, limiting our ability to meet regulatory requirements and the needs of the industry,” Stebbins wrote.  Though Ahern said he is disappointed that the agency won’t have the extra money, he will try to find other sources of money and work with other state agencies like the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security to make IT upgrades.  He’d like to get the agency on track, as far from the scandal-plagued last year as possible. “I would love the CCC to get to a position where we’re a boring regulatory agency, and people don’t really think about us,” said Ahern when asked about what his goal for the commission is. “We don’t want to be in the news cycle unless it’s an interesting story on the cannabis industry. That’s where we want to be. We want to be a non-news story.” The post Cannabis commission, elected leaders out of sync on budget ask appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/470937768_2270163153363719_6060005292694954621_n.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

(Photo by: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The Clark County teachers union is pushing legislation to speed up the arbitration process and allow teachers to petition district court to allow them to legally go on strike.
If the Legislature doesn’t pass the proposal — or if Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoes it — the union says it is prepared to make their case directly to Nevada voters through their “right to strike” initiative, which is already slated to appear on the 2026 General Election ballot.
Clark County Education Association, which represents the approximately 18,000 teachers and licensed professionals within the Clark County School District, is backing Senate Bill 161. The bill would establish an expedited arbitration process for teachers unions and school districts, which could kick in if a contract has not been reached 75 days before the start of a new school year.
More controversially, the bill would also establish a pathway for K-12 public school teachers to legally go on strike, something they are currently prohibited from doing.
The bill, which was given an exemption from standard legislative deadlines, received its first hearing Wednesday night in the Senate Committee on Government Affairs. The bill was immediately passed out of committee on a 5-2 vote and is headed to the full Senate for possible consideration.
State Sen. Rochelle Nuygen, the Las Vegas Democrat sponsoring the bill, told the committee that the threshold set in SB 161 to authorize a strike is high. Teachers would have to make the case that their proposed strike would be “equally or less detrimental” to students than remaining in schools that are failing them through existing policies or conditions.
The strike would also not apply to special education services, food services, mental health counseling, and after-school supervision.
Nguyen characterized it as a nuanced approach that meets the spirit of the state’s existing anti-strike law while addressing the established pattern of prolonged arbitration between the fifth largest school district in the country and its largest bargaining unit.
In contrast, the right-to-strike ballot initiative would be a “blunt instrument,” she argued. Nevada state law prohibits legislators from altering a law established through the initiative petition process for two regular sessions (so, four years) after it is approved by voters, so lawmakers couldn’t quickly alter it if issues arose.
“That’s the choice,” CCEA Executive Director John Vellardita told the Nevada Current in an interview. “The choice is: This is going to be on the ballot in ‘26. We have the resources to run a successful campaign. We’ve done field research. We have the support.”
Bradley Schrager, an attorney who represented the teacher’s union in numerous cases two years ago, pointed out in the bill hearing that CCSD and CCEA have reached a negotiation impasse and gone into arbitration four times in the past decade.
“There’s only five two-year cycles in a decade,” he added.
The pattern of prolonged arbitration means teachers are routinely beginning the academic year without new contracts in place, which can be demoralizing and lead to poor teacher retention, argued CCEA members who spoke in support of the bill.
That was the case in 2023, when the Legislature and Lombardo approved a K-12 education budget they routinely described as “historic” in its funding levels, only to see another impasse and months of public bickering between the district and union. That year, a contract agreement was reached in December, halfway through the school year.
That fall, a significant percentage of teachers at a handful of schools coordinated “sickouts,” leading to those schools closing for one day. The court ruled it strike activity, which put the union at risk of punishment.
SB 161 “forces cooperation at a very early time,” said Schrager, and evens the playing field between the union and district.
But not everyone agrees with that sentiment.
Tom Clark, a lobbyist representing the Nevada Association of School Boards and the Reno+Sparks Chamber of Commerce, suggested teachers strikes would wreak havoc on communities, make national news, and cause pain and suffering to families. Tens of thousands of children could be left without childcare, he added.
“That’s the leverage the strike gives to one side of the equation,” he said. “That imbalance does nothing for negotiations, does nothing for the benefits of students, the teachers, the families, the people in our community that rely on the vital public service that our teachers and our schools provide.”
The Nevada State Education Association, whose affiliate units include teachers in non-Clark counties and support staff in CCSD, is opposed to the bill on the grounds it would give teacher’s unions an unfair advantage over other bargaining groups. NSEA and CCEA have an antagonistic relationship with one another.
The Nevada Association of School Superintendents is also opposed, with lobbyist Mary Pierczynski arguing that states like Nevada have outlawed teacher strikes “for very good reason.”
“The emphasis tonight has been on Clark County and CCEA but there are 17 school districts in our state and they will all be impacted,” she added.
CCSD did not participate in the hearing and has not expressed a public position on the bill. When contacted by the Current for comment, the district’s media relations department stated it is tracking the bill.
“District staff work with legislators to monitor changes made to the language in bill drafts. CCSD provides public comment on bills as appropriate throughout the process as the legislation progresses,” continued the statement.
Nguyen in her presentation emphasized the bill is not a criticism of Jhone Ebert, CCSD’s new superintendent, who started last month. Nguyen said she and others working on the bill are “rooting for her success.”
This year’s legislative session is scheduled to end on June 2. That leaves SB 161 a little over three weeks to pass both chambers of the Legislature and make it to the governor’s desk.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190823_165829-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

Chris Hoene
Chris Hoene is the executive director of the California Budget & Policy Center, a nonpartisan research and analysis nonprofit.


As California leaders and advocates enter prime budget negotiations, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s revised proposal may soon provide clarity, revealing an expected shortfall and a lot of uncertainty driven by federal leaders. 
At the same time, Californians are facing real and growing needs, driven by rising housing costs, persistent inflation and new pressures like tariffs. 
We’re also still waiting to see what happens with the federal budget, as Congress and the president make it a priority to cut health care, food and other vital benefits, while spending billions on tax cuts for the rich. 
Newsom’s May revision must reflect the urgency that Californians are feeling. This is not the time to pit programs and people against each other. It is time for leaders to put people first and advance a vision for California that lies in stark contrast to that of federal leaders. 
For many Californians — especially those with low incomes — this is not a debate about politics or complex policy. It’s about whether they will continue to have access to housing, local hospitals, health care, child care, public transportation, food and other basic needs. 
Scaling back social supports during economic uncertainty only worsens inequality by making it harder for Californians to cover basic expenses and live with stability. Voters across the state see this as a serious and growing concern. 
In this environment, California must lead. State leaders can do this by boosting revenue streams and making the tax system more fair. 
California has often led the nation in bold policymaking. But in this moment, other states are stepping up to protect their residents.
In Minnesota, for instance, House members introduced the Protect Medicaid, Not Millionaires Act, which would raise new state revenue through a tax on millionaires, allowing the state to offset lost federal Medicaid funding if cuts are enacted. This would make taxes more fair for millionaires, who stand to reap huge benefits under the federal budget proposal, while preventing state residents from losing vital health care. 
In New Mexico, a bipartisan group of state senators has earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars in a Medicaid trust fund to support the state’s recipients if Congressional Republicans are successful at slashing health care benefits for millions of Americans. 
And in Washington state, the legislature approved an $8.7 billion revenue package to help balance the budget and prevent deep cuts to services amid federal uncertainty. The measures raise taxes on high earners and large businesses through increases to the capital gains tax, estate tax and business taxes, while expanding the sales tax to new services and eliminating certain tax breaks.
These approaches may not be tailor-made for California, but they offer compelling examples of courageous state action. 
Newsom and state legislative leaders should take steps through this year’s budget to protect California’s most vulnerable against mounting federal threats. That begins with aligning tax and budget policy with our values. 
California gives away billions annually through tax breaks that primarily benefit corporations and high-income households. Closing these loopholes is not only fair — it’s fiscally responsible.

They still aren’t ready,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/05/prisons-natural-disasters/,"Earthquakes, wildfires and floods all could cause problems for California prisons. A new audit says they aren't ready to quickly evacuate prisoners.","In summary
Earthquakes, wildfires and floods all could cause problems for California prisons. A new audit says they aren’t ready to quickly evacuate prisoners.


In 2023, amid record-breaking rain and snow, two prisons in the southern San Joaquin Valley faced a serious risk of flooding. But neither prison, California State Prison, Corcoran or the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, had a robust evacuation plan on hand and ready for the looming disaster.  
Instead, the prisons developed a joint plan to transfer roughly 8,000 incarcerated people to other state prisons within 11 to 14 days — or longer. Wheelchair-bound individuals, the plan stated, would take six days to evacuate. And department buses intended to shuttle people to safety could take up to a day to arrive.
The floods that year ultimately did not reach the prisons, but the threat they posed illustrated how California’s 90,000-prisoner corrections system has failed to prepare for natural disasters. That’s according to a report issued last week by an independent agency that oversees the department’s disciplinary process and internal investigations. 
“While California’s prisons are vulnerable to wildfires, floods, and earthquakes, we found they are not adequately prepared to respond to emergencies posed by natural disasters,” stated the report by the Office of Inspector General, which reviewed emergency plans for 30 state prisons after fielding concerns about the department’s disaster response. 
The report detailed deep fractures in the department’s emergency preparedness, including issues of transportation, varied risk assessment methodologies, lacking mutual aid agreements, timely evacuations, and prison overcrowding. As of December, California’s prison system was operating at roughly 120% – or 16,000 people – over its designed capacity, according to the report. 
“Not only are some prisons overcrowded, but the department is unable to evacuate the incarcerated population and staff at most prisons within the first critical 72 hours of an emergency,” the report noted. “Without the ability to quickly evacuate prisons, it is likely that wildfires, floods, and earthquakes will result in loss of life within the incarcerated population.”
Notably, the inspector general found that none of the prisons included a plan to evacuate incarcerated people outside their gates, but rather focused on moving “the incarcerated population to and from locations within the prison.” 
The report concluded with a list of 18 recommendations, including ones that would bring the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation into compliance with California regulations around emergency planning. 
Carlee Purdum, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Houston who researches how disasters impact incarcerated people, said the report is a “first step” in identifying more resources to support prisons and corrections agencies as they plan and prepare.
“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Purdum said. “Prisons and corrections agencies are very marginalized and isolated in the emergency and disaster planning space. The significant takeaway should be that we have not engaged in these kinds of discussions, and put forth the kind of state level resources and accountability into these institutions.” 
Advocates for years have been sounding the alarm over the ways in which California prisons are ill-equipped to confront climate hazards due to issues such as overcrowding and aging infrastructure. A 2023 report by the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and the nonprofit organization Ella Baker Center for Human Rights chronicled those concerns and urged the state to implement safeguards. 
“People inside have a fear that the actual plan is to abandon them in the case of an emergency. It is deeply troubling,” said James King, director of programs for the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. “In these public health crises, it’s not just going to affect the people in the prisons, either incarcerated there or working there. It’s going to impact the entire county, the entire community.”

Those concerns were echoed by Dax Proctor, statewide coordinator for Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a statewide coalition of organizations that view climate hazards as a key reason to close prisons.
“The number one solution to address these issues at hand is to reduce the number of people locked up in California prisons as rapidly as possible,” Proctor said. “A good starting place would be those most vulnerable to climate hazards.”
Officials from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services answered questions about the report before lawmakers at a hearing Thursday. They assured lawmakers that the department would not work alone in a large-scale emergency.
“California has a vast amount of resources and we would rely heavily on our federal, state and local partners to assist us with the evacuation of an entire prison,” said Melissa Prill, special agent-in-charge at the corrections department’s Office of Correctional Safety.

But Sen. Laura Richardson, a Democrat from Inglewood, said that in an unpredictable situation, those partners “may be busy assisting other people.”
“To assume that these other agencies are going to be available to help you, or to help us in a prison environment is not something, going forward, we have the freedom to assume,” Richardson said. “I would give this (office of inspector general)’s report of your organization — I would consider it an ‘F’ — frankly.”
Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Republican from Murrieta, said he wasn’t “extremely critically concerned.”
“I think we’re getting a little overboard in terms of thinking that we are going to have to evacuate entire prisons,” Seyarto said. “It’s just not a practical thing to think that somehow the whole prison is going to catch on fire.”
In a statement to CalMatters, department spokesperson Mary Xjimenez said prisons take an “all-hazards” approach to emergency planning and that it coordinates its plans with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. The department “follows the FEMA National Incident Management System, which is the national doctrine that provides all federal, state, and local response agencies with a consistent set of principles, management structures, and a systematic approach to emergency response.”
King said the department has a history of being unprepared for climate hazards and instead reacts to them once they inevitably occur. 
“These are simply facts,” King said. The department “could accept these facts and do something about them — or they could try to manage their response to the report. Disappointedly, it seems like they’ve chosen the latter. This is an opportunity to improve their response, to see the gaps and to create plans that address the gaps. ”

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Freddy Lazo left a restaurant job for a higher paying one in trucking about two-and-a-half years ago. But the way President Trump’s trade war is going, he’s thinking he might have to go back to waiting tables soon.
“It’s really super slow,” Lazo said, looking across the mostly empty trucking yard of shipping company Big Blue Box in New Brighton.
A slump in work is to be expected in this industry every once in a while, although in normal times, it’s usually brief and quickly followed by a boom in business. Looking out at the horizon though, harder times may lie ahead.
Since “Liberation Day” on April 2, when Trump announced tariffs on the whole world, many retailers have suspended orders of patio furniture, Barbie dolls, candles and everything else that arrives on rail from coastal ports in giant shipping containers, which Lazo trucks to final destinations across the Midwest. Although Trump paused the so-called reciprocal tariffs, the 145% tax on Chinese imports and a 10% tax on imports from most other countries remain, along with deep uncertainty.
Lazo is an independent contractor, which means if he’s not driving, he’s not getting paid. It also means he’s not eligible for unemployment benefits to ease the pain of lost earnings. Fortunately, he’s already paid off his older rig and has been able to tap into his savings. Still, a protracted slowdown would mean he or his wife will need to get another job to support their five kids.
“If this continues… I definitely have to find a different way to make money,” Lazo said.
Big Blue Box Vice President Ted Longbella said they aim to move about 120 containers a day — big blue shipping containers, as the name suggests. Toys, windows and games come in. Scrap metal, grain and dairy powder go out.
He’s been keeping a close eye on the number of blank sailings, when an ocean shipping company cancels a planned trip, because it tells him what demand will be like in the near future.
He’s like a taxi driver staring up at the airport sign listing arrivals and watching one flight after another canceled. There are passengers that still need rides home now, but pretty soon the airport will be empty.

There are more than 56,000 semi-truck drivers and another 18,000 light truck drivers in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development, meaning widespread layoffs and reductions in income could ripple throughout the greater economy.
Ocean carriers in the Pacific have been canceling trips at a faster rate than during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to freight forwarder Flexport. The company reports more than 25% of weekly transpacific service-loops were canceled in late April and early May compared to 24% in the same time period in 2020.
Cargo at the massive Port of Los Angeles, which handled nearly 20 million containers in 2024, is down 35% in early May from the same time last year.
To prepare for the coming dip, Longbella said he’s put on his salesman hat to find new business to keep his 140 employees and independent contractors busy — and keep them from leaving to work for competitors.
He said truckers in Minnesota will really feel the effects of the tariffs around June, when the surge of goods that were panic-ordered before Liberation Day turns into a trickle.
That lines up with a timeline of turmoil from Apollo Global Management, which predicts empty shelves by the end of May and layoffs in trucking and retail in early June. A recession could follow shortly after that.
The situation could be worse had companies not diversified their suppliers after the COVID-19 pandemic to be less reliant on China. Many companies have been able to switch to suppliers from other countries and are now loading up on goods before the pause on reciprocal tariffs lifts on July 9.
Yet it’s not just imports that are suffering.
“We’re usually doing a lot of soybean pickups throughout the whole year, and those have slowed since the tariff uncertainty,” Longbella said.
Trump administration officials are scheduled to meet with Chinese representatives this weekend in Switzerland, which could help lead to a deal that reduces the tariffs on China that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as effectively an embargo. Even if Trump lays down arms in the trade war soon — an unlikely, best case scenario — the trucking and retail industries will still feel aftershocks.
“On the other side, demand is going to be nuts,” Longbella said.
That will give shipping companies power to raise prices like they did during the pandemic. The challenge for truckers is to make it to the other side.
“Trucking companies have to pay their bills in one or two weeks,” Longbella said. “A lot of companies will have gone out of business, unfortunately, because a lot of trucking companies are hand-to-mouth.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5876-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

We are heartened by the can-do spirit seen in the response to these cuts. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Wendy Nunez and John Kingston: Despite Americorps cuts, service is alive and well in Vermont.","This commentary is by Wendy Nunez and John Kingston, chair and co-chair of the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps board of directors.As many of you know, on April 25, AmeriCorps programs across the country were informed that over 1,000 grants — totaling $400 million — had been terminated. This news hits home for many Vermonters.For those unfamiliar with this program, it’s helpful to think of AmeriCorps as a domestic Peace Corps, where volunteers commit to service terms that range from a couple of months to a full year. AmeriCorps provides federal funding to local nonprofits, which, in turn, provide members with a “living allowance.” At the end of one’s service term, members also receive a Segal Education Award which can be used for tuition and paying off school debt.AmeriCorps not only empowers people wanting to serve, but also offers us a model that combines service, workforce development and project accomplishment. AmeriCorps is a win-win-win.Nationally, more than 200,000 people serve through AmeriCorps positions. Here in Vermont, SerVermont is our state service commission and helps oversee grants that support approximately 2,500 service members. Participants focus on pressing issues that range from conservation work, to food security, to flood relief, to work in local schools.For young professionals, their service is a chance to make a lasting difference just as it is a powerful learning and professional development opportunity. In fact, Jobs for the Future recently reported that 92% of AmeriCorps programs had strong career and workforce development training embedded in their curriculum.Imagine being a young person fresh out of high school with an array of opportunities ahead of you. As you look at the world, you’re determined to roll up your sleeves and contribute. Your commitment to making the world a better place is the spirit that is at the center of service. This brings us to the painful decision to cut funding.READ MORE
More than $2.3 million dollars of grants allocated to programs here in Vermont were terminated suddenly in April. We have to move forward with the expectation that these funds will not return in future years.As readers saw in a recent Seven Days article, these funds impact the programs of essential Vermont nonprofits and state government, including ReSOURCE, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, Vermont State University, and the organization whose board we chair, the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps.All is not lost however. We are heartened by the can-do spirit seen in the response to these cuts. Vermont Youth Conservation Corps is finding ways to continue to offer service experiences to every incoming participant. They won’t be AmeriCorps members, but they will still have a position at Vermont Youth Conservation Corps and an opportunity to serve their community. We also see other organizations being nimble in their response. History is instructive. People are probably aware of the Civilian Conservation Corps, launched during the Great Depression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which enrolled 3 million men in public service. Different versions of federal service programs existed until the early ‘80s. President Ronald Reagan then eliminated these programs during an era of limited federal government.In response, many states then created city-based, state and regional corps. Today, more than 150 corps exist in America. We likely find ourselves in a similar moment of reinvention and revitalization. Service is alive and well in Vermont — and across the country. The elimination of AmeriCorps funding should be a call to action for us all. Now is the time to invest in young people, and increasing the value and accessibility to service experiences can be a strategy that makes Vermont stronger.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Wendy Nunez and John Kingston: Despite Americorps cuts, service is alive and well in Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Trump administration is recommending Congress cut hundreds of millions out of the government’s budget that helps fund the Central Utah Project, a massive system of water infrastructure and habitat restoration projects. 
It’s just one line item in the administration’s 46-page discretionary budget request, which slashes funding for a number of programs and agencies while boosting federal dollars for defense and border security.  
According to the White House, the Department of the Interior’s budget provides about $1.2 billion to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project. Of that, the White House is proposing a $609 million cut. 
Described as the “most comprehensive federal water resource development project” in the state, the Central Utah Project is a web of reservoirs, pipelines and river systems that transports Colorado River water from eastern Utah to the Wasatch Front, where it’s tasked for municipal and industrial use, irrigation, hydroelectric power, fish and wildlife, conservation and recreation. 
But reservoirs and pipelines disrupt wildlife and vegetation, and sometimes come at the expense of hunting, fishing and other types of recreation — so a portion of the funding for the project has been used to offset those impacts. Now, the Trump administration wants the project to solely focus on water infrastructure.

According to the budget proposal, the money allocated to the project funds programs that “have nothing to do with building and maintaining water infrastructure, such as habitat restoration.” 
“Instead, the Budget focuses Reclamation and the Central Utah Project on their core missions of maintaining assets that provide safe, reliable, and efficient management of water resources throughout the western United States,” the proposal reads. 
The request doesn’t specify any habitat restoration project in particular, and it’s likely the request would also impact other bureau projects in the West. 
In Utah, that funding helped restore wetlands and riparian areas along the Provo and Duchesne rivers, improve recreation access for hunters, anglers and boaters, and have contributed to the resurgence of the June Sucker, a fish native to Utah Lake that was once near extinction. 
“It’s tough to say at this point how that all trickles down to Utah and to our project, but we’re making plans and adjustments,” said Michael Mills, executive director of the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission. “It’s a difficult spot we’re in, we don’t really have any more details than what is included in that budget proposal.”
Mills’ commission was formed in the 1990s after Congress passed the Central Utah Project Completion Act. The commission works to offset the environmental impact of large water infrastructure projects — for instance, when the Jordanelle Reservoir was created in 1993, the commission worked to restore a lower section of the Provo River to make up for the section that was flooded, and conserved land in Wasatch County for elk herds that were displaced. 
Since its inception, the commission has worked with federal, state and local governments, universities, nonprofits and the Ute tribe on a number of ecosystem and wildlife conservation projects. 
One of the most recent is the Provo River Delta Restoration and the June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program on Utah Lake.

The June Sucker was nearly extinct in the 1980s — if it didn’t have a lifespan of nearly 40 years, some ecologists say the species would have disappeared. But a few hundred held on, and as the species was listed as endangered, the June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program took shape. 
Farmers and water users in the basin worked to conserve water to increase Provo River flows, and a collaborative effort to restore the river’s delta in Provo began. The delta has undergone a complete transformation — now there’s a boat ramp, hiking trails and a thriving ecosystem. On any given day, you can find scores of birds, fish and other wildlife at the delta, including the June Sucker. This year, scientists estimated the fish’s population to be 80,000. 
All of that was made possible by the federal revenue stream now on the chopping block.

“A lot of people think the federal government is all about overreach and regulation. But what we see with the June Sucker program is that federal coordination brought resources, it brought a lot of funding, and it gave a mechanism for different stakeholders to be heard,” said Ben Abbott, associate professor of environmental science and sustainability at Brigham Young University. 
“Yes, it was about this endemic fish that only lives on Utah Lake, but it ended up improving water quality and creating better public access and having a lot of unexpected benefits,” he said. 
The proposed budget cut makes Abbot and others nervous that projects like the June Sucker restoration won’t be possible in the future. The Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission is currently working on a restoration project on the Duchesne River in eastern Utah that, if federal funding is pulled, could be impacted. 
Plus, operation and maintenance for completed projects could suffer. Federal funding pays for snow and garbage removal, bathroom maintenance, fencing, general upkeep and ongoing conservation. 
“Obviously, I think the work we do is very important, and I enjoy doing it. But if our elected officials are saying there’s other priorities out there, we pivot to try to accommodate those priorities,” Mills said.

The president’s budget recommendations are just that — recommendations. Congress has the final say when it comes to federal spending, and experts say that many of Trump’s proposed cuts won’t get a green light. 
But it provides insight into the Trump administration’s priorities. Since taking office, the administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has cut budgets for federal agencies and laid off federal workers in an attempt to streamline the government and cut waste. 
The budget proposal reflects that same sentiment, with a proposed $163 billion in cuts to non-defense discretionary spending. That includes more than $15 billion in funds allocated under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; $1.3 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to study climate change; nearly $1 billion for the National Park Service to operate the park system, build new infrastructure, preserve historic sites, and offer preservation and recreation grants; and $721 million slated for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development Program.

(Capital-Star photo by John Cole)Sen. Dave McCormick said he’s introduced a second bill aimed at addressing the cost of housing with Arizona Democrat Ruben Gallego.
In a press release, the swing state senators said the bill is meant to increase cooperation across U.S. government agencies with programs and research on affordable housing. It directs the Departments of Agriculture, Urban Development and Veterans Assistance to create a data-sharing agreement for housing-related research and information, and to report to Congress on how they can increase collaboration on housing programs.
“Homeownership is out of reach for far too many families in Pennsylvania, including our nation’s veterans,” McCormick said in a press release. “We need federal agencies to work together more effectively to increase the limited supply of housing and reduce housing costs.”
This follows another bill aimed at boosting the development of multifamily homes, which Gallego introduced and McCormick co-sponsored in late April. That bill would increase the limit on loans from the Federal Housing Administration for developers of multifamily homes with up to four units.
The loan limits, which Gallego said in a press release had not been raised since 2003, were put in place to prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development from subsidizing luxury projects.
McCormick and Gallego were also co-sponsors of a bill introduced by Alex Padilla (D-Ca.) that is intended to help homeless veterans by excluding veterans’ disability payments from counting towards annual income qualifications for a joint HUD and VA housing program.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mccormick1-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector) The Alabama Public Library Service board Thursday adopted a definition of  the term “sexually explicit” after advocates and local library officials throughout the state said that the term — the center of controversies over book content around the state — was vague and hard to comply with.
The new definition is taken from the state’s criminal code defining adult bookstores and adult movie houses. It includes material containing sexual intercourse between people of the same gender or opposite gender, sexual excitement and nudity.
“I think that is an easy thing for us to figure out,” said APLS Chair John Wahl, who introduced the motion on Thursday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The move follows the board’s move in May of last year requiring libraries to restrict library materials from the minors or risk forfeiting state funding.
To qualify for state aid, libraries must adopt policies for selecting library materials that prohibit minors from having materials that are sexually explicit or inappropriate for children, specify the physical location of books and materials deemed sexually explicit or inappropriate materials for children, and obtain advance approval for materials that are marketed or promoted to children.
Libraries must also establish policies that “approve written guidelines that ensure library sections designated for minors under the age of 18 remain free of material containing obscenity, sexually explicit, or other material deemed inappropriate for children or youth,”
Wahls’ motion comes amid continued unrest at the state board that oversees local library funding. In March, members of the APLS voted to suspend funding to the Fairhope Public Library after several patrons complained  that books that allegedly violated the APLS administrative code have yet to be moved to the adult section.
In that same meeting, because of another motion from Minton, APLS terminated Nancy Pack, the former director who led the agency since 2012.
The Fairhope Library has yet to have its funding restored. Supporters have started a fundraiser to help offset some of the funding that could be lost by the library.
Wahl said he had “cordial communication” with Fairhope Public Library Director Robert Gourlay and chair of the Fairhope Public Library, Randal Wright.
“They are still in their review process,” he said. “The APLS board is waiting until they finish their review process.”
Both Gourlay and Wright attended the meeting to address the APLS board during the public comment period.
“We have gotten a lot of reconsideration forms submitted since the beginning of 2023, and we have about 20,000 plus cardholders in Fairhope. Six or seven individuals are responsible for those requests for reconsideration,” Gourlay said.
He said staff have taken the requests seriously and have moved six books from the juvenile and teen section to the adult section.
Wright said that the Fairhope Public Library is not attempting to defy the updated APLS administrative code and recommended that the state agency establish a procedure for libraries to follow who may not be complying and give libraries an opportunity to respond before threatening funding.
“I have witnessed the standards of the majority of the citizens of Fairhope who have spoken out in support of our library,” Wright said. “And I believe we are adhering to the APLS guidelines while also listening to the community standards of Fairhope.”
Fights over book content began erupting in 2023 when a parent complained that the Autauga-Prattville Public Library had a book with inclusive pronouns.
The issue went all the way up to Gov. Kay Ivey, who pushed the board to adopt administrative code changes. Critics said the campaign was about removing books with LGBTQ characters.
The fight continued at Thursday’s meeting.
“Let me be blunt,” said Craig Scott, director of the Gadsden Public Library. “Libraries are not political playgrounds. They are not here to serve an agenda. They are here to serve people, all people. And yes, sometimes providing materials that have been challenged, discomfort, or even provoke thought.”
Wahl said he found Scott’s comments offensive.
“I personally, went to the state Legislature, and found guaranteed funding, so that local libraries would not have to risk losing federal grants,” Wahl said. “There was not a single thank you there. To say that this board does not stand up for local libraries, and does not fight for them, is offensive.”
Board member Amy Minton, who moved to revoke Fairhope’s funding last month, put forward a draft of a motion for the APLS Board to consider at the next meeting that invoked Alabama’s “What is a Woman Act” and the executive order from President Donald Trump that affirmed only two genders.
“In alignment with these clear positions of both state and federal government, it is the opinion of the APLS Board that any library material that encourages, promotes or contains positive portrayals of transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two genders shall be deemed inappropriate for children and youth under APLS Code,” Minton’s proposed motion states.

Burl Toler was born in Memphis. The first Black official in any major sport in the U.S., he defeated prejudice at each turn. 
In 1951, Toler starred for the legendary undefeated University of San Francisco Dons. Prejudice kept the integrated team from playing in the Gator Bowl, but the team found success anyway. Nine players went to the NFL, three of them later inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame. Their best player may have been Toler, who was drafted by Cleveland but suffered a severe knee injury in a college all-star game that ended his playing days. 
Toler decided to make his way into professional football through officiating. The NFL hired him in 1965 — a year before Emmett Ashford became the first Black umpire in Major League Baseball and three years before Jackie White broke the color barrier in the NBA. 
He rose above the racism he encountered, working as a head linesman and field judge for a quarter-century. He officiated Super Bowl XIV, where the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Los Angeles Rams in 1980. Two years later, he officiated the “Freezer Bowl,” where the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the San Diego Chargers in the AFC Championship Game. The game marked the coldest temperatures of any game in NFL history — minus 59 degrees wind chill — and Toler suffered frostbite. 
In addition to his NFL work, he worked as an educator, becoming the first Black secondary school principal in the San Francisco district. He died in 2009. Two area schools and a hall on the University of San Francisco campus have been renamed in his honor. On Nov. 23, 2020, Toler was remembered again when the NFL had its first all-Black officiating crew.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120242/May9-ALL-BLACK-OFFICIATING-CREW.jpg,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

This is CalMatters’ third year in a row of Emmy nominations, with two award wins.


CalMatters’ collaborations with CBS-TV are again nominated for Emmy awards, following two previous Emmy wins, and bringing nominations three years in a row.
Both awards, given by the Northern California chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, are for work produced in partnership with CBS News and using deep reporting from CalMatters’ Digital Democracy, a tool that uses data and artificial intelligence to examine state government. This comes just a week after Digital Democracy was awarded the Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation in the national Poynter Journalism Prizes.
“Using new AI, grieving moms discover California lawmakers killed popular fentanyl bill by *not* ​voting” pairs CalMatters’ state government analysis with video reporting by Julie Watts of CBS News. The entry is nominated for politics and government news coverage and recognizes Watts and producer Dennis Lopez along with CalMatters’ reporters Sameea Kamal and Ryan Sabalow. Foaad Khosmood, a computer science professor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and an architect of Digital Democracy, was also recognized.
The video tells the story of how advocates for fentanyl legislation were upset to learn through Digital Democracy that their bills died when legislators declined to vote. The broadcast followed a CalMatters’ story, “Power is never having to say ‘no.’ How California Democrats kill bills without voting against them” co-authored by Watts and CalMatters reporter Ryan Sabalow. The story used data from Digital Democracy to show that instead of directly voting against a bill, Democrats often killed bills by declining to vote.
And “Why some California Democrats take Big Oil money and vote against environmental laws” pairs CBS’ news analysis, powered by Digital Democracy, this time for a nomination for politics and government short-form content. The segment reveals “that California Republicans in Congress voted against most (92%) environmental bills in the last session, even though surveys show that most of the people they represent think lawmakers should do more to prevent climate change.”
The nomination recognizes CBS’ Watts along with Grace Manthey, Kurtis Ming, Jui Sarwate and Dennis Lopez – again with Khosmood.
Emmy winners will be announced June 14 in Sacramento.
CalMatters’ first Emmy win two years ago was for Watts featuring CalMatters reporter Julie Cart’s coverage of the devastating effects of endless wildfires on the mental health of California’s firefighters. And the second Emmy award last year was for CalMatters criminal justice reporter Nigel Duara and Julie Watts for their segment on how California investigates shootings by law enforcement officers of unarmed civilians.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/040324-DD-Dave-Lesher-FG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-09 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT agency aims to build housing in downtowns, near public transit",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/09/ct-municipal-development-authority/,"The Municipal Development Authority, which started work last year, helps towns build up their downtowns and areas near public transit.","The Naugatuck train station is a small plexiglass box with a single bench, a lone dot in the expanse of the concrete parking lot, just across from the loading dock of a post office.
It’s exactly the type of car-centric development that David Kooris, executive director of the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority, wants to avoid. A construction site just south of the station will soon be the home of a larger train station and a mixed-use apartment complex with homes on top and businesses on the bottom floor.
“We want vibrancy,” said Mayor Pete Hess, on a recent walking tour of the site. “We want people walking, eating, drinking, shopping using the train.”
It’s paired with a project to improve walkability in the nearby downtown, where workers were putting in new brick sidewalks late last month. It’s an expensive project, and the town will need improved infrastructure, Hess said. Just when he was worrying over the small town being unable to afford the cost, “out of nowhere, an angel came from above, and it was CMDA.”
The Connecticut Municipal Development Authority, formerly called the Municipal Redevelopment Authority, was established in 2019 as an unfunded entity and officially got money and started work last year. Since then, at least 11 cities have passed ordinances agreeing to work with the quasi-public agency. Another 10 are in the process, Kooris said.
[RELATED: CT agency aimed at increasing housing convenes, picks director]
He’s hoping more towns along Metro-North will join in the coming months, and for those that have started, he’s aiming to have projects in the works later this year, he said.
The authority is statutorily charged with helping municipalities build up their downtowns and districts near public transportation. In addition to helping with the planning process, the agency has $60 million in bonding that towns can apply for to help spur development.
​​”The way that I describe it is: we’re trying to help give communities the tools they need to be the next best version of themselves,” Kooris said. “That means taking what’s there and tweaking it to provide more housing, more support for local businesses, more riders for transit.”
CMDA is governed by a board of directors, and chair Felix Reyes said they’re focused on supporting Kooris. Reyes, the director of economic development and planning in New London, said he’s encouraged his city to work with CMDA.
“We see New London’s downtown is changing fundamentally, because now it’s becoming not just a center of commerce or a center of business, but it’s also becoming a neighborhood, because a lot of our historic buildings are being revitalized to include housing on the second floors and above,” Reyes said.
To work with the agency, town councils need to adopt a resolution to enter a partnership with CMDA. They then decide what area of town they want to work in, whether that be downtown or a public transit station.
CMDA works with contractors to help evaluate the town’s zoning and where they can “substantially increase” housing supply, Kooris said. The town also then becomes eligible to apply for CMDA funding.
Kooris is waiting for the next biennial budget to pass to determine the details of his next steps. Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposed budget included $1.2 million for the authority, while the legislature’s proposal included $700,000. How much money he gets will determine how many staffers he can hire for the agency, Kooris said.
As CMDA grows, Kooris hopes to find ways to connect towns to more state funding and, eventually, cut through red tape around development projects. He hopes that towns that participate can work their way through environmental approvals and other state permitting more quickly, he said.
The CMDA has been a priority for Lamont, who touted his support during the past couple of legislative sessions. He’s proposed it as a way to increase the state’s housing supply and boost the economy.
Connecticut lacks tens of thousands of units of housing that are affordable and available to its lowest income residents, and people across economic classes are struggling to pay housing costs. This has posed difficulties for employers, who need places for workers to live.
Lamont has spoken often about the need for more housing for the workforce and painted CMDA as the agency to resolve the issue without statewide control of zoning. He’s supported local control of zoning issues.
The agency is centered around a land use concept known as transit-oriented development, which encourages walkable neighborhoods with easy access to public transportation. It’s a growing movement across the United States and has been particularly popular among land use and urban design advocates.
The idea has been controversial in the Connecticut legislature. For the past few legislative sessions, lawmakers have considered another proposal to encourage more transit-oriented development known as Work, Live, Ride. This year’s version of the bill would prioritize certain infrastructure funding for towns that opt to establish denser districts near train and bus stations.
Opponents have said that it would usurp local control and mean that those towns that don’t opt in may struggle to get funding that they need for bridges and roads. 
In 2023, opponents submitted testimony on the bill to provide funding to the CMDA expressing fear that the authority would require too much density and require substantial changes to towns.
But Kooris sees CMDA as a way for towns to get creative.
“We would help kind of focus everyone in on this limited geography and say, ‘OK, what are we all trying to get out of this development? What do we all think is needed to unlock the potential of this place?,’” Kooris said.
That can mean allowing for more infill development of three- and four-family units, more accessory dwelling units or mixed-use development like what’s underway in Naugatuck. Often, Kooris is focused on what may seem to be smaller details such as how many drive-throughs are allowed in the area, the amount of parking or making sure the town has pedestrian-friendly infrastructure such as raised crosswalks.
Michelle McCabe, executive director of Connecticut Main Street Center, said the creation of CMDA is a good sign for Connecticut downtowns. 
“Village centers are complex ecosystems that have a lot of different stakeholders trying to succeed in them, whether it’s your small businesses, your arts and culture, the residents who live there, the way that the streets are designed for mobility, for traffic, it all comes together,” McCabe said.
Kevin Brown, executive director of the Norwich Community Development Corporation, said the work with CMDA will help the economy in his town. It has several blighted buildings and former mills, and he wants to see those revitalized, particularly downtown and along the water.
“When you talk about sort of the anchor point for this and transit-oriented development, we are already upping the ante on our economic development and our residential downtown living near our intermodal transportation center,” Brown said, of the transportation hub at the mouth of the Yantic River. “And so this just really is, you know, to use an analogy, throwing gas on the fire for the forward momentum of the city of Norwich.”
Much of Kooris’ inspiration comes from historical Connecticut, he said, when towns had thriving main streets and a variety of businesses within walking distance. Often, he thinks about historical images and maps of towns from the 1920s, 30s and 40s.
“We were introducing the car, but we weren’t yet governed by it,”  he said. “So you accommodated the car, and you started to have parkways and stuff like that, but they were used to connect these walkable, transit-oriented communities to one another.”
He believes in the concept of “environmental determinism,” which means that the way people behave is largely determined by their environment. So, there are ways to encourage people to drive less and interact with their neighbors more, just through urban design, he said.
“We create the context within which we can then perform,” he said. “If you build all your community around wide roads and car dependency, then you’re going to drive everywhere. If you build your community to be walkable and mixed use, then you might walk a good chunk of the time.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0423_SR_DavidKooris_021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Getty Images)A group of LGBTQ+ baristas is working to unionize a Starbucks in Huntsville for what they hope will help create a more fair and equitable workplace for everyone.
If successful, the store on Memorial Parkway would be the third organized Starbucks outlet in Alabama, after stores in Scottsboro and Birmingham. The organizing team wants to join Starbucks Workers United (SBWU), the union that represents over 570 union Starbucks stores, out of about 15,000 outlets in total.
Questions at the Huntsville Starbucks were directed to a corporate media line. Messages sent by phone and email seeking comment were left with Starbucks.
Huntsville union organizing team members Briar Wolf and Nox Ashes were initially drawn to Starbucks because of its long-standing reputation as an inclusive and supportive workplace, especially for LGBTQ+ employees.
“Starbucks is the place where queer people land and where trans people land because they’ve had a reputation for a long time as being a friendly place to work,” she said. “You know, there’s the joke about the whole blue hair, they/them baristas making the best coffee and all that. Starbucks had presented themselves as this, this paragon of acceptance for queer and trans people to be able to work there.”
Wolf was also attracted by the company’s benefits, including tuition reimbursement for a first-time bachelor’s degree through Arizona State University and the company’s health insurance plan. In 2018, Starbucks introduced a supplemental insurance plan that covered gender-affirming procedures like electrolysis, facial feminization, and other related health care, many with no co-pays or deductibles. The company provides travel reimbursements for gender-affirming care.
But now, she said, that support has been slowly eroded. Fast Company reported in 2022 that many of the procedures covered by the supplemental plan were moved to a primary plan, which can include co-pays and in-network and out-of-network doctors.
“For one of the surgeries that I plan to have, to get a doctor that is even on WPATH’s (World Professional Association for Transgender Health) recommended list, I’m going to have to go to San Francisco,” she said. “They used to pay for travel, but now they only pay for a certain amount of travel, and only if it’s approved, and only if there’s not an in-network doctor within driving range. They’ve chipped away at little bits and pieces of it.”
Starbucks said its benefits package has not changed. In a letter to the union sent in 2023, May Jensen, a Starbucks vice president, wrote that individual state policies led to shifts in coverage.
“Whether specific same-sex and gender affirming care, services, and procedures are covered as part of the Company’s core health insurance plan or its additional wrap plan depends upon the state law applicable to the Company’s plans and, more specifically, whether the care, services, and procedures are required to be part of Starbucks core health insurance plan offerings,” the letter said.
SBWU bargaining delegate and Birmingham barista Naomi Wilson, whose Starbucks store is unionized, is part of the team drafting and negotiating SBWU’s first collective bargaining agreement with Starbucks, as well as an active member of the union’s Trans Rights Action Committee (TRAC).
“One of the biggest things that we want is the reinstatement of the trans health care supplemental plan that they took away in 2023,” Wilson said. “Everybody is like, yeah, we’re getting that. I haven’t seen anybody say that, ‘no, that’s too much.’ Everyone in our union says we are going to get that.”
Another key issue driving Huntsville’s union effort are allegations from Wolf and Ashes of  workplace discrimination against transgender workers. They say coworkers are misgendered by management, and despite multiple corrections every day, it continues without response. Starbucks refers to employees as “partners.”
“At some point, it really does become malicious, and partners who were more outspoken about the way things were being run were being misgendered very frequently and sort of pointedly,” Ashes said.
The baristas say that logistical issues also plague this location. On Starbucks’ website, the Memorial Parkway location is supposed to close at 6 p.m., but the baristas say it regularly closes at 2 p.m. because of staffing issues. Wolf said workers who are scheduled for those shifts have to use PTO to make up the hours.
Ashes said turnover in the store, which left everyone “fed up,” also contributed to the union push.
“I just didn’t feel safe anymore,” she said. “Suddenly my job security did not exist.”
Despite concerns about risking her job, benefits and education, Wolf began organizing just three weeks into the role.
“I decided to go ahead with it, because it’s just the right thing to do,” she said. “Showing people that folks look down on and consider unskilled labor, whatever that is, because all the labor is skilled labor, that they do have power and that they can organize. (…) My life’s mission is to organize and empower marginalized people and people who work at Starbucks, people who work at whatever fast food places, they’re marginalized people. People look down on them.”
The organizing team recently filed for a union vote, which grants them legal protections against retaliatory firings. If they are fired during this period, they can file charges with the National Labor Relations Board.
Ashes said she hopes a union will give them guaranteed hours, proper staffing and power for workers.
“We’re having p.m. workers who have been working p.m. for a year plus, sometimes several years are now being forced to work a.m. because they’re being told that their hours don’t exist anymore,” Ashes said. “The power to take all of those issues and say, this needs to be fixed, and if you don’t fix it, your store is not going to run. We need to be respected. We were hired to work this. We can work this. We desire to work, but you need to let us and support us”
Wilson has worked at the unionized Birmingham Starbucks location for a year and a half. She said she has greater job security but that the union has led to greater scrutiny from the company.
“People are scared to say the word ‘union,’” Wilson said. “It was dark. It was like saying the word ‘union’ was like a bad word in our store.”
But Wilson said the union gave her  a heightened sense of responsibility in her workplace and a stronger community.
“By participating, you actually give people a fighting chance to have a good workplace, a stable workplace,” she said. “And by burying your hand in the sand, you’re leaving everyone vulnerable to like, harassment, firings.”
In a report released in January, the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, cited Starbucks as engaging in union busting, citing 771 open or settled unfair labor practice tactics before regional offices of the federal National Labor Relations Board through February 2024.
Workers at the Huntsville location are starting to report documents on unions are being hung up around the store. They report that two documents were hung up in their store recently, including one listing ten negative things about joining a union.
Local labor organizations have expressed support for the Huntsville Starbucks, including the North Alabama Democratic Socialists of America, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and The North Alabama Area Labor Council.
“Starbucks workers in Huntsville have realized what more than 10,000 Starbucks workers across the country have realized — that a voice on the job is important, and that they do deserve it,” said Jacob Morrison, president of the North Alabama Area Labor Council.
The union election is scheduled for May 12.

Mackey and the board discussed rules for a paid parental leave policy, which passed the Alabama Legislature in April.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education will adopt temporary rules for paid parental leave for public education employees at its June meeting, State Superintendent Eric Mackey said Thursday.
The move comes a few weeks after Gov. Kay Ivey signed a law extending the benefit to the workers. SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, goes into effect on July 1. 
Mackey said the board will have to adopt an emergency rule in order to approve temporary rules on the paid leave because of the turnaround for the effective date of the benefit. Once the board adopts temporary rules, there will be a 35-day public comment period before the permanent rules are adopted in July.

“All that’s to say there could be changes between the two, so during the public comment period, obviously,” Mackey said Thursday during the board’s work session.
The law allows women who give birth; have a stillbirth or experience a miscarriage after 12 weeks to receive eight weeks of paid leave. It also allows the father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under three years old, either parent may have eight weeks of leave if they are both eligible employees.
The benefit can be taken within a year of the event. Mackey said, though, that a parent that gives birth or any other related event on June 30 will not be eligible for the benefit. Also, employees must be employed for one year before they are eligible for paid leave.
“Let’s say somebody has a baby July 1 this year. They qualify if they have been employed the last year,” he said.
Mackey also said that the benefit can only apply once every 12 months. However, the benefit can be taken at any time within those 12 months after the event. A teacher who gives birth during the summer while she is not working can take eight weeks off when school starts in August, Mackey said.
“They could say, start their leave (when) their first day back to school is August 8. They can wait and start their leave on August 8 and then take their leave, you know, for eight weeks,” he said.
The program did not receive supplemental funding for fiscal year 2025, so Mackey said the individual school districts would have to pay employees that take the leave between July 1 and Sept. 30. Once the FY 2026 Education Trust Fund budget takes effect on Oct. 1, the state will reimburse the districts at $120 per day.
He said the Legislature likely underestimated the number of related events that happen in a year. The line item for the benefit received $9.6 million, but Mackey said it is likely closer to a $12 million expense.
“So $9.6 (million) covered what was originally written, but it got changed, when they put in the father’s leave for fathers’ two weeks, which was not in the calculation,” Mackey said..

(Nevada Immigration Coalition video screengrab)A heightened federal immigration enforcement presence in Nevada is a tactic to create fear, and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo should be assuring Nevadans their rights will be protected, the Nevada Immigration Coalition said Thursday. 
The press conference comes after an estimated 30 people were arrested this week by federal agents in Northern Nevada, including in Reno and Carson City.
Noé Orosco, the Government Affairs Manager with Make the Road Nevada, warned that having immigration enforcement in Carson City where “laws of our state are being made” shouldn’t be seen as a coincidence. 
“That is intimidation, plain and simple,” he said. 
The coalition earlier announced it had canceled its immigrant lobbying day scheduled for next week out of fears of prolonged presence of federal immigration officials. 
Organizers have previously warned of increased immigration enforcement in the state over the last few weeks, but have struggled to verify how many people have been detained by immigration officials in Southern Nevada.
Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, said immigration actions taken by President Donald Trump and his administration have been “devoid of due process” as federal officers have targeted undocumented immigrants, Green Card holders and “even U.S. citizens in some instances.”
“Realistically, there needs to be a press conference next door because the governor has been silent,” Haseebullah said. “We need the governor to stop being silent.” 
Nevada Current asked Lombardo’s office to comment on reports of an escalated presence of federal enforcement officers in the state, what communication the governor’s office had with them, and how he plans to ensure people receive due process if they are detained.  
Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for the governor’s office, referred all questions to immigration enforcement officials. 
“Nevada is not a sanctuary state or jurisdiction, and Nevada will continue to follow federal law under Governor Lombardo’s leadership,” Ray said in an email. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t respond to questions. 
Having repeatedly promised “mass deportation” on the campaign trail, since his inauguration Trump has rescinded a 2011 policy prohibiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive” places such as schools, churches, and hospitals, targeted green card holders, and flaunted court  orders finding the administration’s immigration policies have failed to provide people with due process under the law.
Haseebullah said many of these actions are done in cooperation with state and local agencies.
“For any government institution in Nevada that decides it’s going to cooperate with ICE in these investigations in violation of the law, expect to hear from us,” he said. “If you are hiding records, which many government entities are … we will find them, we will bring legal action against you and you will be held accountable for that.”
The coalition cautioned that even the threat of enforcement could disrupt and harm people, especially families. They also said increased U.S. Immigration, Customs and Enforcement activity would damage the state’s fragile economy since it depends heavily on its immigrant workforce.  
“We are day laborers, bakers, food service workers, parents and neighbors,” Orosco said, adding that the state’s immigrant community “contributes over $20 billion annually to the economy.”
Several state Democratic lawmakers also joined the coalition during the press conference as they work to pass several bills that seek to provide a measure of reassurance to anxious families. 
Assembly Bill 217 would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school, or provide student records, including information on a student’s family, without a warrant. Assembly Bill 460 seeks a streamlined process for selecting a temporary guardian for minors prior to any immigration action.
“Every Nevadan, regardless of their immigration status, deserves due process, dignity and protection under the law,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, who is sponsoring both bills. “Immigrants are not a threat to Nevada, they are essentially.”

I have Type 1 diabetes. I’m raising a toddler. And I am so tired.
Every day is a balancing act between staying alive and staying afloat. I’m constantly monitoring my blood sugar, taking insulin, scheduling appointments, and praying I don’t hit a snag, because any delay or disruption in my care could land me in the ER or worse. And even when I do everything right, I’m drowning.
Insulin isn’t some luxury item. Neither are the supplies that keep me stable. But the price tags make it feel like I’m being punished for needing them. I shell out hundreds of dollars a month just to keep my body functioning—and there’s zero margin for error. No extra wiggle room. No safety net. Just the relentless pressure to survive another day.
That level of constant stress—that’s my baseline now. And it’s catching up with me.
It’s a pretty simple story. Insulin prices have gone up in my lifetime. That burden has dictated the course of my entire adult life. It’s stopped me from switching jobs, going back to school, or building financial stability. 
Every other developed country on Earth offers insulin at little to no cost. And yet, people die in this country every year from rationing insulin. That’s not just a tragedy—it’s a human rights violation. Keeping life-saving medicine behind a paywall while it’s free everywhere else is indefensible.
The Biden Administration capped insulin prices for seniors on Medicare through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. While this is still in place, the insulin cap does not cover millions of individuals. This action demonstrates that it is possible to put people above profits. With the current Trump Administration and a Republican controlled House and Senate, it is not clear if the insulin cap in the Inflation Reduction Act will remain. It is incumbent upon states to address this issue so residents are not forced to ration medication or simply go without this life-saving drug.
Here in Nevada, something good is happening—finally.
Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager introduced a bill in the Legislature to cap insulin prices for individuals on private insurance at the state level. And that gives me hope again. It tells me that someone is listening and understands that this isn’t about handouts—it’s about survival. About moms like me getting a chance to live long enough to raise our kids.
I don’t want Hudson to grow up without his mom because insulin became too expensive. I don’t want to become another headline about a woman who died young because the system made her choose between her health and her bills.
We need insulin caps. We need full coverage for diabetes care—supplies, appointments, everything. We need a healthcare system that doesn’t crush people who are doing everything right but still can’t afford to survive.
I’m not asking for luxury. I’m asking to stay alive.
Yeager’s bill gives me hope that Nevada might lead the way where the federal government has failed. That maybe, just maybe, moms like me won’t have to carry this weight alone anymore.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/insulin-1024x732.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

Divided views on flooding, housing, crime and poverty have shaped two local council races.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Next week, Barre voters have a choice of City Council candidates with different approaches to its biggest issues.","City Hall in Barre on Sept. 19, 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIf there’s anything Barre City’s Ward 3 City Council candidates can agree on, it’s that Barre is struggling. “Barre has a really high poverty rate, and with the floods, that’s only gone up,” incumbent Samn Stockwell said. “I do believe that Ward 3 has been kind of forgotten,” her challenger, Don Routhier, told the podcast 802 Scoop last month. But on a variety of issues, the two candidates — who will face each other in elections on Tuesday — are at odds: from flood mitigation, to homelessness and crime, to the tenor of their candidacy and the way that the City Council should view Barre’s future. Routhier, owner of a local used car dealership, has framed his campaign around the concept of “Bring Barre Back” — back to the days of his family’s roots as business owners in the North End. The issue in Barre, as he described it on the podcast is “we have a lot of ideologies who have a dream, this rainbow coalition of everything’s going to happen, but it’s not.”“We need doers. We don’t need teachers,” Routhier went on, “we need doers” taking action to address issues like crime and road repairs. Stockwell, a poet and social services coordinator for the Family Center of Washington County, has put more emphasis on the need for affordable housing and ways to support residents on the path toward homeownership. A similar battle of viewpoints has played out in Ward 1, where current Councilor Emel Cambel is stepping down. Former school board member Eddie Rousse said in an interview that supporting the police department and limiting loitering should be key priorities for the City Council. His competitor Beth Hilgartner, a retired minister and author, emphasized consensus building over jumping to specific solutions. In Ward 2, current Councilor Jeff Bergeron is running for another term unopposed. The election, scheduled to take place on May 13, will also have a budget vote, a vote on a street and sidewalk improvement fund and a vote on whether the city clerk should be appointed by the City Council rather than an elected position. ‘Good Old Boys’?Routhier declined to speak with VTDigger, saying that it was too close to the election for him to do an interview. As of Thursday, his sole media appearance has been on 802 Scoop, a local podcast, on April 16. In that appearance, Routhier held up an old photo of his parent’s former business, the Heiress Motel, now known as the Budget Inn. Although Routhier left Barre to go to college, he eventually returned and opened a used car sales business, Routhier Auto Center. On the 802 Scoop podcast, Rothier was asked if that made him one of the “good old boys,” an oft-used term in Barre to refer to an in-group of political figures. He replied that he finds the term “slanderous,” he said on the podcast, but indicated his support for current mayor Thom Lauzon, who came back into power in 2024 after a six-year hiatus. “Thank God that, you know, we have a new mayor, and I think with a little bit of help, we can turn the city around again,” he said. His vision for turning the city around includes more support for the police department and more cleaning up, beautifying and adding amenities in Ward 3, which includes the North End, one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods in the 2023 floods. Stockwell also believes that new flood-safe development should be a priority in the North End. As a City Council member, she’s been working on flood mitigation through creating new floodplains, removing bridges that contribute to flooding and seeking federal funds for flood-safe housing development and home elevation. But at the same time, she said, Barre should be looking for more opportunities to build dense housing downtown.“The North End would remain a rehabilitated and restored neighborhood without a ton of apartment buildings,” she said. “I think downtown is a place to develop ‘up.’” She also said Barre should look at programs to help residents become homeowners. The two candidates are directly at odds on whether the city should consider dredging the Stevens Branch of the Winooski River, which state officials have warned municipalities to approach with caution, since it can worsen flooding in some situations. Routhier told 802 Scoop he would dredge the river and recommended it be “cleaned out.” Stockwell said there were “real reasons” that dredging can be destructive and hasn’t been the most effective method for Barre. Not ‘that easy a divide’Like Routhier, Rousse, in Ward 1, said he’d like to talk to Barre Police Chief Braedon Vail about ways to reduce crime. He’s specifically interested in cracking down on loitering, particularly among drug users and unhoused people, and said he believes it creates a negative image in downtown. Growing up in a family of seven, Rousse said he didn’t have a lot of goals, but “you’d see (someone) loitering around that was unmotivated, and I just said, ‘That’s not who I want to be.’ And I see more and more of that now.”Rousse has spent decades as a financial planner and representative for National Life Insurance Co. He’s also active in local civic organizations like the Barre Rotary. He cited his professional experience as giving him an advantage when considering the complex fiscal situation of the city. “I think I could provide a common-sense response to whatever comes my way, no matter what it is,” he said. Hilgartner said she tried to approach issues like homelessness with “compassion.” But beyond her personal beliefs in how Barre should address the issue, she believes the emphasis should be on a more community-driven process for tackling it. It’s something she has experience with as an Episcopal minister, where you “have to keep everybody on board” to gain funding and support, she said. She does have one topic that is personal to her: traffic safety. Shortly after Hilgartner, a Barre native who was away a long time, moved back in 2022, two cars got into an accident on her road, damaging the heat pump connected to her home. Barre’s road quality was a top complaint among residents in a 2025 budget survey, and all four candidates mentioned the need to fix cracks and potholes. But Hilgartner floated the possibility of going beyond maintenance and trying to add features to slow down drivers on Main Street. “There’s a 25 mile-an-hour speed limit throughout the city of Barre,” she said. “It is not observed.”Despite the challenges Barre faces, Hilgartner said it’s a wonderful place to live. She recalled the flood in 2023, when residents and community organizations across the board jumped in to help clean up. “The day after the rain stopped, people were just down Main Street and in the North End with their buckets and their shovels and their boots and their gloves, and they were digging their neighbors out and trying to get the businesses up and running again immediately,” she said. Stockwell said one recent bright spot has been the influx of new businesses to Barre, from the Slowpoke Clothing Exchange to Foxy’s, an LGBTQ+ bar. Reflecting on the tone of the different City Council campaigns, she said that Barre had a broad spectrum of political beliefs and backgrounds, among both new and longtime residents. “I don’t think it’s that easy a divide, and I hope people will work together to keep Barre alive,” she said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Next week, Barre voters have a choice of City Council candidates with different approaches to its biggest issues.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/barre-1-20230919-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

StebbinsA fundraiser set to be held Friday night by the Berrien County GOP has drawn criticism for hosting Jan. 6 rioters in a local American Legion hall. 
The fundraiser, “Battlefield Michigan: Untold Stories from Michigan Freedom Fighters,” will be held at American Legion Post 568 in Stevensville and will feature two men charged, and since pardoned by President Donald Trump, for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol – including former gubernatorial candidate Ryan Kelley. It will also host William and Michael Null, who were acquitted of plotting to kidnap and kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
A flyer for the event calls the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol a “mostly peaceful protest about a stolen election.” A bipartisan U.S. Senate report found that at least seven people died in connection with the riot, including three law enforcement officers.

After the event was announced, criticism came from within the veterans community itself about hosting such a divisive event.
Marty Goldrick, a veteran and former member of the American Legion, told WNDU he was opposed to the openly partisan nature of the fundraiser.
“First of all, they bring these people in, but then they divide the American Legion, veterans, forcing them because there’s Democrats and Republicans, Independents in any organization, but this thing here is a wedge. To glorify these people is unacceptable,” Goldrick told the station.
Once the criticism mounted, the Herald-Palladium reported that the American Legion attempted to cancel the event, and issued a statement saying officials had not been told about the nature of the fundraiser at the time it was booked.
“Upon learning the nature of the event, from an outside source, the post attempted to cancel the event but was unable to do so because of contractual obligations and the dollar amount requested by the Berrien County GOP to allow the post out of the contract. The American Legion is a non-partisan organization and has no position on the subject matter being presented at the fundraiser and is not a part of the fundraiser,” the statement said.
The county party, in a statement posted to Facebook, said there was an “effort underway on social media to sabotage our event and disparage the Berrien County GOP,” and that canceling the event would constitute a breach of the contract they had both signed.
“We simply want to give Ryan Kelley and our other guests an opportunity to share their experience and perspective because they deserve the opportunity to tell their story and set the record straight. The public deserves an opportunity to hear their stories,” said the statement.

I see potential everywhere and capital nowhere.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Connor Daley: Vermont’s nonprofits are the backbone of our communities. Let’s support them like it..","This commentary is by Connor Daley, a nonprofit strategy consultant based in Winooski. He works with organizations across the country to build stronger and more resilient nonprofits, foundations and community organizations.Vermont is a special place when it comes to mission-driven organizations. We’re home to more nonprofits per capita than any other state in the country. Vermont ranks behind only Washington, D.C., as a percentage of our workforce employed by nonprofits.From food shelves and housing supports to cultural institutions and youth programs, our nonprofits are the lifeblood of communities. Both rural and urban, reaching from Bennington County to the Northeast Kingdom and from White River Junction to Alburgh, they serve where government resources fall short or the government itself pulls back.They step into where the private market doesn’t (and shouldn’t) go. They step in when towns flood, when a family is unhoused, when a neighbor is hungry or when a kid just needs a mentor to believe in them.Yet, despite their irreplaceable role, Vermont’s nonprofits are being targeted. This is especially true for those led by women, BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and disabled people.These organizations — from direct services to advocacy and from downtown development to grassroots power-building — help Vermont be a more welcoming, supportive and inclusive place. But now, threats of uncertain federal funding, policy decisions and regulatory environments are threatening one of Vermont’s most effective and impactful sectors. Resources like this map of the scale and scope of federal funding cuts/freezes to organizations place in stark relief the severity of the situation.This has been a problem for a long time – Vermont nonprofits have forever been chronically underfunded and overburdened.Per Common Good Vermont’s most recent Nonprofit Wages and Benefits Survey & Report, executive directors identifying as women make up two-thirds of nonprofit leaders yet only earn, on average, 79% of what executive directors identifying as men are making. If we want a resilient, inclusive and vibrant future for our state, we must do more than just applaud their mission. We must fund their work and pay them equitably.From the data and from my experience with national organizations, it’s clear: Nonprofits led by people from historically marginalized communities receive less philanthropic funding, face higher hurdles to institutional support and are often left out of decision-making spaces that impact their operations. Addressing this is not just a matter of efficacy — it’s a matter of doing the right thing. These leaders bring lived experience, cultural knowledge and innovative approaches that are essential to solving the most pressing issues Vermont faces.As someone who works alongside nonprofit leaders every day, I see the brilliance, the commitment and the quiet exhaustion that comes from holding communities together with shoestring budgets. I see the young executive director trying to launch a workforce development program with no full-time staff. I see the grassroots mutual aid network scrambling for unrestricted funds while still meeting daily needs. I see the leader training our next generation of community leaders while simultaneously fundraising to support her students. I see potential everywhere and capital nowhere.Vermonters are generous people. We show up. We volunteer. We give when asked. But we cannot afford to treat giving as seasonal or optional, especially given the state of the world and the state of our community organizations. If we care about women in leadership, equity, justice, education, housing, mental health or the environment, then we must care about the nonprofits doing the work on the ground, year-round, often invisibly.Growing up in the Northeast Kingdom, my father taught me and my younger brother that neighbors aren’t just the people you live next to. They’re your community, your support system and — sometimes — your friends. Our nonprofits are led by our neighbors. Let’s help them out. Here is my ask: Give more. Give monthly. Give without strings. Support Vermont nonprofits led by people who haven’t historically had a seat at the philanthropic table. Talk to your friends and networks about starting an informal group that supports your local nonprofit or library or food shelf.If you’re nervous about being recognized or flagged for your support of an organization, call your financial adviser or a community foundation and ask about setting up a small donor-advised fund, through which you can give anonymously. Challenge your business or foundation to increase its corporate social responsibility donations or community benefit programs to help these organizations continue doing good work.If you’re already giving, thank you. Please keep going. The time to step up is now.The future of our state’s well-being, culture and communities depends on it. Our neighbors deserve it.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Connor Daley: Vermont’s nonprofits are the backbone of our communities.

(Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)
Thousands of state government and community college employees in Washington want Gov. Bob Ferguson to ensure they receive a pay raise in July like the rest of the state workforce.
They are asking the first-term Democrat not to sign a new state budget unless it pays for their contract, which lawmakers said was ratified too late to be put in the spending plan awaiting Ferguson’s signature. 
This request from the nearly 5,300-member Washington Public Employees Association is a long shot and could require the governor calling lawmakers back to Olympia for a special session.
In the meantime, the much larger Washington Federation of State Employees is pressing Ferguson to sign the budget, which would pay for raises for its members and does not include furlough plans that the union fought against.
The Washington Public Employees Association delivered a letter to Ferguson this week, asserting that inaction by negotiators in his budget office prevented contract talks from being completed faster so the collective bargaining agreement could get funded.
“I recognize that the position you find yourself in is not an easy one,” union president Amanda Hacker writes in the letter. “Please recognize that signing a budget that harms over 5,000 of your employees for asserting their legal right to participate in their union is not the correct way out of this situation.”
Hacker sought to drop the letter off at the governor’s office on Wednesday but was told no one was there to accept it. 
A Ferguson spokeswoman emailed the Standard late Wednesday, indicating the letter had been received.
“Governor Ferguson looks forward to reviewing it,” communications director Brionna Aho wrote. 
Also Wednesday, about 100 association members rallied at a public service recognition event held across the street from the state Capitol. 
Throngs of state workers attended the annual celebration that featured food, music and dozens of information booths representing agencies, community organizations, and service providers. 
Ferguson did not attend the event, choosing instead to schedule a midday bill signing in Seattle.
Delayed agreement
The Washington Federation of State Employees represents 50,000 state government, higher education and public service workers. It has more than a dozen contracts funded in the budget approved by the Legislature on April 27, the last day of session.
“We want him to sign it,” Ashley Fueston, the federation vice president, said. “It’s definitely a tough situation for all of us. We worked very hard to get our contracts funded. We hope they find a way into the budget.”
Those contracts contain general pay hikes of 3% on July 1, 2025 and 2% a year later. These agreements also raise the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
Members of the Washington Public Employees Association are not receiving those increases. They work at 14 community colleges and nine state agencies, including the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by a governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
But association members overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement with the pay hikes by that deadline. Union leaders told employees then that rejecting the accord would put them in “uncharted territory.”
Hacker said they sought to keep bargaining. But the Office of Financial Management, which represents the state, wouldn’t, she said. The union sued to try to force a resumption of talks. Negotiations restarted in December. Hacker lays out the timeline in her letter.
The two sides reached a tentative agreement in March and union members ratified it April 3. It is essentially the same contract they turned down, and has 3% and 2% increases, the same as the other contracts.
“As you know, Governor Ferguson was not in office when most of this occurred,” Aho, the communications director, emailed. “We would defer to OFM for more details.”
On March 19, the Office of Financial Management told legislative budget writers that separate tentative agreements had been reached with Washington Public Employees Association general government workers and higher education employees. OFM staff estimated those two contracts would cost $55.8 million for the 2025-27 biennium.
In the same letter, OFM director K.D. Chapman-See said the agency supported a “one-time non-precedent setting suspension” of the Oct. 1 statutory deadline “to enable these tentative agreements to be considered for funding.”
She also included potential language that could be put in the budget bill, making clear the funding would be solely for the upcoming budget cycle.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-2-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Some of Florida’s most vulnerable people who rely on Medicaid may wind up having their care flow through managed care organizations under a bill the Legislature passed this session.
Advocates for people with intellectual disabilities are willing to make this move because the proposal, HB 1103, also makes changes to how the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) operates, requiring, among other things, for it to be more transparent about the billion-dollar Medicaid iBudget program it administers.
Now there are fears the bill won’t become law because the Legislature heavily recast the original agency bill. For example, it provides for a no-bid statewide expansion of a Medicaid pilot program, imposes transparency requirements on the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis, and is a priority for House Speaker Daniel Perez, who has been rowing with the governor.

“Everyone is worried he’s going to veto it,” Alan Abramowitz, executive director of the social services agency The Arc of Florida, told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview.
The legislation involves a Medicaid managed-care pilot program launched at the behest of then-House Speaker-Designate, now Speaker, Daniel Perez in 2023. The pilot was designed to care for up to 600 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and was approved for Medicaid regions D and I, which serve Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties. 
The state received federal approval for the pilot in February 2024. The Agency for Health Care Administration issued a competitive procurement for the pilot with two vendors, Florida Community Care and Simply Healthcare Plans Inc., vying for the contract. AHCA eventually awarded the contract to Florida Community Care.
Three hundred and fifty eight people were enrolled in the pilot program as of May 5. During testimony in a House Health and Human Services Committee in February, Carol Gormley, vice president for government affairs for Independent Living Systems, attributed the slow start-up to administrative barriers on APD’s part. Independent Living Systems is the parent company of Florida Community Care. 
HB 1103 would lift the 600-person cap on the pilot program on Oct. 1, expanding enrollment statewide for qualifying disabled people on the Medicaid iBudget wait list. There are 21,000 plus people on the waitlist, according to a legislative analysis.
Expansion premature?
iBudget provides clients with money to choose services to help with activities of daily living such as eating and bathing. Those home- and community-based services allow clients to live in their communities and outside of institutions. APD serves 35,790 individuals through iBudget Florida.  
Under the bill, in July 2026 the program would open to every Medicaid-eligible intellectually disabled person, including those already enrolled in the iBudget program and a different Medicaid managed-care program known as the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) long-term care program.
Some observers feel the statewide expansion may be premature, though.
Valerie Breen, executive director of the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council, told the Florida Phoenix that there hasn’t been enough experience with the pilot program to take it statewide.
“[The] council believes there should be more data before it goes statewide. In addition, we believe that people should have the ability to choose their long-term support and services,” Breen said.
  State Sen. Jennifer Bradley via Florida Senate
Senate bill sponsor Sen. Jennifer Bradley tagged two amendments onto HB 1103 late in the session that ensured Florida Community Care will continue to be the only contracted managed-care plan for the intellectual disabled for the next six years.
The Arc of Florida doesn’t oppose statewide expansion of the pilot program because enrollment in it isn’t mandatory, Abramowitz said.
Agreement required
Indeed, Abramowitz lauded HB 1103 because it makes it clear that intellectually disabled clients or their guardians must affirmatively agree to be placed into a managed-care plan and cannot be mandatorily assigned into one. The affirmation applies to the intellectually disabled program and the Medicaid managed-care program. 
While most Medicaid beneficiaries in Florida are required to enroll in that managed-care program, people with intellectual disabilities are not. Nevertheless, the AHCA has been assigning Medicaid-eligible intellectually disabled people into the managed-care program unless they tell the state they don’t want to be enrolled.
Again, Florida Medicaid statutes don’t authorize AHCA to randomly assign people, but the DeSantis administration has done it nonetheless, including through mandatory assignment language in the last managed-care contract.
AHCA was rolling out the managed-care policy change while APD was announcing the new intellectually disabled managed care pilot program.
“It confused everyone. It was a mess. People were unhappy,” Abramowitz said. 
Hijacked by the House
HB 1103 quickly went from a priority bill for APD  to a priority bill for House leadership and advocates.
The bill was filed in February when Taylor Hatch still headed the agency (she now heads the Department of Children and Families.) As initially filed, the bill would have increased the size and power of the APD and made it the single state agency to serve Florida residents with disabilities. 
To that end, an early version of the bill would have transferred the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, the Division of Blind Services, and the Federal Rehabilitation Trust Fund from the Department of Education and placed them within APD. It also would have changed the title of the person who runs the agency from “executive director” to secretary.
None of that is in the final bill, though. That’s because the House Human Services Subcommittee tagged a lengthy amendment onto the measure, replacing the agency’s wish list with the House leadership’s instead.
The amended bill would create a statewide advisory council to make recommendations to the APD.










The  idea that information about the number of people served, the expense of the service being accessed, those on the waiting list, those sorts of things, once again being available online is certainly going to be a positive.


– Former APD Executive Director, advocate, and lobbyist Jim DeBeaugrine


It also would require ADP to post its quarterly reports on its website regarding Medicaid iBudget and its operations, including the numbers of clients and of people on the iBudget wait list.
APD routinely posted the information on its website for years but in the last two years under the DeSantis administration has stopped making the information — which the agency is required to submit to the Legislature — publicly available. 
Former APD Executive Director Jim DeBeaugrine lauded the transparency requirements for the iBudget reports.
“The  idea that information about the number of people served, the expense of the service being accessed, those on the waiting list, those sorts of things, once again being available online is certainly going to be a positive,” DeBeaugrine said.
A surge of support
Abramowitz said the transparency requirements, along with creation of a  Statewide Family Council, represent important changes for people with intellectually disabled family members.
The Statewide Family Council would advise APD on policy, working alongside the existing local Family Care councils. These councils have for the last 31 years worked with families of people with disabilities, sharing information about programs, services, and resources available in Florida.
The bill would require APD to publish on its website all local family care council reports plus local council findings, policy recommendations, and an assessment of the agency’s actions in response to previous recommendations of the local councils.
Lastly, the bill would require APD to contract for a study to review, evaluate, and identify recommendations regarding the algorithm used to set a person’s iBudget allocation. The study must, at a minimum, assess the performance of the existing algorithm used by the agency and determine whether a different algorithm would better meet clients’ needs.
Abramowitz said a lot of the bill was “grassroots written” and that there’s been a surge of support for it in the community.
Stephanie Nordin is a mother of four, including twins with severe autism, who wrote a letter to DeSantis beseeching him to sign the bill.
“Like so many parents across Florida, I live with the constant weight of trying to secure support for my children in a system that feels impossible to navigate. This bill would bring meaningful, desperately needed change to families like mine,” she wrote. 
“And just as importantly, this bill creates real transparency. For the first time, agencies will be required to publish updates about waitlists and funding, so families aren’t left in the dark wondering where they stand.”
Abramowitz, too, wrote a letter to the governor asking that he sign the bill into law.
“Our families, self-advocates, and providers would be honored to celebrate this moment alongside you and your staff. I hope you will consider holding a bill signing ceremony.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Federal officials announced an ambitious plan Thursday to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system, acting after several recent deadly plane and helicopter crashes ignited public panic and made air safety a sudden priority for the Trump administration.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlined plans to replace decades-old technology, build new air traffic control centers and towers, and “supercharge” hiring to erase the current national shortage of more than 3,000 air traffic controllers.
Workers would replace radar, software, hardware, and telecommunications networks, with an eye on reducing outages, improving efficiency, and ensuring safety, Duffy said. The plan also aims to eliminate close calls on runways and in approach airspace by expanding a “surface awareness initiative” to 200 airports.
Duffy likened the current system to a flip-phone, saying it has antiquated telecommunications technology that relies on copper wire instead of fiber-optic cable and air traffic control centers dating back to the 1960s.
“You have to redo it all, simply put,” Duffy said. “We are going to build a brand-new air traffic control system. Full stop … this is the biggest lift, the biggest build that has ever happened in the history of the FAA.”
Duffy announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C., before an audience that included politicians, press, and people who lost loved ones when a plane and Army helicopter collided in January over the Potomac River near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Sixty-four plane passengers and three soldiers died in that crash, and investigators revealed more than 15,000 “near-miss” incidents occurred near the airport in the four years before the crash.
President Donald Trump joined the announcement by phone, referring to ongoing delays and outages at Newark Liberty International Airport as “the flavor of the moment.” On April 28, a radio and radar outage left air traffic controllers unable to track aircraft or communicate with pilots at Newark airport for 90 seconds.
“That was not a good situation,” Trump said Thursday. “I’m sorry what you’re going through with the terminals, but we’re going to get them fixed up.”
It’s unclear if the proposed improvements will ever happen, as Duffy and Trump had no cost estimate for the plan.
Pressed by reporters, Duffy said administration officials haven’t put a price tag on the plan, although he expects it will cost “billions. Lots of billions.”
“I’m going to leave that to the Congress,” Duffy said.
He added: “Congress has a lot of fights over money. This is one they should not fight over.”
Rep. Sam Graves, R-Missouri, said the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which he chairs, has approved a $12.5 billion “down payment” to get improvements rolling.
Trump said he hopes one company will get “one big, beautiful contract, where it’s, you know, they’re responsible for everything from digging ditches to the most sophisticated stuff. And if you have any ideas as to who makes the best system, we’d love to have it.”
Duffy called the plan a national priority and said it will require “permitting reform” so that whatever companies do the work can bypass regulations that would likely drag improvements out over 10 to 15 years or longer. Administration officials instead aim to have the work done within three to four years, Duffy said.
The improvements are especially urgent as the skies become more crowded, Duffy added, citing recent upticks in air taxis and delivery drones.
A parade of CEOs from airlines and industry groups took the microphone after Duffy to applaud the plan as long overdue.
“The technology that we use to track our teenagers is more advanced than what we give to our air traffic controllers. That is literally insane. We need to fix that,” said Todd Hopley of the American Association of Airport Executives. “We need better technology. We need better facilities, and we need more controllers. It is as complicated as that and as simple as that. It’s something we can fix, it’s something we should fix, and it’s something we will fix.”
Joanna Geraghty, the CEO of New York-based Jet Blue, acknowledged the families of crash victims in the audience.
“It should not take a tragedy to solve this problem,” she said. “We know air traffic control delays and challenges far, far too well. This has quite literally been our number one priority for decades.”

Jim Murphy, R-St. Louis (Photo courtesy of Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)A bill that would help fund the installation of rescue boxes for parents in crisis to anonymously relinquish newborns to the state is headed to Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe.
State Rep. Jim Murphy, a St. Louis Republican and the sponsor of the “Safe Place for Newborns Fund,” called his legislation “a pro-life bill that everybody agrees with.” 
That was nearly true. The bill faced no opposition until it reached the Senate, where state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, voted against it Wednesday when it passed 31 to 1. When the bill returned to the House for final approval on Thursday evening, it passed 136 to 1, with state Rep. Bryan Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, as the lone dissenting vote.
The legislation was amended in the Senate where lawmakers tacked on an increased tax credit allowance for maternity homes from 70% to 100% and raised the ceiling from $50,000 to $100,000 per taxpayer per year. The Senate also extended the expiration date on the diaper bank tax credit to 2031. 
The amended bill also establishes the “Zero-Cost Adoption Fund,” which would go toward helping Missourians pay for adoption costs, giving priority to those adopting children in foster care. The fund would be administered by the Missouri Department of Social Services and also provide financial support for community-based interventions to help prevent children from entering foster care. 
“Any time we can make not only the adoption process smoother and more cost-efficient and also put supports in place to ensure that the adoption is successful, that’s an easy yes for me,”  state Rep. Melissa Schmidt, a Republican from Eldridge, said Thursday. 
But the “newborn safety incubators” remained the focus of the bill. These boxes are increasingly popular around the country, allowing parents to anonymously relinquish their infant to the state without criminal consequence for abandoning the child. Under state law, parents who relinquish their infants still have an opportunity to ask the state for custody of their child again in the future.
‘Really horrifying’: Missouri draws scorn over treatment of teen mom in foster care

Six of these safe boxes have been installed around Missouri with four more on the way, all thanks to private donors, Murphy said. One child has been safely relinquished through this method, he said. 
The first box was installed in August 2023 at the Mehlville Fire Protection District in south Saint Louis County. Exactly six months later, the box’s silent alarm went off. Inside the box, first responders found an hours-old newborn. 
In early February, while testifying in support of the bill, Hendricks said he planned to attend the little girl’s 1st birthday later that month with her adoptive family.
“There is no reason in the world we live in that babies end up in dumpsters,” Hendricks told state representatives in February. “We can do better. But the funding is an issue.” 
The fire chief said he receives at least three calls a month from other fire departments and law enforcement agencies interested in installing their own boxes. But in most cases, funding is a major barrier. 
The cost of installing each box is roughly $20,000, Murphy said. This includes equipping the box with temperature controls, alarms to notify first responders the box has been activated and a feature that dials 911. Some are also outfitted with video cameras that show a live feed of the baby. 
The current budget earmarks $250,000 for the program, which would put up to $10,000 toward each box, thus contributing to the installation of 25 more boxes in the next fiscal year.
Murphy told his colleagues that the interest in the boxes spans the state. In Kansas City, for example, one councilman is looking to install six boxes, he said.
During the House hearing on the bill, state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, told Hendricks that she was texting the fire chiefs in Berkeley and Ferguson in north Saint Louis County about the technology. 
“I want that box,” said Proudie, who suggested extending the relinquishment period to six or 12 months.
In 2002, Missouri passed a safe haven law that allowed mothers to surrender babies within the first weeks of their lives to staff at hospitals, fire departments, ambulance services, law enforcement agencies, maternity homes or pregnancy resource centers.
Since then, Murphy said, “many, many babies were still found in dumpsters and alleys and places like that,” adding: “The safe haven bill didn’t work as planned.” 
The National Safe Haven Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for “infant abandonment protection,” reports that in 2021, 73 infants were relinquished through Safe Haven laws around the country. That same year, the nonprofit reports, 31 babies were found abandoned in dangerous locations like dumpsters around the country. Of those 31 infants, 22 were found dead. 
During Senate debate Wednesday, state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, expressed her support for the bill as she addressed Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman of Arnold, who handled the legislation in the Senate, acknowledging both their roles as adoptive mothers. 
“My son was placed in my arms at 13 days. I can’t imagine what his birth mom was going through during those days, but I am so grateful that after 13 days, she was able to place him in my arms,” Nurrenbern said. “That’s what we want for all birth parents in that situation, to recognize that there is a safe place for their baby.”
On Thursday, state Rep. Bridget Walsh Moore, a St. Louis Democrat, accused  Senate Republicans of hypocrisy for passing the baby box legislation then leading a filibuster the evening prior to kill legislation that would have created a child care tax credit.
“These baby boxes are all well and good,” Walsh Moore said. “But if we invested in our families and our working families making sure that mothers are healthy and cared for and that children are safe in child care, then maybe people wouldn’t have to hand their children over to the government.”

(Photo by Getty Images.)  Minnesota did the right thing in 2023 by passing earned safe and sick time for all workers. 
This was a powerful first step that affirmed a simple truth: No one should be fired, or risk the ability to feed themselves or their family, because of a short-term illness, the need to care of a sick family member, or because they’ve suffered domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking. It was a common sense step toward ensuring dignity for all workers, no matter where we live or what we do. 
This week, six members of the Senate DFL joined Republicans to put that promise in danger.  
On Tuesday, the Minnesota Senate passed amendments to take ESST away from more than 110,000 workers who have been earning and using earned sick and safe time for 16 months now, for no other reason than the size of their employer.
In doing so, they sent a clear, troubling message: some workers count less than others. 
Let it be clear, sick is sick. It doesn’t matter if you work in a small business in Minneapolis or as a farmworker in Greater Minnesota. It doesn’t matter if you have four coworkers or 40. The need for paid time off to see a doctor, get out of an abusive relationship, or care for a loved one doesn’t change based on the size of your workplace. It’s a basic dignity that all Minnesotans deserve. But with these amendments, our lawmakers are creating a two-tiered system that leaves behind more than 110,000 Minnesotans, as well as the loved ones we care for.
But this will wind up affecting all of us: The child care workers who nurture our children; the home care workers who take care of the most vulnerable among us; the farm workers who grow and harvest the food we eat. 
When we deny these workers the ability to rest, recover or care for loved ones, we don’t just endanger their health — we compromise the well-being of our entire society. No community thrives when its families are forced to choose between their health and a paycheck. Undermining their protections is not just unjust — it’s dangerous.
These rollbacks are a direct blow not just to workers, but to the industries they claim to protect. Stripping away basic protections makes attracting and retaining workers harder, makes workplaces less safe, fuels public health risks, and undermines the stability families depend on. It’s short-sighted and deeply unfair.
For the last 16 months, ESST has allowed all workers to take care of themselves and their loved ones, and made them proud to work in a state where we look out for each other. 
As we think of these potential cuts, we are reminded of a story of a young father from Saint Cloud whose partner developed severe vertigo during pregnancy. He had to take on extra caregiving responsibilities for both her and their child, often stepping in when their daughter was sick. Having just started a new job without paid sick days, he was forced to choose between earning a paycheck and being there for his family, a choice that caused immense stress and heartache. These are the families that ESST was developed to protect. These are the painful stories that could again become reality if these carveouts become law.
Luckily, the fight is far from over. The Minnesota House and Gov. Tim Walz now have a critical opportunity and a responsibility to do what the Senate would not: stand up for universal, common-sense protections and reject these harmful carveouts. They must listen to the voices of working Minnesotans who simply want the right to care for themselves and their loved ones without risking their livelihood.
Minnesota promotes itself as one of the best states to live, work and raise a family. We fight for strong public schools, vibrant communities, and a commitment to fairness and opportunity. But policies like these carveouts chip away at basic worker protections and move our state backwards. We cannot claim to be a national leader while telling thousands of workers their health and dignity are negotiable because of who signs their paycheck. 
If we want to continue setting the standard for a thriving, equitable state, we must defend the rights that make that possible. Cutting corners on ESST doesn’t just hurt workers — it weakens the foundation of what makes Minnesota great.

Revamped regulations tripped Indiana lawmakers up for nearly four months but emerged from a chaotic legislative session within House Enrolled Act 1390, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles’ (BMV) annual package. They’re set to take effect next month after a zig-zagging path through the Statehouse.
“Indiana is the No. 1 predatory towing state in the nation,” author Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “… Our towing practices exploit and harm trucking companies in their time of need.”

Surveyed commercial carriers logged the most “predatory” towing incidents relative to mileage in Indiana between 2021 and 2023, according to a report by the American Transportation Research Institute. The state also had few of the personal vehicle owner towing protections identified in a 2021 report from the Public Interest Research Group’s Consumer Watchdog team.
“House Enrolled Act 1390 holds towing providers accountable, requiring transparency, capping fees and ensuring access to personal belongings, while penalizing bad actors who are taking advantage of a bad situation,” Pressel said.
Commercial vehicles in the spotlight
That research sparked a Hoosier campaign for reform.
“The great majority of the towers … are responsible businesspeople and are not the problem, but there’s a small percentage that have taken advantage of the industry, and those are the ones that we’re focused on,” Indiana Motor Truck Association President and CEO Gary Langston said.

After learning of the commercial tow findings, Langston began asking around — and was “bombarded with invoices” from in-state and out-of-state carriers.
Indiana law already mandates itemized receipts, but that doesn’t mean all charges are legitimate.
Langston recalled one invoice for an 18-mile tow that featured a fuel surcharge of more than $7,000. He also described seeing overstated hourly labor costs and various “hidden” fees in the miscellaneous and administrative columns on the invoices.
Commercial vehicle interests additionally sought greater recourse for recovering vehicles and the client loads inside while disputing such charges.
In committee hearings, Indiana Towing & Wrecker Association President Karrie Driscol expressed openness to additional regulations but similarly blamed the complaints on a handful of bad actors. Her organization declined comment to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Charges, releases scrutinized
Several chunks of incoming Indiana code tackle what Langston dubbed “egregious” overcharging.
Towing companies on the Indiana State Police (ISP) rotation will only be able to charge the rates they’ve already filed when ISP calls them for emergency tows. When their services are requested by local law enforcement agencies, the restrictions shift.
If there are set rates, that’s what’ll get charged. If not, a company could charge its ISP rates. If the company isn’t on the ISP rotation, it will charge, at most, what’s in the ISP district’s agreements.
The legislation also requires law enforcement agencies to include a lengthy list of provisions in written policies or contracts entered into, amended or renewed after June 30: contract lengths, service and storage rates, allowable administrative fees, a prohibition on charging unlisted fees, a provision allowing the agencies to suspend or remove violator companies, and more.
When private property owners request tows, companies will charge whatever rates are in the agreements they already have with the owners, according to the legislation. If there’s no preexisting agreement, a company must charge a rate applicable under the legislation’s local law enforcement agency provisions.
The state’s itemized invoice requirement also got tweaks.
  Indiana Towing and Wrecker Association President Karrie Driscol testifies in committee meeting on Monday, March 31, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Come July 1, invoices must include the number of miles the vehicle was towed, a “good faith estimate” of where and how long invoiced items were used, and an attestation that all invoiced items were “used and necessary in the ordinary course of business.”
Fees must also be accompanied by “full” descriptions of the services provided. Towing companies and storage facilities are barred from charging inspection fees but could charge for retrieval.
Another piece of the legislation lets commercial carriers file complaints with the Indiana Attorney General’s Office if they believe the charges are “unreasonable.” A towing company or storage facility will have to release the impounded vehicle and its cargo within 24 hours of receiving payment for 75% of the invoice, proof of a bond for the remaining 25%, and a copy of the complaint.
Legislators also cracked down on towing company compensation offers for referrals. They’re banned unless there is a prior contract in play.
Winding journey, differing reactions
Towing changes encountered hefty opposition throughout several rounds of changes.
House lawmakers briefly considered giving the Secretary of State’s Office oversight and requiring that towing companies obtain licenses from the office, but the language ultimately wasn’t added to House Enrolled Act 1382 before it left the chamber.

Also in the session’s first half, procedural deadlines felled two towing-focused proposals. Pressel’s committee didn’t put one on its hearing agenda; the other advanced to the House floor but languished on the chamber’s agenda for eight straight session meetings and died.
One Senate committee resurrected that language during its turn to consider the annual BMV agency bill — the same place it was re-inserted more than two weeks later.
In between, another panel removed the provisions, prompting Pressel to cram them into a utility trailers sales bill. At the time, Driscol pressed lawmakers for a “pause” this session.
“May 1, are you available?” she quipped, in a March 31 committee hearing. “… I think that even if this does go, and passes, Chairman Pressel and I will be talking over the summer, because there are still tons of issues that need to be resolved.”
She’s not alone.
Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, was a vocal opponent. He told the Capital Chronicle that he’s looking forward to continued work with Pressel and others on the topic. He wants to make sure good towing companies don’t get caught up in the new regulatory structure.
“I think it’s workable, but it actually kind of contradicts itself as well,” Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, said of the final version. “There were so many different versions done on the language, trying to get it right.”

(Getty Images)For the second year in a row, legislators pushed back on State Public Defender Rémy Starns’ efforts to gain total authority over Louisiana’s sprawling indigent defense system. His proposal would also have made it easier for him to fire a small group of public defense attorneys who have publicly clashed with him. 
Two lawmakers hastily pulled bills from consideration Thursday after members of the House Committee on Criminal Justice questioned Starns’ motivation for pushing the legislation. 

The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Vanessa LaFleur, D-Baton Rouge, criticized the proposal as a “power grab” from Starns and then asked her colleagues to squash it. 
Attorneys who run local public defender offices in central and north Louisiana also testified Thursday that Starns was using the legislation to push them out of their jobs. He was upset, they said, because they had opposed his bills at previous legislative hearings. 
“We are about to have our careers wiped out because Mr. Starns doesn’t think that we should come before you and share with you when we disagree with his policies,” said Michelle AndrePont, the head of Caddo Parish’s public defender office and one of the attorneys Starns is trying to dismiss. 

House Bill 447, sponsored by Rep. Les Farnum, R-Sulphur, would have eliminated a review process AndrePont and other chief public defenders are in the middle of now to fight Starns’ decision to fire them. It also would have taken away some limited power lawmakers bestowed on the State Public Defender Oversight Board just last year. 

House Bill 516, sponsored by Rep. Roy Daryl Adams, D-Jackson, would have consolidated authority over local public defense funds and operations with Starns. Both bills were scuttled temporarily by the authors but could be brought up for reconsideration later in the session. 
At the urging of Gov. Jeff Landry, state lawmakers in 2024 transferred significant authority for managing the state’s public defender system from an oversight board to the state public defender’s position, which Starns has held since 2020. 

Starns had clashed with the previous state public defender board on several issues and told legislators last year its members were interfering with his ability to improve the public defender system overall.

The new version of the board, which has less power than its previous version, is made up of appointees from the governor, legislative leaders and the Louisiana Supreme Court. It oversees the public defense system’s largest contracts, mostly with private attorneys who provide death penalty defense, and it sets the salary scale for chief public defenders hired to run local offices. 
Yet even on these limited issues, Starns has had difficulties getting along with the new board, whose members were seated last July. 
The new board initially declined to go along with Starns’ proposal to route the death penalty contracts through local public defender offices. Its members have also twice turned down his proposed pay scale for chief public defenders, primarily because it would have cut the salaries of some by tens of thousands of dollars.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

More recently, the board has agreed to review Starns’ decision to fire five chief public defenders, including AndrePont. 
All of the attorneys at risk of losing their jobs testified during Thursday’s committee meeting. They said Starns was trying to fire them, primarily because they have criticized his policies in front of state lawmakers and the state public defender board. 
Collectively, the attorneys said they have over a century of experience working in public defense. None have received a negative performance review, they added. 

“What do we five have in common? We are active in the legislative process,” said Brett Brunson, who has run the public defender office in Natchitoches Parish for 18 years and is at risk of losing his job. “At times, we have been at odds with Mr. Starns and his proposals.”

When the public defenders testified last year, they warned they might lose their jobs over speaking out publicly against Starns’ proposals. A few legislators appeared taken aback Thursday that Starns was attempting to fire them. 

“You all are the same ones who came in opposition? And all of you are the same ones who are now terminated?” Rep. Alonzo Knox, R-New Orleans, asked the attorneys. 

“Yes,” responded Trisha Ward, chief public defender for Evangeline Parish.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Photo by Mike Simons/Getty Images)If the state of Indiana moves forward with the execution of convicted murderer Benjamin Ritchie on May 20 as planned, the Indiana news media — and by extension the public — will have no legal right to witness the proceeding. Our government will impose the ultimate punishment behind a veil of secrecy, with no objective witnesses.
It’s time for that to change.
Indiana is one of 27 states with the death penalty, but one of only two that prohibits professional media witnesses to its executions. Under state law, execution witnesses are limited to a small group of people, including the warden, immediate family members of the victim, no more than five friends or relatives of the convicted person, the prison physician, and the prison chaplain. The Indiana Department of Correction’s implementing policy explicitly states that the press “shall not be permitted to witness the execution or be in the Execution Chamber.”
Late last year, the state of Indiana executed death row inmate Joseph Corcoran, who was convicted of murdering four people in 1997. It marked the first time in 15 years that the state carried out the death penalty.
Members of the news media were barred from witnessing Corcoran’s death by lethal injection except for one. Indiana Capital Chronicle Senior Reporter Casey Smith witnessed Corcoran’s execution, but was only able to attend after being specifically invited by Corcoran to take one of the seats that the statute reserves for an inmate’s  friends and relatives. Smith’s access to Corcoran’s execution was an outlier. When the state carries out Ritchie’s execution later this month, journalists will be prevented from officially observing it.
Death row inmate Joseph Corcoran executed for quadruple murder

Earlier this week, attorneys from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Indiana’s ban on media access to executions on behalf of The Associated Press, the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Gannett, WISH-TV, and TEGNA. Our lawsuit argues that the media ban violates the First Amendment.
The public relies on journalists to serve as its eyes and ears, and Indiana’s exclusion of the news media from witnessing executions goes beyond safety or security. Indiana’s law and policy runs counter to the First Amendment and denies transparency to the public.
When state lawmakers hold hearings to discuss health care, public education, or property tax reform, we expect members of the news media to be there to document the debate and help us understand what it all means. When a mayor announces plans for a new economic development project, we expect reporters to be there to ask questions about how much it will cost and how it will impact the local community.
We should expect the same level of journalistic scrutiny when the government uses taxpayer dollars to carry out one of its gravest responsibilities — capital punishment.
Media witnesses play a crucial role in ensuring that executions are carried out lawfully. Their reporting provides the public with an accounting of execution protocol and proceedings, from start to finish. If the lethal injections go as planned, news reporting from media witnesses can help the public have greater confidence in the process. If things don’t go as planned and an inmate suffers a painful death at the hands of the state, journalists should be there to tell us about it.
The need for media witnesses is arguably more important today, as states increasingly use controversial methods to end the lives of death row inmates, despite mounting concerns that they don’t always work — or aren’t always administered — as intended. Reporting by independent media witnesses has shown that prison officials sometimes have conflicting accounts.
Indiana’s execution of Corcoran last December was the first in which the state used only a single drug, pentobarbital, rather than a cocktail of drugs as it has done in the past. (I am currently representing Indiana Capital Chronicle in a lawsuit against the Indiana Department of Correction seeking access to the cost of the drug. The lawsuit recently prompted officials to disclose that the state paid $900,000 to acquire the drug, but the government continues to resist disclosing important related information, including how much of the drug was purchased.)
Advocates for and against the death penalty will always debate its merit. But we should all agree that when the government carries out its ultimate punishment in the public’s name, it cannot be allowed to do so in secret.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-09 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,TVA suing Holly Springs over power grid failures,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/09/tva-suing-holly-springs-over-power-grid-failures/,TVA alleges Holly Springs breached their power contract by taking funds from its utility department it shouldn't have.,"The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally created utility that sells wholesale power to local providers in the south including Mississippi, is suing the city of Holly Springs for breaching a contract by continuing to mismanage its electric department.
TVA, which has sold power to north Mississippi city since 1935, alleges Holly Springs breached a power contract between the two parties by taking funds from its utility department when it shouldn’t have, as well as by failing to make timely payments, increase its retail rates to customers, and provide regular financial updates to TVA.
That lawsuit, filed May 1 in the United States District Court in Oxford, lists as defendants: Holly Springs Mayor Sharon Gipson, who recently lost her bid for reelection, all five members of the city’s Board of Aldermen, and Wayne Jones, the utility department’s general manager. The suit asks the court to use its authority to enforce the contract.

Years of under-investment and deferred maintenance — as well as destructive weather, including a 2023 ice storm — have debilitated the utility to the point where customers experience unusually frequent and prolonged power outages, local officials, TVA and ratepayers told Mississippi Today. They said while the catastrophe was years in the making, decision-making under the current administration has exacerbated the problem.
In its complaint, TVA says it first warned the city in September 2023 that it lacked “necessary revenue” to run the power department. Last October, TVA again warned city leaders, saying it needed to increase customers’ rates to survive financially. The lawsuit alleges that Holly Springs hasn’t paid a monthly invoice to TVA on time since May of last year, and that it still hasn’t paid what it owes from this past February.
TVA also says Holly Springs leaders took funds from the utility department before ensuring there were sufficient reserve dollars. Under the parties’ contract, the city can take payments in lieu of taxes from the utility after it fulfills certain expenses, including saving enough money in reserves. The lawsuit alleges, though, the city made five such payments in the last year, all while having outstanding debts and thus no reserve funding.
While managed by city officials, the utility has expanded to the point where about two-thirds of its 12,000 customers live outside Holly Springs, meaning most ratepayers have no local voting power in terms of running the department.

Customers and state officials attribute much of the recent power issues to city leadership, especially Gipson, Holly Springs’ mayor since 2021. Just a month ago after severe weather took out power for Holly Springs customers, Northern District Public Service Commissioner Chris Brown alleged that Gipson refused assistance from crews in New Albany who offered help. Holly Springs officials denied the claim, FOX13 Memphis reported, saying the crews showed up without getting the city’s approval. 
The Public Service Commission, which oversees the utility thanks to a bill state lawmakers passed last year, initially scheduled a hearing for city officials to appear in Jackson in January. The city successfully appealed the initial date, arguing one of its attorneys, Sen. Bradford Blackmon, had to appear in the legislative session. The PSC agreed to postpone the hearing until after the session, which ended a month ago.
“We are currently in the final stage of the third party investigation and are awaiting a report from (third party investigator) Silverpoint which will determine the exact scheduling of a hearing,” Richard Stone, a spokesperson from Brown’s office, told Mississippi Today on May 5. 
During the 2025 session, Rep. John Faulkner, D-Holly Springs, offered two proposals related to the city’s utility: one requesting $2 million in appropriations, and another establishing a nine-person board — five appointees from Holly Springs and two each from the boards of supervisors for Marshall and Benton counties — to run the department. Both bills died in their House committees.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185719/3X0A1847-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Photo by Taylor Jung for New Jersey Monitor)JERSEY CITY — The family of a man killed by police here in 2023 gathered with social justice advocates Thursday to condemn a grand jury’s decision last week not to criminally charge the officer responsible for his death, calling it another example of racism within the criminal justice system. 
It was an outcome that left the family and advocates disappointed, but not surprised, they told reporters. They also claimed that community-led mental health response programs that were supposed to be implemented in the wake of Washington’s death have yet to receive proper funding.
Washington’s case reflects broader failures in handling mental health crises, especially in communities of color, advocates said. 
“Mental illness is not met with sympathy and respect. It is met with militarized policing instead of compassion. Families like ours are left with funerals and trying to heal,” said Toni Ervin, Washington’s aunt.

According to Ervin, Washington had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. He was experiencing a mental health crisis when his family called a medical hotline for assistance (they said he feared police). Law enforcement eventually responded instead of mental health professionals, the family said, and after a two-hour standoff, officers broke open Washington’s door. Washington, who had a knife in his hand, came toward the officers, and then Officer Stephen Gigante shot and killed him.
The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office launched an investigation into Washington’s killing, as it does with all officer-involved shootings. On April 28, a grand jury decided Gigante would not face criminal charges.
“We are even more reinvigorated than ever to get justice for Drew,” said Amelia Green, an attorney for the family.
The family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in August 2024 against the Jersey City Police Department, Jersey City Medical Center, and Hudson County, alleging they violated Washington’s constitutional rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Green noted that following the grand jury decision, they now expect to receive previously withheld evidence, including unreleased body camera footage of some of officers’ interactions with Washington.
Washington’s death, along with the police killing of Paterson activist Najee Seabrooks, inspired the Seabrooks-Washington Community-Led Crisis Response Act, state legislation that Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law in January 2024. The law creates a two-year pilot for community-led, non-emergency crisis response programs. Though the state has pledged $12 million for the initiative, none of the selected organizations have received their promised funding, advocates said at the press conference.
Pamela Johnson of the Anti-Violence Coalition of Hudson County, one of the grant recipients, said her organization has an office on Martin Luther King Drive in Jersey City that it cannot open because it does not have enough money.
“So how are we supposed to address individuals going through mental health issues and answer those calls from family members when they need help,” said Johnson.
Jersey City Councilman Frank Gilmore expressed frustration with city leadership, calling the handling of Washington’s case an “epic failure” and accusing city officials of not making mental health resources a priority.
“This is what happens when you dehumanize a certain segment of the population. Because the reality is, if this would have happened to someone else, somewhere else, the sympathy would have been there,” Gilmore said.
Jersey City spokesperson Kimberly Wallace-Scalcione said that even with the city’s participation in Arrive Together — an initiative of the Attorney General’s Office that pairs mental health professionals with law enforcement for crisis calls — and its own investments in crisis response, situations with potential violence like the one involving Washington are still handled by police first.
“No other municipality in the state has addressed more police misconduct and terminated police officers for wrongful conduct than Jersey City.  The loss of anyone’s life is tragic, and even as the grand jury found no wrongdoing by the officers, the city remains committed to improving services while ensuring public safety,” said Wallace-Scalcione.
Washington’s family has continued advocating for improved mental health support systems in Jersey City and statewide. Ervin urged people to register to vote to help elect officials who will implement change.
“We will continue to demand justice, not just for him, but for every life disrupted or ended by police violence,” Ervin said.
Dan Prochilo, a spokesman for Attorney General Matt Platkin, said the office of public integrity and accountability that Platkin oversees “conducted a thorough investigation” into Washington’s death.
“The work of the Fatal Police Encounter Unit within OPIA’s Integrity Bureau, which conducts independent investigations of any civilian death during an encounter with law enforcement as well as deaths in custody, has resulted in several indictments and a conviction of a former corrections officer, who was sentenced to a three-year prison term,” Prochilo said in an email.
As for advocates’ claim that they have not received the funding they were promised from the Seabrooks-Washington bill, Prochilo said organizations that have received approval and a fully executed contract can submit reimbursement requests.
“Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin created the Division of Violence Intervention and Victim Assistance and the Office of Alternative and Community Responses to enable our Office to work hand-in-hand with community partners in the distribution of the funds that support such programs while also adhering to our obligation to be good stewards of the public funding,” he said.

Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) told reporters that they would be starting from “base” with the budget. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Finance Committee kicked off its work on the next Wisconsin State Budget Thursday by eliminating over 600 items from Gov. Tony Evers’ sweeping budget proposal, saying they would start from “base” and his budget had too much “irresponsible” spending. Democrats criticized Republicans for blocking all of Evers’ proposals without presenting a plan of their own to address the concerns of everyday Wisconsinites.
The committee spent last month hearing from members of the public, many of whom called for investments in public education and health care, and from some agency heads, who have defended Gov. Tony Evers’ budget requests. The state has a $4 billion budget surplus it’s considering, and Evers proposed the state tap those funds and raise income taxes on the wealthiest Wisconsinites to fund his proposals. 
The list that lawmakers eliminated from the budget bill spanned about 20 pages and includes a new 9.8% income tax bracket for high-income earners, Medicaid expansion, nearly $500 million for the Child Care Counts program, marijuana legalization and taxation, $125 million to create a grant program to address PFAS, $200 million to address the replacement of lead pipes and other provisions to help address lead poisoning and many provisions related to public schools including free school meals, a “grow your own” teaching program and ensuring access to menstrual supplies in schools, funding for the Office of School Safety and a provision to cap participation in the state’s voucher programs.
Ahead of the budget meeting, committee co-chairs Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) told reporters that they would be starting from “base” with the budget, meaning removing all of the items and taking the budget back to the one in place for 2023-2025. 
Born said legislators are accustomed to “the way we have to manage the governor’s executive budgets.” Since Evers took office in 2019, Republicans have kicked off every  budget cycle by removing all of his proposals.
“Unfortunately, [Evers] sends us an executive budget that’s just piles full of stuff that doesn’t make sense and spends recklessly and raises taxes and has way too much policy,” Born said. “So, we’ll work from base and the first step of that today is to remove all that policy… and then begin the work of rebuilding the budget.”
Responding to Democrats’ criticism  that Republicans are removing items that are popular with the public, Marklein said they should draft separate bills and use the regular legislative process to advance those ideas. 
“I can point to things in the budget bill that we’re going to pull up that I like… and we’re pulling that out as well. It’s a policy,” Marklein said. “It’s got nothing to do with the budget.” 
Born noted that there are also other ways that lawmakers could address issues of concern apart from Evers’ suggestions, saying the removal of items “doesn’t mean that when we build this budget over the next couple of months, we won’t impact those areas in positive and significant ways.”
“The governor has one idea on how to fund child care or one idea on how to impact mental health,” Born said. “There are other ways that we can do that in current law and current budget operations by inserting more money in things that I can most likely see us do.”
Marklein also noted that there could be some changes to how they go about drafting the budget this year following the state Supreme Court upholding Evers’ partial veto in the last budget.
“I anticipate that you’re not going to see too many references to digits, years anymore,” Marklein said. “My guess is that our drafting attorneys are going to recommend that you spell out those years, and those dates in the budget.” Born said the decision could also affect the education budget because there are increases already “baked into the cake.” 
Evers slammed Republicans for gutting his proposal, saying that they are refusing to help Wisconsinites.
“The most frustrating part for me as governor is that Republicans consistently reject basic, commonsense proposals that can help kids, families, farmers, seniors and Wisconsinites across our state, all while Republicans offer no real or meaningful alternative of their own,” Evers said. “Republicans talk a lot about what they’re against, but not what they’re for.”
During the meeting, Democrats proposed keeping 19 items in the budget across a handful of motions that touched on certain issue areas, saying they hoped they could carve out some spots for agreement. 
One would have placed $420 million back in the budget to fund the Child Care Counts program, as well as several other child care related measures. 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) said Republicans are “willing to pull out really, really important items” and said the child care proposals are essential, warning that money for the Child Care Counts program is expected to expire in June. 
“We are at risk of losing 87,000 [child care] slots… The fact that these things are being pulled out of the budget today and as of today, there is no mention or discussion of a replacement plan for something as important as this,” she said, is creating uncertainty among Wisconsinites and exacerbating a crisis. 
“Our children deserve quality services. Our families deserve affordable rates,” Johnson said. 
Another motion would have placed Medicaid expansion back in the budget. Wisconsin is one of only 10 states that haven’t accepted the federal expansion, which would allow coverage for those up to 138% of the federal poverty line. 
“Families are struggling to afford the care they need, and we have an opportunity — and I would argue an obligation — to do something,” Andraca said.
Andraca noted that Congressional Republicans, including Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, are considering cuts to the Medicaid program as they aim to extend the 2017 tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first term.
“We heard how people are fearful of cuts to the programs that they rely on, and they are forced to make increasingly hard choices between groceries and prescriptions,” Andraca said. “Are you still willing to turn your backs on the people who entrusted us to vote for their best interests? Honestly, our constituents deserve better than this.”
The final proposal from Democrats would have kept items in the budget related to veterans including tax credits for veterans, funding for a veterans’ mental health program and for the Wisconsin Veterans Museum as well as an item to designate Juneteenth and Veterans Day as holidays. 
Rep. Tip McGuire (R-Kenosha) said he hoped they could agree on not making veterans’ lives harder.
“I recognize that it’s sort of the whole brand of the Republican party right now is to make everyone’s life a little bit more difficult,” McGuire said. “Certainly, it’s harder to travel in this country, It’s harder for people to access health insurance, it’s harder for people to afford college or go to college or manage their student loans. It’s harder for people to afford groceries and there may even be a question of what you can have full shelves soon… I know it’s your whole brand to make people’s lives harder, but I think we can all agree… [veterans] should still deserve some support.” 
Republicans rejected each motion.
McGuire doubled down on his point, saying that Republicans’ opposition to supporting even smaller parts of Evers’ proposal is a sign that they don’t want to help the average person.
“People are struggling and it is a challenging world and the one thing we should not be doing the one thing that nobody votes for their legislator to do is to make their life harder,” McGuire said. “Yet, that is all we are seeing out of the Republican party right now. That’s all we see out of the federal Republican party and frankly the Republican party here,” McGuire said, noting that Republican lawmakers recently passed legislation that would place additional restrictions on unemployment benefits.
“You’re making things less affordable and more difficult for regular [people] and that’s bad and we shouldn’t do it,” McGuire said.
Marklein said he was “glad we’re going back to base” because Evers’ budget proposal included a 20% increase in spending, an additional 1,300 positions funded by general purpose revenue and an increase in taxes. 
“When I talk to my constituents about the process, they are truly supportive of us not starting from this inflated budget that [Evers] put before us,” Marklein said, noting that Evers signed the last budget after they went through a similar process. “The idea that the door is closed on all these things is pretty ridiculous.” 
McGuire pushed back on Marklein’s comments, saying that lawmakers are pretending it is a “nice and friendly” process. 
“Part of the process that occurs here today is that not only do you remove the governor’s budget items, which make life easier for Wisconsinites, but then, you also prohibit anyone from ever discussing them ever again,” McGuire said. “And that’s really bizarre… This is a top-down totalitarian committee where we’re not permitted to discuss things past a certain point.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Every kid has heard “No means no!” when they want something their parents don’t think they should have. This week that phrase got a couple high profile uses when Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, told Donald Trump right to his face that Canada was not and never would be for sale and Montana’s Congressman Ryan Zinke forcefully said “no” to the sale of public lands in the West.  
In this day and age seeing U.S. politicians keep their campaign promises — or honor their oaths of office — is becoming increasingly rare.  But on “keeping public lands in public hands,” Rep. Zinke did just that. 
The measure in question was part of the “big, beautiful bill” touted by Trump to give yet more tax breaks to the already wealthy. The new twist was to sell hundreds of thousands of acres of federal lands in Nevada and Utah for mining, logging, drilling and development to finance those tax breaks.  
Doug Burgum, the Secretary of the Interior, has publicly declared public lands and resources as “natural assets” that can be used to pay down the national debt. Consequently, GOP Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada and Celeste Maloy of Utah inserted the public land sale as an amendment since it was not contained in the original draft of the bill due to bipartisan opposition.
When the measure was up for a vote in the House Natural Resources Committee, on which Zinke sits, Montana’s Congressman and former Secretary of the Interior called the move to sell public lands “a red line” and was adamant: “It’s a no now. It will be a no later. It will be a no forever.’’   As Zinke explained his firm opposition: “I prefer the management scheme and I give as an example a hotel. If you don’t like the management of a hotel, don’t sell the hotel; change the management.”
At almost the same time, Canada’s Prime Minister, Mark Carney was using almost the same words in his White House meeting. After listening to Trump’s blather about how Canada should be our 51st state, how much he “loved Canada” and how erasing the “artificial” border line would make one beautiful piece of real estate, Carney used Trump’s own real estate line to fire back: “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.  We’re sitting in one right now.  Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it’s not for sale, won’t be for sale,” adding: “Canada’s not for sale. It never will be for sale.”
Carney won office largely on his opposition to Trump’s intentions to take over Canada, saying during the election that: “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.”
Both Zinke and Carney are dead right.  Polls show 74% of Americans oppose the sale of our public lands — and Carney’s election speaks for itself.  He won by fighting Trump’s nasty threat to take over our northern neighbor that 77% of Canadians oppose.  
For a guy who’s always been told he can have everything he wants, the double-barrel blast should be a wake up call.  The world is not one big real estate sale to be marketed solely to make greedy billionaires even more money.  Kudos to Zinke and Carney — and hopefully a sign to the rest of Congress and the world that it’s time to tell our spoiled child of a president “No means no!”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2213751899.jpg,,,2025-05-09 07:02:30.122244

A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the […]","Apartments and stores under construction in Rapid City, S.D., in 2023. New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
Fast home-building states, like Idaho, have higher birth rates, federal data show

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
 Does overregulation of housing construction play a role?

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America




Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.

(Photo provided by Benjamin Ritchie's legal team)Lawyers for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie are seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court to allow evidence of the inmate’s “serious brain damage” to be weighed for the first time.
The high court requests are in response to a 2-2 decision handed down late last month by Indiana’s Supreme Court justices, which shut the door on any further legal challenges in state or federal courts.
Defense attorneys argued in the Wednesday filings that the denial was a “legal error” and said Indiana’s justices failed to take into account Ritchie’s “ineffective” lawyers at trial and in other post-conviction matters. Current counsel said those earlier lawyers “failed to present fetal alcohol syndromes,” which lead to a death sentence “based on inaccurate information.”

“Through trial, state post-conviction, and habeas review, the record developed by Ritchie’s attorneys contains incomplete information of Ritchie’s brain damage,” public defenders said in new court documents. “Ritchie’s attorneys allowed the State to create a materially false impression with the jury. … Ritchie was condemned to death without anyone hearing evidence that he suffers from a fetal alcohol syndrome.”
Ritchie faces a May 20 execution date for the 2000 killing of Beech Grover law enforcement officer William Toney. The condemned man has been on death row since his conviction in 2002.
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at the police officer, who did not survive the shooting.
The inmate’s current counsel said prior lawyers “completely failed to investigate the source of Ritchie’s serious brain damage” because they “erroneously believed” he lacked the facial features that are commonly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. 
As a result, state prosecutors told the 2002 jury “to assign little weight to his mitigation because there was no such diagnosis,” according to the latest filings.
Separate from the SCOTUS filings, Ritchie’s attorneys are seeking an emergency stay from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. In the motion, filed Thursday, his defense team similarly argued that Indiana’s Supreme Court has wrongly shut down final opportunities for post-conviction relief.
If the higher courts decline to intervene, the only option for a commuted sentence rests solely with Gov. Mike Braun, who has final say over Ritchie’s pending clemency petition.










Ritchie was condemned to death without anyone hearing evidence that he suffers from a fetal alcohol syndrome.


– defense attorneys for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie


Those proceedings began earlier this week when members of Indiana’s Parole Board spoke with Ritchie during a Monday hearing held at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. A second meeting is scheduled for Monday, May 12, in Indianapolis and will allow members of the public to speak for and against Ritchie’s clemency petition.
After both hearings, the board will make a recommendation, but a final clemency decision about whether to commute Ritchie’s death sentence to life in prison without parole will ultimately be up to the governor. There’s no timetable for the board, or Braun, to issue opinions.
Neither the governor nor any current members of the state’s parole board have deliberated a death penalty clemency case before Ritchie’s.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.
Years of ‘ineffective’ counsel
Ritchie’s lawyers submitted two requests to Justice Amy Coney Barrett: one to supersede the state supreme court and allow for further post-conviction review of the inmate’s case; and another to stay, or pause, the scheduled execution, at least until those proceedings can play out.
The petition for writ of certiorari — a request asking SCOTUS to review the state supreme court’s decision — held that a 2002 jury sentenced Ritchie to death “based upon inaccurate information.”
The inmate’s current lawyers said prior counsel was “insufficient(ly) prepared” and hired only one mental health professional who “was forced to admit that” any brain damage suffered by Ritchie “could not be traced to any source.”
Story continues below.

That’s contrary to new evidence submitted to the Indiana Supreme Court earlier this year, Ritchie’s lawyers said.
Included in the most recent post-conviction filings were findings from two Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) experts, who claimed that Ritchie “has extensive brain damage resulting in deficits due to a fetal alcohol syndrome.”
One expert, a geneticist, specifically diagnosed Ritchie with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), “meaning his brain damage limits Ben’s functioning to that similar to a person with intellectual disability.”
“Ritchie has significant adaptive functioning deficits caused by pFAS that, among other things, inhibit his ability to control impulses,” his lawyers wrote in the petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Importantly, unlike an investigation ‘into other mental illnesses and behavioral issues,’ a diagnosis of FASD can establish ‘both cause and effect’ of a criminal defendant’s actions,” they continued.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office has repeatedly maintained in legal filings that Ritchie has failed to provide the high court “with a good reason to reconsider its decision to set an execution date or to deny him permission to re-litigate his trial counsel’s performance.”
“Ritchie has not explained why the jury would have found this evidence more mitigating had his trial counsel linked those functional deficits to a formal clinical diagnosis …” state attorneys wrote. “Ultimately, the reports submitted by Ritchie at this late stage do not cover any new ground and they certainly do not help Ritchie meet his burden of proving that there is a reasonable possibility that he is entitled to relief on his successive claims.”
State supreme court justices split
Indiana’s Supreme Court justices “agreed that (Ritchie) has brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other toxins.” But the court was split, 2-2, on whether he should be allowed to present evidence “of the effect of that damage on his behavior” on the night of his crime.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush, who disagreed with the decision to deny further post-conviction relief proceedings, said in her April 15 opinion that she believed evidence submitted to the court suggested “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, in 2000.
Rush said she preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the FASD experts’ evaluations.
‘I am so sorry’: Clemency hearings begin for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter said in their opinion that “what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant.” The issue before the court “is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today,” they said. Rather, the justices must decide whether Ritchie’s trial lawyers “were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then.”
The affirming justices, citing federal law, maintained that Ritchie was unable to meet the necessary standards for his petition to be further litigated.
Last week, the state’s high court justices rejected a follow-up request by Ritchie’s defense team for a new hearing to reconsider the inmate’s request for post-conviction relief. The justices additionally denied a request for a stay which would have delayed the execution.
Justice Mark Massa, who served as a deputy prosecutor in Marion County and participated in proceedings related to Ritchie’s case, has recused himself from the case.
The decisions stymied Ritchie’s ability to appeal in federal court. His legal team wants the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Indiana justices’ ruling and allow Ritchie to continue his post-conviction pleas.
The high court’s ruling followed a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by Ritchie and his legal team.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Budget cuts are often sold to the public as necessary belt-tightening — an unfortunate but unavoidable step toward “fiscal responsibility.”
But what happens when those cuts target the most vulnerable among us? What happens when the programs being slashed aren’t luxuries, but lifelines?
Across Oklahoma and the nation, disability services are quietly being defunded, downsized, or dismantled. These decisions may not make front-page news, but their impact reverberates deeply in the lives of disabled individuals and families who depend on them for support, inclusion, and survival.​
Programs designed to support and protect people with disabilities — like state councils on developmental disabilities, protection and advocacy systems, and national initiatives that give us a voice — face the threat of elimination.
As a single mom of five, raising a son on the autism spectrum, I live the realities these programs are designed to address.
Every day, I navigate school systems, health care barriers and support networks in a world that isn’t built with families like mine in mind.
And I’m not alone.
Since 2022, more than 2,000 Oklahoma families have been approved for or are currently receiving developmental disability services, following a significant reduction in the state’s waitlist from 13 years to one. These services are not luxuries; they are essential supports that enable families to move from merely surviving to truly thriving.
What truly changed the trajectory of my advocacy journey was Partners in Policymaking, a leadership training program I completed through the Oklahoma Developmental Disabilities Council. That experience gave me the tools to speak up — not only for my child, but for the entire community. I learned how to navigate the Legislature, challenge broken systems, and amplify the voices of others who are often ignored.
This is not just a budget issue — and it’s not about left versus right. It’s about what’s right versus wrong.
In Oklahoma, recent funding efforts have made a measurable difference. Rolling back that progress now would be devastating.
Despite that, I’m hearing growing concern that this progress could be reversed in the upcoming budget and that these critical services could be on the chopping block — putting thousands of families at risk of losing the critical support they’ve only just begun to receive.
Budget cuts would send a message loud and clear that our needs are not a priority. Without programs like these, future advocates won’t get the chance to find their voice. The leaders, policy changers, and community builders of tomorrow will be silenced before they ever begin.
Cutting disability programs means cutting off access — to education, employment, independence, safety, and basic dignity. It also means delaying early screenings and interventions — critical steps for diagnosing developmental disabilities, identifying delays like autism and addressing childhood trauma.
The data is clear: approximately 1 in 6 children aged 3–17 in the U.S. has a developmental disability. Services to support these children are not a luxury — they are a necessity. When children are denied early access to help, we miss critical windows of opportunity that shape their futures.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, early diagnosis and intervention for developmental disabilities can greatly improve a child’s development and long-term outcomes. Eliminating these services risks leaving thousands of Oklahoma’s children without timely help during their most critical developmental windows.
What starts as a delay in services, often grows into a lifetime of missed potential, greater needs, and heavier burdens — both for families and for our state. Cuts made today will cost far more tomorrow both in lives and in dollars.
We can’t claim to value community, family, or fairness while gutting the very programs that make those ideals possible for everyone. Oklahoma can’t call itself inclusive if we only show up when it’s convenient. We can’t say we care about all children while ignoring those who need support the most.
Because when we silence the most vulnerable among us, we don’t just harm individuals and their families — we betray the very values that are supposed to unite us and wound the very soul of our society.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas State Library Board on Friday will disburse public funds to libraries for the last time in the 2025 fiscal year, and likely the last time before all seven board members will be replaced.
As local library directors wait for their regular shares of state funding, some continue to await a long-delayed avenue for rural libraries to be eligible for more state funding. An amendment to the State Library’s fiscal year 2024 appropriation bill introduced by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, required the Arkansas Department of Education to alter library funding eligibility standards to allow smaller libraries not supported with a local millage access to state aid.
The original deadline for establishing those standards was July 1, 2024, the start of the current fiscal year.

“We want [libraries] to receive local support,” Payton told a Joint Budget subcommittee at the time.  “We don’t want them dependent on the grants and aid that might come through the State Library system, but it’s impossible for them to pass and maintain one mill if they’re a city of less than 5,000.”
Arkansas Constitutional Amendment 30 prohibits libraries in cities with fewer than 5,000 people from being supported by local property taxes. Payton said he presented the proposal to change the rules on behalf of his constituents in Ash Flat, which has a population of just over 1,100 and a library funded by the city government.
Eligibility for state aid would allow the Ash Flat Library to apply for state and federal grants it currently cannot access, Terry Hill, chairman of the library’s governing board, told the Advocate.
Subsequent State Library appropriations, for fiscal 2025 and 2026, reiterated the need to broaden access to library funding, but the rule-making process stalled last year, meaning rural libraries still cannot access the funds, according to library directors and the education department.
State Library Director Jennifer Chilcoat told the board in a Feb. 14, 2024, email that the rules had to be in place before the board met that August to start disbursing state funds for fiscal year 2025. If not, the State Library would be “in violation of” either its standards for state aid to public libraries or the legal requirement to create the rules, Chilcoat said in the email.
The State Library appropriation bills state that the new rules must “allow a public library to adequately demonstrate a source of revenue in lieu of the requirement to maintain a one-mill county or city property tax,” which is currently a standard for libraries to receive state aid. Without formal rules, the current standard limits which libraries can receive state grants. A mill is equal to $1 dollar for every $1,000 in assessed value on real estate.
Calhoun County is Arkansas’ most rural county, and its library system would receive an $18,000 funding boost under broader state aid eligibility standards, director Allie Gosselink told the Advocate. The Hampton library would also be able to increase its hours of operation from 28 to 40 hours per week and would bolster its early literacy services and upgrade its technology, Gosselink said.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)
She and John McGraw, regional director of the Faulkner-Van Buren Library System, were both on the advisory committee that drafted new rules required by the 2023 law.
“We talked about every piece of that and tried to decide what worked, what didn’t work, what was detrimental, and we changed the rules based on what we thought would be fair,” Gosselink said.
Assistant Attorney General Sarah DeBusk told the State Library Board in November that proposed rules must be approved by the education secretary and governor and a public comment period before final approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council.
The Department of Education’s legal division is responsible for ensuring the rules are in the proper format before they return to the state agency that drafted them. The State Library Board would be responsible for opening a 30-day public comment period on the rules after receiving the formal version from the education department, and Chilcoat urged the board in the February 2024 email to plan for a special meeting the following month.
Education department attorneys were “tentatively predicting that we should either hear back from or receive approval from” Sanders’ office in the subsequent few weeks, Chilcoat wrote.
“There is a timeline that we are keenly aware of to get the changes in place before the start of the 2025 State Fiscal Year,” she said in her February 2024 email. “For that reason, we cannot wait until the May board meeting to get these Rules in front of you and the public.”
The State Library Board has not voted on the proposed rules but has a new deadline of this July 1 to act, according to emails obtained by the Advocate via the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
Possible alternatives
The still unofficial rules and possible actions the Library Board can take were the subject of late April emails between Chilcoat and ADE Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford.
Since the board doesn’t have new rules to address Payton’s 2023 appropriations amendment, Chilcoat wrote on April 25, “we need to have a stopgap formula beginning in August in case the promulgation process is not complete at that time.
“If there aren’t new State Aid Rules in place when the new board members begin their terms, these drafts will give them a template which they can use or dismiss, but it will give them a starting point from which to work if they so choose,” the email said.
One of the last laws the General Assembly passed before adjourning this month was Act 903, which will dismiss the entire State Library Board and require Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appoint seven new members in August.
In an April 30 email, Chilcoat told Salas-Ford she has “two versions of a one-time state aid formula for the current board to choose from and approve so that the new board doesn’t have to deal with the first quarter payments at their first meeting.
“One formula simply removes the MLS (Master’s of Library Science) credit from all recipients of it. The other is a simple across-the-board percentage decrease [in state aid to all libraries].
“Both are included so that we can honor Senator Payton’s amendment to include those libraries that don’t or can’t collect the millage previously required. Of course, the current board can also vote to pass the responsibility to the next board.”
Gosselink and McGraw both told lawmakers in April that the inaction on the proposed rules was a reason the Legislature should not dissolve the State Library and its board and transfer their responsibilities and funds to the education department. A House committee rejected the proposed dissolution, one of several bills that generated hours of debate about library oversight and funding throughout the 2025 legislative session.
The new rules for state aid to libraries are on Friday’s Library Board agenda.
Gosselink said she hoped Friday’s board meeting would create “a little bit of clarity” for her library’s funding for the rest of the state’s fiscal year.

The Sheridan Chess Association brought in a Serbian chess protegee who took on the room, playing 24 games at once and winning all of them. 
The post Grandmaster 24, Sheridan chess club 0, but winners all around appeared first on WyoFile .","At age 21, Serbian chess player Luka Budisavljević is the youngest Grandmaster in his country’s history. A grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can achieve, besides world champion, and there are only around 1,850 of them in the world today. 
In Sheridan last weekend for the Wyoming Community Foundation Open — a chess tournament with a $9,000 guaranteed purse — Budisavljević warmed up by playing 24 Sheridan players simultaneously. The Sheridan Chess Association, which hosts the tournament, put on the event to give local players a chance to compete against one of the sport’s elite.

Daniel Hoopes, a Sheridan High School student, held out the longest, lasting more than 30 moves against the Serbian protegee, according to Sheridan Chess Association president Brian Kuehl. “A bunch of people who played out of the 24 were young kids,” Kuehl said. “It’s an opportunity to bring chess into the community and for kids to get a chance to play against a grandmaster they’ll likely rarely, if ever, have that opportunity again.” 
The real tournament began Friday and lasted until Sunday. The chess association has hosted the competition in Sheridan each of the last four years. The group’s principal goal remains getting Wyoming youth interested in chess, an activity Kuehl said imparts both critical thinking skills and focus to its young adherents. 
Before his simultaneous dispatching of 24 local players, Budisavljević visited two Sheridan schools to talk about chess and play students blindfolded.

Budisavljević was one of three grandmasters in Sheridan for the weekend. The 79 contestants from eight different states also included state champions from Colorado, Wyoming and Montana. Players ranged in age from eight to late 80s, Kuehl wrote in a summary of the tournament. 
Budisavljević ended up one of four people locked into a tie for first place in the tournament’s most elite division.

Wyoming's congressional delegation should review the ""Code of the West"" before they sell off our public lands, attorney Ryan Semerad writes.
The post Remember that some things aren’t for sale appeared first on WyoFile .","Our public lands are invaluable and irreplaceable. A national treasure and a source of local pride. Yet, when the opportunity arose for Wyoming’s senators to protect our public lands from being sold off and privatized, they voted no. 

Opinion

U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, voted against preserving our public lands because she didn’t want to “obstruct President Trump’s agenda,” according to an April 10 statement from her spokesperson Joe Jackson. Both Lummis and U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, have suggested that some of our public lands should be sold to develop more affordable housing.
In the fall, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon and 26 members of the Wyoming State Legislature joined legal briefs to support Utah’s lawsuit demanding a transfer of millions of acres of public land from federal management and public ownership to state management and, later, private ownership. And, in the span of just five days, Hageman and every Republican on the House Committee on Natural Resources — except for Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado, — went from backing away from selling our public lands to advancing a midnight amendment that could authorize the sale of nearly a half million acres of public land across the West. The late-night move allowed no time for reflection, discussion or public input. As Devin O’Dea of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers put it: “This amendment isn’t just a backdoor land sale — it’s a deliberate effort to circumvent a process that was thoughtfully designed to protect and improve our nation’s public lands.”
Is this plan to sell our public lands really what the Wyoming people want?
In January, the State of the Rockies Project from Colorado College released its 2025 Conservation in the West Poll. The poll surveyed 3,316 registered voters from eight western states, including 402 registered voters from Wyoming. Across the entire set of respondents, 37% identified as “MAGA supporters” and 24% identified as “MAGA Republicans.” From the Wyoming group, 53% identified as “MAGA supporters” and 74% identified as “Republicans.”
Some 65% of all respondents and 58% of Wyoming respondents opposed transferring control over our national public lands from the federal government and its agencies — including the U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management — to the states. Only 11% of Wyoming respondents supported selling these public lands to create space for affordable housing. By contrast, 86% of Wyoming respondents supported building more housing in existing communities near jobs, roads and transit.
Preserving public ownership of these lands produces immense economic value for outdoor recreation, energy development and agriculture alike. 
Last November, the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable announced new economic data showing that outdoor recreation across the United States generated $1.2 trillion in economic output in 2023 or 2.3% of the country’s gross domestic product. That is a 36% increase in real terms from 2012.
BLM-managed public lands situated in Wyoming produced $24.9 billion in economic output and supported 73,000 jobs in 2023, according to the agency. That economic output included $211.8 million from recreation, $238.9 million from grazing, and $24.2 billion from oil, gas, coal, and mineral development. From this output, BLM-managed public lands produced $970.9 million in payments to Wyoming and its counties to help fund our schools, road improvements, infrastructure and other public services.
“A recent trip on public lands in Wyoming.” (Andy Beach)
So here’s my question for our senators and Wyoming voters: How does selling our public lands promote the Wyoming people’s agenda? 
Do our senators believe that we want to give away our cherished public lands? The lands we hunt, fish and hike. The lands we inherited from our parents and grandparents, and that we hope to leave for our children and grandchildren. I don’t know about you, but I don’t remember voting for Lummis, Barrasso or Trump so they could strip us of that great legacy — our public lands.
We live our lives and make our homes in Wyoming, that great plain sweeping across the American West, because we love the land. We respect it. We honor it. 
And we raise our families on public lands. We teach our children the great lessons of life on these lands. We graze our stock on these lands. We marvel at their rugged splendor. We are the undeserved but grateful beneficiaries of the colossal bounty and beauty of these lands.
The people of Wyoming — contrary to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s belief — have never treated our public lands as just “national assets” on a balance sheet. We have never wanted these lands to be liquidated to pay for some short-term project like a temporary tax cut or to be transformed into a tiny pyrrhic band-aid on the societal wound that is a lack of housing supply.
These lands are part of the fabric of our Wyoming souls. They are in our blood.
By state law, W.S. § 8-3-123, Wyoming follows the “Code of the West.” I have the code framed on the wall of my office. Among other things, the code reminds us to “Remember that some things are not for sale.”
Our elected officials would do well to remember the code. Cause some things truly are not for sale. Otherwise, us Wyoming folk may have to find and vote for real leaders who represent our interests rather than followers who would sooner sell us and our legacy out in service of someone else’s agenda.

Republicans and law enforcement supporters of the bill (AB-34) said officers need to be protected from repeated investigations, and that anti-police groups have abused Wisconsin’s John Doe law to harass innocent officers who’ve been involved in civilian deaths. A long line of attorneys, legislators, social workers and others spoke in opposition to  the bill, arguing that it adds to an array of legal privileges and protections police already enjoy.
Wisconsin’s John Doe law allows for a judge to be petitioned to review a case where prosecutors have already decided not to file charges. Once a John Doe hearing has been called, the judge may hear arguments from the petitioner as to why probable cause should be found that a crime was committed. If the judge agrees that probable cause does indeed exist, then special prosecutors may be appointed by the judge to review the case. Those prosecutors, however, ultimately decide whether charges will be pursued, regardless of whether a judge finds probable cause of a crime. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonee), an author of the bill, said the law had been used to “unfairly target” two officers who’ve been involved in deadly incidents. Former Wauwatosa officer Joseph Mensah killed Jay Anderson Jr. in 2016, claiming that Anderson lunged for a gun on the passenger seat of his vehicle. Anderson was the second person Mensah had killed in a year. He was involved in a total of three fatal shootings over his five year career at Wauwatosa PD. Mensah left Wauwatosa PD in late 2020 and was hired by the Waukesha County Sheriffs Department, where he is a detective. 
In 2021, a John Doe hearing was called to review Anderson’s shooting, after which Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Glenn Yamahiro found probable cause existed to charge Mensah with homicide by negligent use of a dangerous weapon. The second John Doe hearing, started in 2023, focused on Madison police officer Matthew Kenney for the 2019 killing of 19-year-old Toney Robinson. A judge declined to allow the hearing to go forward. 
“After the investigations, the court confirmed that he had acted in self-defense,” Moses said of the John Doe hearing in Anderson’s case. Mensah’s John Doe hearing “mirrored” reviews done by the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office, U.S. Attorney’s Office, FBI, and Wauwatosa PD, he said. “It’s concerning that such investigations, which echo previous exhaustions, can be perpetuated, consuming significant time and resources,” said Moses. 
While speaking Wednesday, Moses incorrectly referenced Mensah’s 2015 shooting as being the reason for the John Doe hearing in 2021. “Officer Mensah used self-defense to protect himself while on the job in a situation in 2015,” Moses testified on Wednesday. In 2015, Mensah killed 29-year-old Antonio Gonzales while still in his probationary period at Wauwatosa PD. Neither Gonzales, nor Mensah’s third fatal shooting of Alvin Cole in 2020, were the subjects of John Doe hearings.
Last year, when the bill was first introduced, Moses joined Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield) in claiming that families of people killed by police were seeking vengeance against officers. Moses confused details of Mensah’s shootings during those hearings as well. When asked about the mix up, Moses admitted to Wisconsin Examiner that he had not closely followed the Mensah cases. 
  Rep. Clint Moses (Wisconsin Legislature)
As Moses testified on Wednesday, Hutton joined him in the committee room. Hutton, who has brought forward Senate versions of the bill, has said that although he’s taken extensive feedback from law enforcement about the bill, he has not reached out to the families of people killed by police. During a hearing in February, Mensah testified in favor of the bill.
Mark Sette, vice president of the Wisconsin Fraternal Order of Police, said the bill is “crucial” and that law enforcement “have both the duty and right” to use deadly force to protect themselves or others. Sette said that police must make split second decisions in high-stress circumstances, and that deadly use of force incidents “are rare”. Sette praised Wisconsin’s process of conducting reviews of deadly force incidents led by an outside agency, saying that the investigations are thorough. Sette said that repeated investigations prevent officers from moving on with their lives, and trap them in a cycle of psychological trauma and financial stress. 
West Allis Police Chief Patrick Mitchell, a former president and current legislative chair of the Wisconsin Chiefs of Police Association, also praised the investigative process. Mitchell pointed to the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT) as an example of how thorough reviews of deadly force incidents by police can be. 
Not everyone was sold on the bill, however. Rep. Andrew Hysell questioned Sette and Mitchell about whether or not it’s possible for a district attorney to make a mistake in clearing an officer of wrongdoing. Sette said although it’s possible, that it’s “incredibly unlikely” because of the thoroughness of deadly force investigations. Hysell said that district attorneys aren’t infallible, and that the bill — if passed — would set in stone a prosecutor’s decision, and deny one legal avenue for families of people killed by police.

After Moses, Sette, and Mitchell came numerous people from a variety of backgrounds voicing opposition to the bill. Gregory Jones, vice president of the Wisconsin NAACP and president of the organization’s Dane County branch, urged lawmakers to dig deep, ask tough questions, and consider all aspects of how the bill could negatively impact civil rights and the pursuit of  justice. 
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, stressed that the bill takes away judicial discretion and elevates law enforcement as a privileged class above all other citizens. Merkwae noted that prosecutors and law enforcement have close working relationships, and that district attorneys often rely on the very officers whose actions they’d need to review when citizens are killed. 
The advocacy director also cited investigations by MAIT, citing an investigation by Wisconsin Examiner in partnership with Type Investigations, which reviewed 17 MAIT investigations from 2019-2022, all of which resulted in no charges against officers. Merkwae listed the article’s findings including that officers who kill citizens are interviewed as witnesses or victims only, can refuse to have their interviews recorded, and may amend their statements after viewing video evidence. In several MAIT investigations, officers were not separated from one another to prevent statement contamination despite this being a required policy. 
Mensah and other officers provided contradictory statements and were not separated from one another after his third shooting. These facts were raised during a federal civil trial into Alvin Cole’s death earlier this year. The trial ended in a hung jury, with jurors unable to unanimously agree on whether Mensah’s killing of Cole was excessive.

Merkwae said that last year, Wisconsin had 24 fatal police encounters, up from 14 incidents the prior year. “So by creating a separate standard for police officers, this bill sends the message that they are above the law,” said Merkwae. “Which, I think, is a dangerous precedent that erodes trust and makes community engagement with law enforcement more fraught and less effective.” 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) also spoke in opposition. Clancy said that he hadn’t planned to speak on the bill, but decided to when he heard Mensah’s name being used. “The idea that an officer who killed three people in three different incidents is a poster boy for why this is good legislation rather than bad is mindblowing to me,” said Clancy. “Joseph Mensah serves as an example of how our current system is failing the people that it is designed to protect. Had Joseph Mensah been held accountable after the first time he shot and killed somebody, he wouldn’t have shot and killed a second and a third person, in three different incidents. And it is sickening to me that he was brought up as an example of how this is necessary because he feels that some folks are mean to him in trying to find some measure of accountability.”
More people rose to speak against the bill after Clancy. Some were social workers and medical staff, who recounted being spat on, punched, kicked, scratched, and hurt yet never once considering criminally charging the person who hurt them. It’s a privilege that police officers have which they do not, the speakers argued. At one point, a Wisconsinite who wished to be identified only as G. Lee attempted to testify while wearing a hat that used an obscenity to criticize President Donald Trump. Committee Chair Ron Tulser (R-Harrison) called the hat offensive and got into an argument with Lee, after which he called for the assistance of the  Capitol Police and called the committee into recess.

When the hearing re-started, G. Lee was allowed to testify on AB-34 while wearing the hat, though he was warned any breaches of decorum would result in him being removed. Lee apologized that the hat “threatened or offended” Tusler, and stated that Tusler reacted from a position of power. Comparing that to the powers police have, Lee said “what scares me about the decorum set in this room, and the measure tied to this bill, is about power.” 
Lee, speaking directly to Tusler, said that when the hearing was stopped because of Tusler’s feelings, “One of my concerns here is that we are privileging the feelings of law enforcement over the feelings of families who’ve actually lost loved ones to bullets. That’s an important thing to consider here. The whole system is set up to protect a particular part of the state power, and you’ve used your state power to make a message.”

Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) addresses the upper chamber on May 7, 2025. (By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A Republican legislator is pushing for the state to lay the groundwork for a four-day work week by establishing a pilot project and a tax credit to encourage participation. 
Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford presented a resolve, LD 1865, to the Taxation Committee on Thursday that would establish a pilot project administered by the Maine Department of Labor to “promote, incentivize and support” the use of a four-day work week and study the benefits and effects of the schedule change.
“This proposal is rooted in a simple principle,” Bennett said. “Maine people work hard and they deserve to thrive, not just survive.”
Bennett said his proposal is not about working less but working smarter, but some Republican legislators on the committee were critical of the plan. 
“Working five days a week, that’s part of being an adult,” said Rep. Tracy Quint of Hodgdon. 
Bennett pushed back. “I don’t think part of being an adult is to have to work in a given rigor that was handed to us by what worked in 1938,” he said, adding that when former President Franklin D. Roosevelt ushered in the 40-hour work week about 80 years ago, critics feared economic disaster but instead it helped usher in an era of prosperity.
“I do not want our state policy making to be governed by fear,” Bennett said. 
The pilot project would be voluntary, open to all private and public employers with at least 15 employees, but selection will be up to a process established by the Department of Labor to ensure a wide breadth of participation. 
Research on four-day work weeks is in its early stages, and not all four-day work weeks look the same.
Bennett said he’d like the pilot to involve a reduction in hours per week to 32 hours, eight hours per day, without any loss of pay, employment status or benefits. Other models compress 40 hours into four days.
An international trial of more than 200 companies that switched to a reduced hours workweek like Bennett proposed found improved worker well-being, retention and recruitment, with most companies choosing to continue the model. 
However, other studies identified some negative impacts, including scheduling problems, more intense monitoring measures and a risk of benefits fading over time.
Some private Maine businesses have implemented four-day work weeks, using varying methods, as well as a handful of municipalities, including South Portland, Lewiston and Biddeford.
In order to encourage participation, the resolve would also establish a tax credit against income taxes owed by that employer. 
The specifics of that credit are not outlined in the proposal. Currently, it states that it would be determined by the department and the State Tax Assessor, but constitutionally tax changes must go through the Legislature, so ultimately such a decision would have to come back to lawmakers. 
Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) questioned why a tax credit is necessary if some municipalities and businesses in Maine have already implemented four-day work weeks, but Bennett said Maine-specific data on effectiveness is lacking. The credit would be an incentive to help the state gather that data, and it is not intended to replace the cost of the additional eight-hour work day.
“I want it to be proven out that the productivity gains and the other possible advancements are achievable and aren’t just replaced by state tax dollars,” Bennett said.
Pressed on the cost the tax credit could incur the state by legislators of both parties, Bennett said he would return with specifics for the work session but anticipates it to be modest. 
He is also open to the committee choosing to fund an incentive in another way, noting that he modeled his plan after a similar bill currently being considered in Massachusetts that uses taxpayer dollars. 
“I hope that you don’t reject it on that basis,” he said. 
The duration of the pilot project in Maine would be at least two years but no more than four years, which would be determined by the Department of Labor.
The resolve specifies that participating employers should be diverse in size, industry location and ownership, including those owned by veterans, women, minorities and people with disabilities. Those participating should also have both employees who are exempt from and subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 
No one testified for or against the measure on Thursday, but Patrick Woodcock, president and CEO of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, spoke neither for nor against. Woodcock said, if the resolve does pass, the chamber would want to partner with the Department of Labor to make the pilot as effective as possible, noting that it would be helpful to gather data about how a four-day work week would work for salaried versus hourly employees. 
“I think ultimately, for something like this to be successful, you do need the executive buy-in,” Woodcock said. “If this does have a trend of being utilized as a best practice, I think Maine does need to be at the forefront of consideration of this model.”
The department would be required to report annually to the Legislature on the progress and participation levels for the duration of the pilot project and then submit a final report.  
The report would assess the economic and social effect of a four-day workweek on the participating employers and the effect on the wellbeing of participating employees, as well as include recommendations. 
However, throughout the pilot, participating employers must provide the department access to employer data and participating employees including through interviews and surveys on a regular basis, though employees can opt out of those inquiries and any data gathered must be anonymized. 
The State Tax Assessor would also be required to submit an annual report on the tax credit.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The effects of climate change made severe flooding that inundated West Tennessee and parts of the Central Mississippi River Valley in early April about 9% more intense, according to an analysis published Thursday by an international team of environmental researchers.
From April 3 through April 6, thunderstorms and torrential downpours hovered over a broad swath of the Mississippi River Valley, leading to near-record breaking floods, widespread damage and at least 15 deaths.
Those four days of rainfall are the heaviest recorded for the region in spring since 1950, according to the report published by World Weather Attribution, an international collaboration that analyzes the potential influence of climate change on extreme weather events.

The study used observational data, historical records and climate models to examine how warming temperatures impact storm likelihood and intensity. Researchers also used nonprofit Climate Central’s Ocean Climate Shift Index tool — based on observations and climate model data — to analyze sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico where much of the moisture fueling the storm originated, said Ben Clarke, a researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London. 
Researchers compared how this type of weather event has changed between today’s climate — about 1.3 degrees Celsius hotter due to warming caused by use of fossil fuels and deforestation — compared to a cooler, pre-industrial climate (1850-1900).
“When we combine the evidence, we do find an overall increasing trend in such extremes,” Clarke said. “Similar events have become, we estimate, about 40% more likely, or, equivalently, about 9% more intense.”
Clarke noted that some climate models used in the study showed a more “mixed picture” of the effects of warmer temperatures, meaning the study’s results are “likely a conservative estimate.”
While the methods used in this study are peer-reviewed, the study itself was released in the immediate aftermath of the severe weather event and has not yet been peer-reviewed itself, Clarke said.
Early warnings likely saved lives, researchers say
Over four days in early April, eight states saw “relentless amounts of rain” ranging from six to 12 inches, with some locations exceeding 16 inches, Climate Central Weather and Climate Engagement Specialist Shel Winkley said.
The rain fell on soil that was already saturated from late-winter rain, particularly in the Ohio River Valley, he said. 
In Northwest Tennessee, the small town of Rives suffered severe flooding in February, only to flood again a few weeks later.

Winkley said a ridge of high pressure over the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida blocked the low pressure system producing the storm from pushing forward, essentially stalling the storm front to dump rainfall over the already-saturated ground.
Early warnings from the National Weather Service very likely saved lives, Bernadette Woods-Placky, Climate Central’s chief meteorologist, said.
In Obion County, Tennessee, more than 100 families evacuated their homes during the event. Nearby Dyer County issued a mandatory evacuation for residents of Bogota on April 7 in anticipation of additional flooding.
Woods-Placky noted that layoffs and firings were beginning to roll out in National Weather Service offices across the U.S. as part of cost-cutting measures under the Trump administration around the time these floods were happening.
“This is an example of how critical these employees are and why recent workforce cuts risk undermining their ability to keep people safe and prepared,” she said.
Winkley said post-storm analyses like this are vital for protecting public safety in future events.
“It helps us really understand, is this going to be a place that’s livable in the future, and if it is, how do we make sure that it’s livable and safe?” he said.
Study: ‘Generational’ storms could become more likely
The 96-hour rain event was the second-highest on record for the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie Rivers (all Mississippi River tributaries), according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Dyersburg, Tennessee — the county seat of Dyer County — is prone to flooding from the North Fork of the Forked Deer River. 
Early April’s flooding marked the third-highest flood in the town’s history, according to Mayor John Holden, who has held the position for 19 years.
The worst flood in Dyersburg’s history occurred in 2010, wiping out multiple homes and trailer parks. The second-highest flood record was set in 1937.

Historical data indicates downpours like this are “expected to occur, on average, about once a century in today’s climate with 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming,” the report states.
Before the storms rolled in, the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center warned the public of “generational” rainfall totals.
But the study’s authors caution that further warming could increase the likelihood that these events will no longer be expected just once in a generation.
“If warming reaches 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), which is expected by 2100 under current policies, four-day spells of rainfall are expected to become a further 7% more intense and twice as likely,” according to a study summary.
“This is a good moment to remember that we are a water planet, and a warmer atmosphere forces more evaporation, so our atmosphere in general has more water to come down whenever there’s a trigger, wherever there’s a trigger,” Woods-Placky said. “So that’s why we’re seeing an overall increase in heavy rain events, even to places that may not be getting wetter. The distribution of how they’re getting rain is coming in these heavier buckets.”
What does higher intensity mean?
Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas were hardest hit by the early April storms, and each state requested a major disaster declaration to access FEMA assistance.
Damage estimates for public property and recovery in West and Middle Tennessee exceed $26 million, according to post-storm assessments. State and local officials believe this will meet the eligibility threshold for federal public aid. Tennessee has yet to receive a decision from the Trump administration.
The administration approved a major disaster declaration for Kentucky on April 24. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders requested a major disaster declaration to cover the April storms on May 3. Trump denied Sanders’ earlier request for major disaster aid following storms and tornadoes in March.
West Tennessee picks up pieces, awaits FEMA decision after severe storms

The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency estimates around 300 homes and 14 businesses or nonprofits were severely damaged. West Tennessee mayors report hundreds of acres of flooded farmland.
To illustrate the significance of the storm’s 9% higher intensity that the study attributes to climate change, Imperial College London Centre for Environmental Policy Senior Climate Science Lecturer Friederike Otto refers to a separate study on Hurricane Helene.
That study, published by the Grantham Institute of Climate Change and the Environment in 2024, estimated that a roughly 11% increase in wind speed due to climate change accounted for about 44% of the storm’s damage in coastal Florida.
Essentially, Otto said, the increase in intensity by 10% could nearly double the cost of damage. 
“If that hits you (the region) once in a lifetime, I mean … that’s one thing,” Otto said. “But if that hits you twice, and it has the higher impact, that completely changes what … extreme weather can mean for a community.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Federal officials announced an ambitious plan Thursday to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system, acting after several recent deadly plane and helicopter crashes ignited public panic and made air safety a sudden priority for the Trump administration.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlined plans to replace decades-old technology, build new air traffic control centers and towers, and “supercharge” hiring to erase the current national shortage of more than 3,000 air traffic controllers.
Workers would replace radar, software, hardware, and telecommunications networks, with an eye on reducing outages, improving efficiency, and ensuring safety, Duffy said. The plan also aims to eliminate close calls on runways and in approach airspace by expanding a “surface awareness initiative” to 200 airports.
Duffy likened the current system to a flip-phone, saying it has antiquated telecommunications technology that relies on copper wire instead of fiber-optic cable and air traffic control centers dating back to the 1960s.
“You have to redo it all, simply put,” Duffy said. “We are going to build a brand-new air traffic control system. Full stop … this is the biggest lift, the biggest build that has ever happened in the history of the FAA.”
Duffy announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C., before an audience that included politicians, press, and people who lost loved ones when a plane and Army helicopter collided in January over the Potomac River near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
Sixty passengers, four crewmembers, and three soldiers died in that crash, and investigators revealed more than 15,000 “near-miss” incidents occurred near the airport in the previous four years.
President Donald Trump joined the announcement by phone, referring to ongoing delays and outages at Newark Liberty International Airport as “the flavor of the moment.”
On April 28, a radio and radar outage left air traffic controllers unable to track aircraft or communicate with pilots at Newark airport for 90 seconds.
“That was not a good situation,” Trump said Thursday. “I’m sorry what you’re going through with the terminals, but we’re going to get them fixed up.”
It’s unclear if the proposed improvements will ever happen, as Duffy and Trump had no cost estimate for the plan.
Pressed by reporters, Duffy said administration officials haven’t put a price tag on the plan, although he expects it will cost “billions. Lots of billions.”
“I’m going to leave that to the Congress,” Duffy said.
He added: “Congress has a lot of fights over money. This is one they should not fight over.”
Rep. Sam Graves, R-Missouri, said the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which he chairs, has approved a $12.5 billion “down payment” to get improvements rolling.

Trump said he hopes one company will get “one big, beautiful contract, where it’s, you know, they’re responsible for everything from digging ditches to the most sophisticated stuff. And if you have any ideas as to who makes the best system, we’d love to have it.”
Duffy called the plan a national priority and said it will require “permitting reform” so that whatever companies do the work can bypass regulations that would likely drag improvements out over 10 to 15 years or longer.
Administration officials instead aim to have the work done within three to four years, Duffy said.
The improvements are especially urgent as the skies become more crowded, Duffy added, citing recent upticks in air taxis and delivery drones.
A parade of CEOs from airlines and industry groups took the microphone after Duffy to applaud the plan as long overdue.
“The technology that we use to track our teenagers is more advanced than what we give to our air traffic controllers. That is literally insane. We need to fix that,” said Todd Hopley of the American Association of Airport Executives. “We need better technology. We need better facilities, and we need more controllers. It is as complicated as that and as simple as that. It’s something we can fix, it’s something we should fix, and it’s something we will fix.”
Joanna Geraghty, the CEO of New York-based Jet Blue, acknowledged the families of crash victims in the audience.
“It should not take a tragedy to solve this problem,” she said. “We know air traffic control delays and challenges far, far too well. This has quite literally been our number one priority for decades.”

Jared Polis speaks about a sweeping housing policy that was set to be introduced in the Legislature, in March 2023 at the state Capitol in Denver. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s 2025 legislative session, which ended Wednesday, was another mixed bag for those who want to make it easier to build more housing units and solve the state’s affordability crisis.
 
Connecting the news in Colorado to the big picture.

It’s been three years since Gov. Jared Polis embraced the YIMBY movement — short for “Yes In My Back Yard” — and made “More Housing Now” a signature goal of his second term.
Polis’ first big YIMBY priority was an audacious 2023 bill to reform land use policies and require higher-density development across the state, including by abolishing single-family zoning in Colorado’s most populous cities and towns. That proposal landed like a lead balloon in the state Legislature, where it was gradually watered down before being killed entirely in the final days of the 2023 session.
In the wake of the bill’s defeat, proponents have revived parts of it in piecemeal fashion, successfully passing bills last year to require higher-density housing near transit stops, legalize the construction of accessory dwelling units in most circumstances, and prohibit local minimum parking requirements. But resistance to YIMBY policies has remained strong. Skeptical lawmakers have stripped reform legislation of enforcement mechanisms, and local officials in several large Colorado municipalities have signaled they won’t comply with some of the new requirements.

The latest YIMBY disappointment came this week with the defeat of House Bill 25-1169, which would have overridden local zoning codes to presumptively allow faith-based organizations and educational institutions to build multifamily housing developments on their land. The bill, dubbed the “Yes In God’s Back Yard” measure, passed the state House of Representatives in March but stalled in the final days of the legislative session as its sponsors acknowledged it lacked enough votes in the Senate.
The YIGBY bill had a lot in common with other housing bills taken up by the General Assembly in the last few years. Its sponsors included two of the statehouse’s most progressive lawmakers in Sen. Julie Gonzales and Rep. Javier Mabrey, both Denver Democrats. It was backed by a long list of environmental, labor and social justice organizations. It passed the House over opposition from Republicans and a handful of moderate Democrats, and faced hurdles in the Senate, where the business lobby and a larger bloc of centrist lawmakers tend to exert their influence.
This has become a familiar pattern in Colorado politics. But it’s notably at odds with many of the presumptions of an intraparty debate currently flaring up among Democrats and left-leaning commentators at the national level, as they seek a path forward after a stinging defeat in the 2024 election.
A loose affiliation of pundits and politicians, critical of what they see as certain shortcomings of Democratic governance, have sought to articulate an alternative approach under the banner of “abundance.” The buzzword was the title of an October 2024 conference held in Washington, D.C., by influential centrist organizations like the Niskanen Center and the Breakthrough Institute, as well as a best-selling book this year by liberal authors Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson.
Abundance, in short, encompasses what Klein also calls “a liberalism that builds” — more housing to bring down rents and home prices, more industry to create jobs and protect supply chains, more clean energy and transit infrastructure to reduce climate pollution. This vision has resonated with some powerful Democrats: Klein was invited to be a guest at U.S. Senate Democrats’ annual retreat this week, Axios reported, and Polis himself has described his governing philosophy as an effort to bring the “abundance agenda” to Colorado.
Blame for the failure to build, in the abundance crowd’s telling, often falls on what Klein and like-minded pundits have taken to calling simply “the groups” — an epithet of sorts for labor unions, environmental nonprofits and other organizations on the Democratic Party’s progressive left wing. “The groups,” they say, have stood in the way of progress on key issues by saddling Democratic policy initiatives with unpopular ideological goals, or by erecting too many regulatory or procedural barriers via legislation and the courts.
But if three years of battles over housing policy at the Colorado statehouse have proved anything, it’s that “the groups” can be willing, enthusiastic members of the YIMBY coalition, and political obstacles to a drastic increase in housing supply are far more likely to be found on the right and center of the political spectrum than the left.
Beginning with the ambitious 2023 land use bill, virtually every YIMBY-endorsed housing proposal taken up by lawmakers lately has enjoyed the support of a loose network of climate and environmental advocacy groups that includes the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, Conservation Colorado, the Colorado Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, 350 Colorado and others. Other progressive groups focused on economic policy or social justice — 9to5 Colorado, the Bell Policy Center, the Colorado Fiscal Institute, the League of Women Voters, Servicios de la Raza, Together Colorado and many more — have also frequently lobbied for the bills, records show.
The most vocal and consistent opponent of these measures has been the Colorado Municipal League, the organization representing the governments of the state’s 271 cities and towns. In a few cases, influential business groups and local chambers of commerce have supported some of the changes, but in many others they have opposed, sought to amend or taken no position, according to lobbying records.
In floor and committee votes, Republican lawmakers have been nearly unanimously opposed to the most sweeping changes, while skepticism from Democratic moderates has repeatedly resulted in concessions, including the multiple exemptions granted to mountain towns like those represented by state Sen. Dylan Roberts and House Speaker Julie McCluskie.
Though a handful of exceptions and ideological cross-currents may exist, the broad political alignment on these issues could hardly be clearer. As Polis and other advocates for “More Housing Now” continue to pursue that goal, their allies and their opponents are easy to spot — and in Colorado, at least, the abundance crowd seems to have it exactly backwards.

But now, as the Legislature’s powerful budget committee is beginning to work on the budget in earnest, a low-profile plan that never came up in those public hearings aims to turn school vouchers into a statewide entitlement, sucking up all the resources that might otherwise go to public schools and putting Wisconsin on a path to a full–blown budget crisis. 
The plan, contained in two bills that failed in the last legislative session, would stop funding school vouchers through the same mix of state and local funding that supports regular public schools, and instead pay for school vouchers just out of the state’s general fund. 
“It’s certainly something that I personally support. … I’m sure it will be part of the discussion,” Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam), co-chair of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, told Lisa Pugh on Wisconsin Eye when she asked about “decoupling” Wisconsin voucher school funding from the rest of the school finance system.
“Decoupling” would pave the way for a big expansion in taxpayer subsidies for private school tuition. While jettisoning the caps on available funds and enrollment in the current school formula, voucher payments would become an entitlement. The state would be obligated to pay for every eligible student to attend private school. It’s worth noting that most participants in Wisconsin’s voucher programs never attended public school, so what we are talking about is setting up a massive private school system with separate funding alongside the public K-12 school system. That’s more than Wisconsin can afford.
Anne Chapman, research director for the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO), has followed the issue closely. “It could come up last-minute, on very short notice,” she warns. 
She worries that Wisconsin is following the same path as other states that have steadily expanded public funding for private schools without accurately assessing what the expansion would cost. In a recent WASBO paper, “The price of parallel systems,” Chapman writes that Wisconsin already ranks third among states with the highest proportion of state education dollars used in private schooling options (9%). The top two states, Florida (22%) and Arizona (12%), she writes, are “cautionary examples.” 
Florida’s universal voucher program will cost the state $3.9 billion this year. The state, which until now has been running budget surpluses, is projecting a $6.9 billion deficit by 2027-28, fueled by the voucher expansion along with tax cuts. Arizona is also facing much bigger than expected costs for its universal voucher program. After projecting it would cost $64 million in 2023-24, the state found that it underestimated the cost of vouchers by more than 650%. The real cost of universal vouchers in Arizona in 2023-24 was  $738 million. The result: a huge budget deficit and significant cuts to public schools.
Wisconsin, which launched the first school voucher program in the nation in Milwaukee 35 ago, has steadily increased both the size and per-pupil expenditures of its system of voucher schools. That’s despite a research consensus that school vouchers have not improved academic outcomes for students and, in fact, have done significant harm.
Testifying recently against a school voucher bill in Texas, University of Michigan professor and school voucher expert Josh Cowen described the “catastrophic” results of vouchers on educational outcomes across the country over the last decade.
‘Horrific’ voucher results
Cowen has been evaluating school vouchers since the 1990s, when the first pilot program in Milwaukee had a measurable, positive impact on the 400 low-income kids who used vouchers to attend traditional private schools. As school vouchers expanded to serve tens of thousands of students and “subprime” operators moved in to take advantage of taxpayer dollars, however, the results took a dramatic downturn. Cowen described the “horrific learning loss” he and other researchers have recorded over the last decade among kids who started in public school and then moved to private school using vouchers. He was used to seeing trends in education that simply didn’t work to improve outcomes, he told the Texas legislators, but “it’s very rare to see something that harmed kids academically.” The worst drops in test scores, he said, came in 2014-15 — the same year that states began taking the programs statewide. He concluded that the smaller programs that had paid close attention to students and offered them a lot of support became something entirely different when vouchers were scaled up. Yet despite the abysmal results, more and more states are moving toward universal voucher systems.
Imagine, Cowen told the Texas legislators, if “30 years ago a vaccine showed some positive effects in clinical trials for a few hundred kids.” Then, when the vaccine was approved and used on thousands of children, “the health effects became negative, even atrocious.”
“No one would say, ‘let’s just hang our hat on the pilot and focus on results from 30 years ago,” Cowen said. But that’s exactly what’s happening with school vouchers. The kids vouchers were originally supposed to help — low-income children in underresourced schools — have suffered the most. 
Studies from research teams in Louisiana, Indiana, Ohio and Washington, D.C., show learning losses for kids who left public school to attend voucher programs that surpassed the learning loss experienced by students in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina or by children across the country from the COVID-19 pandemic, Cowen said.
Instead of helping those struggling students, who often attend the “subprime” schools Cowen discussed, the voucher programs in Wisconsin and other states mostly provide a taxpayer-financed benefit to private school families — 70% of whom have never put their kids in public school.
Anti-government ideologues and school choice lobbyists are selling a faulty product with the rapid expansion of school vouchers.
Part of the scam is the effort to hide the true costs from taxpayers. That’s the part Chapman, the school business expert, is worried about. As school districts struggle with lean budgets, under the current system, at least local taxpayers can see how much they are paying to support the voucher schools in their districts. If the Legislature succeeds in moving the cost of school vouchers into the general statewide budget, that transparency will be lost. And, at the same time, the state will open the door to unlimited spending on vouchers, no matter how expensive the program becomes. 
School choice advocates in Wisconsin have long pushed for “a voucher in every backpack” — or universal eligibility for the private school voucher program.
“Eligibility” doesn’t mean the same thing as “access,” however: In Wisconsin voucher schools have a track record of kicking out students who are disabled, challenging to educate, LGBTQ or for any other reason they deem them a bad fit.
Those students go back to the public schools, whose mission is to serve all students. In contrast, private schools in the voucher system can and do discriminate. Yet, Chapman reports, we are now spending about $629 million for Wisconsin’s four voucher programs, which serve 58,623 students. That’s $54 million more than the $574.8 million we are spending on all 126,830 students with disabilities in Wisconsin, as school districts struggle with the cost of special education. 
Federal tax deduction windfall for voucher schools
As if that weren’t enough, at the federal level, the Educational Choice for Children Act of 2025 (ECCA), currently being considered by Congress, would give a 100% tax deduction on donations to nonprofits known as Scholarship Granting Organizations, which give out private K-12 school vouchers.
Normally, donors to nonprofits can expect a tax deduction of 37 cents on the dollar at most. The 100% tax deduction means financial advisers across the country will push clients, whether they are school choice advocates or not, to give money to voucher schools. Under the bill, contributors would also be allowed to give corporate stock and avoid capital gains tax. “This would allow wealthy ‘donors’ to turn a profit, at taxpayer expense, by acting as middlemen in steering federal funding into private K-12 schools,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports. ITEP estimates that the ECCA would cost the federal government $134 billion in foregone revenue over the next 10 years and would cost states an additional $2.3 billion.
The very least we can do as citizens is to demand accountability and transparency in the state budget process, before we blow all of our money on tax breaks and tuition vouchers for people who don’t need them.

Yet from the beginning, this project has been shrouded in secrecy, half-truths, and outright lies. The supposed economic development we were promised comes at a devastating cost to public health and environmental safety.
The facts are now painfully clear. xAI’s facility is operating with 35 massive methane gas turbines, burning fossil fuels around the clock in the heart of a historically Black, working-class neighborhood already burdened with some of the highest rates of pollution-related illness in the country. These turbines are industrial behemoths, emitting dangerous levels of formaldehyde and nitrogen oxides, which are linked to severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. 
When confronted with concerns over the use of gas turbines, Young falsely stated that 15 turbines were active and that the others were simply stored on-site. But independent thermal imaging done by the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) proved otherwise: 33 turbines were fully operational, releasing pollutants into the air day and night. 
EPA tells South Memphis residents little recourse exists to deal with toxic emissions

This industrial-scale pollution is being generated mere miles from the homes of families who have already lived through decades of environmental neglect and systemic disinvestment. The facility’s location places it in dangerous proximity to the Memphis Sand Aquifer, one of the purest and most vital sources of drinking water in the nation. Our aquifer is already under threat from past industrial activities, and this project only increases the risk of irreversible damage.
At every stage of this process, city officials have treated public concern with contempt and evasion. Public hearings have been scheduled without meaningful outreach, key environmental reports have been kept hidden from public view, and straightforward questions from community members have been met with scripted talking points rather than honest dialogue. The message from City Hall is unmistakable: this project will move forward, no matter what it costs the people of Memphis.
This is an unmistakable act of environmental violence, targeting vulnerable communities that powerful interests believe are too poor, too Black, and too politically marginalized to resist. Southwest Memphis was not chosen by accident. It was chosen because city leaders and corporate executives believed that they could steamroll opposition without consequence.
But they have miscalculated. The people of Memphis are watching, and we are not fooled.
The fight against xAI’s project is about more than just turbines and permits. It’s about the soul of our city. It’s about whether Memphis will continue to allow powerful outsiders — like billionaire Musk — to treat its communities as expendable, or whether we will demand leadership that places the health, dignity and future of its residents above corporate profit.
Memphis deserves better. We deserve leaders who tell us the truth — not after independent investigations force their hand, but from the outset. We deserve a government that places the health of its people and the sanctity of our environment above empty claims of economic progress. We deserve development that empowers communities, uplifts neighborhoods, and protects the environment that sustains us.

City officials must continue to be pressed to disclose all communications, agreements, and impact assessments related to the xAI project. xAI must immediately cease operations until it obtains the proper permits, undergoes a full environmental impact review, and proves that it can operate without jeopardizing the health and safety of Memphians.
Moreover, future projects must not be negotiated behind closed doors with billionaires and developers. They must be driven by community needs, developed transparently, and subjected to rigorous scrutiny. They must center the voices of the people who will be most affected, not exclude them until the damage is already done.
Memphis’ resilience is not in question. But resilience should never be mistaken for consent to exploitation. It does not mean quietly accepting the degradation of our air, our water and our quality of life in exchange for vague promises of “technological innovation” that may never materialize or benefit the communities most at risk.
Memphis has endured too much to be treated as expendable yet again. We must continue to demand accountability, defend our environment and fight for the communities most impacted by these decisions. The future of Memphis must belong to its people — not to outside interests seeking profit at our expense.

Trump’s answer reflects, not ignorance of the solemnity of the oath that he took, but rather the authoritarianism that he is seeking to entrench in the United States, a governing approach that is embodied in a plebiscitary presidency.
The philosophical framework of a plebiscitary presidency toward which Trump is moving, represents the completion of Richard Nixon’s conception of government. The model is not that created by the Framers of the Constitution, nor is it a parliamentary regime.
Trump’s expression of doubt about the binding nature of the Constitution, and his duty to uphold it, cannot be dismissed by his indifference our constitutional system — separation of powers, checks and balances, enumeration of powers — but rather his disdain for it. 
Trump, as we have seen, has usurped fundamental congressional powers — lawmaking, appropriations and appointment, among others —and has unilaterally abolished statutory requirements, defied the U.S. Supreme Court’s order requiring adherence to the commands of due process and engaged in a calculated disparagement of the free press, universities and other bodies committed to free and independent thought. 
Trump has subdued GOP leadership in Congress and party faithful, at his beck and call, are loathe to resist his personality, temperament and judgment. He is in command of the economy, and he has concentrated in his hands, alone, power over foreign and domestic policymaking. At this historic juncture, Trump’s ambitions, moods and perceptions determine acceptable fare for his presidential agenda and the nation.  
Trump’s usurpations are met by stunning silence from members of Idaho’s congressional delegation — U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, as well as U.S. Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher — who refuse to defend the Constitution and their institutional powers. He betrays his oath of office while they betray theirs.  
Trump is engaged in an audacious reconstruction of the Constitution, one grounded in the premises of a plebiscitary presidency, which assumes that democracy is enhanced if the capacity to govern is vested in the White House, undeterred by constitutional restraints. In its glory, it speaks of the investment of the sovereignty of the nation in the chief executive and reflects contempt for the rule of law. As Trump told The Atlantic, “I run the country and the world.”
The plebiscitary presidency is intended,” as political scientist Theodore Lowi observed, “to evoke the powerful imagery of Roman emperors and French authoritarians who governed on the basis of popular adoration, with the masses giving their noisy consent to every course of action.”
Robert Michels’ classic, “Political Parties,” published in 1911, explained the rationale of the “personal dictatorship conferred by the people in accordance with constitutional rules.” By plebiscitary reasoning, “once elected the chosen of the people can no longer be opposed in any way. He personifies the majority and all resistance to his will is anti-democratic. He is, moreover, infallible, for ‘he who is elected by six million votes, carries out the will of the people; he does not betray them.’” 
Imagine how much stronger the president would be if elected by 30 million votes. If the opposition becomes annoying it is for the voters themselves, “we are assured, who demand from the chosen of the people that he should use severe repressive measures, should employ force, should concentrate all authority in his own hands.” The president, having aggrandized the powers of the legislature and judiciary, would become democracy personified.
Trump, it will be recalled, has spoken – repeatedly — in such grandiose terms. Daily, he reminds Americans of his victory in the 2024 presidential election, although baselessly claiming a “landside” victory, for the purpose of swelling his plebiscitary claims and aims. 
In his Meet the Press interview, he shrugged off constitutional limitations, by reiterating that he won the election — “they had their chance” — as if victory confers power beyond authority derived from the Constitution. Of course, the Constitution is the sole source of governmental authority and the president, until constitutional provisions are surrendered or trampled, has a solemn duty to uphold the Constitution.

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois state parks saw more visitors in 2024 than any point in the past 15 years, according to new data from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.

Illinois’ 290 state parks and 56 historic sites recorded more than 41 million visitors last year, which was the most in 15 years, following several significant capital projects to upgrade and improve many of the parks.

Interest in state parks has been growing since the pandemic, IDNR Director Natalie Phelps Finnie said in an interview.

“During COVID, people were stir crazy, shut in, and they once again realized how important nature is to all of us,” Phelps Finnie said.

An aggressive advertising campaign by the state has also helped, she said. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity launched the state’s “Middle of Everything” marketing campaign in 2022, which promotes tourism at the state’s top recreation and cultural attractions in TV commercials, billboards and online advertising.

Starved Rock State Park in LaSalle County topped the list in 2024 with 2.4 million visitors coming to explore the canyons and waterfalls nestled in gorges along the Illinois River in north-central Illinois.

The second-most visited park last year was Illinois Beach State Park, near Zion, with 2 million visitors. IDNR completed a major $73 million project last year to preserve the park from erosion.

“It’s always been a high number of visitors, but certainly the uptick we’ve seen since the beach was restored and since the resort is being invested in once again and remodeled,” Phelps Finnie said.

Beach State Park holds Illinois' only undeveloped stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline, but it’s subject to the ferocious waves of the lake. The conditions have sometimes eroded up to 100 feet of shoreline a year in parts of the park.

To preserve the park’s shoreline, IDNR’s project included building 22 breakwater structures in the lake to decrease the power of the waves hitting the shore. Several of the structures are entirely submerged while others that poke out the surface of the lake are designed to provide nesting for migratory birds.

The project also included extending the public beach further into Lake Michigan. Erosion had diminished the beach to come within feet of the parking lot and hotel at the park.

The state also announced earlier this year it will put $60 million toward deferred maintenance projects. More than half of that will go to Starved Rock for trail improvements, facility renovations and building a new wastewater system.

The department is also working on adding electric vehicle chargers at state parks and renovating the Old State Capitol in Springfield.

This summer, IDNR plans to restore and upgrade the Crenshaw House in Gallatin County to include a visitor center at a location on the reverse underground railroad, where slaves were held. According to IDNR, John Crenshaw used slaves at his southern Illinois home where he manufactured salt. Crenshaw is also believed to have kidnapped freed or escaped slaves to sell them back to slavery in the South.

“We’re excited that the investment is being made and these parks are getting the attention they deserve,” Phelps Finnie said.

Lincoln’s New Salem Historic Site in Peterburg, where the 16th president lived in his 20s, was the state’s most visited historic site last year with 360,000 visitors. The site is in line for funding to repair aging buildings.

IDNR announced in March it will invest $8 million to repair up to 23 replica log buildings at the site that depict how the village looked when Lincoln lived there in the 1830s.

""You have things fall into disrepair and then it dominoes,” Phelps Finnie said. “It builds. So what was once maybe $100 million or so is now a little over $1 billion worth of deferred maintenance” across IDNR’s properties.

Debate over that decision has probably overshadowed other efforts to replenish our coast.
Episode 5 of “The Light Switch” dives headfirst into the conflict with Illuminator reporter Elise Plunk, our Report for American corps member who’s focused on all things water related. She’s taken an up-close look at ongoing wetlands rebuilding and spent a lot of time looking into the science behind coastal restoration. We’ll talk about her recent reporting (see story links below).
 
For our “Swamp Spotlight” segment, Elise interview Tulane University professor Ehab Meselhe, one of the foremost authorities on coastal restoration. He weighs in on the stalled Mid-Barataria diversion, the science behind the project and other wetlands work.
In our “News From the States” segment, we learn about why Rhode Island leaders felt the need to revise their rules on harvesting road kill. Yes, we think that feels like a “very Louisiana” thing, too.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)In the 30 days after several damaging twisters hit Arkansas on March 14, the state saw nearly four times as many tornado warnings as Texas did.
The National Weather Service issued 144 warnings in Arkansas, compared to 39 in Texas from March 14 to April 14. Mississippi also recorded 144 warnings over the same period and Tennessee saw 125 warnings. Alabama noted 57 warnings. 
It’s an indication that the classic “Tornado Alley” region — the area from central Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, so named because of the number of tornadoes there — is shifting eastward.
The shift is attributed to climate change, the warming of the Gulf of Mexico’s waters and a dip in the cold jet stream pattern.
Arkansas, scientists say, is nearly in the bull’s eye of a new tornado-prone area that’s referred to as “Dixie Alley.”  The region, which has seen a vast increase in tornadoes over the past several years, also encompasses Mississippi, Alabama and western Tennessee.
Weather Service survey teams have already confirmed 35 tornadoes have touched down in Arkansas through April. The state averages 42 twisters per year.
The storms have also been larger.  Arkansas was hit with two EF-4 twisters on March 14 — one in Jackson County and one in Izard County
The last time a tornado of that strength hit the state was on April 27, 2014, when a tornado cut a 41-mile path of destruction through western Pulaski County, Mayflower and Vilonia in Faulkner County, and on into White County. Sixteen people died in that storm.
Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, conducted research about the shift, authoring a paper in 2018 that noted the change. Since then, he’s continued to monitor the trend and says the trend is ongoing.
“It’s still more prevalent in the southeast,” he said. “And we’re seeing more evidence of that each year.”
 ‘Drying up’

Gensini tracked tornado reports from 1979 to 2018 for his initial study, but also noted atmospheric conditions in the areas at the time that were favorable for the formation of tornadoes.
Gensini blames a combination of weather phenomenon for the increase in Arkansas’ tornadoes. A drought in the southwest is taking away needed moisture for the formation of twisters in the traditional Tornado Alley region.
More than 67% of Arizona is experiencing “extreme” and “exceptional” drought conditions — the two highest levels of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Drought Monitor is based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln and records weather conditions and patterns weekly.
Three months ago, only 17% of Arizona was under the same two drought conditions. A year ago, the state was considered free from extreme and exceptional drought.
New Mexico, Texas and Utah have also seen increases in drought in their respective states. Thirty percent of Texas is in “extreme” and “exceptional” drought, an increase from 14% three months ago.
“The most intense levels of drought now cover a broad area from southeastern California, southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah through much of Arizona, New Mexico and the Texas Big Bend, said Richard Tinker, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, and the author of the latest drought report.
“The southern Great Plains are drying up,” Gensini added.
 Faster rate of change

The dry atmospheric conditions in the southwest create a dome of high pressure over the western U.S., sapping energy from the atmosphere and forcing potential tornado-producing systems to move further east. The jet stream, a strong current of frigid Arctic air, is also dipping further south into the Mississippi delta region because of the Southwestern drought.
Water temperature in the Gulf has also increased on average by one or two degrees, creating the moist, humid air needed for tornadoes.
 “One or two degrees may not seem much. But think of the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees,” Gensini said, referring to the temperature when water freezes. “It’s early in the season, and the waters are warmer. That warm, humid air is heading into Arkansas where the air has been unstable already. It makes things more potent.
“We’re seeing weather pattern changes over the last 70 to 80 years that didn’t happen in 100,000 to 120,000 years before,” he said. “There is such a rapid rate of change, and it’s not lessening.”
Of the 144 warnings issued in Arkansas between March 14 and April 14, not all produced tornadoes, said Dennis Cavanaugh, the National Weather Service warning coordinator in North Little Rock.
In fact, the Weather Service strives to keep its “false alarm” rate of tornado warnings to less than 80%. Warnings are issued when Doppler weather radar picks up rotation in clouds, signature “inflow notches” that indicate the building of cyclonic air patterns, hail cores and other indicators.
The Weather Service also must balance the need to warn people while also not unnecessarily alarming them. Issue too many warnings that don’t produce tornadoes, and the public may become complacent and not heed future warnings as seriously.  John Robinson, a former Meteorologist in Charge at the North Little Rock station, used to say that more people were injured in tornadoes while gawking at clouds for confirmation of those tornadoes rather than seeking shelter when warnings were issued.
On the other side, if the Weather Service curtails its warnings and an unwarned tornado does form, results could be devastating.
“Radar can’t see tornadoes,” Cavanaugh said. “It can see circulation aloft when it’s likely a tornado is forming. If we wait to see the debris cloud from a tornado that’s on the ground to issue a warning, it’s much too late.”

 More hail

Cavanaugh said continued advances in technology should help the Weather Service lower its rate of false alarms. But the service will always rely on trained storm spotters who can see the lowering of wall clouds — a first step in the formation of tornadoes — and any circulation of clouds overhead.
“That’s really not applicable to this year,” he said of the fear that the scores of warnings issued may eventually be ignored. “I don’t think the average Arkansan thought he or she was not warned unnecessarily.”
During a round of storms one April evening, Ryan Vaughn, the meteorologist for KAIT8 in Jonesboro, was broadcasting live storm coverage. At one point, most of northeast Arkansas was placed under a myriad of tornado warnings.
Vaughn took a deep sigh on air. 
“I don’t think I’ve ever said this before, but if you’re anywhere in northeast Arkansas, take cover now,” he told viewers.
Tornadoes are formed by opposing winds at various levels. Strong winds in opposite directions cause a shear and a horizontal column of air circulating overhead. Warm, humid air feeds the twister and eventually the column of air begins tilting vertically and lowering to become a destructive tornado.
And if the increase in tornadoes in Arkansas and the Delta is not enough, Gensini said the ingredients for twister formation should also cause larger hail storms.
Hail is formed inside supercell thunderstorms. The rising air inside a building storm lofts raindrops into freezing air. It causes hail, which falls to the ground. Many times, a frozen raindrop falls in the size of a pea or gravel. But with more convection inside the stronger storms, that pea-sized bit of hail is lofted over and over again inside the system, growing larger as more water freezes on it.
That’s what causes the golf ball- and baseball-sized hail and are indicative of stronger storms and tornadoes.
Gensini is about to embark on a 40-day field study this summer of hail storms.
“Tornadoes get all the attention on the news because of the visual destruction,” he said. “You see a path of destruction with shattered homes. But hail is much worse overall.  It damages roofs, cars and agriculture in a much larger area.
“I think the south and southeast will see a lot more problems in the years coming,” he said.

Patrick Morrisey has signed lawmakers’ key foster care measure into law – an omnibus bill that folded together several pieces of legislation. It includes creating a team to review the death of a foster child that occurred while in state care.,"The West Virginia State Capitol (West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey has signed lawmakers’ key foster care measure into law – an omnibus bill that folded together several pieces of legislation. It includes creating a team to review the death of a foster child that occurred while in state care.
The Republican governor opted to veto other child welfare-related items, including a bill that would have provided pay raises for attorneys representing foster children. He also slashed lawmakers’ funding for a nonprofit that helps foster kids. 
Lawmakers came into the 60-day session saying they must address widespread issues in the state’s troubled foster care system that is serving more than 6,000 children with a shortage of social workers, support services and safe homes for children. Too many children have ended up living in hotel rooms, and the state spent $70 million last year sending foster kids to out-of-state group homes. And, for years, the state hasn’t wanted to answer questions about what’s happening to kids in the child welfare system.
While many of the proposed bills – including one mandating an outside review of the foster system – never made it up for a vote by deadline, lawmakers behind the successful foster care measure say it’s a step in the right direction. 
Foster care is a “glaring area of need in state government,” said Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, who is a foster parent. 
  Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason
“We made it clear that we are willing and committed to taking action … We’ve tried over the course of several years to identify areas that need attention and need work, and many of those areas got touched by [House Bill] 2880,” he continued. “There’s always work to be done, but when you look at the measure that we did get passed … I’m pleased with where we’re at.”
Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, called it the “most important bill of the session.”
  Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
“For all the praying we do in the Senate, these are the least among us. These are the most vulnerable people,” he said. “There was a lot of bipartisan work that went into this … It’s a really thoughtful bill. It’s going to help kids.”
But, more should have been done, he emphasized.
“This bill would hit like 20% of what we could have done during the session,” he said. “This is just a screaming issue for the little ones who have no lobbyists.”
During the Legislative Session, a federal judge dismissed a sweeping lawsuit brought by foster children against the state for alleged mistreatment in care. The judge said that the ongoing problems couldn’t be solved by the courts, and the “blame squarely lies with the West Virginia state government.”
 What’s included in the bill

The foster care measure nearly died in the final hours of session last month as Senate and House members struggled to come to an agreement on what it should contain. 
Woelfel told lawmakers in a conference committee hashing out the bill that they couldn’t let the session’s only foster care measure die. Lawmakers eventually agreed to remove a part of the bill that would have regulated in-state behavioral programs for children, and said they’d work on that part in a separate bill for next year.  
House Bill 2880 in its final form folds together several different foster care measures from this session, including mandating that parent resource navigators, who help parents who are seeking to reunify with their children, be included in key meetings about the child’s case. Parent resource navigators are established through the court system. 
West Virginia terminates parental rights at twice the rate of any other state. 
“It’s always about reunification with biological mom and dad, but they don’t always get a lot of resources through navigating the complex system,” explained Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, who sponsored the bill. Burkhammer is a foster parent. 
  Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis
The measure also created a Critical Incident Review Team that will review a fatality or near fatality of a child in the custody of the state Department of Human Services. The team must meet within 45 days of the fatality or near fatality to conduct the review and share a report with lawmakers and online. 
“I think probably the best part of the bill is the Critical Incident Review Team and being able to put an additional set of eyes on these fatalities and near fatalities,” Pinson said, adding the goal is to help prevent future incidents. “Being able to bring in additional resources to address our response to these very serious situations is demanded.”
The bill also included some new requirements for the state’s online Child Welfare Dashboard, including additional information about the state’s Child Protective Service workforce. 
Angelica Hightower, communications specialist for the Department of Human Services, said that the agency didn’t have any concerns with the bill. 
“We recognize the intent of this legislation to strengthen the delivery and oversight of services within our child welfare system and broader human services framework,” she wrote in an email. “As we move toward implementation, the department is committed to working collaboratively to ensure that the measures outlined in the bill are carried out effectively and in alignment with the needs of West Virginia’s children and families.”
Lawmakers also revised childhood immunization rules for foster families in a bundle of rules changes, Burkhammer said. Foster parents will no longer be required to provide the vaccination records of their biological children as an eligibility condition to open their home to a foster child. 
Both Burkhammer and Pinson said lawmakers’ failure to fix ongoing issues with the state’s voucher system, which provides money for their foster kids’ clothes and other items, was the biggest failure in foster care reform this session. 
The current voucher system limits spending to only certain stores and regularly results in foster parents and kinship caregivers spending their own money to pay for clothes, beds, car seats and more. 
“When parents are willing to step up and put themselves out there for foster children, we’ve got to make sure that as a state we can provide the resources that they need,” Pinson said.
 Morrisey vetoes pay raise for guardian ad litems amid shortage 

Morrisey vetoed House Bill 2351, sponsored by Burkhammer, which would have given public defenders and guardian ad litems a pay raise of an additional $10 per hour for in- and out-of-court work. 
The state has a shortage of guardian ad litems, which are required in child welfare cases and represent the best interests of the child. The shortfall has led to cases often lingering in the court system while children await permanency. 
In his veto message, Morrisey said he was “sympathetic to the intent of this bill” but noted that lawmakers had reduced his proposed funding amount for the Public Defender Services.
“I want West Virginia to be a national model for fiscal responsibility, and this bill fails to meet that objective,” Morrisey wrote. “The math does not add up. The Legislature did not fully fund this line item for the ensuing fiscal year, which necessitates the veto of this bill.”
Burkhammer emphasized that the shortage of guardian ad litems has led to “low quality of services.” 
“Ulimateily, the child’s best interest is not getting the attention it deserves,” he said.
Morrisey also cut 75% of lawmakers’ allocated funding to West Virginia’s Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a program that helps foster children in the court system, before signing the budget bill. 
In his veto message, the governor said the program relies on grants and could seek additional grant funding.  
Woelfel believes that despite the vetoes, Morrisey is committed to foster care reform. 
“I’m taking him at his word,” he said. “I think it has got to be a team effort.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/capitol.jpg,,,2025-05-09 06:00:38.136259

In[...]","The NIOSH Coal Worker’s Health Surveillance Program offered periodic black lung screenings at no cost to coal miners in the U.S. (NIOSH photo)
As the federal government moves forward with a “reorganization” that has left the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) largely unstaffed, attorneys for West Virginia coal miners are asking a federal judge to issue a preliminary injunction to keep the program running and grant miners a protection against developing dangerous black lung disease.
In a hearing Wednesday, attorneys for the coal miners argued that the shutdown of the CWHSP — which operates within the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health — means the government is not meeting its legal obligation to coal miners or others as the work the agency is statutorily required to do is no longer being performed.
Attorneys for the federal government argued that the closure of the CWHSP — as well as other departments within NIOSH — is temporary.
Workers were notified that they were to be on administrative leave on April 1. Last week, some were told to return to work. But this week they were once again moved back to leave and permanent terminations are slated to take place come June.
NIOSH as well as the services performed in it, attorneys for the government said, will eventually return in a reorganized form under the federal Department of Health and Human Services. As such, they contended that the lawsuit on behalf of coal miners was premature.
Those testifying during Wednesday’s hearing in front of U.S. District Judge Irene Berger included coal miners, epidemiologists from the CWHSP and supervisors from within NIOSH.
Coal miners could pay for savings if inspectors lose offices on DOGE list, advocates warn

No one, including the attorneys representing the federal government, provided details or a timeline for when the agency would resume the duties it is required by law to perform.
Laura Reynolds, a supervisor over the CWHSP, was asked if she was aware of any plans or discussions happening to transfer the agency’s services to DHHS.
Her response was one word: “No.”
Scott Laney, who worked as an epidemiologist at NIOSH, said the community of researchers and providers qualified to do the work done by those at the CWHSP is quite small. He hasn’t heard of anyone being asked to do it and has not been included in any plans to train others.
“There is nobody who does the surveillance and breadth of what we do at NIOSH [for black lung],” Laney said.
 Without plan to resume services, coal miners left exposed to dangerous dust

Meanwhile, coal miners who have been diagnosed with black lung — including Harry Wiley, a coal miner in Raleigh County who is the lead plaintiff on the class action suit — are in a dangerous position.
NIOSH plays a critical role in the Part 90 program, which allows workers diagnosed with black lung to transfer to a less dusty part of a mine without facing retribution or negative repercussions from a mine operator. Miners transferred under the rule have their pay, benefits and hours protected while being able to work in an area that is less likely to advance their black lung disease.
In order to qualify for Part 90, miners anywhere must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved.
But now there are no NIOSH workers. Laney said labs certified to test miners for black lung were instructed to stop in April since there was no one at the CWHSP to evaluate the results.
This leaves Wiley, who was diagnosed with black lung in November and who applied for a transfer under Part 90, without any options to protect himself from the dangerous disease advancing.
Trump calls for more coal as his administration delays new black lung protection for miners

And the disease will advance, said Noemi Hall, another NIOSH epidemiologist.
The best protection to stop the progression of black lung — which has no cure and few treatment options — is prevention and reducing any exposure to coal mine dust, Laney said.
“We know that this intervention [of transferring workers to less dusty areas] works from the science,” Laney said. “[It’s] very clear in the scientific research.”
Debbie Johnson, the black lung program director at Bluestone Health in Princeton, told the court she knows of at least four coal miners from her clinic who are depending on the CWHSP to resume services.
Two have already entered their applications for a Part 90 transfer and two others need their results evaluated and certified.
None have heard from NIOSH.
Anita Wolfe, who retired from NIOSH in 2020 but still worked for the agency on a contract basis, said the CWHSP could see more than 5,000 x-rays a year that need to be evaluated. That’s 5,000 workers who could be at risk of developing a complicated and severe form of black lung disease without intervention.
 Freeze on CWHSP occurs while silica dust rule under threat

While the federal government says its sorting out what a “reorganization” of NIOSH and the CWHSP will look like, it has also delayed the implementation of a federal labor rule that would have limited miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever.
That rule was meant to go into effect in April. It’s been delayed until August, however, partially due to the shakeups at NIOSH and the critical role workers there would have played in its implementation.
Sam Petsonk, a labor attorney representing the miners in their lawsuit against the federal government, said in an interview after Wednesday’s hearing that without the silica rule and without Part 90 transfers, miners are left with little to nothing to protect themselves.
“West Virginia coal miners fought to create these programs because workers here walked off the job, picketed and demanded protections for themselves and miners throughout the world,” Petsonk said. “This whole program was created to protect our miners. And now the government isn’t doing its part.”
Meanwhile, more than just the response actions NIOSH is mandated to perform are going undone. The agency was also responsible for critical research to aid in identifying and preventing black lung in miners.
That’s especially important today in central Appalachia, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of the region’s coal miners are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
“We’re seeing a lot of younger miners who are at that point [of needing a Part 90 transfer],” Johnson told the court Wednesday.
Before being told not to come to work in April, Hall was researching cases of black lung where individuals did not show symptoms but were developing the disease. Hall hoped that research could go toward working with miners to get tested early and frequently throughout their careers in order to stop symptoms from onsetting.
Now, she said, that work has been dropped and she doesn’t expect it to pick back up again.
While on the stand Wednesday, both Hall and Laney were asked two questions by Mike Becher, an attorney from Appalachian Mountain Advocates who is representing the coal miners.
“Do you feel through your work you’ve made a difference in the lives of coal miners?” Becher asked.
“I know that to be the case because of the scientific evidence,” Laney responded.
“Yes,” said Hall.
“Do you feel you’ve saved miners’ lives?” Becher asked.
“I do,” Laney said.
“Yes,” responded Hall.
The class action lawsuit against the federal government was filed on behalf of miners by Appalachian Mountain Advocates, Mountain State Justice and Petsonk PLLC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of West Virginia on April 21, 2025.
On Wednesday, Judge Berger said she would have a response to the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction to order NIOSH to resume its work “soon.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The House voted under the hammer to advance an emergency measure (LD 1948) that would make the funding in the two-year budget for MaineCare available more immediately (more on that here). The body first voted 69-63 to suspend the rules to bypass the committee process, which will also require Senate approval. Also, for an emergency to pass, it will ultimately require support of two-thirds of both chambers. There will be more on that to come.
Other votes of note: 
Both chambers passed a bill (LD 814) under the hammer that would provide $9.75 million for the next two fiscal years to fund area agencies on aging for community-based services and programs.
Senators voted 22-11 and the House 106-32 to reject legislation (LD 512) that would allow a student whose parent lives in a district with a secondary school with 200 or fewer students to enroll in another school. Sponsor Rep. Stacey Guerin (R-Penobscot) said it would ensure all students, particularly those in more rural areas, have access to educational opportunities. However, Education Committee chair Sen. Joe Rafferty (D-York) said only 17 secondary schools would meet this criteria and said high schools already have a variety of local partnerships, including early college programs, to expand opportunities for students. He argued this approach would destabilize local school districts with the potential loss of funding.
Legislators also rejected (18-15 in the Senate; 74-66 in the House) an emergency proposal (LD 389) from Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) to establish a COVID-19 review commission to evaluate the state’s response to the pandemic. Stewart said he was disappointed the bill fell along party lines and argued it would increase transparency and future preparedness. However, Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) said while on the surface it’s a good idea, he noted the make-up of the commission would be legislators, not public health experts, and said in other states where such studies occurred they devolved into “political theater.” He said a better avenue is a directive to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a multi-departmental evaluation. 
Both chambers passed without roll call votes emergency legislation (LD 1061) to provide ongoing annual General Fund appropriations of about $1.6 million to the DHHS to provide community support for families and child abuse prevention services statewide.
The Senate voted 21-12 and the House 73-65 for LD 783, which would provide ongoing funds of $190,000 each fiscal year to the Maine Multicultural Center in Bangor for one or more positions to establish a comprehensive program for foreign-trained workers. During the House debate, proponents characterized the measure as a workforce bill. However, Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) said allocating this funding while neglecting the needs of our “longtime residents” could send the wrong message. 
After passing the Senate under the hammer, the House voted 103-36 to enact LD 461, which would provide funding to the Department of Public Safety for four Maine State Trooper positions to patrol Washington County. While some lawmakers argued the bill was not necessary, given the passage of another bill (LD 477) to add 15 new state trooper positions, others said there is particular need in Washington County. House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) said as a border county, increasing patrol is not only vital to the protection of the county but it would help stop the spread of drugs into the state.
After failing to pass the House, senators voted 18-15 to reject a bill (LD 513) that would allow the spouse of a school board member to serve as a stipend employee within the school board’s jurisdiction.
Both chambers voted under the hammer to back (LD 224), which updates the definition of “terrorism” in the laws governing the Maine Emergency Management Agency to include acts against non-physical infrastructure, including information and telecommunications technology infrastructure, systems or services or critical infrastructure.
Both chambers rejected a bill (LD 1401) to repeal the laws requiring motor vehicle liability coverage for the towing and storage charges incurred as a result of an accident if the vehicle is towed at the request of a law enforcement officer. Supporters of the bill took issue with how the law requires people to buy towing insurance but Rep. Kristi Mathieson (D-Kittery) argued the law is new and the Legislature should wait for more data before repealing it.
More than two-thirds of both chambers backed an emergency provision (LD 489) that provides that the holder of a commercial halibut fishing license may only fish using the vessel named on the license unless the license holder requests authorization from the Commissioner of Marine Resources to use another vessel when theirs is temporarily inoperable.
The House and Senate are at odds over legislation (LD 792) to provide one-time funding of $300,000 to the Christine B. Foundation to support a research project to evaluate the impact of access to specific dietary services on cancer patients. The House backed the committee recommendation against the bill but after several senators argued in favor of the program, they voted for the bill’s passage. The legislation will now go back to the House to reconsider.
Some of the other bills that passed both chambers under the hammer: 

“An Act to Ensure Rent-to-own Protections Apply to Mobile Home Park Tenants” (LD 1183)
“An Act to Enhance Protections Regarding Invasive Aquatic Plant Infestations in Inland Waters of the State” (LD 171)
“Resolve, Establishing the Commission to Study Unregulated Storm Water Pollution (EMERGENCY)” (LD 646)

“An Act to Amend the Motor Vehicle Laws”(LD 850)
“An Act Regarding the Confidentiality of Certain Lottery Winner Identities” (LD 404)
“An Act to Employ Mental Health Personnel Within the Maine State Police” (LD 298)

Senate action
The Senate passed without a roll call an amended bill (LD 795) that would establish a waiver process from the permit requirements for the use of explosives in recreational or hobby mining activities.
The chamber also unanimously backed legislation (LD 693) to establish three office specialist positions in the Department of the Secretary of State’s bureau of corporations, elections and commissions.
These are some of the other bills the Senate passed under the hammer this week:

“An Act Regarding Confidential Information Gathered for Forest Fire Emergency Response and Planning” (LD 379)
“Resolve, to Establish the Committee to Study the Use of Sunflower Crops to Produce Biofuels” (LD 1297)
“An Act Regarding School Enrollment for Military-connected Students” (LD 31)

“An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Fantasy Contests” (LD 33)
“An Act to Include Judicial Marshals in the 1998 Special Plan for Retirement” (LD 794)

House action
Members of the Maine House voted 76-64 to reject a bill (LD 187) that would prohibit public sector labor unions from imposing mandatory service fees on nonmembers, otherwise known as a “right to work bill.” During debate, supporters said the legislation would put Maine in compliance with a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Opponents of the bill, including Labor Committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), argued the bill is an effort to roll back labor rights.
The House voted 72-68 to pass LD 86, which would update several education laws, including the definition of “homeless student” to match the federal definition and update statutes regarding private schools’ receipt of public funds to reflect the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Carson v. Makin.
House members voted 73-67 to reject legislation (LD 174) that would reinstate nonmedical exemptions for school-required vaccines, six years after that provision was repealed. During the floor debate, Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) argued that current law requires families to choose between their religious beliefs and an education. However, Rep. Sam Zager (D-Portland), a family physician, argued the law and vaccines in general have helped save children’s lives in “incredible numbers.” A similar bill (LD 727) was killed under the hammer. More on both bills here.
House lawmakers voted 74-67 to back the committee recommendation against LD 189, which would eliminate the requirement for health care facilities to obtain a certificate of need for the provision of mental health and substance use disorder services. Proponents argued this would increase access to much-needed services. Rep. Kristi Mathieson (D-Kittery) said it wouldn’t have an impact on community-based services but would rather pave the way for national for profit hospitals to enter Maine’s market and destabilize our already fragile system. A similar bill (LD 743) was killed under the hammer. (You can read about a similar proposal last session.)
Here are some bills that passed the House under the hammer: 

“An Act to Establish the November General Election Day as a School Holiday Applicable Only to Public School Buildings Used as Voting Places” (LD 53)
“An Act Requiring the State to Pay a Retired State Employee’s or Retired Teacher’s Premium for Medicare Part B Under Medicare Advantage” (LD 328)
“An Act to Raise the Cap on Retirement Benefits for Certain State Employees and Teachers to Which a Cost-of-living Adjustment Is Made” (LD 1040)

Appropriations 
Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

“An Act to Appropriate Funds to the Department of Environmental Protection, Lake Water Quality Restoration and Protection Fund” (LD 296)
“An Act to Provide Funding for Low-income Electric Ratepayer Assistance” (LD 995)
“An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault Services” (LD 117)

Kim Hammer, R-Benton, that would change the citizen-led ballot initiative process Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025, at the Arkansas Capitol. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Over the course of the recently concluded session of the Arkansas Legislature, the media have reported in bits and pieces on various measures passed by lawmakers that infringe on Arkansans’ rights, target marginalized groups, erode the wall of separation between church and state, limit free speech and squash democratic participation, usually with the stated purpose of solving “problems” that only exist in the minds of Republican legislators.
But if we stop and take a moment to look back on their collective handiwork over the last five months, the destructive scope of these pernicious laws — and the expensive litigation they’re likely to trigger — becomes breathtakingly clear.
Elementary school librarians face possible suspension of their teaching licenses if they don’t lock away books about “sexual ideology,” which is not defined but will almost certainly be aimed at books with LGBTQ themes. Schools will be left to figure out how to comply.
Doctors who provide gender-affirming care to transgender patients could open themselves up to malpractice suits unless they read their patients a lengthy screed about their care that contains information that’s untrue, misleading, or merely misguided opinion sprung from the fevered imagination of Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, who has made targeting transgender Arkansans her pet cause.
The process for collecting signatures for ballot initiatives will now be so cumbersome, convoluted and arduous that direct democracy — a cherished constitutional guarantee in a state whose motto is “The People Rule” — could be a dead letter for grassroots groups without deep pockets.
Voters who choose to vote by absentee ballot because they find it more convenient will now have to find a witness to sign their ballot paperwork, impacting minority, disabled and elderly voters in a state that already has tragically high rates of ballot rejection — but almost no voter fraud.
Schools and public buildings will have to display a mostly Protestant version of the 10 Commandments, a practice the U.S. Supreme Court forbade 45 years ago. And discrimination against LGBTQ people will be protected by state law if done on religious grounds, including refusing to place kids in adoptive homes with LGBTQ parents.
The state plans to start suffocating death row inmates with nitrogen gas, an experimental execution method that’s cruel and unusual, and will trigger years of litigation. And noncitizens without legal documentation who commit crimes will face harsher criminal penalties than citizens, up to 20 more years in prison with no chance for parole. Never mind that, like U.S. citizens, noncitizens are protected by the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.
As you might expect, this tsunami of ill-conceived nonsense is keeping folks at the Arkansas ACLU busy — sorting through which of these new laws are likely to cause the most immediate harm, working with prospective clients, and preparing litigation to counter unwise and unconstitutional laws that state taxpayers will pay to defend.
“Some people ask us what we do to relax and refresh at the end of the session, and I say, ‘File lawsuits,’” jokes Holly Dickson, the ACLU’s executive director, who likens dealing with legislators on civil liberties issues to “trying to do ballet across quicksand.”
Dickson would not comment on when, or over what, the ACLU might sue, other than to say that “we’ll announce any litigation when it’s filed.” But the Arkansas League of Women Voters has already filed a federal lawsuit to strike down the new restrictions on citizen-led ballot initiatives, calling them an unconstitutional restraint on core political speech.
Some of the baloney Arkansas legislators offered up to feed their base this year may have limited effect because it’s impractical, illogical or will be quickly laughed out of federal court.
For instance, even a cursory reading of the 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision Stone vs. Graham that forbade posting of the 10 Commandments in public schools — or the scathing decision by a federal judge in Louisiana last November invalidating a similar 10 Commandments law — would have shown legislators that this bill would lead directly to a spanking in federal court. Yet, all but two Republican legislators plunged ahead, because, as Dickson puts it,  “they know that voting against the 10 Commandments is going to affect their reelection.”
Likewise, the law that prevents the state from taking action against employers who discriminate against transgender people for religious reasons runs straight into a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision — penned by that well-known radical leftist Justice Neil Gorsuch — that the Civil Rights Act precludes employment discrimination based on gender identity.
Another new law allowing people to sue if they — gasp — encounter transgender people in a restroom or changing area in a public facility may be difficult to use because, thankfully, legislators didn’t authorize the genitalia inspections necessary to establish someone’s gender identity in a court of law.
The law expanding malpractice suits against doctors providing gender-affirming care was clearly designed to intimidate them into not treating their patients. Rather than forcing them to give their patients inaccurate information — problematic on First Amendment grounds — it merely entices them to do so by providing a “safe harbor” against lawsuits if they comply.
But Arkansas doctors who provide this care have largely stood up to that pressure by ignoring the “safe harbor” provision in a similar law passed in 2023 targeting gender transition. 
“The game of chicken doesn’t really play well with people who aren’t chicken,” Dickson said.
Unfortunately, legal challenges take time, and some of these ineffectual laws may be hard to challenge because until someone can demonstrate actual harm, it could be difficult to get cases into court.
In addition, so-called facial constitutional challenges, which seek to block laws before they go into effect, also have a high bar — made higher by the Arkansas Supreme Court’s recent supineness in standing up to legislative excess as well as a new law that takes original jurisdiction in these cases away from judges in Pulaski County Circuit Court, who have been willing to say no to legislators.
Perhaps the most disheartening thing about all of this is how unnecessary it is. None of this sound and fury does anything to make the day-to-day lives of ordinary Arkansans easier or better; indeed, it wastes money on litigation that could be better spent on things that would.
And what we’ve seen over the past five months also plays fast and loose with the oath every legislator took when they were sworn into office: “I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Arkansas, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of upon which I am now about to enter.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/protesters-2.11.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 06:00:38.136259

Expanding the powers and size of the state auditor’s office. Allowing the concealed carry of a handgun without a permit.
These are just a handful of the hundreds of bills under consideration by North Carolina lawmakers this session. This week provided a key checkpoint for which of them have momentum, and which are doomed to stall out.
Thursday marked the General Assembly’s “crossover” deadline — the day by which a bill has to have been passed by either the House or Senate. If it hasn’t, it’s considered dead for the remainder of the legislative biennium — through 2026.
Crossover is far from definitive, though. Budget and tax bills don’t have to meet the deadline. And lawmakers have ways of getting around the deadline — like gutting and replacing an eligible bill with a new policy, or stuffing policy proposals into the state budget.
“Nothing is ever dead around here,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters Wednesday evening after the chamber’s final pre-crossover votes.
Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers, have almost always prioritized their own members’ bills. It’s resulted in frustrations for Democrats, particularly in the Senate, where the party leader says they’ve had almost no input.
“It’s supposed to be lauded that this is the higher chamber,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) told reporters Wednesday. “But I feel like we act like we’re at the kids’ table half the time, in middle school, where you don’t want to invite individuals who have equal representation in their districts to the table.”
Both the House and the Senate will likely begin taking up bills from the other chamber in the coming weeks. Lawmakers in the House are also expected to begin active debate and negotiations on the state budget, a version of which has already passed the Senate.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Every meeting of a public board in North Dakota will be required to hold a public comment period during each of its meetings beginning Aug. 1.
Senate Bill 2180, signed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong on April 30, requires local subdivisions, school districts, park districts and water resource boards to give meeting attendees the opportunity to make public comments to the board during their meetings.
The bill states public boards may only limit the comment period based on total time of the comments, the time of each individual speaker to deliver their comments, or both. It would also limit the public comment topics to the current meeting’s agenda items or the preceding meeting’s agenda.
Sen. Jose Castaneda, R-Minot, chair of the bill’s conference committee, said the law sets the minimum standard and boards can choose to be less restrictive on public comments.
North Dakota lawmakers approve needs, some wants with $20.3 billion budget

Castaneda told lawmakers that if someone misses a meeting, they should be able to go to the next meeting and have their concerns be heard by that board.
The bill stems from concerns that public entities were not providing adequate public comment periods during meetings and were limiting comments to only items on the board’s current meeting agenda.
Karen Krenz of Williston, who submitted testimony for the bill, said her local school board was limiting comments that could be made at meetings.
“As taxpayers, we should have the opportunity to contribute our input during public meetings,” Krenz wrote. “When public input is limited, decisions may not fully reflect the needs and priorities of the community, leading to policies that are out of touch with public sentiment.”
The law requires boards to craft public comment policies. The policies may require that comments need to be pertinent to the entity receiving the public comments and may “not interfere with the orderly conduct” of the meeting. Comments may not be “defamatory, abusive, harassing or unlawful,” and may not include confidential information.

Castaneda said the goal of the legislation was to find a good balance between giving time for people to address these public entities and not letting the comments hijack the meeting.
Sen. Chuck Walen, R-New Town, a previous school board member, said limiting the comments to the current and preceding meeting was a good balance, otherwise, “you can get into the weeds really, really fast.”
“I see this as a good compromise to have in here,” Walen said.
Previous versions of the bill would have limited comments to only the current agenda items of the public board meeting and would have required a public comment period be offered at only some of the meetings, or once every three months.

Relying on public records and more than two dozen interviews with officials and experts, CPR produced one of the most illuminating examples of Colorado journalism on the biggest news story of the era. The coverage had no agenda but the truth, and it enriched all Coloradans’ understanding of how public officials at the top of state government handled their responsibilities.
Such accountability reporting has always posed a threat to tyrants, including the tyrants in power today.
President Donald Trump is trying to undermine National Public Radio — of which CPR is a member station — and the Public Broadcasting Service, falsely accusing them of bias. His real objection is that accurate, independent journalism exposes him to scrutiny.
Like all of the Trump administration’s assaults on institutions — in education, science, health, public welfare — the ultimate victim of his attacks on public media is the public. But, at least in this case, a direct form of resistance is readily available to anyone who values the threatened institutions.

Public media is grounded in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit established in 1967 by Congress. Lawmakers at the time thought public media “furthers the general welfare” and should “be responsive to the interest of people both in particular localities and throughout the United States.” The act that created the CPB envisioned TV and radio programs that “address national concerns and solve local problems through community programs and outreach programs.” 
Anticipating political hostility to independent programming, the act was careful to ensure that public media has “protection from extraneous interference and control.”
In 1969, CPB established PBS, which delivers beloved educational, news, cultural and family programming with member stations around the country. Rocky Mountain PBS, based in Denver, is the only statewide television network in Colorado.
The following year, NPR was incorporated. The nonprofit and its local member stations reach more than 95% of Americans. The stations provide invaluable, impartial journalism, and they broadcast emergency alerts and public safety information during disasters. The NPR news programs “Morning Edition” and “All Things Considered,” both carried by Colorado member stations like CPR, are irreplaceable components of many Americans’ daily routines.
These public media sources, which are free for all Americans, have a long public-approving, award-winning tradition of fulfilling the vision Congress articulated for public media almost six decades ago. But Trump has actualized the initial fear that public media would be threatened by interference. On May 1, he issued an executive order calling for CPB funding for NPR and PBS to be canceled.
Loss of federal funding would hurt local stations most. NPR member stations — such as KUNC in Greeley and KRCC in Colorado Springs — typically rely more on direct federal funding than does NPR. CPR gets about 5% of its annual funding from the federal government, while NPR gets about 1%. Direct federal money comprises up to 10% of the budget of some local stations.
“The reality of a loss of federal funding would be to weaken or shutter locally owned independent stations particularly in remote and rural communities,” CPR said in a recent statement.
In case 5% doesn’t sound like a lot, it amounts to about $1.4 million, a loss that CPR, an outlet that laid off 15 staffers just last year, would surely struggle to absorb without a noticeable decline. And the threat runs deep. Public media stations use pooled assets such as satellite networks and emergency alert systems, which could be compromised for CPR and other local stations that benefit from them. Also, NPR gets most of its funding from member stations like CPR, so a loss of direct federal funding for local stations could in turn mean a substantial loss of indirect federal funding for NPR. 
CPR and Rocky Mountain PBS get most of their funding from individual, business and foundation contributions. This suggests an answer to a tyrant’s attacks. There’s little that individuals can do to counter, say, Trump’s efforts to shut down the U.S. Education Department. But individual community members who value trusted institutions like CPR and Rocky Mountain PBS can act as a form of immediate, grassroots countermeasure to MAGA hostility.
That support promotes the general welfare, as Congress intended. CPR is the only outlet in Colorado with a Washington, D.C.-based reporter focused on Colorado issues. For almost 20 years, Colorado governors have regularly sat down with CPR for interviews, which often present insights about state policy that are not available anywhere else. Through voter guides, state Legislature coverage and other useful nonpartisan reporting, the outlet consistently elevates the community life of the state, adhering to the highest professional standards and exemplifying the essence of the First Amendment.
This is what Trump wants Americans to believe is harmful to the country. But a weakened public media in the state would mean a weakened Colorado.

(Photo by Mechelle Hankerson/ Virginia Mercury)Virginia teachers are still flying blind months into a new school year — trying to adapt to overhauled history standards without the full set of instructional guides the state promised to help them navigate the change.
Since early April, the Virginia Department of Education has continued to publish its history instructional guides to help ​​prepare teachers to instruct students in the state’s updated history and social studies standards.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said at the Board of Education’s March meeting that part of the delay stemmed from staff adding web links to primary and secondary sources in the guides. Since then, the agency has been releasing instructional guides for its history and social science courses on a weekly basis.
The department says the instructional guides provide educators with directions for implementing the recently adopted 2023 History and Social Science Standards of Learning, which replace the 2015 version.
Danyael Graham, president of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, said teachers have already begun lesson planning and receiving training on the 2023 standards. Educators have also been required to start integrating the standards into their instruction. However, Graham said, it has been difficult to build effective lessons without the necessary guides that clarify what teachers need to know — particularly in preparation for state assessments.
She explained that the 2015 standards, along with their accompanying curriculum framework, provided detailed expectations for what students were supposed to learn. In contrast, the 2023 standards do not include a curriculum framework and instead rely on instructional guides, which teachers are still waiting on to fully adjust their lessons.
As a result, Graham noted that teachers will likely spend unplanned time over summer break or in August reviewing the complex documents and modifying their lesson plans.
“They’re unsure what resources to turn to,” Graham said, “And while it’s great that (VDOE) is putting these links in here (and) is going to be supportive for teachers, it’s very late.”
Graham also worries the delay will also negatively affect elementary teachers who are already juggling other state curriculum changes in math and literacy.
Publishing the documents “earlier” would have been ideal, she said. However, “I at least do appreciate that they’re sticking to their timeline.”
In the meantime, Graham said the consortium is gradually releasing its own document to help teachers craft lesson plans and connect the instructional guides. She said the organization believes it’s important to support educators of all experience levels by offering teacher-facing lessons — educational content and activities designed to enhance their instruction during a time of major transition. 
“We know they’re overwhelmed, we know they’re burnt out, or we know they’re entirely new to the field and need direction,” Graham said. “So we thought that by building out these inquiry-based tasks, we’re providing them with some high-quality instructional materials that they can then use and plug into their classes.” 
In March, Gullickson took over the department after former Superintendent Lisa Coons resigned amid growing pressure from teachers and educational organizations calling for the release of the instructional guides.
Since then, the agency has kept to its rollout schedule. It plans to complete the release of the final four instructional guides over the next two weeks. These remaining courses include Grade 2, Grade 4 Virginia Studies, Grade 10 World History and Geography: 1500 to the Present and Grade 11 Virginia and United States History.

Glenn Youngkin signed it along with several other measures he initially tried to amend.
Youngkin carves out $900 million as Virginia prepares for Trump-era uncertainty

House Bill 1609 by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, will require the Health Insurance Reform Commission (HIRC) to consider coverage for diagnosis and treatment of infertility and procedures like IVF in its 2025 review of essential health benefits covered by health insurance.
“The timing is actually really critical in that HIRC is about to do the essential health benefits plan,” Helmer said, adding that now the state will “have to look seriously” at whether to include infertility care in the health insurance coverage it offers Virginians. 
When the legislature concluded the bulk of its work this past February, Youngkin then reviewed the bills that passed and weighed whether to sign, veto or seek amendments on them. Before signing Helmer’s bill, he tried to tweak it by including a provision for nongovernmental health insurance plan sponsors to opt out of potential coverage requirements for religious or ethical purposes. The legislature rejected this idea, punting it back to Youngkin, who recently approved it in its original form.
In his signature explanation, Youngkin called Helmer’s bill a “balanced approach” to expanding fertility care in the state because it didn’t outright mandate immediate coverage for the treatment. 
Calling it an “interim step,” Youngkin commended the bill and said HIRC’s review of how infertility care coverage could be implemented can “ensure the General Assembly has the data, analysis and necessary input to make an informed decision in the future.” 
Like his previous attempt to amend Helmer’s bill, Youngkin added that he believes it’s “essential” for his exemption idea to be taken up if Virginia does eventually cover fertility treatments like IVF. 
“The conscience clause that my amendment would have added is critical to ensure the expansion of fertility care does not come at the cost of religious liberty,” Youngkin said. 
While some states have passed laws to protect IVF access, members of Congress have sparred over the issue and failed to agree on federal protections. The reproductive healthcare treatment, which was less controversial in past years, has come under scrutiny after Alabama’s state supreme court ruled last year that embryos are people — prompting fertility clinics to suspend the procedure for risk of lawsuits. The state recently passed a law to protect IVF in the state, though questions remain about future challenges. 
Virginia-born Elizabeth Carr, the first person born of the procedure in the U.S., has emphasized that IVF is not “just (to treat) infertility.” 
“There are implications for if you need a surrogate, if you are a same-sex couple, if you want to screen for a genetic disease,” she told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in 2024. “Or, if you are going through cancer treatment and want to preserve your eggs so that after you’re done and you want to conceive, you can use IVF.” 
The use of IVF after a cancer diagnosis hit close to home for Helmer, whose close family member had to leave Virginia because health insurance didn’t cover the treatments in the state. For the past several years, he’s carried some version of House Bill 1609 to bring the state closer to realizing coverage. 
“Nobody should face the choice of having to leave to start a family. I’m grateful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were able to unite” on the measure, Helmer said. “I think the signing of this bill should give a lot of hope to a lot of people that we are going to be there for them, and this is exactly the kind of legislating that we should be doing.”

Despite progress, there is more work to be done. (Photo by Evgeniia Siiankovskaia/Getty)It’s Children’s Mental Health Awareness Week, and we are encouraged to see some positive trends continuing as the pandemic fades into the past.
Back in 2021, the national percentage of high schoolers feeling sad and hopeless rose to 42%, a peak after several years of worsening scores. Since then, here in Rhode Island, key internal indicators we track at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island have been moving steadily in the right direction for members ages 18 and under. 
From 2021 to 2024, we have seen year-over-year improvements for both inpatient admissions (down 25%) and for emergency department visits (down 13%). 
For those of us working in mental health, the pandemic exposed a problem we had seen growing for years and prompted the U.S. surgeon general to issue an advisory calling on the nation to “step up for children.” Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island had already recognized we had an important role to play. In 2018, we eliminated many prior authorization requirements for mental health services to improve access to care.
After carefully considering how we could best serve our members and their communities, we launched a three-year plan in 2023 aimed at supporting the mental health of 110,000 Rhode Island youths and children, about half of the state’s under 18 population. 
Highlights of the plan include:

Assisting vulnerable populations: We worked with providers in our behavior health network to increase the availability of urgent appointments, potentially avoiding unnecessary visits to hospital emergency departments, and we collaborated with Bradley Hospital on offering clinicians free autism and anxiety training, plus stipends, to help them better serve children and youth.
Early identification and treatment: We increased reimbursement rates for early intervention care, offered incentives to pediatric primary care sites to integrate behavioral health care into their practices, expanded virtual care options, supported behavioral health startup Braver’s use of trained coaches to ramp up its exposure therapy program for children’s anxiety, and provided assistance to school-based mental health intervention programs, including Project SUCCESS and Mood Check.
Prevention and awareness: We coordinated Teen Mental Health First Aid trainings, promoted digital emotional wellness coaching for parents and caregivers through The Greatest 8, seeded the expansion of the Chris Collins Foundation’s school-based peer-to-peer program and supported youth recreation programs run by Recess Rocks in RI and Boys & Girls Clubs.

We’re encouraged by our progress so far. Over the past two years, we estimate that our collaborative efforts have helped touch the lives of about 130,000 youths, exceeding our original goal, and we are likely to surpass 200,000 by the end of 2025. 
New KIDS COUNT Factbook outlines what’s a stake for vulnerable R.I. kids

We’ve named just some of our valued partners here, but they and many others are foundational to the goals of our plan. They share our commitment to building healthier families and communities and we’re proud to support their efforts to launch and grow programs and services that promote the wellbeing and mental health of Rhode Island youths. 
Clearly, there is still much work to do. For example, the just-released 2025 RI KIDS COUNT Factbook noted that there was a significant increase in mental health hospitalizations for children on Medicaid in 2024 and that the number of calls to the Kids’ Link RI triage service, although down in 2024, still totaled 5,386.
We know we join all our partners throughout May in recognizing Mental Health Awareness Month — a time to reflect on the progress we’ve made and, importantly, to recommit ourselves to creating safe and supportive environments, promoting mental health education, reducing, and ensuring access to high quality mental health care.

Thirty-five people submitted opponent testimony against Ohio House Bill 160, which would reduce THC levels and redirect most of the tax revenue. State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, introduced the bill two months ago and opponents testified against the bill for more than three hours during Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee meeting. 
“H.B. 160 imposes a litany of negative changes on cannabis users, consumers, growers, and professionals to dismantle key parts of current Ohio law enacted by your constituents,” said Gary Daniels, ACLU of Ohio’s legislative director. “At worst, these changes can be interpreted as purposeful, designed to kneecap Issue 2. At the least, these changes fundamentally handicap the purchase, use, transportation, and sale of cannabis in the state.”

Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative. The state’s total recreational marijuana sales were $479,219,877 as of April 26, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Cannabis Control. 
H.B. 160 would reduce the THC levels in marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap the number of marijuana dispensaries at 350, and reallocate the bulk of marijuana tax revenue to the state’s General Revenue Fund. It would ban using marijuana in public spaces and offer expungement for prior convictions for marijuana related offenses. 
“I think this bill represents the most thoughtful of the approaches we’ve seen from legislators,” said state Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord. “If we could find some common ground, I think the sponsor has mentioned that he wants to have a fairly stripped down bill.”
H.B. 160 would repeal the Cannabis Social Equity and Jobs Program, which was enacted through the passage of Issue 2. The bill also has an intoxicating hemp provision that would require every THC product to only be sold at Ohio’s regulated marijuana dispensaries. 
During the committee meeting, Callender held up an intoxicating hemp product he recently purchased with the Hawaiian Punch logo on it. 
  State Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord, holds up an intoxicating hemp product during the Ohio House Judiciary Committee meeting on May 7, 2025. (Screenshot).
“This is to show that there is some common ground,” Callender said. “1,000 milligrams of THC, 96.1% THC.  … No ID required to purchase, no ID required to go into the location. … We don’t want children having access. We don’t want false labeling.”
The bill would also make it illegal to purchase marijuana in another state and bring it back to Ohio. 
“But Ohioans can still return home from their favorite out-of-state microbrewery with a can, six pack, or entire keg of beer,” Daniels. 
Many of the opponents were not shy about pointing this out. 
“The Issue 2 campaign was called Regulate Cannabis Like Alcohol,”said Karen O’Keefe, Marijuana Policy Project’s director of state policies. “Yet H.B. 160’s unnecessary and onerous restrictions on cannabis in no way resemble how alcohol is regulated. … Would you ban possessing bourbon purchased in Kentucky?”
Opponents questioned where they would be legally allowed to use marijuana if the bill passed. 
“If people can’t consume at home-and sharing at a friend’s house becomes illegal, where are they supposed to consume safely?” asked Anthony D. Riley, founder of Ohio Cannabis Live and the Ohio Cannabis Expo.
Those opposed to the intoxicating hemp provisions are worried about the ramifications of limiting sales to only marijuana dispensaries. 
“We have concerns that the language in S.B. 160 would ban most types of legal hemp products from retail sales, reducing access for consumers,” said Ohio Grocers Association President Kristin Mullins. 
Instead, she wants lawmakers to incorporate regulatory oversight such as age-restricting products and product labeling. 
Ohio Senate marijuana bill 
The Ohio Senate passed their own version of a bill that would overhaul the state’s marijuana law back in February — shortly before the House introduced their bill. 
There are some similarities between the bills such as lowering THC levels, requiring marijuana only be used in a private residence, and capping dispensaries at 350. 
One of the biggest differences with Senate Bill 56 is limiting Ohio’s home grow from 12 plants down to six. The bill would also combine the state’s medical and recreational marijuana programs under the Division of Cannabis Control. 
S.B. 56 has yet to have a hearing over in the House.

In the end, the House voted 69-42, largely along partisan lines with Republicans voting in favor of sending House Bill 781 to the Senate just ahead of Thursday’s crossover deadline, after which only bills that have passed at least one chamber can be considered.
A new mandate on local governments
HB 781 would allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property located within its jurisdiction to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph) pushed back against claims that HB 781 criminalizes homelessness while introducing the bill.
“This bill does not criminalize homelessness,” Biggs insisted. “It addresses unauthorized public property camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness itself.”
Biggs has said the HB 781 grew out of conversations with municipal leaders who asked for guidance around handling the state’s growing homeless crisis. He said the state can no longer wait to address the problem.
Total homelessness across the state jumped 19% to 11,626 in 2024, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development report documenting homelessness in America. That was 1,872 more homeless people than the 9,754 counted in 2023.
“Some people want to kick it down the road two years, five years, but how long are we going to wait until we deal with our homeless population in our own house,” Biggs said. “We need to deal with it now. We need to give guidance.”
Under HB 781, local governments would also be responsible for ensuring safety, maintaining sanitation, policing illegal substance use and alcohol use and coordinating with health departments to provide behavioral health services at designated sites.
A lengthy House debate
The HB 781 debate was collegial. Some bill opponents thanked Biggs for taking on a difficult issue that has vexed cities and towns.
  Rep. Laua Budd (Photo: Screenshot from NCGA video feed)
“It [HB 781] falls short in a lot of ways, but it took an act of courage to actually put it out there,” said Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg). “Maybe this is a solution we should consider because doing nothing is not an option. The solutions we’re currently trying to employ in our communities across the state are either ineffectual or not meeting the needs of those they are seeking to house.”
Budd, however, said she could not vote for the bill because it’s tantamount to an unfunded mandate that would create financial and strategic hardships for local governments.
“We cannot ask our local governments to foot this bill because when we do that, you know where they get the money, they get it out of the pockets of taxpayers living in their communities and most of those citizens can’t afford that either,” Budd said.
  Rep. Abe Jones debates House Bill 781. (Photo: Screenshot from NCGA video feed)
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) agreed the state should provide local governments with financial assistance if HB 781 is approved.
“I think we’re going to have to put our money where our mouths are, otherwise, we would be just as guilty as the feds who do this all time; shove it down the line, beat their chest, act as though they did something and they’re sending us no money,” Jones said.
Rep. Jordan Lopez (D-Mecklenburg) spoke forcibly against the bill, contending it would criminalize homelessness.
“It’s not a misconception that House Bill 781 will require local governments to not only punish those that are unhoused, but in a state where affordable housing remains increasingly harder to find, it’s contributing to a rising homeless rate, basically requires local governments to push away or outright hide unhoused people as well,” Lopez said.
Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry) reminded colleagues of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in the case of Grants Pass v. Johnson that there is “no specific right to housing on public property.” The Court ruled that cities can punish unhoused individuals for sleeping outside in public even if they have nowhere else to go.
  Rep. Sarah Stevens (Photo: NCGA video feed)
“It [the Court decision] said there’s no constitutional right to living on a public park, a public property, so this does encompasses that and said you don’t have the right to live on public property but if a city or county wishes to establish a place for people to live, they need to at least provide sanitation, they need to provide a space and give them some guidelines,” Stevens said.
After the Court ruling, Grants Pass designated camps for people experiencing homelessness. City policy restricts camping to specific locations.
Stevens argued that HB 781 is not an unfunded mandate because the problem of homelessness already exists.
“This is an attempt to start moving forward and getting the cities and counties to say, ‘Yes, this is an issue and we’re going to deal with it,’” Stevens said. “We didn’t create the problem on the state level, so it’s not up to us to fix it. Each of the cities and counties are going to have to do their own thing.”
Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) questioned a provision in the bill that prohibits selected sites from negatively affecting property values of neighboring properties.
“Well, who’s going to determine that?” Butler asked. “Who’s going to do the valuations?”
Like other bill opponents, Butler thanked Biggs for taking on a challenging subject but said HB 781 leaves her with more questions than answers.
“You [Biggs] are well intentioned with this bill, but I think homelessness, being unhoused, is a very tough issue and people in that advocacy space have been trying to figure it out,” Butler said. “Until we can figure it out, and until we commit the dollars and resources to solve some of the underlying challenges, I don’t think we’re going to get there, and I think this bill is going to impede our progress on tackling homelessness.”
Advocates for the homeless decry bill’s substance, question motives of authors
Lawmakers’ concerns about HB 781 largely mirrored those that have been expressed by advocates for people experiencing homelessness.
“Absent state fiscal support, the NC bill diminishes local autonomy while making cities and counties both fiscally responsible and legally liable for the implementation of state-sanctioned encampment policies,” the NC Coalition to End Homelessness [NCCEH] said in a statement earlier this week.
The NCCEH also expressed concern that the bill is being pushed by the Cicero Institute, a conservative think tank, that has led efforts to pass similar legislation in Arizona, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin and Kentucky.
The institute was founded by tech-industry capitalist Joe Lonsdale, who is critical of the “housing first” approach to ending homelessness. That model prioritizes providing individuals and families with permanent, affordable housing as the first step in ending their plight.
“While Cicero describes itself as a think tank, its policies promote industries that potentially profit from criminalizing poverty,” said Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of NCCEH. “States that adopted Cicero laws find they are funneling more public money into incarceration, so while these bills could lead to the financial enrichment of out-of-state investors of privatized jails and prisons and monitoring technologies, they will worsen conditions for North Carolinians without housing.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2914-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 06:00:38.136259

The atmosphere was emotional — and often testy. 
Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and the committee chairman, exchanged heated words with some of the testifiers, cutting off those he thought were repeating previous speakers and others he said were veering off topic. The proceedings lasted through the afternoon and well into the evening, wrapping up around 11 p.m.
The Senate Finance Committee will now take up the budget and make a series of changes, beginning on Friday at 1. The Senate has until June 5 to pass the budget, at which point it will likely head to negotiations with the House. The Legislature must deliver the budget to Gov. Kelly Ayotte by June 30, the end of the 2025 state fiscal year. 
Speakers raised the House’s proposed 3% decrease to Medicaid reimbursement rates, the elimination of the State Council on the Arts and Aging Commission, cuts at the Department of Corrections, and education freedom accounts, among other topics. 
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Ayotte said her budget director watched the hearing, and that she had taken note of the public commentary, particularly around the Medicaid cuts. 
“My takeaway is that my budget was a lot better,” said Ayotte, who has opposed many of the House’s proposed cuts. 
Here are some of the voices.

Fears of Medicaid cuts
Many of the speakers decried a 3% decrease to Medicaid reimbursement rates that the House included in its version of the budget. They urged the Senate to reverse it.
“We often think of Medicaid as a benefit, but it really is a part of the infrastructure,” Jeffrey Fetter, chief medical officer at New Hampshire Hospital, said. “The way that we deliver mental health care is more embedded in how Medicaid works than many folks understand or realize.”
The cuts, which were inserted into HB 2, would lower the amount the state’s Medicaid program reimburses providers for medical care purchased through Medicaid.
“I look outside my office at New Hampshire Hospital, I see 2,000 offices in buildings that used to have 2,000 patient beds,” Fetter said, referring to the psychiatric hospital’s history as a mental institution and asylum. “All those patients did not go away with de-institutionalization. They are living good lives in the community, and if our community mental health centers are unable to get the Medicaid funding they need, all those patients come streaming back into New Hampshire Hospital through emergency rooms, and that’s what we don’t want to see happen.”
Doctors and providers fear that when people lose access to Medicaid, they’re less likely to receive preventative care — including for mental health — and more likely to visit the emergency room, oftentimes for things that should be handled by a primary care provider oftentimes sicker than they would be otherwise.
Tiffany Gladu, a registered nurse with Granite State Independent Living, testified about how vital Medicaid is to the clients she works with, who have disabilities.
“Many of the individuals I serve don’t just need a little help,” Gladu said. “They rely on Medicaid-funded care for their very survival. These are not optional supports. They are critical, life-sustaining services that keep people alive, safe, and in their homes.”
She pointed out that many of those she works with cannot bathe themselves, get dressed, or get out of bed safely, without assistance, putting them at risk for pressure sores and infections that can become life-threatening. They also need help preparing meals, grocery shopping, taking their medications, accessing clean drinking water, and using the restroom. Some require physically invasive bowel programs or catheterization. These services are paid for through Medicaid.
“Without this support, their lives would be at risk,” she continued. “The care provided by these services allows people with disabilities to maintain their well being and live with dignity and safety in their homes. While personal care services are nonmedical in classification, they are medically necessary in practice. Without them, people are at risk for hospitalization, displacement from their homes, or death.”
Gladu said this care system is “already stretched thin.”
“A rate reduction in reimbursement means providers will be paid less for the same medically necessary work,” she said. “This does not only impact agencies. It directly impacts the people receiving the care. Lower rates make it harder to retain and hire qualified caregivers in a field that is already underpaid and undervalued. When we can’t find staff, consumers go without care.”
Defending state arts funding
A number of people spoke against the House’s decision to eliminate the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts. 
In Nelson, the Apple Hill Center for Chamber Music educates 300 students each summer on its 100 acre campus, “greatly assisted” by grants from the State Council on the Arts, said Sam Bergman, the executive director. But it doesn’t help just students, he said. 
“In the Monadnock Region, sir, as in so many parts of our state, the tourism economy is critical to everything that we do, and the arts are a critical part of that tourism economy,” Bergman said, addressing Gray. “The people who come to our arts organizations eat in our restaurants, they stay in our hotels, they patronize our businesses.” 
Mary McLaughlin, the interim board chair of the State Council on the Arts, noted that the organization had supported artists and organizations since 1965. And she agreed that the grants help stimulate local economies. 
“The arts are a revenue generator for the state, providing a positive 5-to-1 ratio return on investment,” McLaughlin said. “In 2024 New Hampshire invested 73 cents per citizen in the arts and culture sector, contributing to an estimated yield of over $2 million in in-kind goods and services, and over $50 million in payrolls of grantee organizations.”
McLaughlin noted the organization’s “artisan residents projects,” in which artists receive funding to teach their art in public schools. It’s “often the only arts education that some of our schools can afford to offer,” she said.
And she said that the elimination of the arts council would also result in a loss of National Endowment for the Arts funding.
Funding art is important for more than just economic activity, argued Andrew Pinard, the interim executive director of the AVA Gallery and Art Center in Lebanon and the founder of the Hatbox Theater in Concord. “Art is both important and fragile,” Pinard said. “It should not be taken for granted.”

Speaking up for the Commission on Aging
As another cost-cutting measure, the House budget would eliminate New Hampshire’s Commission on Aging, which was established in 2019 to advise policy related to senior citizens. The commission’s executive director, Lily Wellington, testified Tuesday urging senators to restore it.
“In 1925, the average person could expect to live for 59 years,” she said. “Today, that average lifespan has increased to 79 years, a testament to the power of public health, medical innovations, better nutrition, and wise public policy. This remarkable extension of life now requires a fundamental shift in how we plan and build our shared futures. We must now proactively adapt our systems to support longer lives.”
Wellington pointed to a 10-year blueprint the commission created for how the state can support its aging population and a transportation needs assessment it conducted on senior citizens as ways the commission was helping the state adapt.
Education freedom account expansion draws opposition
Some of the people present spoke against the House’s proposed expansion of education freedom accounts. The House’s budget would raise the current income threshold for the program from 350% of the federal poverty level to 400% in the first fiscal year, and then to all income levels in the second fiscal year.
The program allows families to access state education funds of between $4,000 and $7,000 per child per year to pay for private school or home-schooling expenses.
Some at the hearing argued the state’s Education Trust Fund should be used to increase state support of public schools, and should not fund the education freedom account program. 
“I’m here to ask you today to please support increased school funding in our state budget for public schools, and relieve the pressure on property taxes by ending the voucher system formula for school funding,” said Shelly Gingras, a school guidance counselor in Rochester.
Laura Vincent, a school board member at the Merrimack Valley School District, also opposed the education freedom account expansion. And Vincent warned lawmakers against adding mandatory budget caps for school districts. The House considered adding that measure to the budget, but did not ultimately do so.  
“Together with EFA expansion efforts, this will put our schools in a type of a vise,” Vincent said. “As money flows out to EFAs on one end, the money obtained through local taxes on the other end will start shrinking.”
Speaking against Department of Corrections cuts
One speaker Tuesday testified against the proposed cuts of 190 positions — 149 of them currently filled — at the Department of Corrections. 
Matt Davis, recruitment and retention sergeant for the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, said his job is one that would be eliminated. He said the cuts would create a risk to public safety and to the state’s prison system, which he said had earned national recognition. 
“I’m here today to ask one simple question: Who’s left behind the walls?” 
Davis argued that by cutting positions for training officials, teachers, mental health counselors, and others, lawmakers would not be eliminating the need for those roles. 
“That work just doesn’t go away,” he said. “It shifts to officers already drowning in responsibility and burnout. …That’s not just unsustainable, it’s dangerous.”
Stern rebukes from the chairman
Throughout the roughly eight-hour hearing Gray, the Finance Committee’s chair, chastised speakers who he said were being repetitive in a way that was taking up too much of the committee’s time. His rebukes began with the first few speakers.
“I believe I have the three minutes to finish my statement,” said Pinard, after he was interrupted by Gray’s gavel.
“Sir, I believe I am the chair,” Gray responded. “And if you read the Senate rules, I’m the one in charge. So you don’t tell me what I’m doing and not doing. I’m asking you to summarize your testimony and not repeat. Thank you.”
Gray continued this through the hearing to varying degrees.
“Every time that we have one of these public hearings that last a long time, there are people who come and can’t stay long enough to do the testimony, because the testimony continues, continues, and continues,” he said at one point. “That is one of the reasons we have a time limit. That is one of the reasons we restrict the repeating. That is one of the reasons we don’t want you clapping and stuff. And that’s all in the Senate rules of this committee. So please, with respect of your other people who want to testify and are very low on the list.”
Late in the hearing, Gray got into an argument with Rep. Jonah Wheeler, a Peterborough Democrat who said the Senate Finance Committee’s process for hearing public comment was too limited. Gray urged him to focus his comments on the budget.
“We are in the people’s House,” Wheeler said.
“And you are in a Senate hearing,” Gray countered. “And I am the one who gets to decide who’s talking and who’s not talking, Representative. Back to the bill.”
Gray then asked staff to “cut his microphone please.”

No modern political leader has done more to undermine science and research – both by slashing funding and directly spreading myths and disinformation — than President Donald Trump.
Whether defunding everything from cancer studies to the National Weather Service or placing a troubled conspiracy theorist like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in charge of the nation’s health, Trump has recklessly endangered millions of lives and wreaked havoc that will take many years to repair.
And sadly, Trump has also spurred state and local government in a similar direction. Last week, North Carolina House Republicans advanced a bill to ignore the Food and Drug Administration by allowing the sale of a drug used to kill parasites in horses — ivermectin – without a prescription.
Though touted by some right-wing pundits as a miracle cure, peer reviewed scientific research has repeatedly shown such claims to be bogus.
The bottom line: Ivermectin advocates may be sincere, but by overturning established, science-based drug approval laws, they are setting a very dangerous precedent indeed.

(Photo by Kimberly Fraser/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Flickr)For years, outdoors enthusiasts in New Mexico have pushed to overhaul the state Department of Game & Fish — an agency plagued by leadership turnover, funding woes and the scorn of hunters and tree-huggers alike.
Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”
New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.











We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it's the only one we've got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director



This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.
Political appointees set state wildlife policy. Critics say that’s a problem.

Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

(Getty Images)In March, the federal government announced it was revoking $81.3 million in pandemic-related funding from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services that was not expected to expire until 2026.
The funding was being used to support the state’s epidemiological laboratory and testing capacity, outreach to vaccinate residents, efforts to address health disparities in the state, and substance use disorder treatment programming, as outlined in a new report from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
The funding came from myriad federal laws, grants, and programs designed to help New Hampshire, and other states, recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. State officials originally believed they’d be able to spend this funding into 2026, but in a surprise announcement, federal officials clawed back the funding on grounds that the pandemic has ended.
This made a difficult budget year for New Hampshire ever more challenging. The state has been dealing with lagging business tax revenues for the past few years, is being compelled by the courts to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement money after hundreds of children were abused in its juvenile detention centers, and was already running out of pandemic-era federal funding. Amid these challenges, Gov. Kelly Ayotte unveiled a $16 billion two-year budget proposal in February. House lawmakers decided her cuts weren’t sufficient to deal with the aforementioned fiscal challenges and passed a budget in April that spends $643 million less than the governor’s proposal. Now, the Senate is debating the spending plan, and lawmakers will have to figure out how to either find funding for these programs elsewhere or eliminate them.
Roughly two-thirds — $51.1 million — of the revoked funding was set aside for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases Program, a joint program between the federal government and states that seeks to allow states to respond to disease outbreaks, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. The money was being spent to increase the capacity of the state’s epidemiological testing and laboratories, and on disease research and surveillance.
About a quarter of the funding — $20.7 million — the federal government revoked was being used to support vaccine outreach efforts. Additionally, about 6% — $5 million — was being used to address health disparities in how COVID-19 affected different populations. Money from both of those segments was used to hire 39 community health workers. Those community health workers, typically members of the community where they serve, helped clients navigate the complicated health care system and connected them to food assistance or child care programs.
Additionally, the revoked money was funding behavioral health programs. A little over 2% — $2.1 million — came from a grant meant to provide community mental health services, and almost 3% — $2.3 million — was being used to support substance use (addiction) treatment, though the money was mostly being used on operational support and not direct patient services. That included programs teaching first responders how to deal with patients experiencing PTSD or other trauma, assisting community mental health centers in becoming federally certified as community behavioral health clinics, and the state’s 24-hour service that provides mental health assistance via phone and in-person to people experiencing crises.

The proposal would prohibit the use of AI to create deepfake porn — particularly involving minors. But with provisions requiring watermarks and punishing identity fraud, the bill’s impact could extend far beyond the creation of pornography.
Senate bill 163
The bill’s sponsors, state Sens. Louis Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., and Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, argue the restrictions will “prevent potentially harmful uses” of an emerging technology while protecting Ohioans “safety and privacy.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill goes after AI-generated child porn by expanding the definition of obscenity to include an “artificially generated depiction.” Blessing explained “current laws against child sexual abuse material require an actual real photo of a child to be able to prosecute someone.”
“With AI not being a real photo,” he added, “this leads to issues of prosecuting someone generating these photos. Senate bill 163 will give attorneys the ability to prosecute these people.”
The sponsors argue AI can also be used to engage in fraud for financial, political and reputational purposes. So, the proposal extends identity fraud statutes to include a “replica” of an individual’s voice or likeness. It prohibits the use of a replica persona to defraud, damage a person’s reputation, or depict a person in a state of nudity or engaged in a sexual act.
Beyond its prohibitions, the bill aims to get ahead of deceptive uses by requiring any media created with artificial intelligence to include a watermark identifying it as such. Removal of a watermark is subject to a civil lawsuit for damages, and anyone who removes a watermark faces the presumption that they caused the alleged harm.
Proponents’ testimony
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost praised the measure’s “three-pronged approach.” He argued the watermark requirement “would provide a minimum level of transparency and notice” when an individual encounters AI-generated content.
Speaking about the bill’s identity fraud provisions, Yost brought up a case from his time as state auditor. A scammer successfully mimicked a school district’s email system and then sent a fake funds transfer request to the accounts payable department posing as the district’s financial controller. Best practice, Yost said, would be to call the sender for confirmation.
“But now, in the era of deepfakes with audio,” Yost explained, “you can send that fake email, call up (accounts payable) using the controller’s voice and say, ‘Hey, I just sent you an email asking you to do a wire transfer. This is really important. We need to move it. I wanted to follow up with phone calls so you didn’t have any questions.’”
As for the restrictions on child sexual abuse material, Yost urged lawmakers ensure “these powerful tools are not used for evil,” and added that “these are the kinds of things that keep me up at night.”
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, pressed Yost on how useful state legislation can be when it comes to addressing a “borderless” crime.
Yost acknowledged he’d prefer to see federals laws and even international treaties governing the use of AI-generated images. But “possession or use within Ohio can still be proscribed by this body and it ought to be.” He added that one way to push Congress to act is for states to pass an array of legislation.
Lou Tobin, speaking on behalf of the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association, noted many states have passed bills to prohibit AI-generated child sexual abuse material or CSAM.
“As of last month,” he said, “Thirty-eight states, including every state surrounding Ohio, have enacted laws that criminalize the creation, possession and distribution of artificially generated CSAM.”
But while many states have taken action, it’s not clear those laws will hold up in court.
“I think a federal district court has found one of these statutes to be in violation of the Ashcroft decision,” Tobin told lawmakers. “The Ashcroft decision was a U.S. Supreme Court decision from the early 2000s that said you could not criminalize artificially generated images of child pornography because there wasn’t a real victim.”
In February, a federal judge in Wisconsin threw out one charge related to possession of “virtual child pornography,” but allowed three others to go forward. Prosecutors in that case have appealed the decision to dismiss the charge.
Tobin explained his office and the AG’s worked with state lawmakers to narrowly tailor S.B. 163 bill to avoid problems with the First Amendment. Regardless of how the case in Wisconsin or others play out, Tobin agued, “We think that’s a fight worth having.”

Medicaid, the federal-state health insurer for low-income Americans, covers nearly 3 million Ohioans. That’s about a quarter of the state’s population.
Particularly in states such as Ohio, Medicaid covers large numbers of working people. That’s because in 2014 the state opted to expand eligibility to people making 138% or less of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, that’s $43,000 a year.

About 770,000 Ohioans are covered by expanded Medicaid — a group for which rates of uninsurance have dropped by 62% since 2012, according to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio.
A draft budget making its way through the U.S. House of Representatives would cut federal spending — the primary source of Medicaid money — by $880 billion over 10 years. KFF reported that such a move would require a 29% increase in state spending to maintain the same level of coverage.
The federal government currently covers 90% of the cost of Ohio’s expended Medicaid. In his draft of the state budget, Gov. Mike DeWine included a provision saying that if the feds cut that, the state would end coverage of the 770,000 Ohioans in the expansion group.
In the report it released this week, the Commonwealth Fund said such cuts would harm state economies, with Ohio’s high among them. It said “the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) would decrease by $95 billion and tax revenue would decrease by $7 billion. The states likely to face the most significant economic losses include California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.”
One reason for the losses, the explainer said, is that each dollar in Medicaid spending creates a greater value to the overall economy.
“Medicaid investment is shown to have a “multiplier effect,” meaning that every dollar spent generates over a dollar’s worth of economic activity,” it said. “Medicaid drives employment in the health care sector; generates state and local tax revenue; and saves money for enrollees, allowing them to spend more on items other than health care.”
Medicaid spending also bolsters the economy by making more people healthy enough to work. Research in Ohio and across the country has shown that workforce participation is greater in states that expanded Medicaid, the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy reported in 2023.
The economic benefits of Medicaid spending are manifold, the Commonwealth Fund report said.
“Medicaid coverage helps lift enrollees out of poverty — more effectively, in fact, than federal tax credits,” it said. “In states that have expanded Medicaid, enrollees have benefited from reductions in income inequality, evictions, and bankruptcies, as well as improvements in credit scores. One study found that less than two years after Michigan expanded Medicaid, the average amount of medical bills in collections for enrollees had dropped by over $500, enrollees were 11% less likely to be evicted, and they were 13% less likely to overdraw their credit cards than before expansion.”

The western Oregon transit service is warning of potential service cuts if the state does not provide more funding. (Courtesy of Tillamook County Transportation District)Compared with major American cities, the ridership on public buses in Minot, North Dakota, can seem relatively minuscule.
But the 82,000 rides taken each year allow people without cars to get to work, help those with disabilities get around and connect patients with crucial health care.
“The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system,” said Brian Horinka, the city’s transit superintendent.
Like in many cities — from sprawling metropolitan areas to smaller and rural communities — the financial future of public transit is questionable in Minot, population 48,000. While increasing, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. Federal funding and state budgets remain uncertain, while inflation is pinching transit services.
For example, Horinka said he’s looking to buy a new 30-foot heavy-duty bus. He expects it will cost up to $700,000 because of inflation. Just five years ago, a similar model could be had for about $400,000, he said.
“We’re in dire straits, from a financial standpoint,” he said.
North Dakota’s four largest cities, including Minot, asked lawmakers for millions in extra grant dollars this year to keep transit buses rolling. The state enacted a new law awarding $2 million in grants — a welcome reprieve, but far less than the $15 million initially requested.














The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system.


– Brian Horinka, transit superintendent in Minot, N.D.






Republican state Rep. Dan Ruby, a sponsor of the legislation, said cities will likely need to increase local funding for bus systems.
“I don’t think it’s enough,” he said. “I think it is going to just be somewhat of a stopgap for some of them to be able to function.”
The law also calls for a study to develop a proposed funding formula for fixed-route bus systems. Ruby said he would prefer a permanent funding model that doesn’t require cities to continually rely on legislative grants.
“We also want to make sure that they’re not sitting on funds or running inefficiently just because they have the funding,” he said. “That’s the key to get support from most of the legislators, to show that they really do have a need and there’s no way to find any more cuts in their operations without affecting the people that need the rides.”
It’s indicative of discussions occurring in state capitals across the country as public transit faces existential funding challenges.

Public transit systems in major cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco face the potential of deep service cuts without more funding. But the problems also extend to smaller systems that connect people in rural America and smaller cities.
 Partisan debates over transit funding

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the transit financial crisis affects residents in all 67 of the commonwealth’s counties.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said at a news conference in April.
Transit funding has been stuck in a partisan battle in Harrisburg.
In November, to stave off cuts, Shapiro ordered the transfer of more than $150 million in federal highway funds to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, which serves the greater Philadelphia area with bus and regional rail lines. He’s also backed legislation to increase transit funding, which has found support in the Democratic-controlled state House but so far has not advanced in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
Late last month, House Republican Leader Jesse Topper proposed partially privatizing the Philadelphia-area transit agency rather than increasing funding, which he said in a statement would “only serve to patch over the problems of a system chronically in crisis.”
“The same old, same old is clearly not working,” he said, according to a report by public radio station WESA.
The transit agency has said it already operates one of the most efficient systems in the nation. On a special website it created to call attention to its $213 million budget deficit, SEPTA said there’s “nothing left to cut from the budget but service.”
The authority has said it may be forced to cut services by 45% and raise fares by 20% without help from the state.
Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents a portion of North Philadelphia, said that would be “catastrophic” for the region.
“It makes this not only a less appealing place to live for people who are considering moving here,” he said, “but it also makes it difficult to live for folks who call this area home.”
Kenyatta, who dismissed the idea of privatization, said the state has a moral and economic obligation to ensure sustainable funding for public transportation.
“We’ve done patches here and there,” he said. “And that patchwork approach is not one that inspires the type of confidence and allows our transit agencies to do the type of long-term planning that they need to do.”
 Transit’s pandemic ‘death spiral’

Mass transit saw some of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 as people worked from home and avoided public spaces.
The federal government provided nearly $70 billion in pandemic aid to transit programs, which saw revenues drop sharply because of reduced fare collections.
But with the rise of remote and hybrid work, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels even as costs for labor and equipment skyrocket. A recent Bloomberg News analysis estimates the nation’s largest transit systems are facing a $6 billion shortfall — only heightening fears of a so-called death spiral in which a combination of service cuts and fare increases cause further erosion of riders and revenue.
In Oregon, Democratic lawmakers have proposed increasing the state’s dedicated transit payroll tax. Billed as “a starting point,” the plan would increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.18% — estimated to raise $269 million over each two-year budget cycle.
“That’s appreciated, but it’s nowhere near what it needs to be,” said Brian Vitulli, general manager of the Tillamook County Transportation District in western Oregon. “There could be some service reductions in the near future if we don’t get more funding.”
Aside from rising costs, Vitulli faces major hiring challenges: The district has 19 drivers but could use eight to 10 more. With too few drivers, bus service has been cut to six days a week.
For some riders, the transit services provide a lifeline. After last year’s closure of Tillamook’s only dialysis center, for example, the agency began offering rides to other dialysis clinics well outside its service area.
That has driven up costs and tied up drivers, making services such as the on-demand Dial-A-Ride less available for other residents.
“We’re kind of the only option for these dialysis patients,” he said. “And we’re kind of prioritizing those trips rather than somebody who just wants to go to the Elks Club for lunch or something.”
Vitulli also serves on the board of the Oregon Transit Association, which is lobbying instead for a 0.4% increase in the transit payroll tax phased in over eight years. The association said the current 0.08% proposal could force transit providers across the state to cut services by as much as 25% in the next few years as inflation and decreased fare collections push many into deficits.
TriMet, which operates rail, bus and paratransit services across 533 square miles of the Portland region, said it would still need to cut services even if the lawmakers’ proposed 0.08% funding increase were approved. The agency faces a deficit of nearly $75 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
Oregon lawmakers are broadly concerned about federal spending cuts, which could turn the state’s modest budget surplus into a gaping deficit, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. Nearly a third of the state’s budget comes from federal money.
Democratic state Rep. Susan McLain said budget uncertainty has heightened scrutiny of all state spending this session. She is one of the authors of the state’s transportation proposal, crafted after nearly two years of meetings across the state. Aside from increasing the transit payroll tax, it calls for boosting the gas tax and hiking vehicle registration costs to help pay for road improvements.
McLain, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Transportation, said budget negotiations are ongoing, with aims of having hearings later this month.
While the state wants to do more to ensure everyone can access medical care, schools and jobs, McLain noted that belt-tightening is imperative for all manner of agencies, including transit.
“We’re really trying to dig in and find ways to do more with less,” she said, “but also to make sure that we’ve got sufficient, adequate types of investment in areas that we value.”

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)A confession: I’m trying to quit my podcast habit.
My family and friends know I am the least likely person to write those words. If you were in a conversation with me over the past 20 years, there was an 87.3% chance that my first words would be: “I was listening to this podcast and …”
Baseball. Politics. Soccer. Comedy. Environmental issues. American culture. Entertainment. And science.
This week, my son pondered the possibility of plugging a USB drive into his head to upload knowledge for an upcoming test. For me, that has been the intellectual equivalent of podcasts.
In fact, my writing for Kansas Reflector began as “Audio Astra,” a digest of podcasts about Kansas or related to Kansas. If you didn’t know that, I forgive you. Those columns were even more torturous to read than they were to write — and that is saying something.
For hours each week I would listen to niche-y podcasts about Kansas forests, Midwest farm wives or the history of the Riverside Zoo in Wichita. As I listened to many of them, the audio quality often buzzed and screeched in my AirPods, even more so when I was writing on deadline and had to listen at 2x speed. I considered sending a few different podcasters a new microphone, just to improve my personal listening experience. I was a scribe — perhaps the only one — in the Holy Church of the Modern Podcast.
And yet, here I am today speaking heresy against them.
(Plus, I am writing for a publication with its own podcast. And I just finished judging a podcast contest.)
Even more absurd is the timing of my takedown. Americans are listening to more podcasts each year. While it’s true that counting podcast listeners has been an imperfect task recently, most media watchers see podcasting as a promising and growing media format.
Why my grumpiness toward podcasts then? Some of my malaise with podcasts is just that: my burned-out ears have been fatigued by thousands of hours of listening. My auditory claustrophobia is real.
But there is something else — something about the podcasts themselves. It’s their flabbiness.
Here’s one example. While folding laundry the other day, I turned on one of my favorite mindless podcasts, “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend,” a comedy podcast hosted by the former late-night host. The jovial and absurd interview episode has been a weekly staple of my listening for the last few years. And behold! Conan was interviewing Bill Hader, an actor who I admire so much that YouTube thrusts his content at me each time I log in. With all of that excitement, I clicked play.
After 56 minutes and 44 seconds, the interview ended. The pre/post banter slid into silence. That was two days ago.
Right now, I’ve been sitting at this keyboard for five minutes and I can’t tell you a single thing that was said. That’s an hour of stopping my ears up from hearing anything else. The squirrels chasing on the roof. The dishwasher sloshing. My son talking to friends on the phone in the next room.
All of that was blocked for unscripted celebrity chatter that I have entirely forgotten.
It’s a specific kind of programming. Call them the banter podcasts. Movie stars sit down with other movie stars. Comedians sit down with other comedians. Joe Rogan sits down with anyone and everyone.
Of course, banter podcasts these days are incredibly popular. The top five overall podcast chart, as ranked by Apple, includes Rogan at No. 4, along with actor Amy Poehler’s new show, “Good Hang.” Plus, the No. 1 show, “The Mel Robbins Podcast.”
Rogan is famous for making marathon episodes, like this week’s interview with Cameron Hanes, which stretched for 3 hours and 18 minutes. What does Hanes do for a living? Well, he’s got two podcasts of his own, among other things. Looks like a lot of banter on his channel too.
Podcasts, it turns out, have simply become too easy to make. A quiet room, a microphone and a friend. That’s the recipe for your first episode.
With that rant out of my system, I’m not ready to delete my podcast app yet. Many news podcasts still deliver tight, focused and original reporting and rich, audio storytelling.
Last week, NPR’s “Fresh Air” provided an emotional interview with Noad Wyle about his starring role in my household’s new favorite show, “The Pitt.” From the New York Times, “The Daily” distilled decades of reporting on investment genius Warren Buffett into 28 minutes on Wednesday. So, if I corner you at a cocktail party, watch out, because I remember tons of stuff from each of those episodes. “I was listening to this podcast and …”
But the banter podcasts … they leave me bloated, foggy and listless. My recent peevishness with them was triggered by listening to more audiobooks. While podcasts and audiobooks might seem one and the same, I found audiobooks entirely different when I returned to them after months of endless podcast banter. Podcasts were often the casual and wandering Zoom call between two actors, each promoting recent movie releases on a Thursday morning.
Audiobooks, on the other hand, pack a punch. Authors boil down years of expertise into singular chapters. Audiobooks, especially with the aid of a good book editor, also present the ideas with urgent, concise language rather than the podcast standard: a series of stuttered questions interrupted by leisurely sips of podcast coffee.
My critique might smack of impatience as I strive to mainline terabytes of information into my brain as fast as possible. And perhaps that’s true.
However, my main concern about flabby banter podcasts is the possibility that they are replacing our conversations in real life. How can we give our kids, partners and friends any real attention if we are racing to keep up with Rogan’s 12 hours of audio during a six-day period this week? No matter how extroverted you are, there is only so much conversation capacity there. Maybe we need to save our banter bandwidth for real people.
This is my alert to whomever is tracking podcast analytics: You are about to see a dip. Not because my rhetorical wit and zeal here will sway millions of readers. Instead, with my throttling back on my daily podcast habit, you might notice a hiccup in worldwide podcast listening.
And yes, I would be happy to come on your podcast to explain. I have three hours free after lunch.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Private donors have chipped in $80,000 to help AmeriCorps programs in Maryland that were slashed by the Trump administration, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Thursday at a news conference in Baltimore.
That money is just a fraction of the millions in federal funds that Maryland lost when the cuts were announced last month, leading to the elimination of at least 550 positions at organizations around the state. But state officials are also issuing a broader “call to action,” urging the public to donate time and money to organizations rocked by the abrupt cancellation of AmeriCorps programs.
The initial donations, from organizations including Baltimore Gas & Electric and the South Baltimore Gateway Partnership, will support two city organizations that had been getting AmeriCorps funding: the Digital Harbor Foundation and Elev8 Baltimore. Ferguson said the funding will let the organizations, one of which is in his district, “weather the storm” while litigation to restore the AmeriCorps funding proceeds.
“For them, services were interrupted immediately, and this funding will help them to restore some of those services immediately,” said Ferguson, an AmeriCorps alum himself. “The courts are the bulwark of our democracy. Unfortunately, the courts cannot keep pace with the actions that we know are coming from Washington, D.C.”
Officials said it’s hard to pinpoint an exact number of cuts and job losses, since AmeriCorps funnels some of its funding through states, while other funding is distributed in other ways. But they now say at least 550 jobs were lost in Maryland as a result of the cuts, more than twice the initial figure they shared.
As Trump slashes AmeriCorps, states lose a federal partner in community service

In addition to nonprofits, such as CASA and Habitat for Humanity, the list of agencies affected includes Frostburg and Salisbury universities and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, all of which hosted AmeriCorps members for programs such as food pantries and mentorship initiatives. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources was hosting 41 AmeriCorps workers in state parks, who were all dismissed while preparing for the peak summer season.
In defending the cuts, President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has cited consecutive financial audits “failed” by AmeriCorps. “President Trump is restoring accountability to the entire Executive Branch,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement earlier this week.
But Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, who is leading a court challenge to the cuts with 24 other states and the District of Columbia, said the president cannot make those cuts without congressional approval. When asked about the audits, Brown said his suit is not focused on the validity of Trump’s arguments for cutting AmeriCorps, but on the procedural violations.
“He’s exceeding his authority, and he’s violating the processes that he would need to undergo in order to roll back or curtail AmeriCorps,” Brown said.
The Justice Department agreed to an expedited timeline for the Maryland lawsuit, Brown said, with briefs filed by the end of next week, and hopes to receive a ruling on its preliminary injunction “shortly thereafter.”
If granted in full, the injunction would temporarily reverse the cancellation of more than 1,000 AmeriCorps programs nationwide, as well as the termination of about 85% of AmeriCorps staff and the cancellation of the National Civilian Community Corps.
Eight AmeriCorps workers had been serving at the Digital Harbor Foundation, said Jade Burnham, the foundation’s director of AmeriCorps services. She said all of them have since been dismissed, and that if the AmeriCorps program is not revived she is likely to lose her job at Digital Harbor as well.
After learning about the initial donation of funds, Burnham said she is hoping that she can bring back at least some of the workers.

The foundation provides digital education, and focuses on expanding technology and internet access, Burnham said. Thursday’s news conference was held at Digital Harbor’s tech lab on Federal Hill, in Ferguson’s district, which hosts 3D printers, computers and work spaces for students.
“These programs are not a waste of taxpayer dollars, but an investment in our communities,” Burnham said. “In the wake of its abrupt termination, we are hearing from those very communities. They are reaching out to us: ‘Where did the support go?'”
Marylanders can donate directly to impacted organizations, officials said, or use a fund established by America’s Service Commissions to provide emergency financial assistance to dismissed AmeriCorps workers, many of whom have lost access to stipends, housing, health insurance and other benefits. The fundraising campaign is national, but donors can funnel their donation to Maryland by selecting the state from a dropdown menu on the website.
At Elev8 Baltimore, the donations announced Thursday will allow the organization to go back to “business as usual,” said Executive Director Alexandria Warrick Adams. The nonprofit provides mentoring services to vulnerable middle- and high schoolers, she said.
“We’re talking about young people that have the most need to have trusted adults in their lives,” Warrick Adams said.
Warrick Adams said Thursday’s news should only be the beginning, for organizations struck by the loss of expected AmeriCorps funds.
“I cannot express our gratitude enough for this opportunity, but there is more. This is a call to action. This is not a one-and-done,” she said. “We’ve got a lot of years ahead of us to commit to young people, to commit to Baltimore, to commit to the community.”

,California,2025-05-09 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"If lawmakers or lawsuits get oil companies to pay for climate change, consumers will pay, too.",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/climate-change-california-consumers/,Other efforts to reduce Californians' carbon footprint have cost consumers. A new auditor report notes a greenhouse gas reduction program has raised gasoline prices.,"A theory that oil companies should be held legally responsible for the effects of climate change has been circulating among California’s left-leaning organizations and their political allies for several years.
The movement is gaining new vigor since deadly wildfires swept through Los Angeles County this year and it’s taking two forms — lawsuits and legislation.
As a recent CalMatters article notes, “Across the country, states, cities, tribes and environmental groups have filed dozens of lawsuits against oil companies alleging that they misled the public about the dangers of their products. These cases share a core argument: Oil companies knew fossil fuels were driving climate change and lied about it.”
However, as Michael Gerrard, an environmental law expert at Columbia Law School told CalMatters reporter Alejandro Lazo, “There are a lot of lawsuits pending, but so far, not a single court in the world has held fossil fuel companies financially responsible for greenhouse gas emissions.”
Meanwhile, there are a couple of bills in the state Legislature that, if enacted, would open the door to hitting oil companies in the pocketbook.
Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, introduced Senate Bill 222 in January as the wildfires were still raging. It would give homeowners and insurance companies the ability to sue oil companies for fire damages on the theory that their products created conditions for destructive blazes.
However, the bill was sidelined during its initial hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, garnering just five votes.
The second measure, SB 684, would create a Polluters Pay Superfund Program and empower a state agency to determine how much atmospheric damage has been caused by petroleum between 1990 and 2045 and impose the cost on oil companies.
Carried by Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys, the bill is pending in the Judiciary Committee.
The underlying assumption of both the lawsuits and the legislation is that the oil companies would be forced to acknowledge their contributions to climate change and pay billions of dollars as compensation and punishment.
The theory, however, has an aspect that advocates never mention — that corporations can pass on those costs to customers in the form of higher prices.
By happenstance, California already has a mini-version of the polluter-pays movement called cap-and-trade, and it proves the point that consumers eventually shoulder the financial burden.
Since 2012, California’s Air Resources Board has been setting limits on how much greenhouse gases can be emitted by certain industries and auctioning off “emission allowances,” raising billions of dollars each year.
By paying for emissions, it’s believed, corporations have an incentive to reduce them. Whether that’s true is still an open question and one reason for doubt is their ability to shift the burden to consumers.

Commentary 
Oil and gas companies should be held financially responsible for California climate disasters 

by Guest Commentary 





The Legislative Analyst’s Office, which advises the Legislature on financial matters, released a report on the cap-and-trade system this week.
Among other things, the report confirms that California motorists are already paying quite a bit more for fuel because of cap-and-trade.
It pegs the current effect at 23 cents a gallon, and if emission auction prices rise to their upper limit, “cap-and-trade would contribute roughly 74 cents per gallon to gasoline prices…”
The LAO report estimates that at the higher level, “the average household would pay about $700 per year as a result of the program,” adding, “such higher costs would be particularly burdensome for lower-income households, as they tend to spend a relatively high share of their incomes on transportation fuels compared to wealthier households.”
So there you have it. Whatever California does to reduce its carbon footprint to zero will be expensive and California consumers will face even higher costs of living, in the same way President Donald Trump’s tariffs impact prices. We shouldn’t pretend otherwise, as advocates for carbon reduction tend to.

Buddy Carter announced May 8, 2025 that he is entering the 2026 Senate race that shapes up as referendum on Trump policies. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)Georgia Republican Congressman Buddy Carter announced Thursday that he’ll run for Senate in 2026, entering into what’s sure to be a crowded field of Republican candidates looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff.
Carter, who’s serving his sixth term as congressman representing a coastal Georgia district, launched his campaign  with an ad declaring himself an ardent backer of the MAGA agenda to “put America first.”
The Pooler Republican is entering the race days after presumptive GOP favorite Gov. Brian Kemp announced he was declining to run for the U.S. Senate in 2026.
“Last November, Georgia spoke, but Jon Ossoff doesn’t care,” the Carter campaign ad says. “He fought against President Trump securing our border, and voted for men in girls sports. Jon Ossoff is on the wrong side. Trump has a warrior in Buddy Carter.”
Ossoff’s U.S. Senate campaign manager Ellen Foster said their campaign was unfazed by Carter’s announcement.
“Sen. Ossoff will defeat any challenger,” she said in a statement. “While the GOP primary field scrambles to outmaneuver each other and audition for Donald Trump’s support, Senator Ossoff’s campaign is already building the most effective and unstoppable turnout effort in Georgia’s history.”
Since 2015, Carter has represented Georgia’s 1st Congressional District, which includes Savannah. Carter serves on the House Budget, Energy and Commerce committees in Congress. He previously served in the Georgia Legislature for a decade.
Carter becomes the first established Republican candidate to publicly declare for the Senate race. Among the other candidates who have indicated interest are Reps. Mike Collins of Jackson and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Rome, as well as Insurance Commissioner John King.
Democratic Party of Georgia Chairman Charlie Bailey said Carter’s alignment with Trump’s policies puts him at a disadvantage.
“Buddy Carter jumping out of the gate as a self-described ‘MAGA warrior’ only means that over the next eighteen months he will have to own Donald Trump’s tariffs that are increasing costs for Georgia businesses and families, Medicaid cuts, anti-abortion extremism, devastating budget cuts hitting seniors, veterans, and kids, and so much more,” Bailey said in a statement.
“Georgia Republicans are clearly heading towards a messy, chaotic, and disastrous primary,” he said.
Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie said Carter’s announcement is part of a strategic plan to gain name recognition in a contest that is expected to be highly competitive with no clear front runner.
Gillespie said Carter will look to appeal to Trump supporters without polarizing a segment of voters who like another potential candidate such as Greene.
The Senate election will show where Georgia’s shifting political parties stand after the pandemic-affected 2020 election and the 2022 midterm election in which Republicans regained some control, Gillespie said.
“If we look at 2022 in the other statewide races, it looked like Georgia was coming back to equilibrium with Republicans winning, albeit by single digit margin, even though in many instances it was healthy single digit margins,” Gillespie said. “But when (U.S. Sen.) Raphael Warnock won over Herschel Walker, it reinforced the idea that Georgia has become competitive enough that if the Republican candidate is really problematic Democrats have a shot at winning.”
“The 2024 presidential election also reflected what is probably still the norm of Georgia in that the state probably still leans Republican,” Gillespie added. “Even understanding that those national conditions might be a little bit more favorable for Democrats this year, Georgia still looks like it’s leaning Republican.”
Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, anticipates that whichever Republican Senate candidate emerges from the primary in 2026 will close some of the gap in polling against Ossoff.
He said the harder part is becoming as popular as Kemp in state politics.
“What Kemp’s term as governor has shown is that people approve of the job he’s done, and therefore he attracts large numbers of independents and even some Democrats,” Bullock said. “So it doesn’t mean that other Republicans couldn’t do that, but they’ve got to work a lot harder to get there.”
So far, the Democratic Party is making the Senate race a referendum on Trump, Bullock said.
“How much of a vulnerability that proves to be in a general election will in part depend upon what the state of the economy is,” he said.

This year's marches showed that people can peaceably make their voices heard if each side respects the other, he writes.","Protesters in Baltimore leave Camden Yards to march to the Inner Harbor during May Day demonstrations this year. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).This year, May Day demonstrations swept across the nation in protest against President Trump and sometime “Co-President” Elon Musk. People took to the streets in over 1,000 peaceful demonstrations in opposition to the chaotic policies and actions of the second Trump administration.
For me, May Day was a day of reflection as I attended a modest size demonstration in Frederick. It was not the first May Day demonstration for me. My first was in May 1971. May 2025 was different for me: I was a protester this time.
In May 1971, I was in Washington, D.C., as a member of the Metropolitan Police Department’s Special Operations Division, Tactical Branch. I was a member of the Civil Disturbance Unit, trained in crowd control, mass arrest procedures and the deployment of special chemical weapons (tear gas).
Following a peaceful demonstration by 175,000 protesters on April 25, up to 40,000 protesters set out the next day for their “spring offensive” to disrupt government by closing downtown Washington on May Day. Their slogan was, “If the government won’t stop the war, we’ll stop the government.”
Marching orders for demonstrators were provided in a tactical manual published many months in advance. It described how to carry out civil disobedience. It included photos and maps of targeted locations and tactics to be employed by protesters who set out to overwhelm police capacity to respond.
From April 26 through May 7, as protesters carried out their planned civil disobedience, over 12,000 arrests were made, with over 7,000 arrests on May 3 alone.

In stark contrast, this year’s May Day drew hundreds of thousands of protesters across the United States in cities and towns, large and small, with comparatively few arrests. There were speeches by politicians, community leaders and protest organizers — and there were protest signs of all shapes and sizes expressing dissatisfaction with the current direction of our nation.
Although both May Day demonstrations were protesting the policies and actions of presidential administrations, one attempted to close the government for an administration’s actions during the Vietnam War and the other denounced an administration’s attempt to decimate federal services and our democratic form of government.
The foremost difference between the demonstrations of 1971 and today have to do with the motives of the demonstrators and the provocations that brought them to the streets.
In 1971, President Nixon, for all of his faults — and there were many, including the continued prosecution of the Vietnam War — was trying to preserve government services, keeping offices open during the demonstrations and ensuring personnel could get to work and do their jobs.
President Trump, on the other hand, has been attempting to shut down the government, to bring our democratic form of governance to its knees with indiscriminate firings, withholding congressionally authorized funding and closing many federal offices.
The 1971 protesters, using civil disobedience, tried to shut down the government. Today’s demonstrators, organized by the 50501 Movement, used peaceful demonstrations to protest the dismantling of government and to preserve our democracy and way of life.
I have now seen things from both sides, as a law enforcement officer attempting to keep the peace as well as a protester, peacefully exercising our First Amendment “right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”
As we enter what will undoubtedly be a summer of widespread protest, I want to implore demonstrators to remain peaceful and respectful, particularly the law enforcement officers there to ensure their safety and the safety of others. Be careful not to do anything that would provoke an unwanted response from the police.
Remember, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that when demonstrations filled Washington’s streets after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, then-President Trump asked authorities if they could shoot protesters in the legs. “Can’t you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something?” was said to be Trump’s question.
Similarly, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said Trump called for law enforcement to handle protesters and “crack their skulls.”
Law enforcement, “peace officers,” are reminded of their oath of office, to protect and defend the Constitution. As summer heats up in both temperature and rhetoric, it will be important for officers to keep cool heads and maintain public order while protecting protesters’ right “peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”
Mass demonstrations can have an impact. A White House Historical Association official said “the enormity of the protest pushed Nixon to accelerate the nation’s exit from Vietnam.” Whether the protests that lay ahead will have the same impact as those of the Vietnam War era, only time will tell.

Critics of the state's bear-culling program, which is aimed at boosting Mulchatna Caribou Herd numbers, say Alaska Department of Fish and Game officials have failed to adequately analyze impacts to bear populations, including impacts to bears that roam in Katmai. (Photo by F. Jimenez/National Park Service)The Alaska Department of Fish and Game does not have the right to carry out a controversial plan to kill bears this spring, at least for now, a state judge has ruled.
Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin found that the department’s predator control program, aimed at boosting a caribou population that has declined dramatically since the 1990s, remains unconstitutional, despite an Alaska Board of Game emergency authorization for the bear-killing to resume.
Through the program, which began in the spring of 2023 after the board first authorized it in 2022, the department has killed 175 brown bears, five black bears and 19 wolves.
Rankin’s order, released late Wednesday, was in response to a request by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance for a restraining order barring the department from carrying out this year’s predator control. The department had planned to start culling bears this weekend.
A restraining order is not needed because the program is already legally invalid, under a ruling issued by Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi on March 14, Rankin said.
Neither the Department of Fish and Game’s March 21 petition for an emergency nor the Board of Game’s March 27 approval of the emergency changed the fact that there is an existing court ruling that the predator control program violates the constitution, Rankin said.
The state has not satisfied the requirements in Guidi’s order for adequate public notice and analysis of the predator control program’s impact on the bear population, Rankin said. Because of that, “the Court specifically finds that the requirements of the Order have not been met and are still binding on the State,” she said.
Critics of the state’s program argue that bears are not to blame for the Mulchatna Caribou Herd’s decline. They point to numerous other factors, including a changing habitat in which tundra vegetation favorable to caribou has been replaced by woody plants favorable to moose.
They also argue that the predator control program poses a threat to bear populations, including those that roam through Katmai National Park and Preserve.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance sued the state in 2023 to block the program, and that lawsuit resulted in Guidi’s March ruling.
On Thursday, the alliance counted Rankin’s ruling as a victory, even though it did not result in a restraining order blocking the state’s plans to start roving bears on Sunday.
“The Superior court ruled that the existing predator control program was unlawful, which means that the State poached almost 200 bears over the past few years, including dozens of cubs, from planes and helicopters,” Nicole Schmitt, the organization’s executive director, said in a statement. “Instead of remedying those legalities, the State and the Board tried to skirt the public process again. We’re grateful the Court saw this process for what it was: an attempt to run-around a Court order without meaningful engagement from the public.”
In their petition to the Board of Game for emergency authorization, state officials argued that they were under a time crunch to remove bears from the caribou herd’s range.
The bear culling has to be conducted during the spring and early summer, the time when caribou are giving birth to calves on which the bears might prey, department officials argued in their petition and at the March Board of Game meeting.
But Rankin, in a hearing Tuesday, expressed skepticism about the justification for the emergency finding.
She peppered Kimberly Del Frate, an assistant attorney general for the state, with questions about how the emergency action would not be seen as an end run around Guidi’s ruling.
“I know it’s a hard fact, but you need to just admit it: The emergency was created because you lost with Judge Guidi. You wouldn’t have needed to do it if you didn’t have this decision,” Rankin told Del Frate.
Department of Fish and Game officials did not provide information Thursday on their plans now for predator control in the Mulchatna area. The department was still evaluating Rankin’s decision, a spokesperson said.
Joe Geldhof, one of the attorneys representing the organization, said he fears that state officials will carry out their predatory control program in defiance of the ruling.
He and fellow attorney Joel Bennett, a former Board of Game member, see parallels with the Trump administration’s defiance of court rulings.
To try to bolster the case against the bear-killing program – and potentially give Rankin legal grounds to issue a restraining order against the Department of Fish and Game — Geldhof and Bennett on Wednesday filed an amended complaint that adds the Board of Game’s emergency authorization to the list of state actions that they want to overturn.

Josh Shapiro's plan to increase sales tax transfers to the Public Transportation Trust Fund. (Capital-Star photo by Peter Hall)Compared with major American cities, the ridership on public buses in Minot, North Dakota, can seem relatively minuscule.
But the 82,000 rides taken each year allow people without cars to get to work, help those with disabilities get around and connect patients with crucial health care.
“The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system,” said Brian Horinka, the city’s transit superintendent.
Like in many cities — from sprawling metropolitan areas to smaller and rural communities — the financial future of public transit is questionable in Minot, population 48,000. While increasing, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. Federal funding and state budgets remain uncertain, while inflation is pinching transit services.
For example, Horinka said he’s looking to buy a new 30-foot heavy-duty bus. He expects it will cost up to $700,000 because of inflation. Just five years ago, a similar model could be had for about $400,000, he said.
“We’re in dire straits, from a financial standpoint,” he said.
North Dakota’s four largest cities, including Minot, asked lawmakers for millions in extra grant dollars this year to keep transit buses rolling. The state enacted a new law awarding $2 million in grants — a welcome reprieve, but far less than the $15 million initially requested.
Republican state Rep. Dan Ruby, a sponsor of the legislation, said cities will likely need to increase local funding for bus systems.
“I don’t think it’s enough,” he said. “I think it is going to just be somewhat of a stopgap for some of them to be able to function.”
The law also calls for a study to develop a proposed funding formula for fixed-route bus systems. Ruby said he would prefer a permanent funding model that doesn’t require cities to continually rely on legislative grants.
“We also want to make sure that they’re not sitting on funds or running inefficiently just because they have the funding,” he said. “That’s the key to get support from most of the legislators, to show that they really do have a need and there’s no way to find any more cuts in their operations without affecting the people that need the rides.”
It’s indicative of discussions occurring in state capitals across the country as public transit faces existential funding challenges.
Public transit systems in major cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco face the potential of deep service cuts without more funding. But the problems also extend to smaller systems that connect people in rural America and smaller cities.
 Partisan debates over transit funding

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the transit financial crisis affects residents in all 67 of the commonwealth’s counties.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said at a news conference in April.
Transit funding has been stuck in a partisan battle in Harrisburg.
States warn of ‘Band-Aids and duct tape’ for road maintenance
In November, to stave off cuts, Shapiro ordered the transfer of more than $150 million in federal highway funds to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, which serves the greater Philadelphia area with bus and regional rail lines. He’s also backed legislation to increase transit funding, which has found support in the Democratic-controlled state House but so far has not advanced in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
Late last month, House Republican Leader Jesse Topper proposed partially privatizing the Philadelphia-area transit agency rather than increasing funding, which he said in a statement would “only serve to patch over the problems of a system chronically in crisis.”
“The same old, same old is clearly not working,” he said, according to a report by public radio station WESA.
The transit agency has said it already operates one of the most efficient systems in the nation. On a special website it created to call attention to its $213 million budget deficit, SEPTA said there’s “nothing left to cut from the budget but service.”
The authority has said it may be forced to cut services by 45% and raise fares by 20% without help from the state.
Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents a portion of North Philadelphia, said that would be “catastrophic” for the region.
“It makes this not only a less appealing place to live for people who are considering moving here,” he said, “but it also makes it difficult to live for folks who call this area home.”
Kenyatta, who dismissed the idea of privatization, said the state has a moral and economic obligation to ensure sustainable funding for public transportation.
“We’ve done patches here and there,” he said. “And that patchwork approach is not one that inspires the type of confidence and allows our transit agencies to do the type of long-term planning that they need to do.”
 Transit’s pandemic ‘death spiral’

Mass transit saw some of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 as people worked from home and avoided public spaces.
The federal government provided nearly $70 billion in pandemic aid to transit programs, which saw revenues drop sharply because of reduced fare collections.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump
But with the rise of remote and hybrid work, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels even as costs for labor and equipment skyrocket. A recent Bloomberg News analysis estimates the nation’s largest transit systems are facing a $6 billion shortfall — only heightening fears of a so-called death spiral in which a combination of service cuts and fare increases cause further erosion of riders and revenue.
In Oregon, Democratic lawmakers have proposed increasing the state’s dedicated transit payroll tax. Billed as “a starting point,” the plan would increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.18% — estimated to raise $269 million over each two-year budget cycle.
“That’s appreciated, but it’s nowhere near what it needs to be,” said Brian Vitulli, general manager of the Tillamook County Transportation District in western Oregon. “There could be some service reductions in the near future if we don’t get more funding.”
Aside from rising costs, Vitulli faces major hiring challenges: The district has 19 drivers but could use eight to 10 more. With too few drivers, bus service has been cut to six days a week.
For some riders, the transit services provide a lifeline. After last year’s closure of Tillamook’s only dialysis center, for example, the agency began offering rides to other dialysis clinics well outside its service area.
That has driven up costs and tied up drivers, making services such as the on-demand Dial-A-Ride less available for other residents.
“We’re kind of the only option for these dialysis patients,” he said. “And we’re kind of prioritizing those trips rather than somebody who just wants to go to the Elks Club for lunch or something.”
Vitulli also serves on the board of the Oregon Transit Association, which is lobbying instead for a 0.4% increase in the transit payroll tax phased in over eight years. The association said the current 0.08% proposal could force transit providers across the state to cut services by as much as 25% in the next few years as inflation and decreased fare collections push many into deficits.
Red states create their own DOGE efforts to cut state government
TriMet, which operates rail, bus and paratransit services across 533 square miles of the Portland region, said it would still need to cut services even if the lawmakers’ proposed 0.08% funding increase were approved. The agency faces a deficit of nearly $75 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
Oregon lawmakers are broadly concerned about federal spending cuts, which could turn the state’s modest budget surplus into a gaping deficit, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. Nearly a third of the state’s budget comes from federal money.
Democratic state Rep. Susan McLain said budget uncertainty has heightened scrutiny of all state spending this session. She is one of the authors of the state’s transportation proposal, crafted after nearly two years of meetings across the state. Aside from increasing the transit payroll tax, it calls for boosting the gas tax and hiking vehicle registration costs to help pay for road improvements.
McLain, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Transportation, said budget negotiations are ongoing, with aims of having hearings later this month.
While the state wants to do more to ensure everyone can access medical care, schools and jobs, McLain noted that belt-tightening is imperative for all manner of agencies, including transit.
“We’re really trying to dig in and find ways to do more with less,” she said, “but also to make sure that we’ve got sufficient, adequate types of investment in areas that we value.”

These proposals may seem like routine guardrails to protect teens on social media, but they actually risk endangering the very communities that Connecticut’s Democratic leaders have long championed.
These bills would require platforms to verify the identity and age of all users, chipping away at the privacy of all Connecticut residents, adults and minors alike. It would also block minors from accessing social media overnight, impose a default one-hour time limit, and ban algorithmic content curation – all of which raise serious constitutional and practical concerns.
We’ve seen this play out before. Across the country, similar laws have been challenged in court. From Arkansas to California to Utah, judges have blocked laws that attempt to sidestep well-established constitutional protections around speech and privacy. And when those states inevitably lose in court, it’s taxpayers who are left holding the bag, having paid to defend these ill-conceived bills.
But these laws don’t just risk bad press, wasted resources, and legal delays. They risk real harm to the speech and privacy rights of all residents. 
Under an age verification mandate, platforms must verify the identity and age of all users, including existing ones. Many adults simply don’t want to share sensitive documents with online services. Under the proposed legislation in Connecticut, they’d face an uncomfortable choice: hand over personal data just to engage in protected online speech or walk away entirely.
Rather than collect that sensitive data, many platforms may choose to treat all users as minors – curating their content accordingly. Imagine if YouTube became “YouTube Kids” for everyone, creating an overly-sanitized ‘Disney Land’ experience that no one asked for.
Compelling companies to collect troves of personal information also opens the door to cybersecurity threats. A service offering age verification services recently left user data exposed, putting countless consumers at risk.
For LGBTQ+ users in particular, increased data collection isn’t just intrusive – it’s dangerous. Platforms serving these communities could have their data weaponized for blackmail, cyberbullying, or worse. In 2022, a majority of LGBTQ+ respondents (54 percent) reported experiencing severe harassment, including stalking, physical threats, and doxxing.
The problems don’t stop there. These bills assume that everyone has access to official identification and is willing to share it. But many of those in marginalized communities, including undocumented residents, transgender people, and people of color, disproportionately lack standard forms of ID. 
Since its inception, the internet has served as a great equalizer – a place where people can access news, education, health care resources, and community without being filtered through gatekeepers. It’s one of the few remaining public forums where your background, income, or immigration status doesn’t define your ability to speak or be heard. 
By requiring users to produce government ID to participate in online life, Connecticut risks locking people out of vital platforms for self-expression, advocacy, and connection. Instead of building a safer internet, bills like those legislators are currently considering  risk turning it into a gated community where only those with the right paperwork can enter. In President Trump’s second term, these risks become even more severe. Laws that require age verification could become tools for surveillance, discrimination, or even deportation.
Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislators have worked hard in recent years to positionConnecticut as a forward-looking tech leader. From >clean energy to fintech innovation, the state has built true momentum. But that progress could be jeopardized by well-intentioned but deeply flawed tech laws.
Instead of pushing through risky measures in the final weeks of the legislative session, lawmakers should look to the cautionary tales unfolding in other states.

While presented as a climate friendly solution to make energy more affordable, this bill undermines the state’s renewable energy and energy efficiency programs with little to no benefit to the ratepayer. Senate Bill 1560 is comprised of three misleading and costly-long term policy actions:  

Destabilizes clean energy funding by replacing the systems benefits charge with a politically controlled Green Bond fund, making long-term investments in efficiency and renewable vulnerable to annual budget fights.  
Uproots investment in truly renewable energy by adding existing nuclear power to the definition of class 1 renewables, diverting money meant to support new clean energy projects toward subsidizing existing nuclear plants like Millstone. 
Duplicates and disrupts existing programs, creating a redundant new agency, adding confusion by re-creating programs that already exist, and interfering with regulatory work already underway by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. 

Destabilizing clean energy funding  
Transferring funding for essential energy efficiency programs to the proposed Green Bond Fund would subject payment of program costs to the annual political wrangling that accompanies the release of bond authorizations and place successful programs in jeopardy. The proposed annual Green Bond Fund cap of $800 million represents a third of the state’s annual bond cap. Not to mention that if these costs move to bonding, the state of Connecticut will have to pay interest on that funding. If the goal is truly to make Connecticut a more affordable place to live, adding long-term costs won’t achieve that goal.  
The system benefits charge has been successful in providing sustained funding for clean energy and efficiency programs that lower costs for residents for decades. As it is currently implemented, for each kilowatt hour of energy you use, one tenth of one cent goes to renewable energy programs, and six tenths of a cent go to energy efficiency programs. Importantly, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs are the best ways for Connecticut residents to reduce the costs of their utility bills while also lowering system costs grid-wide! Since its inception, renewable energy programs funded by the systems benefits charge lowered energy burdens for more than  63,300 families and 8,125 businesses.   
Dismantling this funding will increase costs to ratepayers and taxpayers over time, and the Green Bond Fund will affect all Connecticut residents, not just those who pay a monthly electric bill from Eversource or United Illuminating. Additionally, electric load on the grid will be harder to manage, as efficiency programs compete with politically attractive local infrastructure projects in the annual bonding process.  
Uprooting investment in truly renewable energy 
The proposed change to the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of these standards. The RPS provides incentives for utilizing clean energy options to support the development of new renewable electric generation facilities. However, the proposed expansion of the definition of a Class I resource within the RPS to include existing nuclear energy will destroy the RPS by flooding the market with eligible “renewable” energy credits from existing legacy generators.   
Connecticut must develop new renewable energy resources. The facts are that load growth on the grid will require new supply in future years. We simply can’t afford to divert resources to subsidize existing generators at the expense of the growth of renewable portfolio. 
Duplicating and disrupting existing programs 
Finally, creating a redundant new state entity would only serve to unnecessarily expand the state’s bureaucracy, increase the costs associated with the state’s energy planning and procurement processes, and create a confusing web of overlapping responsibilities.  
If the goal of the bill is to address concerns about transparency and accountability, it does not make sense to create unnecessary complexities to the energy procurement process. Moreover, the proposed board has limited oversight with unclear process for stakeholder involvement and a lack of explicit consumer protections. How, then, will this board guarantee transparency and accountability? The best interest of the ratepayers, taxpayers, and residents of Connecticut would be better served by improving existing systems through thoughtful, collaborative policymaking – not what is proposed in SB 1560. 
The bottom line 
SB 1560 would not help reduce costs in the long run, and that the proposed changes would instead cripple essential programs for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other systems benefits that keep our electric grid running smoothly, cut air pollution, and save money. 
The Connecticut General Assembly must protect and continue to invest in programs that benefit Connecticut families. To make Connecticut safer, healthier, and more efficient – we must have reliable funding and access to programs that help achieve these goals.

For over a century, this American law has harmed the United States and Puerto Rico by inflating the cost of water transportation. I hope that the General Assembly will adopt this resolution and, in so doing, encourage the long-overdue reform of a law that has exacerbated the economic struggles of my island.
Passed in 1920, the Jones Act—or ley de Cabotaje as it is often referred to in Puerto Rico—limits domestic water transportation to vessels built and registered in the United States. These restrictions dramatically increase the cost of shipping. Cargo ships that fly the U.S. flag are more than four times more expensive to operate than internationally flagged ships and four to five times costlier to build.
In Puerto Rico, just two companies control 85 percent of the container capacity for transporting goods to and from the U.S. mainland. Competition is so limited that in 2008 executives from three Jones Act shipping companies pled guilty to price fixing. Such an anti-competitive arrangement was only possible because of the Jones Act.
Costly ships and restricted competition mean that Puerto Ricans must pay a premium when purchasing goods from the states. A Federal Reserve Bank of New York report found that shipping goods from the East Coast to Puerto Rico—where the Jones Act applies— cost approximately twice as much as sending those same goods to neighboring Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, where the Jones Act does not apply.
Incredibly, if Puerto Rico was sovereign and free of the Jones Act, it would actually be easier for us to purchase American products.
Instead, we are subjected to this costly law, which a 2024 academic study found imposes a $1.4 billion annual welfare burden on Puerto Rico. This is no small hardship for an island that already suffers from a 40 percent poverty rate. How can subjecting us to the Jones Act be considered a wise policy?
Aside from the obvious climate, health and economic costs of having over 95% of electric generation in Puerto Rico come from fossils, the Jones Act almost forces Puerto Rico to switch to renewables. In fact, the island’s law requires reaching 100% renewable energy by 2050. Building a resilient network of microgrids based on renewables is a necessity for Puerto Rico, not a luxury. 
In the meantime, purchasing fuel to temporarily patch up our unreliable electric grid is so much more expensive than it needs to be thanks to this obsolete and protectionist law. What most folks that follow this issue don’t realize, is that the Jones Act is bad for the United States as well.
Take Connecticut for example. While the United States is the world’s leading exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) and even has export terminals along the East Coast, New England instead imports LNG used for electricity generation at higher cost from overseas. The reason? There are no Jones Act-compliant LNG tankers to transport it domestically.
The law also makes life difficult for the state in other ways. Expensive shipping means increased trucking and rail demand, contributing to traffic on Connecticut highways. The Jones Act has made water transport so costly that, despite thousands of miles of coastline, vast rivers, the Great Lakes, and places such as Puerto Rico that can only be accessed by sea or water, it accounts for less than nine percent of domestic freight movement.
Clearly, change is needed.
The Jones Act is costly, unfair, and isn’t working. After over 100 years, reform of this law is long overdue for both the Puerto Rican and American peoples. I thank Connecticut legislators for their leadership in this effort.

This piece is part of an ongoing Mississippi Today Ideas series showcasing perspectives of mayors across the state.

Oxford is experiencing unprecedented growth and the challenges we face are unique in Mississippi.
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that in 2023 Oxford had a population of only 27,000 residents. On any given weekday in Oxford, we have more than 80,000 people in town with a student population of 23,981 (an 11% increase from last year) and workforce and visitors totaling approximately 39,000 people a day coming in from surrounding counties. On an SEC home football game, Oxford swells to more than 250,000.
In the simplest terms, Oxford has to be able to provide water and sewer service all year for 300,000 people to be able flush the toilets — even if we only need it for 10 days a year. With a tax base of 27,000, it is difficult to make those numbers work. 
The past eight years have been a rollercoaster in Oxford – from a pandemic that nobody prepared me for to growth that never stops. However, Oxford is a much stronger community with a stronger economy today than we had eight years ago. We are setting records every month in sales tax collections. New businesses are opening across our community, and almost every corner of Oxford is being developed at an incredible pace.
To make all of this work, my staff and I have to think outside of the box.       
When your greatest challenges are the result of tremendous growth in Mississippi, you say ‘thank you’ and you get busy being proactive in your planning. Planning is exactly what my staff, city employees and I have done.

Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill
I was told before I was elected in 2017 that our state and federal partners did not provide financial assistance to Oxford. I saw that as a challenge. I quickly learned that Oxford had not been told “no,” but rather Oxford had never told its story and asked for help. My team and I have secured more than $246 million dollars from our state and federal partners in the last eight years. 
That is $246 million that has been and will continue to be invested in transportation infrastructure, water and sewer infrastructure, facility upgrades and capital improvements across our community that our local taxpayers will not have to pay for. It is the result of an investment of time and relationship building in Jackson and Washington, DC. And, it’s the reward for being a community that is planning ahead and being a good steward of the funds we are granted. It also takes give-and-take between our state and federal elected officials, and we have been so blessed with great partners.
Telling our stories and seeking assistance from our state and federal partners is something every community can do. As the chairman of the Mississippi Municipal League Education Committee, I facilitated a session at our annual meeting where staff members from our United States Senate and Congressional offices attended and shared the best ways for our local elected officials to contact their offices. Our state and federal partners often do not know a community’s needs unless a community takes the time to share challenges, needs and concerns.  
Law enforcement is becoming increasingly complex, and the public’s expectations of police officers are becoming more demanding. The city of Oxford and Oxford Police Department have spent hours evaluating our mission, how we serve the community and how we can improve. 
Policing today extends beyond the realm of enforcing laws. Officers are called upon to respond to non-criminal incidents, including many situations that involve mental health issues or people who have no one else to call for help. In these cases, officers are often ill-equipped to handle the call. Afer all, they are not psychologists, psychiatrists or social workers.
We often expect officers to serve as family therapists, medical first responders, homeless advocates, school counselors and dog catchers. Each call is different, and rarely do the calls follow training scenarios; therefore, police officers and police departments must adapt, sometimes on the fly.
As first responders, the Oxford Police Department typically receives the initial call when a citizen is in need or has become the victim of a crime. Our officers respond to more than 1,000 calls per year where victim services are needed, which we define as calls such as domestic violence, sexual assaults, child abuse, harassment and stalking. Wanting to offer the best care for our citizens facing these situations, the Oxford Police Department began evaluating how we can walk hand in hand with our victims and connect them with the appropriate partners who can best serve their long-term needs. 
To meet these needs, we established a Community Response Team within the Oxford Police Department. The Community Response Team is led by a full-time employee who has completed a 10-week FBI Victims Impact Training Program and has a background in social work. This employee is dedicated to victim services, and is accompanied by volunteer officers and staff members of the Oxford Police Department. Our Community Response Team is responsible for identifying cases that could benefit from these services, training our officers to recognize these cases, and connecting our citizens to these services. 
Knowing we have amazing resources in the Oxford community, we invited all of the different victim service organizations to a roundtable discussion. This meeting allowed our police department to put together a comprehensive list of victim services available in our community, and educated our officers on these organizations. We want to operate like the Emergency Room and connect victims to the best resources available. Our goal is to provide a safe place and services needed for victims to help them move forward.
In 2017, my administration established a Safe Site in our downtown business district with the Oxford Polic Department. Uniformed officers are there Wednesday through Saturday evenings assisting patrons who feel unsafe, need assistance in finding a ride home, or would like to be escorted to their car. This Safe Site has become a great way for Oxford Police Officers to meet and build relationships with our citizens, and especially with our student population. 
Realizing that at bar closing time thousands of students are exiting bars at the same time presenting issues with securing safe rides home, my administration established three transportation hub locations in the downtown area with UBER, Lyft and local taxis participating. The rideshare companies direct people requesting rides to one of three sites where cars can stack and be waiting to offer safe rides home. Oxford Police Department has made 100 less arrests for DUI this year since our installation of the hubs.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A pair of priority bills that by fluke had ended up linked, then faced moments of conflict and potential demise, are now decoupled and moving on to next rounds of debate in the Nebraska Legislature.
Floor discussions on State Sen. Terrell McKinney’s Legislative Bill 48 and State Sen. Glen Meyer’s  LB 382 had gone on for several days before lawmakers voted Thursday to advance each separately.
At points in recent weeks, McKinney, of North Omaha, threatened to disrupt the remainder of the session if his priority bill was killed. Another lawmaker questioned whether McKinney was being mistreated because he was Black or a Democrat.
  State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha. July 26, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
His LB 48 calls for an around-the-clock Family Resource and Juvenile Assessment Center pilot program in Omaha. The goal is two sites that would address family dynamics, mental health, substance abuse and educational challenges to juvenile delinquency.
The effort will integrate “culturally relevant services delivered by and for the communities served.” Subject to available funds, up to $1 million annually for five years for the pilot would come from a Medicaid cash fund.
 ‘Not ready for prime time’

Opponents of the measure, including State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, said she counted two dozen entities in the Omaha area that offered services and she believed made the pilot redundant and duplicative.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston said the measure needed work and was “simply not ready for prime time.”
Speaker John Arch of La Vista was among lawmakers who said they came around to supporting the McKinney bill. Noting his background with Boys Town, Arch said that “not every program works with every youth,” and he saw value in the approach.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor, viewed the pilot program as aiming at the toughest to reach youth and families, and agreed with McKinney that the lawmaking body should do more for prevention programs, especially if it is beefing up penalties.

Meyer, of Pender, didn’t face outright opposition to his priority legislation, LB 382, which calls for taking $4 million over two years from a Medicaid cash fund to keep afloat services offered by the state’s eight designated agencies for the aging, including Meals-On-Wheels.
The fluke 
But when McKinney’s pilot program last month failed to garner enough votes to move forward, another lawmaker revived it by tacking it on as an amendment to Meyer’s LB 382. Meyer’s priority bill happened to be next up for discussion after McKinney’s. 
Meyer opposed the move then and in various ways tried to detach McKinney’s bill. He was among seven lawmakers who on Thursday voted against moving McKinney’s priority bill to its second reading. The vote was 30-7. 
Meyer’s LB 382 advanced Thursday to its third and final reading on a voice vote, which is allowed on second reading.

The general revenue support would be the first time state tax dollars have been appropriated directly to the program begun in 2021. The line item, a major part of Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe’s budget proposal, found favor in the Missouri House but was rejected by the state Senate when it passed spending bills last week.
The item was one of the last to be reached as budget negotiators worked through 13 spending bills paying for state operations in the coming year. All 13 bills, as well as three capital improvements bills awaiting a vote in the state Senate, must be passed by the 6 p.m. Friday constitutional deadline.
Official figures were not yet available, but tracking by The Independent shows lawmakers intend to spend $53.5 billion in the coming fiscal year.
Lawmakers negotiating Missouri budget add $300M to public schools spending

State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, said she objects to providing tax money for the tuition program because the state doesn’t prevent parents from using the scholarships to send their children to schools that are selective for academic achievement or religious beliefs.
“This is fiscally irresponsible, and quite frankly I think it’s shameful to put $50 million into funds that can directly discriminate against the students they are supposed to be serving,” she said.
The program provides stipends equal to the State Adequacy Target, the figure that drives how much money is needed for the school foundation formula, the basic aid program for public schools. Families with incomes 300% of the federal poverty guideline or less — $173,000 a year for a family of four — can apply for the aid.
Republicans argue the direct appropriation is legal and needed to expand access to the program, which was set up to be funded by donations secured by tax credits for donors. 
“This was one that was very important to the House and we passed it out very strongly,” said House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
The budget negotiating committees are 10 members, five from each chamber made up of three Republicans and two Democrats. State Rep. Marlene Terry, a St. Louis Democrat, appointed to the negotiation committee over objections of other Democrats because of her support for school choice bills, backed Republicans on the MoScholars funding.
“I believe in education and a good education for all children, whether it be private schools, charter schools, public schools,” Terry said. “We want our children to get the best education that they can, and we want to give them the help to get it.”
All of the differences, large and small, were reconciled over two days of public budget negotiations. Several big decisions were made Wednesday, including agreement to increase school funding through the foundation formula by $300 million, spend $107 million more on child care supports and to use Kehoe’s pay raise plan that rewards longevity in state employment.
The budget overall calls for spending about $210 million less than Kehoe recommended, approximately $1.9 billion more than the House version and $237 million more than the Senate voted for when it passed the budget last week.
The legislative budget calls for spending $16.2 billion of general revenue, money mainly from income and sales taxes. That is $200 million more than Kehoe proposed, $1 billion more than the House spending plan and about $391 million less general revenue than in the Senate budget.
The final budget finds savings over the Senate plan in large part by tapping a pool of almost $500 million in banked federal funds to underwrite the Medicaid program.
The Thursday meeting focused on funding for health, social services and state official and judicial budgets. Some of the decisions finalized Thursday would:

Set aside almost $93 million to pay off a judgment against the state for damages claimed by a vendor who worked on the state’s computerized Medicaid enrollment system. A $23 million judgment grew to more than $50 million as the state appealed and interest accrued. The appropriation includes both state and federal funds to allow flexibility in the way the judgment is paid.
Allow more than 300 near earmarked projects — items sought by lawmakers for their district or lobbyists seeking money for clients — with a general revenue cost of $600 million and an overall cost of $750 million. 
Cut 25 open employee slots from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ budget and one from the budget of Lt. Gov. David Wasinger. The cuts were initiated in the Senate, where Hoskins served eight years and sought repeatedly to cut unfilled jobs, while Wasinger won his job after defeating Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough in a primary last year.

Hoskins had supporters on the negotiating committee but not enough to change the decision. State Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked for five of the positions to be restored. And state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Rogersville, also backed Hoskins.
“I don’t mean to belabor what appears to be a dead horse, but I would like to ask us to consider that the new secretary of state may need some time to be able to level out what he actually does need, and maybe a little bit of grace might be appropriate,” Chappell said.
Despite the plea, Deaton made the cut stick.
“This wasn’t a House position, but our Senate colleagues are pretty impassioned here,” Deaton said.
After the meeting concluded, Hough said he is not concerned that the budget spends more general revenue than either Kehoe or the House included. The budget grows through the process, he said, as lawmakers seek help for community projects.
“A lot of members from the House and a lot of a lot of interested parties all over the state come banging on the Senate,” Hough said. “They say, ‘why would you leave $2 billion in the bank when we have investments that we’d like to see in our communities?’”

,WyoFile,2025-05-09 02:00:00+00:00,WyoFile,Property at Grand Teton gateway can’t shake polluted legacy,"Jenna McMurty, KHOL 89.1 FM",,,,,https://wyofile.com/property-at-grand-teton-gateway-cant-shake-polluted-legacy/,"

High groundwater, challenging soils and uncertain real estate development bog down Wyoming’s efforts to eliminate benzene plume.
The post Property at Grand Teton gateway can’t shake polluted legacy appeared first on WyoFile .","When the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality first started cleaning up sites with underground petroleum leaks in 1989, the state agency had a list of 37 contaminated properties in Teton County. 
That number has since dwindled to four thanks to the state’s remediation efforts, though cleanups are still underway in Jackson. 
One spot that remains is a brownfield at the north end of town on a prominent route to Grand Teton National Park. Many of the park’s more than 3 million annual visitors stream past the empty lots dotted with shipping containers and a remnant of weathered buck-and-rail fence corralling little more than weeds before reaching sought-after pristine views. 
But for Jackson — a town whose mission statement makes environmental stewardship a top priority — transforming this eyesore has been complicated.  
While past plans to develop the beleaguered site have stalled, Utah-based Mogul Capital is seeking approval from the town of Jackson to build what would be the town’s largest private commercial development on top of a plume of chemicals left behind from leaky underground fuel tanks. Like many gas stations across America, the Teton Texaco that once stood on the site’s north end contaminated the soil and groundwater, leaving behind a legacy of carcinogenic pollution that has taken decades to clean up.   
Mogul’s plans have shocked residents because of the sheer scale of the project spanning 11 lots, but there’s also concern about what’s lurking underground.
Mogul Capital has submitted a sketch plan for a five-building complex along North Cache (pictured) and North Glenwood streets in Jackson. The project includes 109 hotel rooms, 17 market-rate condominiums, 16 units deed restricted for workers, a restaurant, spa and underground parking. (Mogul Capital / Town of Jackson application)
If not addressed properly, watchdogs warn that the leftover benzene — now a fifth of its original size, according to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality — could leech into structures built above it and further contaminate groundwater or nearby Flat Creek in an area that has a high water table. 
The DEQ has consulted with AECOM, a national engineering firm, which wrote a “dig and haul” proposal to move the remaining contaminated soil off-site to Sublette County.
But in an unexpected turn, DEQ rejected its consultant’s plan. Mogul learned about the decision in the Teton Texaco annual report released last month. There are a variety of site-specific factors that caused DEQ to change course, one being that the site is a bit of a sticky wicket. Digging up contaminated soils and hauling them away has been tried before. 
“Although 186 tons of soil were removed from the site [in 1990], the contamination was not resolved,” DEQ spokesperson Kimberly Mazza said in an email. 
Removing more dirt could risk “soil liquefaction.” DEQ Storage Tank Program manager Jason Fernandez said that was a top concern because of the property’s high groundwater and tight soils. DEQ is taking into account the state highway — the one most Jackson visitors take to and from Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. 
“We were afraid if they dug a hole adjacent to those important infrastructure, roadways, sewer lines, et cetera, that those soils would collapse and possibly impact that infrastructure,” Fernandez said. “All these risks can be mitigated, but our consultant did not address them, and we did not want to buy off on a program that had that much risk.” 
Yet another approach, injecting microbes, also has shown limited results. 
“Injections were attempted several times, but also were not effective due to the soil characteristics,” Mazza said.
Wyoming’s Storage Tank Program continues to monitor contamination at the old Texaco site and will complete additional subsurface investigation work. Through monitored natural attenuation, benzene levels have decreased from 4.9 mg/L to 1.04 mg/L, according to DEQ. (Jenna McMurtry/KHOL) 
Remediation tactics used for other Jackson sites, like pumping and treating the pollution, can be slow and costly. DEQ said even with these alternatives, the initial risks don’t go away and there’s no guarantee that afterwards the plume would be gone because the site’s clay and silt tend to keep a tight grip on the benzene.  
As to why DEQ has been able to remediate other sites to the agency’s standards much faster, Fernandez said the ground beneath the old Texaco is complicated by its soil makeup. 
But that’s not the only challenge stalling clean-up efforts at the site. 
“We have multiple developers coming in, coming up with different plans, and we’re afraid that if we put a system underground, that it will just be torn up when they do construction,” Fernandez said. 
That already happened when previous Teton Texaco buildings were demolished, some of DEQ’s onsite monitoring equipment was ripped up in the process, Fernandez added. 
“We just don’t want to duplicate the work and pay for it twice,” Fernandez said. 
Since 1990, Wyoming has leaned into a federal and state-funded remediation initiative after legislators created the “storage tank corrective action account.” The Storage Tank Program has been widely considered a national success story for cleaning up leaky underground storage tanks, with Wyoming even outperforming other states.   
Wyoming’s program takes private companies responsible for the fuel leaks off the hook for cleaning up or paying for the remediation — the aim being to relieve the burden on small businesses. The same goes for future developers, which, unless they choose to take on the liability and costs associated with taking remediation a step further, are not required by the state to do so. 
“If [Mogul] doesn’t want to do that, there’s always the case that they could cap [the plume] and build over it,” Fernandez said. 
The state would still continue remediation, he said, and work underneath the new buildings.
Mogul’s latest plan is to build a “bathtub” to isolate the contaminated groundwater and soil as they keep the rest of the plume onsite and build on top of it. 
“If the DEQ says, ‘continue what we just told you,’ which is to build over and not disturb it, that’s our plan. If they come back with a different recommendation in working with the environmental consultants, we will follow that plan,” Mogul CEO Brad Wagstaff said at a recent council meeting.
Mogul is still in the conceptual planning phase for its mix of hotel rooms, condos, restaurant and spa, though the Jackson Town Council has tacked on several conditions that will steer how the development stage is approached. With the question of the plume still looming, one of the conditions requires the developer to pay for the town’s third-party environmental review to better understand the risks around the plume. 
At Monday’s council meeting, Wagstaff appeared frustrated that the town wasn’t on track to pass his sketch plan despite DEQ granting the go-ahead to keep the plume in the ground. He added that DEQ’s latest report shows the plume continues to shrink. 
“We have a buildable project that is compliant, meets all requirements to move forward with this project [and] we will continue to work with DEQ,” Wagstaff told the council. 
The council postponed a vote after two meetings deliberating on the conceptual plan and is now holding a special meeting Wednesday for the vote. 
After rejecting the last iteration, DEQ expects to have a new remediation plan by early 2026. It’s possible that Mogul’s more detailed development plan could come out before then, which made some on the town council interested in fast-tracking DEQ’s new remediation plan. 
The 2026 data point is key for the town to make an informed decision on Mogul’s development plan, at least according to Planning Director Paul Anthony. 
“That’s the risk that the developer right now is taking, having a plume on their property. That is their burden to convince us that they have met their burden and provide us the information [elected officials] need ultimately to approve the project,” Anthony said at Monday’s council meeting.

When asked if the state would speed up its new remediation plan, the DEQ said it is still working on additional subsurface investigation work and stuck to its timeline. 
“The data will be finalized at the beginning of next year,” the agency told KHOL. “Once the data is finalized, a new remedial action plan will be completed.”
The remediation methods DEQ implements are bounded by both cost and priority. The four Jackson sites the DEQ is still remediating pale in comparison to the 250 sites it is currently working on across the state, though the DEQ added that it is committed to resolving each site until it reaches its remediation standard.

The town has a population just under 3,000 and is the headquarters of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The Trump administration’s decision to abruptly cut AmeriCorps funding has had a “devastating impact” on a nonprofit school for Native American children in South Dakota, according to a lawsuit.
Red Cloud Indian School Inc., which operates schools under the Lakota name Mahpiya Luta, is one of more than a dozen plaintiffs that jointly filed a lawsuit this week challenging the funding cut.
“Red Cloud schools, their programs, and the prospects of their students and of Lakota youth who participate in AmeriCorps are at serious risk,” the lawsuit says.
AmeriCorps is a federal agency dedicated to community service and volunteerism, which works in close partnership with states. It’s the latest victim of President Donald Trump’s campaign to dismantle programs and slash the federal workforce.
As Trump slashes AmeriCorps, states lose a federal partner in community service

The agency abruptly cut $400 million, or 41% of its budget, and placed 85% of its staff on administrative leave last month, according to court records. AmeriCorps had provided $960 million to fund 3,100 projects across the United States each year, according to general undated figures available on the agency’s website.
Red Cloud Indian School Inc. operates two elementary schools, one middle school, a high school and a Lakota language immersion program on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwest South Dakota. For 26 years, according to the lawsuit, the nonprofit has received AmeriCorps awards. The awards have enabled the training of over 400 Lakota AmeriCorps participants as teaching assistants and paraprofessional educators, offering career and job training opportunities in one of the nation’s poorest regions.
AmeriCorps told Red Cloud via email on April 25 that its grant was terminated, that all grant activities should cease, and that the action was not administratively appealable, the lawsuit says. 
In the past three years, the nonprofit received approximately $400,000 a year in AmeriCorps funding. The money enabled Red Cloud to recruit local Lakota AmeriCorps participants to serve as teaching assistants for a duration of one to three years. The participants joined in groups of four to five to assist a staff teacher with classes of approximately 20 students. 
The participants provided students with individualized support in math, literacy and social-emotional development, while also gaining teaching skills. Students benefited from one-on-one attention with participants they viewed as role models.
Many AmeriCorps participants pursued college degrees concurrently. Ten of Red Cloud’s current teachers began as AmeriCorps participants. 
“The program’s success is evident in its improved student outcomes and strengthened community empowerment through a career pipeline into education,” the lawsuit says.

As of last month, Red Cloud had 11 AmeriCorps participants serving in its teaching assistant program. The organization felt a moral obligation to retain the participants through the end of the school year on May 16, the lawsuit says, which has “placed an unexpected financial strain” on the nonprofit. The school is not in a position to retain the participants through July 31, when the AmeriCorps grant was set to expire, the lawsuit says.
Fourteen organizations, the union representing AmeriCorps staffers and three individual plaintiffs who were AmeriCorps members filed the lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.
Besides Red Cloud in South Dakota, the other nonprofits bringing the lawsuit are based in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
On April 29, attorneys general from nearly two dozen states and the District of Columbia also sued alleging the cuts were illegal. South Dakota’s attorney general is not included in that group.
In a statement provided Thursday to States Newsroom, the White House defended the cuts.
“AmeriCorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in unaccounted for payments in 2024 alone. President Trump is restoring accountability to the entire Executive Branch,” said spokesperson Anna Kelly.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)The father of the teenager who shot and killed two people at a Madison private school and took her own life five months ago was arrested Thursday and charged with three felony counts in connection with the December shootings.
Jeffrey Rupnow, 42, was charged with two counts of intentionally giving a dangerous weapon to a person under the age of 18 and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. All are Class H felonies under Wisconsin law, subject to a fine of up to $10,000 or a prison sentence of up to six years, or both.
Rupnow was booked into the Dane County jail just before 5:30 a.m. Thursday, according to the jail’s online records.
He is the father of Natalie Rupnow, the 15-year-old student at Abundant Life Christian School on Madison’s east side who entered the school in the middle of the morning on Dec. 16, 2024, shot and killed a teacher and a student, wounded six other people and then took her own life, all within a matter of minutes.
According to the criminal complaint, which was unsealed Thursday after Rupnow’s early morning arrest, Rupnow purchased two guns for his daughter: a 22-caliber handgun and later a Glock 9 mm pistol — the weapon that was used in the shooting. He said Natalie helped pay for the Glock and he purchased it for her from a gun store, the complaint states.
“All of these weapons, including [a third] one that was about to be gifted to the same teen, were purchased legally,” Madison Police Department Acting Chief John Patterson said at a Thursday afternoon press conference.
“There was a gun safe in the home. Based on our investigation, it did not stop the teenager from having regular access” to the contents,  he said.
Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said the case “is a call and an action to hold parents accountable … if their children can access their firearms.”
Rhodes-Conway said she wanted to see the Legislature take up “a number of really common sense proposals that have been around for years” to reduce gun violence. Those include measures such as universal background checks before people can purchase a gun as well as “red flag” laws that empower the courts to remove guns from owners who may represent a credible threat to others.
“The other piece of this is really making sure that responsible gun owners are doing everything they can to make sure that those guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them,” she said.
Patterson said Rupnow has been cooperative with police throughout the investigation.
In interviews with police, Natalie’s parents as well as two friends described her behavior as depressed and sometimes angry at her parents, who are divorced.
“Why would a 15-year-old open fire in her school and murder a teacher, classmates, and injure six others? We may never fully understand that horror,” Patterson said. “We do know the teenager had a fascination with weapons and school shootings.”
The complaint states that in June 2022 Madison police officers told Jeffrey Rupnow “of high-risk behavior that [Natalie] was engaging in via the internet.” The complaint does not elaborate further on that report. “I can’t speak further to the follow-up that was done” at that time, Patterson said.
Patterson said the investigation remains open in the case. He declined to comment about reports that people in other states were in touch with Natalie Rupnow online.
According to the complaint, Jeffrey Rupnow told police he had 11 guns, including two that were considered Natalie’s. He told police his daughter became interested in guns after he took her to a friend’s farm to shoot guns about two years ago and that they would occasionally go to a shooting range.
Because of her interest, Rupnow told police he bought her a 22-caliber handgun and later the Glock, according to the complaint.
The complaint states that Rupnow described occasional comments by his daughter about wanting to kill herself, but that he generally viewed those remarks as attention-seeking behavior.
Rupnow told police he had a gun safe where he kept all of the guns, including those he had purchased for his daughter. The safe was locked with a security code. He told police he had not told his daughter the code itself, but that he had told her that it was his Social Security number backwards, in case she needed to get into it.
The complaint states that police found maps of the school and a cardboard mockup that appeared to be of the school building among Natalie Rupnow’s things at home.
Police also found notebooks and what Patterson called a “manifesto” — a six-page document titled “War Against Humanity.” That and other documents suggested a fascination with other mass shootings, including one in 2007 by an 18-year-old in Finland, which she noted in one of her writings took place two years after she was born.
In addition, police found and reviewed 30 sets of camcorder videos, some of them with Natalie handling weapons and some depicting what appeared to be animal mutilation, according to the complaint.
According to the complaint, Natalie took both of her handguns to the school on Dec. 16, the day of the shooting, but apparently used only the Glock.
The complaint states she arrived at the school just before 10:40 a.m. and entered a classroom just before 10:50 a.m.
A student in the classroom, a study hall, told police that once in the classroom,  Natalie held the gun with both hands and aimed it at the teacher who was sitting at her desk in the front of the room. The student said he heard gunshots and ran to the back of the room, where he hid behind a beanbag chair.
After the shooting stopped, the student saw Natalie Rupnow lying on the floor on her back, with the gun in her hand. The student told police he removed the gun from her hand and put it in a drawer “because he wanted to make sure that no one else got a hold of it,” the complaint states. The police later retrieved the gun from the drawer.
The teacher, Erin Michelle West, and one student, Rubi Bergara, were both killed, according to the Dane County Medical Examiner’s office. Six other students were wounded. One remains hospitalized, Patterson said.

Among the surprises: mysterious tunnels; intact cream bottle lids that spilled out when a vault was struck and an entire foundation of a brick building.

“We knew there’d be debris, but not to this degree,” said Tom McLeay of Clarity Real Estate Companies, a co-developer of the 194-unit Oxworth apartment complex that will span an entire city block. “It’s almost like we’re amateur archeologists, discovering this century-old dairy foundation that hasn’t seen the light of day for 40 years.”
McCleay spoke Thursday — as site work paused for a ceremonial groundbreaking — about challenges as well as anticipated rewards of developing the market-rate dwellings and garage facility at 27th and Leavenworth Streets, west of the downtown of Nebraska’s biggest city.
 $43 million project

The $43 million project, expected to open in 2027, is buoyed by $6.5 million in public tax-increment financing, a statewide tool aimed at spurring development and jobs in blighted areas. 
McLeay said TIF — controversial because it uses increased property tax revenue from the new development to pay for eligible redevelopment costs — is vital to projects such as the Oxworth.
Without the incentive to defray expenses, he said that he and codeveloper Assurity Life Insurance of Lincoln would not pursue such a venture in a tight, infill area where construction risks are greater than in the green fields of suburbia.
“You don’t deal with this if you go out to a cornfield and put an apartment building on top of it,” said McLeay, noting that his crew had to dig a huge hole about 40 feet deep to remove what was left of the Alamito Dairy, razed in the 1980s.
A TIF-assisted project must meet eligibility criteria, including that it would not be possible “but for” the aid. The tool has both staunch supporters and opponents, with critics saying that some city governments have gotten too generous in approving TIF. 
The state auditor has warned lawmakers about downsides of the fast-growing incentive.
 In streetcar zone

The Omaha City Council has approved the financing mechanism for the Oxworth project. Because it is in a so-called “zone of influence” near the coming Omaha streetcar route, 10% of the project’s TIF proceeds must, under city ordinance, go to construction of the streetcar initiative.

The Oxworth is so named to honor both the dairy factory formerly at the site (an ox is in the same genus as cows) and the street upon which it sits (Leavenworth).
When completed, the 1.45-acre site that had been largely vacant for decades, will offer apartments ranging from studio to two-bedroom dwellings with rents from about $1,000 to $2,000 a month.
The complex will include various amenities, including a courtyard with a firepit and picnic area. Also at the site will be a clubhouse with a gym and community rooms repurposed from a 125-year-old former cold storage building that was left from the Alamito Dairy operation. Most recently that structure was used as an upholstery shop.
About 150 parking stalls will be available, all but a dozen of them inside. 
 Area has ‘evolved’ 

According to the Omaha World-Herald, the Alamito business moved to a new three-story concrete building at the 27th and Leavenworth site in 1914, and closed in 1977. It was known as the city’s first modern milk producer-distributor that operated from 1902 to 1977, and apparently named for a trotting stallion.

McLeay said his company has owned the property for about a decade but believes now is the time to build — particularly with the 2027 projected start of the streetcar that will run along nearby corridors, from downtown to midtown.
“The neighborhood has evolved so nicely,” said McLeay, adding that the free streetcar and Leavenworth Street bus line should offer new residents and workers convenient access to downtown and midtown events, restaurants and attractions.
He imagines Oxworth residents as bus riders, streetcar riders, cyclists, scooter users and drivers.
McLeay said he sees continued redevelopment and transportation options in the urban core as ways the city may be able to stop “brain drain” and retain or pull talent to Omaha — including his own two daughters who left town for college or a job.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump has endorsed incumbent Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, for reelection.
In a social media post Thursday afternoon, Trump said Begich “is doing an incredible job representing the Great People of Alaska, a State I love, and WON BIG THREE TIMES, in 2016, 2020, and 2024!”
Begich responded by posting a social media message of his own, thanking Trump for his support.
“Together we are working to Unlock Alaska’s FULL potential!” Begich wrote.
In the 2024 U.S. House election, Begich was Trump’s second choice. He initially supported Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, but when Dahlstrom withdrew from the race after finishing third in the primary election, Trump switched to Begich.
In 2024, Begich defeated incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, by 7,876 votes out of 321,846 counted, or 2.44 percentage points.
Begich is the only candidate who has formally indicated his intent to run for Alaska’s seat in the 2026 election so far. 
The national Democratic Party has named Alaska as one of its top targets for the 2026 election, but no candidates have yet signed up to challenge Begich.
Campaign finance documents published by the Federal Elections Commission show Peltola as a candidate, but that is incorrect; Peltola has $20,794.30 remaining from her 2024 election run.
Begich raised more than $800,000 during the first quarter of 2025 for his reelection campaign, with much of the money coming from Republican-aligned political committees. Jeffery Hildebrand, the billionaire owner of oil and gas firm Hilcorp, also was a major contributor.
The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is supporting Begich’s reelection, said in a statement that the Trump endorsement and Begich’s fundraising shows his “growing momentum” for 2026.
Under Alaska’s elections system, all candidates run in the same primary election, and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election, where a winner is chosen by ranked choice voting.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)At his third annual sustainable energy conference last year, Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy featured a relatively straight-laced group of scientific experts and Biden administration officials.
At this year’s conference in June, with President Donald Trump promoting American “energy dominance” and trying to boost oil production, the conference’s agenda has taken a sharp righthand turn: One of the “featured speakers” at the June event is Alex Epstein, a fossil fuel evangelist from California and author of a 2022 book titled “Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas — Not Less.”
Epstein’s website lists a standard $37,000 fee to speak at an in-person event. He did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday; a Dunleavy spokesman, Grant Robinson, said that the conference’s speaker agreements “are not public information.”
If there’s a fee, Robinson said, it would be negotiated between the speaker and the contractor that’s helping to organize the energy conference, and it would be “paid with conference sponsorships and ticket revenue.”
Epstein, a self-described “philosopher and energy expert,” has testified multiple times before U.S. Congress and asserts that policies to reduce fossil fuel use among developing countries are “immoral.” His arguments and talking points on behalf of expanded fossil fuel consumption have made him a favorite speaker for some conservative elected officials and their ideological allies.
Also joining Epstein as a featured speaker is Daniel Turner, whose national group, Power the Future, has aggressively promoted expanded extraction of Alaska’s coal, oil and natural gas and says “renewables are not the answer.” Turner describes his work as fighting “to protect American energy workers from the eco-Left” and from “Hollywood phonies.”
In a press release Tuesday, Dunleavy’s office said the conference would explore the future of energy in Alaska and on a global scale. Its focus will include artificial intelligence and the electricity needed to power data centers, advancements in renewable and nuclear power and the “continued responsible development of Alaska oil, gas, and mineral resources,” the release said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature is moving rapidly to pass a bill that would force Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration to disclose reports that could show the state settling oil tax disputes for significantly less than what is owed.
“This bill shouldn’t be necessary, but here we are today,” said Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage and chair of the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee, in a Thursday hearing by the House Rules Committee.
“Either the Department of Revenue has already compiled the information requested in the special audit for its own use and is deliberately withholding it from the legislative auditor, or it has failed to do the basic work of calculating the tax, interest, and penalties assessed for each audit cycle,” she said. “Frankly, I’m not sure which of those scenarios would be more troubling.”
The Senate passed Senate Bill 183 on a 19-0 vote Monday. The House of Representatives could vote on it as soon as Friday.
Dunleavy could veto it, allow it to pass into law without his signature, or sign it. 
If enacted, it would require the executive branch to disclose information “in the form or format requested” by legislative auditors.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the Legislature is responsible for overseeing executive branch operations, but since 2019, the legislative auditor has been unable to properly examine the part of the Department of Revenue that audits tax payments by oil and gas companies.
“In the past, the Department of Revenue provided the Legislature with organized summaries showing the total amount of additional tax, interest and penalties assessed for each annual tax cycle,” Gray-Jackson said. “However, the department now claims it is only required to provide access to raw data, not to compile or categorize information in a usable format, as it had done previously.”
Though legislators can examine raw data, they don’t have the resources to process them. The change makes analyzing the executive branch’s actions impossible, Gray-Jackson said.
Legislators have written letters and asked for access, to no avail.
“Unfortunately, the issue remains unresolved, and the auditor still cannot complete this  important audit, which concerns the oversight of billions of dollars in state oil and gas revenue,” she said.
Until 2019, the first year of Dunleavy’s administration, Department of Revenue tax auditors regularly published a memo summarizing total tax and interest assessed after its annual audit cycle.
By combining that information with the amount paid in settlements, lawmakers and the public could see what share of assessed taxes and interest were being paid. 
Without the tax and interest information, it’s not clear how oil companies’ settlement payments compare with the original state assessments.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the Legislature is responsible for overseeing executive branch operations, and the memo was part of that oversight.
When the memos stopped, legislative auditors asked for them and were told that they were now confidential.
At the time, members of the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee were so concerned that they commissioned a special audit of the executive branch’s auditors.
For five years, they’ve been unsuccessful. Members of the executive branch say they’re not required to turn over compiled reports, only raw data.
“That interpretation overturns long-standing precedent,” said legislative auditor Kris Curtis, “and it essentially limits the oversight by the Legislature. The fear is that state agencies from here on out will refuse to provide or compile data in any type format for future legislative audits.”
Destin Greeley, an audit supervisor for the Department of Revenue, testified Thursday that providing what Curtis requested “is creating this new work product that is very time-consuming and trying to put a square peg in a round hole for us.”
Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, said she doesn’t understand why that suddenly became difficult for the Department of Revenue to do.
“I am not buying your story, and this is a huge red flag for me,” she said.
“When you’ve got hundreds of millions of dollars involved, I’m worried,” Stutes said.
Legislative attorney Emily Nauman said she believes the new bill will resolve the ongoing dispute “if the department complies with the law.”
If not, she said, the topic could head to the courts.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina legislators wrapped up a pair of bills in the final days of the legislative session that, a week before, seemed doubtful of becoming law this year. Without agreements reached on liquor insurance relief for restaurants and a sweeping energy package that paves the way for a new gas-fired power plant in the Lowcountry, accomplishments for the 2025 could have been short.
Instead, the chambers’ ruling Republicans touted Thursday getting most of their goals accomplished, when including this week’s deals with last week’s compromise on state aid for private K-12 tuition, and stiffer penalties for professional shoplifters, which passed in March.
“You measure your success on the substance of bills that pass, and we really concentrated on big-ticket items,” House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Smith, told reporters.
“There are certain things that we had to get done, and we addressed those things,” said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield.
Meanwhile, a House GOP priority to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs across state government and private contractors passed that chamber but got nowhere in the Senate. And a Senate initiative to remove State Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error was never addressed by the House.

While mainstream GOP leadership took a victory lap at the session’s conclusion, Democratic leadership and members of the ultra-right House Freedom Caucus referred to the 2025 session as “uneventful.”
“In the big picture, we did not do any momentous legislation that’s going to be remembered long after this year,” said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto.
That is, unless the voucher bill survives an expected court challenge, which the Orangeburg Democrat told reporters he doesn’t believe will happen.
“We don’t think that that should be in the future in this state, and certainly don’t believe the bill is constitutional,” he said.
Massey, however, said “I feel much better this time” about the new scholarship program’s chances before the state Supreme Court. “I think we corrected those things” that led to the high court’s ruling last fall that ended private tuition payments as unconstitutional.
Gov. Henry McMaster signed the latest private school choice program into law Wednesday. A lawsuit is considered imminent.
Rep. Jordan Pace, R-Goose Creek, who leads the Freedom Caucus, said he thought the Legislature didn’t go far enough to address conservative priorities.
Legislators must still return in the coming weeks to finalize the state budget that takes effect July 1.
The House and Senate so far agree on raises for teachers and funding for more police officers in schools. Plus, state employees won’t be asked to pay more for health insurance. Differences the chambers must sort out include the use of debit cards for the purchase of lottery tickets, whether or not to allow colleges to raise tuition on an incremental basis, and a possible pay raise for legislators.
One big change from previous state budgets: This year’s package won’t include any spending requested by legislators for local projects, or what’s called earmarks.
The decision comes two years after total earmarks soared to $713 million. While last year’s tally was smaller, at $435 million, Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler called for a one-year hiatus in an effort to reign in the unvetted spending. Some pushed back, arguing the freeze leaves small and rural districts behind.
Peeler said the process could be different: It could become a competitive grant process. Hutto said he’s fine with that, as long as there is a process to fund community needs. Massey, who helped lead the charge for transparency in the earmark process, called the lack of such local funding “a huge win.”
‘Is this pork?’ SC Democrat highlights what won’t get aid due to earmark refusal

What passed?
Among legislation that McMaster’s already signed into law is a bill merging three health agencies that provide services for people with mental health issues, disabilities, and drug and alcohol addictions.
Passage comes a year after a larger merger attempt, which involved those three additional agencies, was successfully blocked by the Freedom Caucus in a chaotic close to the 2024 session.
Other signed bills include legislation upping the number of family court judges in the state, stiffer penalties for professional shoplifters, and an educator-endorsed bill pledging increased teacher pay transparency, job stability as well as more planning time.
Bills passed in the waning days of session that await the governor’s signature include a hands-free driving law to deter scrolling behind the wheel. Without passage of some kind of hands-free law, South Carolina risked losing $40 million to $80 million in annual federal highway funding.
Without a hands-free driving law, SC could lose upwards of $40M in federal road funding

Legislators also passed bills setting rules for South Carolinians who rent out their personal cars to earn extra cash, requiring labeling of lab-grown meat, and a final-day compromise on a measure to criminalize the use of technology to morph children’s photos into pornographic images.
And in a flurry of last-day confirmations, the Senate appointed a new head for the state’s child welfare agency. Tony Catone, acting director of the state Department of Social Services, will now move into the role permanently.
“I have full confidence that (Catone) is the right person to build on the agency’s critical work to strengthen families and protect our most vulnerable children and adults,” McMaster said in a statement following the confirmation.
Still, senators have refused to confirm McMaster’s pick to head the state Department of Public Health. However, Dr. Edward Simmer remains the agency’s acting head indefinitely, unless the governor nominates a replacement.
When it comes to legislation, the governor has no plans to veto any bills passed at this time, according to spokesman Brandon Charochak.
He did send a warning, however, ahead of the chambers’ budget negotiations about where he would use his line-item veto powers. If they send him a budget with the House’s proposal loosening strings attached to additional state funding for universities that freeze in-state tuition rates, the governor will strike that, Charochak said.
McMaster has said he will not support any measure that raises tuition for South Carolina college students who choose to attend one of the state’s public higher education institutions.
What’s next?
House GOP advances new plan that initially cuts SC income taxes by $400M

As the first year of a two-year session, any legislation that did not pass both chambers can still be taken up in the new year.
The 2026 session will likely start with work on a GOP plan to restructure state income taxes.
Following major pushback on an initial plan that would have actually raised taxes for nearly 60% of tax filers, House leaders advanced a revamped plan, which would cut taxes for more filers than would see an increase. The House sent that over to the Senate this week.
Come January, Massey hopes to take up stiffer penalties for drunken driving.
“Our DUI walls are really weak,” he said after session ended. “There are a lot of people being hurt and killed because of them.
And an effort remains to allow a casino near the southern shore of Lake Marion.
While the proposal is likely to face fierce opposition, both in the Senate and from the governor, its advancement to the House floor shows a new willingness by Republicans to consider legalized gaming in a state that has historically resisted any change to anti-gambling laws.
Also, as part of compromises on energy and liquor insurance, legislators agreed to continue work in the off-season to develop new, stand-alone legislation to address those provisions excluded from the bills passed this week.

The state’s Renewable Energy Fund, for example, has helped build more than 100 operating projects across Alaska — enabling rural communities to reduce their reliance on costly diesel, and slowing the Railbelt’s consumption of Cook Inlet’s dwindling natural gas supplies. 
Renewable energy investments build real projects in Alaska, generating savings for ratepayers and building our energy security. That’s why, as former Republican and Democratic Alaska legislators, we went to bat for policies and investments that helped develop our state’s vast renewable resources.
State investment in renewable energy is now bringing in major federal dollars thanks to legislation approved by Congress in 2021 and 2022. The current version of the state budget for the coming year includes close to $100 million in funding for renewables — primarily from federal sources. 
Federal investments will support a range of energy projects across the state. There are funds to help electrify port infrastructure in Seward, upgrade rural power systems, weatherize homes to reduce Alaskans’ home heating bills, and begin long-needed transmission improvements. These and more projects are described in a recent report, Securing Our Energy Future: Perspectives from Alaskans on the Importance of Federal Clean Energy Incentives. 
U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski have been working to ensure previously awarded energy funds are delivered as promised. But there is a fight ahead. The future of federal clean energy incentives is at risk in the coming federal budget process. Our congressional delegation understands the benefits of these federal clean energy incentives for Alaska — and they need to know Alaskans are behind them. 
Please join us in urging our delegation — Sen. Sullivan, Sen. Murkowski, and Rep. Begich — to safeguard these powerful tools so Alaska’s commitment to renewable energy gets the federal partnership we deserve.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Bills updating the grain indemnity program and allowing the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship clean titles on livestock they take over, advanced Thursday from the Iowa House.
Lawmakers appear to have resolved differing opinions on grain indemnity limits and including credit-sales, which has been a roadblock for similar bills in the past, though the Senate will have to give final approval to the amended bill.
Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, who managed the bill, said there were a lot of opinions on the policy, which left him feeling “caught between a rock and hard spot.”
“I believe, at the end of the day, we have a better product because of that cooperation between everybody,” Mommsen said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Although the House accepted some of the Senate’s version of the bill, Mommsen proposed an amendment to Senate File 608. 
Mommsen explained grain indemnity as being “like FDIC insurance on a savings account.” Since the 1980s, when it was created, the grain indemnity fund has helped farmers get paid for sold grain when their buyers go broke. 
Farmers pay a per bushel fee into the grain indemnity fund when the fund is below its lower boundary, and they stop paying once it reaches the upper boundary. The fund stayed above the minimum for nearly 30 years until 2023, when the bankruptcy of a soybean dealer triggered more than $3 million in indemnity claims from affected farmers and depleted the funds. 
Mommsen said the goal was to “upgrade” the rules around the fund to “better respond to today’s market conditions.”
One such upgrade included increasing the fund’s minimum from $3 million to $8 million, and the maximum from $8 million to $16 million to reflect the changes. These figures reflected the original version of the House bill, but were an increase from the $5 million and $12 million figures in the version that passed the Senate. 
Cash-sale contracts would be reimbursed at 90% under the bill, which is consistent with current law. The bill updates the fund to include some credit-sale contracts and Mommsen’s amendment provided definitions for two different types of credit sales. 
Per the amendment, a deferred-payment contract means the dealer and seller agreed on a price for grain but the payment will take place more than 30 days from the date of delivery. These contracts are not eligible for indemnity claims.
A deferred-pricing contract means the grain was delivered without an agreed-upon price. Farmers with these contracts can claim indemnity for 75% or up to $400,000 of their losses. 
Earlier versions of the bill in the House only covered 70% of these types of sales, and the version of the bill that passed the Senate did not differentiate between the different types of credit sales. 
Mommsen said it was important to differentiate because deferred payments are like “an unsecured loan.” 
Rep. J.D. Scholten, R-Sioux City, said it felt “pretty impactful” to have a bill in the House updating a fund that rose out of the farm crisis of the 1980s. 
“When we do have an agricultural recession we’re dealing with, when we’re dealing with tariffs that are causing uncertainty, farmers need to make sure they have the protection they (need),” Scholten said. “This may not be the perfect bill, but this is a good enough bill.”
IDALS announced in April the fund would stop collecting the fees in September since the current grain indemnity fund balance sits above $10 million, after collecting the fees since Sept. 2023. 
Mommsen said because the current balance is within the boundaries set by the bill, “there would be no need to reinstitute” assessment fees for the fund if the bill becomes law. 
The amended bill passed 81-3. 
IDALS policy bill 
The House sent Senate File 632, which updated regulations for the department of agriculture, to the governor’s desk.
The bill allows IDALS to have a clean title on livestock in the event the department must intervene to take care of the animals. 
This issue arose in October when the state took over care for more than a million poultry following the bankruptcy of Pure Prairie Poultry, Inc. The department was unable to sell the birds to a processor because of existing liens on the birds. As a result, the state had to cull the birds. 
Mommsen said the bill would also clean up terminology, remove the requirement of an oral examination for pesticide licenses, and allow the Iowa Board of Veterinary Medicine to revoke licenses and assess civil penalties of up to $10,000. 
The bill passed from the House unanimously.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ education secretary notified the state education board Thursday of his intent to recommend a Level 5 – Intensive Support classification for the Blytheville School District due to ongoing academic and administrative challenges. 
Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said, with the board’s support, he’d like to schedule a special board meeting in Blytheville in the next two to three weeks so they can hear from community members and formally recommend increasing the district’s current Level 4 classification to the highest level of state support. 
“This is a school district where there’s opportunities for students and families to be very successful. There is no reason that this school district should continue to be the failure factory that it is,” Oliva said. “And it’s becoming more and more apparent the reason they’re in the state they are is because they do lack governance and leadership.”
The State Board of Education visited Blytheville in August after being alerted to concerns with the Northeast Arkansas district last July. The district has struggled with declining student enrollment over the last decade, according to Deputy Commissioner Stacy Smith, who provided an overview of Blytheville’s situation to the board at its monthly meeting Thursday. The district has 1,260 students this year, about half of its 2014 enrollment. 
Students are struggling academically, according to last year’s statewide testing scores, which showed more than half of students in English language arts and science and 76% of students in math scored in the lowest achievement level, Smith said. 
About half of Blytheville’s teachers are unlicensed, but the education department has helped them all get on licensure pathways, she said.
Arkansas Department of Education and Crowley’s Ridge Education Service Cooperative staff have provided about 100 and 185 days, respectively, of onsite support and training, Smith said. 


Let us know what you think...


 

There’s been a “dance of inconsistency” at the district, which was making progress but now appears to be backsliding, she said. While staff members seem receptive to making changes, Smith said there’s dysfunction between the central office and the Blytheville School Board because “we don’t have the right people in either place.”
Since 2018, the district has had two full-time superintendents and three interim superintendents. Jennifer Blankenship was appointed as the current interim superintendent on June 12, 2024. She also served in the interim role from July through December 2021. 
After the previous superintendent was officially terminated last August, the board reviewed candidates in late November and decided to keep Blankenship. A consulting firm hired in February presented two of 13 applicants in late April, but the board declined to interview them and reposted the position. 
“Our biggest concern at this point is we are in May and we have no superintendent, and we have walked with this district for an entire year providing lots of support,” Smith said. 
Arkansas education board removes Lee County’s fiscal distress status

Though the board unanimously agreed to reject the superintendent candidates, Smith said there’s a “lack of coherence” and dysfunction within the board. 
“When we were there before, much of the public comment in the meeting was about the dysfunction of the board, it wasn’t about what was happening in the school,” she said. “It was about this public image of the board.”
State education board members expressed support for Oliva’s request for the special meeting, including Blytheville native Randy Henderson who said he was “very disappointed” in the situation. Fellow board member Jeff Wood cautioned his colleagues that upgrading Blytheville’s classification to a Level 5 isn’t something that should be taken lightly. 
“Level 5 intervention rarely has the celebratory results that we’re looking for on the backside of Level 5; it is not an answer in itself,” Wood said. “There is still a long road of work ahead even after Level 5 consideration. I would hope for a strong plan, decisive plan, quick action plan because one thing I learned in the Level 5 I lived through is just the slow process of it didn’t work.”
Wood was appointed in 2016 to serve on the Little Rock School District’s Community Advisory Board when ADE took over that district. When the district was returned to local control in November 2020, Wood was elected to serve on the district’s new school board. 
The process of considering the classification change must begin with written notification to the Blytheville School District about the intent to recommend the Level 5 classification, Smith said. The district has the right to appeal and ask for a hearing, or the board can make the recommendation without a hearing, she said. 
If the classification is approved, the board can determine what sanctions go along with it, such as dissolving the local board or approving a state takeover of the district. 
Districts currently under the Level 5 classification are Earle, Lee County, Helena-West Helena and Marvell-Elaine.

Budget lines in proposed Iowa House legislation for primary and secondary education programs across Iowa have shifted after negotiation with the other chamber, said Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, in an appropriations committee meeting Thursday.
Harris introduced an amendment to House Study Bill 337, setting the budget for Iowa Department of Education, state universities, community colleges and other education programs across the state. Numbers from the amendment reflect what was decided upon after negotiations with the Iowa Senate, he said.
Iowa House and Senate Republicans reach budget agreement

Rather than decrease funding for universities governed by the Iowa Board of Regents, as was proposed in the original version of the bill, the University of Iowa, University of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University would receive flat funding for the upcoming fiscal year.
Community colleges would see a $7.5 million increase in funding with the amended legislation, which Harris said was “about $7.5 million more than what the Senate initially wanted to do.”
Senate legislation for education appropriations would keep funding flat for community colleges, compared to the original House bill, which would have provided an additional $8 million for the system.
Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, said she would not vote in favor of the amendment, as the “education subgroup on the amendment” preferred the previous proposed IJAG funding and had concerns about flat university funding causing families to have to pay more due to tuition increases.
She added she and others are worried about cuts to special education funding. Harris said the proposed $5 million funding cut is the result of conversations with the Iowa Department of Education, in which officials said the special education division was planning to spend less than $2.5 million of the $10 million it was allocated last year.

“I’m not sure that we’ve seen the total repercussions yet of those changes within the school system, and I think that’s why they’re having, probably, a difficult time finding staff,” Brown-Powers said.
Harris said he agreed with Brown-Powers about liking the original budget set by the House education appropriations subcommittee, but what he brought forward was the compromise that could be reached.
“I preferred, actually, all of our original numbers, not just on this budget, but all the other budgets,” Harris said. “But that’s part of negotiations.”
The amendment passed, and the full bill was moved to the House floor with a 17-5 vote.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Majority-party lawmakers in the Legislature have reached a budget agreement, House Republicans announced Thursday, signaling the 2025 legislative session is nearing an end.
In a news release, House and Senate Republicans released the spending figures from their budget agreement — a total of $9.425 billion in state appropriations for fiscal year 2026. The compromise is $28 million less than the House Republicans’ initial budget target and $8 million more than Senate Republicans and Gov. Kim Reynolds’ target released in April.
The road to reach an agreement included some public disputes between GOP legislative leaders and the governor over specific budget items. One of the major points of contention was $14 million in pay for paraeducators and other school staff that was first allocated in the 2024 law making changes to Iowa’s Area Education Agencies.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, the House Appropriations Chair, said the budget agreement will provide this funding for paraeducator pay, alongside some other House GOP funding priorities, through the Sports Wagering Fund. The state fund is where taxes on sports betting and internet fantasy sports are collected — which currently contains more than $40 million.
The one-time spending from this pool will go to these budget items for the fiscal year, Mohr said, with the expectation that spending on these programs will come from the state’s general fund in future years when revenues increase.
The allocation from the Sports Wager Fund comes on top of commitments to draw from the state’s reserves and Taxpayer Relief Fund already expected for the upcoming fiscal year, as the budget comes in above projected state revenues. The state’s general fund is expected to collect $8.5 billion in FY 2026, according to the Iowa Revenue Estimating Conference in March, driven in part by cuts to the state income tax and federal financial uncertainty.
Mohr said he believes spending of these one-time funds will not put the state in a bad position heading into future years, as state revenue is expected to increase. The state’s reserves — totaling more than $6 billion — were factored into the decision to make income tax cuts in 2024, he said.
“If you look back at the history of Iowa revenue, we expect over time, revenue will increase much faster than state spending,” Mohr said. “So again, while we knew we were going to (need) to take dollars out of the savings accounts, we don’t expect that to continue for five or 10 years. Yes, we knew it was going to be necessary for the first few years, but we expect state revenues will be sufficiently higher in the out years to offset, so we’re not continually taking money out of the reserve savings.”
Governor announces support
Reynolds released a statement Thursday supporting the budget agreement.
“As I’ve said for the last few weeks, my priority with the budget is maintaining fiscal discipline and putting Iowa taxpayers first,” the governor said. “This agreement among all three parties does just that, and I want to thank Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate for coming together to keep Iowa on a strong and fiscally sustainable path.”
The House Appropriations Committee passed several spending bills Thursday afternoon that reflected the compromise reached between the chambers. The education appropriations bill, House Study Bill 337, included $7.5 million for community colleges, lower than the $8 million proposed by House Republicans but still “about $7.5 million more than what the Senate initially wanted to do,” Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, said.
GOP budget agreement gives increase to community colleges but not state universities

The House bills for the administration and regulation budget, House Study Bill 343, and for the agriculture and natural resources budget, House Study Bill 338, were also passed in the committee meeting. Democrats expressed frustration with the changes made through the compromise, saying they preferred House Republicans’ initial spending proposal.
Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, praised Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, who ran the subcommittee for the agriculture and natural resources appropriations bill, for including and answering questions about Democrats’ and advocates’ wants and concerns during the budgeting process.
“This is certainly not what we would have put together as Democrats for this budget, but I just want to express my appreciation for the process that he laid out for this,” Bagniewski said.
There are still several appropriations bills left, including the standings bill that contains paraeducator pay, and the health and human services budget bill. Mohr told the committee he is expecting to have another committee meeting Monday, but House Republican staff confirmed they do not plan to meet Friday or over the weekend to wrap up session.
While House lawmakers will not be back until next week, senators are scheduled to hold floor debate Friday. On the tentative debate calendar are several budget bills.
Eminent domain bill on Senate calendar
Also on the schedule is House File 639 — the bill passed earlier this year by the House that combined several earlier measures aimed at the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. It would raise requirements for pipeline operators, change the definition of a common carrier eligible for eminent domain, and add new requirements surrounding the Iowa Utilities Commission.
The measure was passed through the committee process in the Senate with Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, recommending a significant amendment, but it has not come to the floor. The Senate has not brought up legislation related to pipelines or eminent domain for debate in several previous sessions, though such measures have passed with bipartisan support in the House.
But this year, there’s more pressure for the Senate to bring the bill up for debate. In a letter to Senate leadership, 12 GOP senators pledged to oppose any budget bills unless House File 639 is brought up for debate.
While the eminent domain legislation is on the calendar, this does not guarantee the bill will be brought up. However, without the support of the 12 Republican senators, the budget bills are unlikely able to pass. With 16 “no” votes from Democrats who are expected to oppose most Republican spending proposals, legislation will be unable to reach the needed 26 votes.
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, one of the letter’s signers, told the Iowa Capital Dispatch it “absolutely is still the intent” of the 12 GOP senators who signed the letter to vote against appropriations bills unless eminent domain legislation is brought up for debate, and that he thinks there’s “resolution to stick with it” within the group. He said he cannot confirm the pipeline bill will come up Friday when the chamber is scheduled for debate, but that “if we retain enough support to stop the budget, then it needs to be brought up.”
“I am optimistic that there’s a recognition that the issue needs to be addressed,” Alon said. “And this is the bill in front of us. … I think it’s going to come to a vote. It’s just — I don’t know if it’s tomorrow, I don’t know if it’s next week. I don’t know when that is for certain.”

At a news conference on Tuesday in Washington D.C., U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico Ryan Ellison said prosecutors have filed conspiracy, illicit fentanyl distribution, firearms and immigration charges as a result of the bust.
He also said the alleged drug trafficking organization is “one of the largest and most dangerous fentanyl operations in United States history” — spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Utah — and distributes drugs “throughout the western United States.”
“We will not tolerate those who profit from poisoning American citizens,” Ellison said.
Bondi said the organization is affiliated with the Sinaloa Cartel operating out of Mexico, and when authorities arrested its alleged leader, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, they found millions of dollars in cash and vehicles. She said he “insulated himself” from the drugs, which agents found in Albuquerque, Phoenix and Utah.
Asked for specifics on how the defendants were captured, Bondi said the investigation is ongoing and she won’t reveal police sources or methods.
In court records, two Drug Enforcement Administration special agents characterized three New Mexico defendants David Anesi, Vincent Montoya and Francisco Garcia as “high-volume drug traffickers” in the Albuquerque area, and Phillip Lovato as a “significant customer” in Santa Fe.
They also named Roberta Herrera as Montoya’s significant other “who has been observed participating in drug transactions” with him, and allege that Misael Lopez-Rubio rented out a storage unit in Albuquerque to use as a stash location.
DEA Acting Administrator Robert Murphy noted that the organization’s drug distribution had “probably caused” someone to die.
Since 2018, New Mexico has experienced a dramatic increase in drug overdose deaths associated with prescription drug use and, more recently, use of illicit fentanyl, according to the state Department of Health. Overall, deaths in the state attributed to drug overdose have fallen in the last two years.
Overall, authorities seized 11.5 kilograms of fentanyl powder; approximately $4.4 million in cash; approximately 79 pounds of methamphetamine; approximately 7.5 kilograms of cocaine; approximately 4.5 kilograms of heroin; approximately 41 firearms; and approximately 4.1 million fentanyl pills, according to court records.
Ellison said in Albuquerque alone, police found 2.7 million fentanyl pills; 11.5 kilograms of “concentrated fentanyl powder;” seven pounds of methamphetamine; “multiple kilograms of heroin and cocaine;” 41 firearms; more than $600,000 in cash and “numerous luxury vehicles.”
“When we catch you — all of these individuals, if convicted, we will put you behind bars,” Bondi said. “There will be no negotiating, and we will lock you up for as long as humanly possible. We will not negotiate with those who are killing our family members including brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, parents, friends.”
 DOJ prosecuting, not deporting, defendants who aren’t citizens

Bondi said six of the people charged are living in the U.S. unlawfully. A detention order for Lopez-Rubio indicates that he will be held until trial, in part, because he lacks legal status in the U.S. and is subject to removal or deportation after any prison sentence.
When asked how she’s deciding whether to prosecute or deport any defendants who lack U.S. citizenship, Bondi said it’s based on their potential prison sentences, if they’re convicted.
“I want them to stay in our prisons as long as possible,” Bondi said. “There’s a very big risk — we all know — releasing someone, especially to Mexico. Sending them back to Mexico, who knows, they could attempt to get through our borders. Not under Donald Trump, I doubt. But they’re also part of a major drug trafficking ring in Mexico, so sending them back to Mexico to continue on with their drug business isn’t going to happen under this administration.”

The pandemic tanked traffic stops in 2020 — but racial disparities remained, data shows 

by Erin Petenko 
January 9, 2022, 7:22 amJanuary 10, 2022, 2:35 pm 



In general, data shows that Vermont police stop cars at a higher rate than other states around the country.“Even though traffic stops have fallen almost 50% (since the pandemic) we are still stopping cars at two-and-a-half times the rate of the national average of traffic stops in Vermont,” said  Seguino this week in a phone interview. The researchers have been studying race data that law enforcement agencies have been required by statute to collect since 2014. The April 2025 study updates previous findings using traffic stop data from 2022 to 2023 to determine whether race still influences officers’ decisions in Vermont traffic policing.According to the 2022-23 data, law enforcement agencies stopped almost 50% fewer vehicles compared with 2015-19. The report states that traffic stops statewide fell from more than 170,000 in 2019 to about 75,000 in 2021 but showed a bump in 2023 to almost 93,000.But the stop rate for Vermont continues to exceed the national stop rate by almost 2 ½ times. Where the national average dropped to 52 per 1,000 residents. Vermont’s stop rate in 2022-23 was almost 2.5 times higher at 133 per 1,000 residents, the study noted.At a time when many police departments are struggling with staff shortages, Seguino said traffic stops may not need to be such a priority.“A really interesting question is, just how useful are traffic stops? How necessary are they? Are they the best use of police resources?” Seguino said.Across Vermont and the country, law enforcement officers and agencies have great discretion as to who they stop and then, who they ticket, according to the report. The pretextual traffic stops occur when an officer stops a vehicle for a minor infraction on a hunch to investigate suspected illegal behavior, such as drugs. Such stops disproportionately target people of color, due to negative stereotypes that have proven to be inaccurate, according to the researchers.Pretextual stops have been of concern because they are more susceptible to racial bias than safety-related stops, the study notes. When Seguino first presented the first UVM study confirming racial bias in car searches in 2015, many law enforcement agencies took issue with her findings.  Continued statewide analyses released in 2017 and 2021 have led to deeper discussions of racial bias in policing and led to training at some Vermont law enforcement agencies.The study, now in its 10th year, can cause discomfort but provides a basis for “extremely important discussions in Vermont concerning racial disparities in policing,” said Etan Nasreddin-Longo, co-director of Vermont State Police’s Fair and Impartial Policing Committee, in a May 1 University of Vermont press release.Studies like this led the Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office in 2022 to stop pursuing charges in cases where evidence of a crime was collected during non-safety-related traffic stops, a move adopted by many other states across the country.That may be why the state’s largest law enforcement agencies saw declines in potentially pretextual stops in 2022-23. Although sheriff’s departments registered increases, the Chittenden County Sheriff ’s Department’s rate registered a marked drop in pretextual stops from 9.9% of all stops in 2021-22 to just under 1% in 2022-23, according to the report.Seguino, who has supported that move, said police are supposed to enforce public safety and, while pretextual stops are not illegal, they are often conducted on the basis of bias, which leads to racial disparities evident in the data collected.“Although the disparity has decreased, police continue to search Black and Hispanic drivers at almost double the rate of white drivers,” noted co-author Nancy Brooks, an economics professor at Cornell University, in the press release. While disparities have decreased and arrest rates have dropped in recent years, the 2022-23 data indicated Black drivers in Vermont were still 21% more likely to be arrested than white drivers during a traffic stop. Additionally, Black drivers were almost twice as likely to be searched as white drivers, according to the study.“The proportion of searched Black drivers found with contraband was a third lower than for white drivers in 2023, the largest state-level difference we have seen in our years of analyses — and an indication of racial bias in the decision to search,” she added.Meanwhile, “hit” rates — the percentage of traffic stop searches in which contraband is found — of Black, Hispanic and Asian drivers were close to or equal to the hit rate of white drivers during the pandemic, indicating that fewer stops perhaps resulted from officers’ biases. But progress was short-lived, the report found, “with evidence of greater racial bias in the decision to search Black drivers in 2023 as the relative hit rate fell significantly.”While the 70 or so police departments across Vermont vary greatly in how and how many traffic stops are conducted, overall, the rate of potentially pretextual stops has remained flat throughout the three time periods reviewed by the researchers. But, the study noted, the rate increased for sheriff’s departments and decreased for most police departments.In Brattleboro, Norma Hardy — Vermont’s only Black female police chief —  is aware of how policing bias can target and harm marginalized people. She said her department has tried to minimize that by giving people warnings rather than citations for minor issues like a broken tail light, and provide drivers enough time to fix it. “I’m a big believer in that,” she said.“When we’re doing stops, it’s for safety, not for punitive measures. And so we do discuss that with our officers,” said Hardy.With many residents living close to or below the poverty line, a growing refugee population and new young drivers, Hardy said she preferred to give warnings or call a parent in the case of young drivers in an effort to teach rather than punish. “So we try to be as more community minded as we can,” she added.A comparison of Brattleboro and Rutland in the study, for example, indicated that pretextual stops comprised one-third of all the traffic stops in Rutland compared with less than 7% of all stops in Brattleboro.The authors of the study have long advocated for legislation to reduce the frequency of pretextual stops by police without just cause and limit issuing tickets unless there is basis for a suspected violation, in an effort to lower racial disparities in traffic stops and searches that are both inequitable and inefficient.Lawmakers introduced a bill that would have accomplished those goals last year but it did not go anywhere.“This bill is needed because racial disparities in traffic policing continue in Vermont, despite the 2014 legislation requiring law enforcement agencies to collect race data in traffic stops. Further, Vermont law enforcement agencies stop drivers of any race at more than double (and, in some cases, triple) the national rate,” Seguino said in her testimony last session at the House Judiciary Committee in favor of H.176. The bill was reintroduced in the Senate Judiciary Committee last month by Sens. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, and Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden-Central, but S.144 has no hearings scheduled this session and is unlikely to advance.In an email Thursday, Gulick wrote she is “very concerned” about her Black, Indigenous and constituents of color “being unfairly targeted by traffic stops” as evidenced by the years long study.  “With the Trump administration illegally kidnapping and disappearing legal residents and migrant workers from Vermont, these stops take on an even more disturbing potential impact on Vermonters, one that could impact their safety and security in ways not previously seen,” she wrote. “We need to do all we can to keep Vermonters safe from racial profiling, from the prison pipeline and from horrific Trump policies.”In the context of current national politics and a crackdown on immigration affecting people of color and marginalized groups across the nation, Seguino said “it is important for us to not lose sight of this issue here in Vermont.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Black and Hispanic drivers continue to be stopped disproportionately across Vermont, traffic stops study finds.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/VSP-1-20250123-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-08 20:01:57.697777

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democratic lawmakers on Thursday touted their successes during the 2025 state legislative session, which ended Wednesday, but they warned of a need to come back to the Capitol for a special lawmaking term if Congress passes a federal spending plan with significant funding cuts for programs like Medicaid.
“Federal funding freezes and mounting threats from Washington required us to take action to protect our freedoms, our core services, our public education funding and Medicaid,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said during a press conference, referring to the attitude of legislative leaders as the session began in January.
“The road ahead is uncertain. We are fearful that with the Trump administration continuing to cut services in rural parts of our state, cuts to public safety, cuts to agriculture and water infrastructure, there is more work to be done,” she said.
She highlighted the $4 million legal defense fund the Legislature approved to pay for any legal challenges the state may need to make against the federal government to access obligated funding. Colorado is already a party to more than a dozen lawsuits over Trump policies. That money will allow the state to be nimble in its response to potential Trump actions during the summer and fall.
“This isn’t about partisan politics, to be very clear. This is about making sure that the dollars that Coloradans are paying in tax dollars to the feds are coming back and they’re not taken away from us illegally,” McCluskie said.

But Republicans faulted the Democrats’ approach.
“To try to be confrontational, to be prepared to sue on a moment’s notice — that, to me, is irresponsible. It’s much better to collaborate,” said Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican.
Democrats enjoyed a 43-22 majority in the House of Representatives and 23-12 majority in the Senate this year. That means they could pass nearly all of their priority bills and have them approved by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who will spend the next month signing bills at ceremonies around the state.
This year, Democrats also sought to codify certain rights and practices into state statute given the uncertain federal climate. That includes Senate Bill 25-130, which has provisions that are similar to the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, House Bill 25-1309, which concerned health insurance coverage for gender-affirming care, and Senate Bill 25-1, which codified the right of equal access to the voting process across racial and language minority groups. Democrats also, implementing the will of voters in November, removed language against same-sex marriage in the state’s constitution.










This isn't about partisan politics, to be very clear. This is about making sure that the dollars that Coloradans are paying in tax dollars to the feds are coming back and they're not taken away from us illegally.

Polis praised the Legislature’s work on housing policy Thursday as he stood with legislative leaders in front of a newly-built modular apartment building in Denver’s Sun Valley neighborhood. He signed a bill that streamlines the process of constructing factory-built houses and apartment buildings.
“On housing, we’re making it easier for innovative solutions to build housing faster and at lower cost,” he said.
The Legislature also passed a bill that aims to reduce construction defect litigation in the state, a multi-year effort that lawmakers hope will spur more condominium construction and open homeownership to younger people who cannot afford a single-family home. Other bills, if signed by Polis, would regulate so-called “junk fees” in rental leases, set more protections over when a landlord can keep a security deposit, and ban rent-setting algorithms that some say drive up rent prices. Polis did not mention any of those bills on Thursday.
Polis also all but confirmed that he plans to veto Senate Bill 25-5, which would repeal a second election requirement for union formation. That bill passed both chambers with Democratic support but did not have the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. From the start of the session, Polis said he would not be comfortable signing a bill that didn’t have the support of both labor and business interests, and monthslong talks between the two sides did not result in such a plan.
“We are still seeking a sustainable way to update the Labor Peace Act that fundamentally acknowledges the rights of workers to organize and has enough buy-in to be a stable way that our state can do business and workers can organize for decades to come,” he said. “I truly believe a bill that I could sign would be better for workers and better for business.”
His office could be involved in continuing negotiations.
Polis said the Legislature could come back for a special session depending on what Congress passes in the coming weeks in its budget reconciliation legislation that would affect the federal fiscal year starting in October. The Republican-led Congress is seeking trillions of dollars in spending cuts, possibly through reducing federal funding to states for Medicaid. That would all but require the Legislature to reconvene to figure out a way to preserve health care for a large portion of Coloradans.
Special sessions have followed the previous two legislative sessions, both of which dealt with property taxes.
Some bipartisan successes
Republican lawmakers criticized Democrats’ defeat of bills they claim would have saved money for everyday Coloradans. That includes bills on delivery fees and single-use bag fees that pay for various state programs, as well as bills around government efficiency and deregulation.
“We just finished the legislative session that put perspectives starkly and clearly visibly on display — one perspective of expansive and expensive government and another perspective of free people and an affordable life,” Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Monument Republican, said. He stood in the Capitol next to a fish tank of shredded dollar bills —fake — to represent the caucus’s defeated money-saving legislation.
“We were disappointed that things like the grocery bag fee or the retail delivery fee, which we consistently hear at the doors, was not taken seriously by the Democrats,” House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, a Colorado Springs Republican, said.
Republicans did, however, lead on several successful pieces of bipartisan legislation. That includes bills to change how the legislative vacancy process is conducted, to exempt agricultural buildings from some energy use requirements, and to define nuclear energy as a source of clean energy. There are no nuclear power plants in Colorado, but legislators want the state to be ready for an industry presence.
“Thanks to a multi-year effort from the Colorado Senate Republicans, the development of safe, efficient and emission-free micro nuclear energy will soon be coming to our state,” said Sen. Mark Baisley, a Woodland Park Republican.
Both Republicans and Democrats addressed the need to amend the state’s artificial intelligence law passed in 2024, which Polis and some lawmakers fear could stifle innovation. The sweeping measure on potential discrimination due to AI is set to go into effect in February 2026, and a late bill this session to tweak some parts of the law died in its first committee at bill sponsor Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez’s request. That prompted a call from Polis and other powerful Democrats to find a way to push back the 2024 law’s implementation date. The Legislature did not do that in its final days.
“We need to deal with it as soon as we can deal with it. Certainly, if we’re called for a special session, it must be part of that goal,” Lundeen said.
Rodriguez said that extending the implementation date would not have changed the policy disagreements between tech companies, consumer protection groups and other stakeholders. He oversaw a task force on the issue that began meeting right after the 2024 session ended.
“We will get working, and whether we go into a special session or go into next year, I think we’ll be in a much better place with the policy and have more consensus,” he said.

As the red velvet curtains at the Vatican parted, a priest realized that his college pal from the South Side of Chicago that he knows as “Bob” had been elected the first American pope.

“Oh, dear God,” the Very Rev. Anthony Benedetto Pizzo, the prior provincial of the Augustinian Order in Chicago, said as he heard the news.

Pizzo knew Robert Prevost could be named Pope, but it was an outside chance. Prevost was just named cardinal in 2023. Pope Francis named Prevost the Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, whose job it is to vet potential bishops. His name had come up a few times to succeed Pope Francis, Pizzo said, but he wasn’t a named favorite.

“We were waiting with bated breath to see what would happen,” Pizzo said, speaking from Southern Italy, in an interview with Capitol News Illinois.

Pizzo watched as his friend was introduced to the world as Pope Leo XIV. It was the same man he knew in college, seminary and throughout his career — a man dedicated to his faith and his friends.

Pizzo planned to travel to Rome on Friday but was unsure whether he would see his old friend. He had known Prevost since the men were undergraduates studying at Villanova University in Philadelphia.

Prevost was one of three brothers living in Dolton on the far South Side. One brother remains in Chicago. The other lives in Florida. His father, a World War II veteran, was a teacher and school administrator, Pizzo said. His mother was a librarian.

Young Robert Prevost attended St. Mary of the Assumption Church, located on the Chicago-Dolton border, serving as an altar boy and attending the parish school.

“Bob is such a good friend. He was there throughout my life,” Pizzo said. “He was there when I made my vows, the death of my parents and my installation as a pastor.”

The man who would become pope likes to drive and enjoyed long treks, driving back and forth to college with Pizzo, who described him as very open and an excellent companion.

Pizzo said his friend is down to earth, outgoing and well-rounded.

“He was very dedicated and applied himself in all that he did,” Pizzo said.

The two men attended the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago in 1977. The new pope obtained a Master of Divinity degree.

Prevost began doing missionary work in Peru in 1985, serving in various roles including parish pastor, diocesan official, seminary teacher and administrator. He led an Augustinian seminary for a decade.

From 2001-2013, he served as prior general of the Order of Saint Augustine. He was succeeded by his friend, Pizzo, who continues to serve in the role. In 2014, the young man who grew up in Chicago was appointed Bishop of Chiclayo, Peru.

He became a Peruvian citizen in 2015.

Prevost selected his name after Pope Leo XII, who was famous for his 1891 treatise that outlined rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions and the formation of trade unions.

When Prevost became a cardinal in 2023, Sister Barbara Reid, president of the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, was in attendance. On Thursday, after the announcement, things got hectic at CTU.

Patrick Bittorf, vice president for development at CTU, was fielding calls and requests for media interviews.

“Well, we graduated a pope!” he said.

Pizzo said he hopes his friend receives all the support he needs in his new role and that he continues to be as attentive as he has been, relying on God’s grace.

And does the new pope have a favorite Chicago baseball team?  Pizzo said his friend is from the South Side and was likely a White Sox fan, but then demurred.

“I mean, we never went to a game or anything, but I would assume …”

Photo by Greta Solsaa/VTDiggerMIDDLEBURY — Middlebury College faculty, staff and students staged a schoolwide walkout and teach-in on the Old Chapel green on Thursday morning in response to the college’s plan for making budget cuts to address a projected $14.1 million deficit this fiscal year.“Our working conditions are your learning experience,” David Miranda-Hardy, a member of the faculty, said at the demonstration. “That’s why we are here today to urge our trustee and administrators to change course.” The budget plan announced April 2 included a reduction in matching contributions to the retirement benefit from 15% to 11% for faculty and staff, starting in January of 2026. This would impact staff hired before 2017 as the retirement match was already reduced to 11% for new employees in 2017. The match begins when college employees reach the age of 45.Another aspect of the administration’s budget stabilization plan is maintaining the student body at the small private liberal arts college at 2,650, heightened from the pre-pandemic norm of 2,500. The college increased enrollment to more than 2,800 in 2020, according to the budget announcement.Other cost-saving measures in the plan include offering an early retirement incentive for staff and consolidating at Middlebury the college’s summer language schools that are currently hosted by Bennington College. The plan also mentioned reevaluating employee contributions and deductibles to health insurance plans for potential changes in the coming year.An 11% retirement match may seem generous, said Peter Matthews, a professor of economics, but salaries at Middlebury College tend to be lower than those at similar institutions. The overall compensation package with the higher retirement match was a draw for faculty and staff and encouraged them to stay. He said changing those benefits now feels like a “betrayal” for many. Matthews told the crowd at the demonstration that a conservative estimate of the 4% reduction in the retirement match amounts to a $100,000 to $250,000 loss with compound interest by the time faculty and staff retire. He explained that the financial hit is more significant for younger employees who have been waiting for the retirement match benefit to take effect when they turn 45. “It’s the equivalent of the college saying, ‘We’re not going to give you a rocking chair when you retire. We’re going to burn down your house.’ That’s the economic equivalent of what’s going on, and not surprisingly, people are upset,” Matthews said in an interview. Following Thursday’s demonstration — which the administration said drew roughly 250 people —  Middlebury College spokesperson Jon Reidel said in a written statement that the school has continued to provide updates on budgetary matters since the announcement.“We value the perspectives of all of our faculty, staff, and students and are actively engaged in conversations with our constituents across Middlebury,” Reidel wrote.Miranda-Hardy — an associate professor in the Film and Media Culture Department and among the leaders of the Middlebury Chapter of the American Association of University Professors — said the announced budget plan was a “unilateral” decision that was not made in collaboration with students, faculty and staff. Jason Mittell, professor of film and media and the chair of the Faculty Council, said not only is the retirement match reduction a financial loss, but it comes after Middlebury College froze salaries for the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Mittell said most employees’ salaries, when adjusted for inflation, are less than those of 2019. While Middlebury College is taking austerity measures, Miranda-Hardy said the endowment and student tuition fees continue to increase. He pointed to figures showing Middlebury’s endowment has grown from $1.1 billion in 2015 to $1.6 billion last June and student yearly tuition and fees grew from $61,000 in the 2015-16 school year to $90,000 this school year. “Our compensation still lags way behind and now we are seeing a compensation cut. That is a breach of trust that is bringing morale even lower,” Miranda-Hardy said in an interview.An ‘Albatross’In the budget plan announcement, the leadership wrote that $8.7 million of the total deficit was the result of low enrollment at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, a satellite campus in California housing various graduate, joint-degree and certificate programs focused on multilingual and cross-cultural education. Mittell said Middlebury College has invested large sums into the institute over 20 years since acquiring the campus in 2005. He called it an “albatross” for Middlebury College that is sinking finances and morale.The rest of the deficit, amounting to $5.4 million, was tethered to decreased tuition revenue at the summer language schools, the Bread Loaf school and study abroad schools, as well as health care costs, “increased costs for some budgetary items unrelated to salaries or employee benefits, as well as interest and depreciation.”Miranda-Hardy said the deficit is not the result of instructional costs or faculty and staff benefits, but that is the area the administration aims to trim. He said he thinks the college should work to centralize educational programming and bring jobs to Vermont rather than continue to invest in the institute in California.Laurie Essig, a professor of gender, sexuality and feminist studies, said that Middlebury College’s deficit is a “self-imposed crisis,” that is separate from the federal funding threats to higher education happening nationally. She said the deficit is due in part to lack of financial oversight in investing in the institute at Monterey. Growing frustration, fear of precedentThursday’s demonstration was the latest in a series of actions faculty, staff and students have taken in the past month to express frustration with the budget decisions.On April 18 with a vote of 94%, faculty members approved a motion sponsored by the Faculty Council and the Middlebury Chapter of the American Association of University Professors urging the college’s leadership to cancel the benefit cuts and higher student enrollment and to begin again by discussing solutions with faculty, students and staff. The faculty motion also called on the incoming president Ian Baucom to weigh in on the budget decisions, which he did a week later during a speech at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California on April 25. Baucom said that he supports the current leadership’s “truly difficult decision,” and will work with faculty, staff and students to build financial stability for the college in the future, according to the posted remarks. A circulating online petition in support of maintaining faculty and staff retirement benefits has garnered around 800 signatures by faculty, staff, students, students’ family members and community members, according to Matthews. The physical copy of the petition was delivered to Middlebury College’s Provost Michelle McCauley at the close of the demonstration. The majority of the economics faculty also signed onto a letter urging the administration to reconsider the financial plan, pledging to boycotting commencement and other school events until “the decision has been reversed or a plan to mitigate the damage has been implemented.”Essig said the budget announcement would set a concerning precedent if the college is able to renege on compensation promises without consulting faculty and staff. The college could continue to reduce salaries and benefits and employees would have no recourse, she said.The Director of Discovery and Access at the Middlebury College library, Terry Simpkins, said he views the budget proposal as a product of a “failure of imagination” by college leaders to devise creative ways to address the deficit. Along with the retirement match cut, Simpkins said library staff and other workers at the college will have to take on a larger burden to support more students and help facilitate the language school’s relocation to the Middlebury College campus. “The administration’s response is always to solve whatever budget problems they are facing on the backs of staff,” Simpkins said. “There’s no real understanding or acknowledgement of the additional work that it causes for the existing staff to carry out these decisions.”Media Production Specialist Ethan Murphy, a 17-year staff member, said at the protest that he was less than a year into earning the retirement match benefit before the college announced the reduction. He said the work of all staff is integral to the function of Middlebury College.“This decision sets a precedent — a new Middlebury Way if you will — where no benefits are safe and where the very idea of a total compensation package is meaningless,” Murphy said at the demonstration. “It is safe to say that collectively, we are the student experience at Middlebury and we shouldn’t be made to feel guilty about defending long-promised benefits or be made to believe that layoffs are the only alternative.”Student experienceDaniza Tazabekova, vice president of the Middlebury College Student Government, said she is concerned that continuing with higher enrollment may cause a scarcity of housing and space in classes for students.Miranda-Hardy said he has already experienced the higher enrollment numbers having a negative impact on the student experience by causing a housing crisis, long cafeteria lines and a loss of community spaces. At the demonstration, senior Freddi Mitchell said the student experience is tied to the working conditions of faculty and staff, which will both continue to deteriorate under the compensation cuts. “As seniors at Middlebury, we understand that our experience would not be the same without the faculty and staff that have been with us along this way,” Mitchell said at the demonstration. “Increasing or maintaining the high student enrollment that we’ve experienced these last four years will continue to negatively impact student-faculty relationships and put more pressure on college staff.”‘Volatile moment’Miranda-Hardy said faculty, staff and students have not lost sight of the “biggest problem,” namely concerns with federal funding cuts, detention of international students and threats to free speech across college campuses. He called the budget cuts ill-timed, sparking discontent and disunity at the college as it transitions to a new president.“It’s the worst possible time to breach the trust of your employees, dishonoring your commitments,” Miranda-Hardy said. “This is not the time to create a divided community.”While budget cuts may be necessary, Tazabekova said decisions should be discussed and implemented in a “fair and transparent manner” with faculty, staff and students. “When we’re in such a volatile moment and our funding sources from the federal government are being threatened, I can definitely understand why emergency measures need to be taken to just preserve the longstanding nature of the institution,” Tazabekova said. “But, for me personally, I think tough decisions need to be made in collaboration, because there are so many different stakeholders on campus.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Middlebury College faculty, staff and students take action against administration’s budget cuts.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Middlebury-College-Walkout-Budget-Cuts-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-05-08 20:01:57.697777

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Going-to-the-Sun Road will be open to vehicle traffic to Avalanche Campground starting Saturday, just in time for Mother’s Day weekend, Glacier National Park said in a news release Thursday.
The park’s road crew is still clearing snow farther up the road and, as of Wednesday afternoon, was working between Triple Arches and Rim Rock, Glacier said. The entire road typically does not open until sometime in mid to late June.
Also starting this weekend, the Apgar Visitor Center will be open daily.
The news release said the hiker/biker shuttle may operate later in the season, and the park will provide updates regarding when this free shuttle begins operating.
Glacier also said this summer, starting June 13 through Sept. 28, sections of Going-to-the-Sun Road that are open to motor vehicles are closed to bicycle use between Logan Pass and the Apgar turnoff at the south end of Lake McDonald during the following times: eastbound (uphill) cycling between noon and 6 p.m. and westbound (downhill) cycling between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Visitors can hike and bike Going-to-the-Sun Road past the gate closure on the weekends as far as the posted pedestrian closure, the news release said. During the week, the road crew sets the closure based on where they are working and existing hazards.
The park sends out text alerts, notifying the public about where the road crew and avalanche closures are set every week and general road opening and closure updates.
“Be the first to know by signing up for text alerts by texting the message ‘GNPROADS’ to the number 333111,” the park said.

The Public Regulation Commission on Thursday held a day-long workshop, hearing from utilities who discussed their strategies and justifications for ""public safety power shutoffs"" amid increased risk of wildfire and litigation for utility-caused wildfires. (Photo from lawsuit documents)People across the state should increasingly prepare to lose power the next time high winds and dry conditions combine to raise wildfire risk in their communities.
That was the message big and small electrical providers from all corners of New Mexico told the state’s utility regulator during a day-long hearing Thursday in Santa Fe. The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission held its first of four workshops, stemming out of the historic 2022 wildfire season, focused primarily on “public safety power shutoffs.”
Citing increased fire risk and also the specter of bankruptcy from class-action lawsuits, investor-owned utilities and small cooperatives said shutting off power when conditions require it is a crucial way to protect utilities and, therefore, ratepayers from huge expenses related to wildfires. 
PNM, the state’s biggest electrical provider, did its first-ever power shutoff April 17 in Las Vegas, citing high winds and ongoing drought. The power shutoff affected about 2,300 customers and occurred during a particularly windy day in the Northern New Mexico town of about 12,000 people.
PRC commissioners sought to hear from utilities and state and local officials about the toll of recent wildfires, their criteria for future shutoffs and also how they’re approaching communicating with local governments and the public. 
PNM cuts off power to Las Vegas due to high wind and wildfire risk

“These disasters not only cause massive losses for people and businesses, but for utilities as well,”  PRC chair Gabriel Aguilera said in his opening remarks. “We’ve increasingly seen utilities facing lawsuits with insurance companies covering only a fraction of the damages, or in some cases, none at all.”
Speakers presented on behalf of small cooperatives in Mora, San Miguel and Taos Counties, as well as investor-owned utilities like PNM and SPS. 
PNM is currently facing a lawsuit from hundreds of victims of the McBride Fire in Ruidoso in 2022. A tree falling into one of PNM’s utility lines caused that fire, though the parties disagree on whether it was a result of the utility’s negligence. 
Singleton Schreiber, one of the nation’s biggest law firms bringing wildfire lawsuits, alleges the utility and its contractor negligently allowed the tree to be tall enough and close enough to the power line to cause a fire on a windy day. 
PNM has denied any liability, citing public reports that said a “tree spanning approximately 50 feet tall that was outside of our right-of-way had contacted a powerline due to unanticipated wind gusts of over 90 miles per hour,” spokesperson Eric Chavez has said.
Before the McBride Fire lawsuit, the Jemez Mountain Electrical Cooperative ultimately had to pay $25 million for its role in the 2011 Las Conchas Fire. It sought rate hikes to cover the cost and also could only get between $2 million and $3 million in insurance coverage afterward. 
It’s not just small cooperatives that face existential lawsuits for wildfires: Major utility PG&E filed for bankruptcy after being implicated in a series of fires in California in 2017 and 2018, ultimately being ordered to pay a $13.5 billion settlement. 
The Legislature this year considered, but ultimately didn’t pass, a bill that would have limited liability to electrical cooperatives to $2 million, so long as the PRC approved a wildfire mitigation plan the utility provided in advance. 
Claims office pays men more than women for food lost in state’s biggest wildfire

Cutting off power to prevent a wildfire carries its own costs. In Las Vegas, some families with elderly or sick relatives who relied on electric medical equipment had to scramble to find alternate power sources. And during the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, long power outages meant many people in rural areas lost stores of food in their garage freezers. 
Henri Hammond-Paul, Santa Fe’s director of community health and safety, said at the meeting that utilities need to communicate with local officials and the public as much as possible, including warnings well in advance of a shutoff. He noted that the cost of closing Santa Fe schools, in particular, due to a pre-emptive power shutoff could mean 16,000 students going without lunch. 
“I understand that there is a lot of liability on utilities. There is a different type of liability and risk for cities, because even if we’re not the ones who are going to be sued, necessarily, for an incident, we are accountable and we are seen as responsible,” he said. 
The PRC workshop was only to spur dialogue on the multi-faceted issue of the power shutoffs, members said, though Aguilera suggested the commission was considering crafting a rule that could require standards, public notice timelines and, “at a high level, minimum requirements” for utilities before they shut power off.

To address youth mental health concerns, Vermont senators consider turning to technology.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont youth — like many nationwide — are struggling with their mental health. The reasons for what many have termed a “crisis” are complex, although many are increasingly pointing the finger at technology, specifically smartphones and social media.Now, two tech companies have told Vermont lawmakers that the solution is, possibly, more technology.In the past several weeks, two youth-targeted telehealth firms have pitched the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare on their products. First was the British startup Kooth, which offers an app called Soluna. It offers one-on-one communication with mental health coaches, group messaging platforms where users can discuss their challenges together, “interactive self-care tools” and guides to finding local resources like housing and medical care.The youth mental health crisis “requires innovative and scalable solutions beyond traditional care,” Laura Tully, the firm’s vice president of partnerships, told senators when testifying last month. “We are never going to train enough providers and get them in the right places for every young person to have an in-person appointment,” Tully said.On Thursday, the committee heard from Hazel Health, a telehealth company offering virtual medical and mental health appointments. “Nearly one in five children nationwide experience mental health challenges,” Sean Bradley, a Hazel executive, told lawmakers. “Yet the vast majority of them, about 80%, go untreated. This gap in care can be a profound impact on a child’s ability to succeed academically, socially and ultimately, in the workforce.”Both Hazel and Kooth have contracts with schools and other state governments amid a nationwide surge in companies offering virtual mental health care for youth: Hazel Health has contracts to work in over 5,000 schools in 20 states, according to Bradley, while Kooth has contracted with the state of California and announced a contract with New Jersey in December.  That California contract has drawn some attention, after a California official resigned following a Kooth-funded trip to the U.K., KFF Health News reported. (Kooth said in a statement that the company believes the reporting “fails to raise any legitimate concerns regarding Kooth.”)This year, both Kooth and Hazel have dropped thousands of dollars on Vermont lobbyists: $30,000 and $9,000, respectively, according to state records. Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, the chair of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, said it’s unlikely the committee will introduce any relevant legislation this year. But “we’re at a critical stage right now where we really need to do something systemically for kids,” Lyons said Thursday. “Whatever will work cost-effectively, I’m willing to look at,” she added. — Peter D’AuriaIn the knowOn Thursday, state officials and nonprofit leaders launched the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund with the goal of raising $1 million to bolster legal representation for immigrants.“We are seeing the power of legal representation to change lives. We’re seeing also how many people there are who are still waiting for legal help,” said Jill Martin Diaz, executive director of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, a nonprofit that provides pro bono immigration representation, at the fund’s launch. Mohsen Mahdawi, A Columbia University student whose detention in Vermont by federal authorities for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinian human rights has drawn national attention, spoke at the launch event and praised the fundraising for its support of democracy. He recalled being held in a Vermont prison cell with a migrant farmworker.“Before he goes to bed, he would kneel on his knees, and he would hold his hands, and he would do a prayer from the Catholic tradition,” Mahdawi said. “I think his prayers have been answered today by this initiative.” Read more about the new initiative here. — Ethan WeinsteinThe latest study in an ongoing effort to track traffic stops across Vermont indicates that Black, Hispanic and Asian drivers continue to be disproportionately targeted, even though the number of stops have significantly decreased since the Covid-19 pandemic.Black drivers were stopped by police at a rate 30% higher than would be expected given their share of the driving population, and Hispanic drivers were stopped at double their share of the driving population. Police have increasingly stopped Asian drivers, according to the 2022-2023 data examined in the latest update to the report by Stephanie Seguino, economics professor at the University of Vermont, Cornell professor Nancy Brooks and Pat Autilio, an independent data analyst  who works at the Vermont Racial Justice Alliance.In general, data shows that Vermont police stop cars at a higher rate than other states around the country.“Even though traffic stops have fallen almost 50% (since the pandemic) we are still stopping cars at two-and-a-half times the rate of the national average of traffic stops in Vermont,” said  Seguino this week in a phone interview. Read more about the results of the study at vtdigger.org.— Auditi GuhaRead the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Telehealth companies pitch Vermont senators on youth mental health apps.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/senate-health-1-20250314-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-08 19:06:38.244621

(Photos courtesy of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico)Three New Mexicans held at the maximum-security state prison in Santa Fe are challenging the New Mexico prison system’s use of solitary confinement, not just for them but for anyone else and those who might be subjected to it in the future.
Through their attorneys, three men on Thursday filed a complaint for class relief against the prison itself, the New Mexico Corrections Department and so far unidentified defendants who will be named later.
O’Shay Toney, GuJuan Fusilier and Mah-konce Hudson allege the prison system has an unlawful and constitutional policy and practice “of subjecting hundreds of New Mexicans annually to prolonged periods of solitary confinement as a form of punishment for violating prison rules.”
On Thursday, the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe assigned the case to Judge Matthew Wilson.
“We don’t comment on pending litigation,” Corrections Department Spokesperson Brittany Roembach told Source NM in a statement.
The Corrections Department denies it uses solitary, with Roembach instead referring to it as “restrictive housing.”
“To be clear, solitary confinement does not exist in the NMCD system,” she said. “We utilize restrictive housing, like the Predatory Behavior Management Program (PBMP), to fix behaviors.”
In response to Source’s questions, Roembach shared a copy of the prison system’s policy governing the program, which states that its purpose is to “reduce predatory behavior” among incarcerated people.
ACLU-NM Managing Attorney Lalita Moskowitz told Source NM in an interview it’s a very common practice for prison officials to use euphemisms for solitary confinement. Prison reform advocates in New Mexico have said previously that the program is one example of the department putting a different label on solitary confinement.
In the complaint, the incarcerated people allege that the program uses solitary as punishment and guards use arbitrary and inconsistent criteria to put people in it.
Under the program, the men have “spent months, and in many cases, years of their lives locked in tiny, barren cells for 23 hours per day or more as supposed punishment for violating prison rules,” the complaint states.
If Judge Wilson finds that allegation to be true, that would be a violation of the state’s 2019 Restricted Housing Act, which defines “restrictive housing” as confinement of a person in a locked cell or similar living quarters for 22 or more hours each day without daily, meaningful and sustained human interaction.
Lawmakers to consider more limits on solitary confinement in prisons and jails

There are 147 people in the program at PNM, according to Roembach. ACLU-NM estimates that 400 people have been held in solitary over the last three years.
The policy also requires that prison officials provide mental health and psychiatric treatment to people in the program, however, the complaint alleges, “In reality, PBMP is a long-term solitary confinement unit that offers little in the way of programming or preparation.”
Both Fusilier and Toney suffer from “severe mental illness,” the complaint states, and Hudson was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder because of trauma from being in long-term solitary.
Fusiler said in a statement that he’s begged for help with his anger, anxiety and PTSD and prison officials have allegedly responded with isolation and rejection.
“This so-called program offered NOTHING it promised,” he said. “This place doesn’t provide growth or positive change for our lives, no matter how loud our cries for help are. It feels like the people running it don’t care about the success of my life. Instead, they keep us pinned down and oppressed.”  
While in solitary, Toney alleges he is unable to privately or consistently speak with a mental health professional. Hudson “fears being overmedicated” in solitary and can’t access the care he needs because he has no privacy or ability to communicate with providers, the complaint states.
Prison officials have also allegedly prohibited Toney from using technology, making phone calls or accessing the commissary, his property or recreation time, the complaint states.
Hudson said in a statement long-term solitary “turns anger into hate, eliminates coping mechanisms, leaving only survival tactics, and exacerbates existing mental health issues into debilitating anxiety and paranoia.”
“It teaches isolation rather than connection, leaving people ill-equipped for social environments whether in general population or upon release to society,” he said.

The room at the Temple of Justice in Olympia was packed with loved ones, friends, and colleagues who shared memories of her as someone who loved going to boutiques to find unique clothing or jewelry and throwing “legendary Christmas parties.”
She was the seventh woman to serve on the state Supreme Court and the first woman to reach the court’s mandatory retirement age of 75. She retired in December, just a few months before she passed away in California while visiting family. 
Owens grew up in an era when it was less common than it is today for women to become attorneys. Her father, who was a lawyer, encouraged her to pursue a career as a legal secretary. 
Instead, she graduated from Duke University in 1971 and obtained her law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1975. 
Before being elected to the state Supreme Court in 2000, Owens served as a judge in Clallam County for almost 20 years, and prior to that as ​​chief judge for the Quileute and Lower Elwha S’Klallam tribes.

During her time as a justice, Owens helped “elevate the voices of domestic violence victims and many marginalized groups and wrote some of the court’s most important opinions,” said Chief Justice Debra L. Stephens. 
She was also a champion of rural and tribal courts and taught on the subject of rural courts at the state’s Judicial College. 
Outside the courtroom, she was described as smart and bold — someone who would “cut to the heart of the matter.” She could be found by the karaoke machine or at dance parties with a feather boa, according to memorial attendees. 
“She brought joy and loved making friends wherever she went,” said Judith Hightower, a friend and former colleague. 
During the ceremony, Rio Jaime, friend of the Owens family and vice chairman of the Quileute Tribal Council, wrapped Owens’ two adult children in a Native blanket to provide love and comfort and sang a traditional Quileute song, symbolizing a protection prayer. 
“The one thing that, as I’ve grown to know about my mom, that I’m most impressed with is her toughness and her resilience,” said James Owen Golden, her son. 
She is also survived by her daughter, Sunny Golden, and grandchildren Jameson, Skye, Aubriana, Arabella, and Cannon.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/susan-owens-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-05-08 19:06:38.244621

Kristi Noem presents her annual budget address to lawmakers in the South Dakota State Capitol on Dec. 3, 2024. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Revelations about Republican former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s credit card use prompted a legislative oversight committee to question state officials Thursday in Pierre about how the state approves credit card spending for travel and other expenses.
The Dakota Scout obtained and published records earlier this year showing about $750,000 billed to the Noem office’s state-issued credit cards during her six years in office, including travel expenses related to her book tour and a Canadian hunting trip, plus expensive stays at hotels such as The Venetian in Las Vegas. Noem resigned the governorship in January after she was appointed U.S. secretary of Homeland Security.
‘Out of control’: Kristi Noem on defense over Homeland Security spending overrun

The governor’s credit card is intended to pay for travel-related expenses. Allowable expenses, said Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger, include flights, hotel rooms and meals.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, who chairs the legislative Government Operations and Audit Committee, said she doesn’t view “several $500 charges for Sirius XM radio” as “allowable expenses.”
“The taxpayers have an issue with that. I have an issue with that,” Howard said.
Since the information was published, Terwilliger said the state canceled the satellite radio subscriptions and made internal policy changes for credit card expenses.
Many of the expenses related to the Governor’s Office credit cards come from security details ensuring the governor’s safety during travel, Terwilliger said. The state has since separated accounts between security and the governor’s other expenses to better track what costs are directly related to the governor’s spending.

Noem traveled to other states and Canada during her time as governor, sometimes appearing at campaign events supporting out-of-state Republicans or for President Donald Trump. 
Lawmakers questioned if taxpayer-funded security detail should only be for state-related expenses, rather than campaign-related travel; how governor travel expenses are determined as a benefit to the state; and how many people in the Governor’s Office have a credit card, among other questions.
While Terwilliger said he doesn’t believe any of the credit card charges were campaign related, security for the governor is a “24/7, 365-day mission.” Security is provided by the state Highway Patrol. Terwilliger said he could not say how many people have access to one of the credit cards, saying it would provide information for “potential bad guys that want to do harm.”
Howard was not satisfied with the responses.
“It’s our job as legislators to set up parameters,” Howard said. “…Your answer cannot always, when legislators ask for an explanation, the answer cannot just be hiding behind security all the time. We have to figure out a way we can ask questions and get them answered without someone just saying, ‘Well, that’s security. You can’t know.’”

The State Auditor’s Office reviews the credit card charges once an invoice is submitted by the Governor’s Office. Auditor Rich Sattgast told lawmakers he has never denied a charge from the governor.
He said the Legislature could set stricter parameters on elected officials’ spending to improve oversight or limit spending.
“For the vast majority of elected officials, there has not been what would be seen by the public as an overstepping of their jurisdiction of spending money,” Sattgast said. “So I think having the public be aware of it and being accountable to the public is probably the primary aspect of it.”
Jenna Latham, with the Auditor’s Office, said the governor and some other elected officials can stay in expensive hotels because “they answer to the taxpayer.”
The office will occasionally question if an expense is allowable and ask for justification. Sometimes the expense will get scratched and covered by the individual, “but if they come back, you essentially have to approve it,” she said.
“There’s not much that can stop us,” Latham said, adding, “we have to follow the rules.”
Howard told lawmakers that they can propose legislation recommendations at the end of the year “if there’s different legislation that we think should be brought.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The state Department of Revenue collected about $530,000 in commercial vehicle fee overcharges affecting more than 11,000 South Dakota vehicles last fiscal year.
The finding was part of a fiscal year 2024 audit report on state government presented to the legislative Government Operations and Audit Committee on Thursday in Pierre.
According to Mike Kogelmann, a state audit manager, the Department of Revenue changed its fee tables on July 1, 2022. Instead of charging a flat $7 additional fee for vehicles registered at over 78,000 pounds, in accordance with state law, the department erroneously charged $7 for every 2,000 pounds over 78,000 pounds.

“If your vehicle was registered at 79,000 pounds, you paid $7. If your vehicle was registered at 81,000 pounds, you paid $14,” Kogelmann said. “Prior to that, and when the law was implemented, it was always that everything over 78,000 was $7.”
The department corrected its fee table in December last year, Kogelmann said. The average overcharge was $46 per vehicle.
The department did not immediately respond to a question from South Dakota Searchlight asking whether the vehicle owners were refunded for the overpayments. 
Kogelmann told lawmakers he was not aware of refunds from the department. He’s also not aware of any law requiring the state or local governments to provide refunds for overpayments. 
In an email to South Dakota Searchlight, Kogelmann said the fee tables were not selected for testing for the fiscal year 2023 audit report, which is why the overcharge was not addressed last year. He did not know how many vehicles were overcharged in fiscal year 2023, “but we have no reason to believe it wouldn’t be in the neighborhood” of the 11,000 vehicles overcharged in fiscal year 2024.
Rep. Julie Auch, R-Yankton, said she wants the money repaid. 
“Our state enforces laws if taxes aren’t paid,” she said, “but when we overpay we should have the same in return.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Evergy missed Wall Street expectations but reported a $125 million profit during its first-quarter earnings call Thursday.
Evergy and Black Hills Energy had earnings calls Thursday morning, with both reaffirming their projected earnings for the upcoming year.
Evergy reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share, missing a Zacks consensus estimate of $0.66. Zacks Investment Research projects earnings estimates for companies based on input from more than 2,500 analysts.
Weaker sales due to two heavy snow events and a large industrial customer outage held back Evergy earnings, said David Campbell, president and CEO.
“The first quarter was a slower start to the year than anticipated,” said Bryan Buckler, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “Total demand grew 2.7% while weather normalized demand decreased by 3%. Colder winter weather led to increases in residential commercial usage, but major snow storms limited the business activity in January, and to some degree, in February, on the industrial side.”
Despite lower than expected earnings, Campbell said Evergy continues to stay on track to deliver 2025 adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $3.92.
“The long-term outlook for our business is as strong as it has been in decades, bolstered by strong demand from large new customers, one of the most robust customer pipelines in the industry and constructive regulatory frameworks and supportive legislation in both Kansas and Missouri,” he said.
Evergy also stuck with its long-term earnings growth target of 4-6% through 2029. 
Campbell said a February cold spell led to a new winter peak load record of more than 48 gigawatts in the Southwest Power Pool, which is a regional transmission organization that ensures reliable power for its members.
The new record emphasized the need for continuing investment in infrastructure, such as new dispatch generation, he said. Evergy has applied to the Kansas Corporation Commission to build two new natural gas plants and one solar power facility in the state.
Growth opportunities through economic development in Kansas and Missouri assure Evergy of future opportunities, Campbell said. 
“Of course, the environment for new economic development projects is competitive and we do not expect to win all projects in the queue, “ he said, adding that multiple projects in Kansas and Missouri are or could affect energy usage.
Those projects include a data center in Missouri, which is in process, and final-stage negotiations with two large customers for two data center projects representing 1.3 gigawatts of load.
“One of these customers is evaluating our Kansas service territory and the other existing data center customer is evaluating expansion in Missouri,” Campbell said. “Both customers remain on track to share announcements regarding their plans later this year.” 
 
Black Hills Energy
Black Hills Energy president and CEO Linn Evans reported earnings of $1.87 per share, and reaffirmed the company’s estimates of a 5% annual growth rate.
He also spoke about three company objectives, including a $1 billion capital plan and executing on regulatory initiatives. Black Hills has asked KCC for a 17.6% rate increase.
“We have successfully implemented new rates through five rate reviews since the beginning of 2024, and we also have two active rate reviews requested to be in effect later this year,” Evans said. “Collectively, regulatory execution by our team on these seven rate reviews reflects the recovery of more than $1.3 billion of new system investments.”
Evans said Black Hills has evaluated any tariff impacts and potential changes in federal legislation and does not believe they will affect the company’s five-year outlook.
“The materials for the majority of our 2025 capital projects are already sourced, and our historical spend from foreign sources has been less than 3%,” he said. “We have strong confidence in our long-term (earnings per share) growth target, 4 to 6%, given our robust balance sheet, capital forecasts, incremental investment potential and our other growth opportunities, highlighted by increasing demand from our data center customers.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090642-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-08 19:06:38.244621

An appeals court rejected the request from the Trump administration to stay the lower court’s order.In the filing to the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argues that the Immigration Nationality Act bars judicial review of discretionary decisions, such as humanitarian parole.Sauer adds that Noem terminated the program because it does not align with the interests of the Trump administration.“The district court’s order stymies the government’s ability to terminate parole grants that the Secretary has determined undermine U.S. interests, and thus it inhibits the government’s pursuit of its foreign policy goals,” according to the brief.Presidents for decades have used their parole authority to allow for migrants to obtain protected status.President Joe Biden created the program in 2023 that temporarily grants work permits and allows nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to remain in the country if they are sponsored by someone in the United States.Thursday’s emergency request is one of several immigration related challenges the Trump administration is asking the high court to intervene in after district courts and appeals courts have ruled against the administration.The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on ending birthright citizenship, the use of the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act, revoking Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans and requirements to return a wrongly deported Maryland man from El Salvador.",,,,2025-05-08 19:06:38.244621

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Federal officials announced an ambitious plan Thursday to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system, acting after several recent deadly plane and helicopter crashes ignited public panic and made air safety a sudden priority for the Trump administration.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlined plans to replace decades-old technology, build new air traffic control centers and towers, and “supercharge” hiring to erase the current national shortage of more than 3,000 air traffic controllers.
Workers would replace radar, software, hardware, and telecommunications networks, with an eye on reducing outages, improving efficiency, and ensuring safety, Duffy said. The plan also aims to eliminate close calls on runways and in approach airspace by expanding a “surface awareness initiative” to 200 airports.
Duffy likened the current system to a flip-phone, saying it has antiquated telecommunications technology that relies on copper wire instead of fiber-optic cable and air traffic control centers dating back to the 1960s.
“You have to redo it all, simply put,” Duffy said. “We are going to build a brand-new air traffic control system. Full stop … this is the biggest lift, the biggest build that has ever happened in the history of the FAA.”
Duffy announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C., before an audience that included politicians, press, and people who lost loved ones when a plane and Army helicopter collided in January over the Potomac River near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Sixty-four plane passengers and three soldiers died in that crash, and investigators revealed more than 15,000 “near-miss” incidents occurred near the airport in the four years before the crash.
President Donald Trump joined the announcement by phone, referring to ongoing delays and outages at Newark Liberty International Airport as “the flavor of the moment.” On April 28, a radio and radar outage left air traffic controllers unable to track aircraft or communicate with pilots at Newark airport for 90 seconds.
“That was not a good situation,” Trump said Thursday. “I’m sorry what you’re going through with the terminals, but we’re going to get them fixed up.”
It’s unclear if the proposed improvements will ever happen, as Duffy and Trump had no cost estimate for the plan.
Pressed by reporters, Duffy said administration officials haven’t put a price tag on the plan, although he expects it will cost “billions. Lots of billions.”
“I’m going to leave that to the Congress,” Duffy said.
He added: “Congress has a lot of fights over money. This is one they should not fight over.”
Rep. Sam Graves (R-Missouri) said the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which he chairs, has approved a $12.5 billion “down payment” to get improvements rolling.

Trump said he hopes one company will get “one big, beautiful contract, where it’s, you know, they’re responsible for everything from digging ditches to the most sophisticated stuff. And if you have any ideas as to who makes the best system, we’d love to have it.”
Duffy called the plan a national priority and said it will require “permitting reform” so that whatever companies do the work can bypass regulations that would likely drag improvements out over 10 to 15 years or longer. Administration officials instead aim to have the work done within three to four years, Duffy said.
The improvements are especially urgent as the skies become more crowded, Duffy added, citing recent upticks in air taxis and delivery drones.
A parade of CEOs from airlines and industry groups took the microphone after Duffy to applaud the plan as long overdue.
“The technology that we use to track our teenagers is more advanced than what we give to our air traffic controllers. That is literally insane. We need to fix that,” said Todd Hopley of the American Association of Airport Executives. “We need better technology. We need better facilities, and we need more controllers. It is as complicated as that and as simple as that. It’s something we can fix, it’s something we should fix, and it’s something we will fix.”
Joanna Geraghty, the CEO of New York-based Jet Blue, acknowledged the families of crash victims in the audience.
“It should not take a tragedy to solve this problem,” she said. “We know air traffic control delays and challenges far, far too well. This has quite literally been our number one priority for decades.”

The Sawlog fire is burning about 15 miles northeast of Wisdom. Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks closed the river from Muddy Creek Bridge downstream to Sportsman’s Park Fishing Access. Sportsman’s Park Access Site remains open, the agency said in a release. The Sawlog dispersed camping area is also closed. 
The water closures are due to the river being used for bucket drops on the fire. 
On Thursday morning, 173 personnel were on the fire. Smokejumpers and hotshot crews were part of the response, according to Inciweb. 
The fire was reported on May 1 and the cause is underdetermined and under investigation, Anna Bateson, the Public Information Officer for the Sawlog Fire said to the Daily Montanan.
Fire crews have 20% of the fire contained with lines established along the northern and southern borders of the fire. 
Crews have been making use of previous hand lines and have been working on mop-up duties. Four crews, three engines, and two helicopters have been among the response to the early-season fire.
The fire is burning through timber, sagebrush and short grass. Bateson said there are some areas of “heavy” dead and downed trees near the fire.
A cold front passing through the area could put winds on the fire up to 40 mph on Thursday, according to the fire situation report.
“Fire behavior may pick up today just due to the winds with the dry, cold front passes through,” Bateson said. “So, you know, maybe little more moderate than the smoldering and creeping than they’ve seen in the past couple days.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sawlog-5-3-MOB-smoke-sign-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-08 19:06:38.244621

“What do tariffs mean to Utah?” the report by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute said. “The current upheaval in U.S. trade policy creates greater economic uncertainty and elevates the risk of a recession.”

The impacts could reach far and wide.  
“Unsure about the cost and availability of inputs, businesses freeze or delay hiring, purchasing, and investment decisions,” the report said. “With inflation still above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2.0%, persistent tariffs could lead to stagflation, where the economy is shrinking or not growing but prices rise.”
They could also further aggravate Utah’s already expensive and strained housing market at a time when the price of homes is near record highs, at roughly $550,000 for a median-priced single family home.  
“Tariffs could also adversely affect Utah’s housing market in the short term,” the report said. “In addition to the indirect macro impacts on household balance sheets and interest rates, higher prices for imported lumber and other materials would lead to higher home prices in a state already struggling with housing affordability.”
As of the fourth quarter of 2024, Utah’s housing market ranked as the ninth most expensive in the country when it came to the median sales price of a single-family home. Only areas including Oregon, New York, Colorado, Washington, Massachusetts, Washington D.C., California and Hawaii ranked higher.

According to a World Trade Center Utah survey of Utah businesses across all of the state’s major sectors in late January and early February gauging their responses to proposed tariffs, 71% said they planned to raise prices for buyers of their goods, the report said. About 56% said they would reduce revenue, 29% said they would freeze planned investments, and many respondents chose more than one of those actions. 
The report also included a quote from the investment research firm Alpine Macro: “Uncertainty over the endpoint of U.S. trade policy could be as damaging as the tariffs themselves.” 
While unpacking U.S. trade policy considerations under Trump, the report also notes that proposed tariffs on a wide variety of imported goods remain “negotiable,” and included a list of proposals that had been contemplated as of April 10, including but not limited to: 

10% universal tariff on all countries
Up to 125% tariff on Chinese goods
25% tariff on non-USMCA compliant goods from Canada and Mexico
25% tariff on goods imported from any country that imports Venezuelan oil 
25% tariffs on aluminum and steel
25% tariffs on autos and auto parts

“The ultimate impact on the overall U.S. effective tariff rate remains to be seen but could range from 11.5% to 25.0%, up from about 3.0% in January 2025,” the report said. 
‘Everybody agrees it’s going to cause pain’: Utah governor on tariffs, possible recession

However, it added: “The uncertainty of current U.S. trade policy makes it difficult to estimate the impact of the new rounds of tariffs.”
“Analysts can, however, surmise the new administration’s economic policy and the motivation for tariff increases, as well as summarize the economic theory that supports free trade and discourages barriers to trade, including tariffs,” the report said. 
To that end, the report said the Trump administration “appears to be focused on four major economic goals,” including: 

Trade deficit: Reducing the U.S. trade deficit and rebalancing global trade. The report noted that the U.S. trade imbalance in 2024 tallied $918 billion. 
Budget deficit: Lowering U.S. federal fiscal deficits. “In federal fiscal year 2024, the federal government collected $4.9 trillion in revenues and spent $6.8 trillion in expenditures for a $1.9 trillion deficit,” the report said. “The accumulated U.S. debt stands at $36.5 trillion.”
Labor: Reversing the decadeslong decline in labor’s share of income. “Employee compensation as a share of national income fell from 67.1% in 1980 to 62.0% in 2024,” the report said. 
Taxes: Making permanent the tax cuts from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in 2017 from the first Trump administration and enacting other tax reductions. The Trump administration is also considering taxes including taxes on tips, overtime, auto loan payments and more.

“The implementation of these policies is under way and includes short-term disruptions with the hope of long-term benefits,” the report said. 
Impact of international trade in Utah
Utah’s international imports and exports continue to be a significant economic driver, according to the report. 
Last year, Utah imported $21.9 billion worth of goods from 154 countries while it exported $18.2 billion in goods to 201 countries, representing a goods trade deficit of $3.7 billion. 
Three countries accounted for the lion’s share (55.7%) of Utah’s imports. “Mexico provided $4.8 billion of goods (nearly $2.0 billion of which was unwrought gold), Canada provided $4.7 billion (roughly $1.5 billion of which was gold), and China sent almost $2.7 billion,” the report said. 
  (Courtesy of the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute)
Utah’s 2024 exports supported an estimated $8 billion in the state’s gross domestic product, $3.9 billion of earnings, $15.9 billion of gross output, and 70,171 jobs. “These impacts represent 2.6% of GDP, 2.3% of earnings, 3.0% of output, and 2.9% of total employment in Utah,” according to the report. 
Of the countries sending the most goods to Utah, Mexico is the largest, followed closely by Canada and China, according to the report. 
“The three accounted for 56% of the value of Utah’s imports in 2024, with Mexico alone supplying 22%,” the report said. 
Over the past decade, from 2014 to 2024, Utah’s exports have increased by 12%, according to the report. That’s compared with a national growth of 15.8%, adjusted for inflation.
Natalie Gochnour, director of the Kem C. Gardner Institute, said in a prepared statement issued Thursday alongside the report that its findings show “Utah consistently punches above its weight in international trade, outperforming many peer states.” 
“This research underscores how critical exports are in maintaining a diverse and robust economy in the state, creating opportunities and strengthening our economic foundation,” she said.

Before that, at various points, it was home to a coal yard, steel foundry and glass-making plant.
Since the scrapyard relocated in 2011, however, the property has sat fallow, plagued by weeds and the remnants of pollutants left over from its industrial past.
On Thursday, Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials heralded the site as the “poster child” for a slate of recently-passed regulations that they hope will speed the process for cleaning up thousands of Connecticut’s abandoned, derelict and potentially contaminated properties.
“I’ve been doing this for a while, and people are impatient,” Lamont said. “They get impatient with government, and they just want to speed things up.”
The new rules, finalized last month, do away with a 1980s-era law known as the Transfer Act, which had widely come to be seen as an outdated and cumbersome system for remediating polluted properties.
Under the Transfer Act, properties that served as home to dry cleaners, auto repair shops, furniture strippers or any other entity that generated more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste — about half of an industrial 55-gallon drum — in a month became subject to costly investigations and burdensome regulations whenever owners sought to sell or transfer ownership of the property.
Those requirements applied regardless of whether the property ever had a documented spill or other release of hazardous materials.

“We really created a class of establishments that were guilty until proven innocent,” said Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes. 
“I think we could understand that in the spirit of that time where there was a lack of pressure from the private sector to ensure that contamination was was documented and investigated and cleaned up,” she continued. “But the effect of the Transfer Act was it placed this very significant burden only on certain types of businesses, or these certain types of establishments, and no requirements on properties that didn’t fit that definition.”
Under the new rules, properties that have not already fallen under the Transfer Act’s jurisdiction will be able to avoid that process so long as they have not had a documented release of hazardous materials that requires remediation. 
At the same time, the rules attempt to create a more straightforward approach for cleaning up historical or newly-discovered sources of contamination. That helped the measure win the support of environmental groups.
“It actually puts in a system to respond to actual releases,” said Roger Reynolds, the senior legal director at Save the Sound. “We hadn’t had that before. We sort of relied on the Transfer Act, and then just DEEP’s general authority to, you know, stop pollution, basically, is what the statute says.” 
Jane Kimball Warren, an environmental attorney who represents property owners on matters involving the Transfer Act, said in a recent interview that long-standing distrust among environmental advocates, developers and businesses had served as a barrier to reform efforts.
In 2020, however, state lawmakers passed legislation requiring DEEP come up with a new, released-based system similar to those in existence in most other states. Over the next four years, the state held dozens of informational meetings while drafting the new rules, which were approved by the legislature’s Regulations Review Committee on April 22.
“I think it just became a matter of just opening the doors and getting everybody’s thoughts and it was refreshing,” Warren said. “I think that once they started opening the doors and listening they got a lot of fresh exchange of opinions, and it was really nice to see that happen.”
About 2,500 properties have unfulfilled obligations under the Transfer Act, according to DEEP, and remain subject to its cleanup and investigation standards.
As part of the process of developing its new system, however, DEEP also updated some of those standards to reduce costs and streamline remediation. As a next step, Dykes said that the agency is working to create a “bridge” for those 2,500 property owners to utilize some aspects of the newer release-based rules to achieve even quicker results.
According to an estimate from economists at the Department of Economic Community Development, the new release-based rules will provide a $3.78 billion boost to the state’s economy and help create more than 2,100 construction jobs.
In prior events at other major cleanup sites around the state, DECD Commissioner Dan O’Keefe has colorfully described them as “dystopian hellscapes.”
“I don’t think that is hyperbole,” O’Keefe said Thursday. “These are sites that were built for an economic use case that has simply moved on…. When we take these sites down and remediate them and prepare them for development, not only are we removing blight, but we’re reinventing these places towards something that can be incredible, mixed use, housing, retail, et cetera.”

At the Hartford scrapyard that was the site of Thursday’s press conference, city and state officials recently announced a $5.4 million plan to begin remediating the property through funding approved by the State Bond Commission. Among the list of contaminants on the site include polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, metals, petroleum and other hazardous materials.
The city took over the site from its former owners, the Danny Corporation, in 2021 and has since touted it as a potential corridor for “residential, commercial and industrial incubator space,” according to the Hartford Courant.
As Lamont and administration officials and Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam were touting the new rules amid the weeds and graffiti-tagged structures of the former scrapyard, lawmakers in the state Capitol were giving final approval to legislation that was intended to provide a smooth transition to the new system.
The legislation, Senate Bill 1404, included several technical revisions the existing law and clarified that the Transfer Act will sunset and the new regulations take effect on March 1, 2026, according to state Rep. Steve Meskers, D-Greenwich, who serves as co-chair of the Commerce Committee.
The bill passed both the Senate and the House unanimously and now heads to Gov. Lamont, who said on Thursday that he will sign it into law.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0508_SR_TransferAct188-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-08 18:06:16.247640
,DC,2025-05-08 21:57:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"As Trump slashes AmeriCorps, states lose a federal partner in community service",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-slashes-americorps-states-lose-federal-partner-community-service,,"WASHINGTON — Hillary Kane learned on a Saturday morning in April that within days, she would lose AmeriCorps funding for two programs that match mentors with West Philadelphia high schoolers and first-generation college students — both vulnerable groups at risk of not completing diplomas and degrees.Kane, director of the Philadelphia Higher Education Network for Neighborhood Development, dreaded calling her AmeriCorps members to say the federal government had just terminated their positions in the nationwide service program. It embeds nearly 200,000 Americans each year in community nonprofits, schools and other organizations.“My first thought was just a string of expletives, just that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach,” she said, recalling the April 26 morning.The federal agency dedicated to community service and volunteerism, which works in close partnership with states, is the latest target since President Donald Trump began his second term with an aggressive campaign to dismantle programs and slash the federal workforce.The agency abruptly cut $400 million, or 41% of its budget, and placed 85% of its staff on administrative leave last month, according to court records.AmeriCorps had provided $960 million to fund 3,100 projects across the United States each year, according to general undated figures available on the agency’s website.Two of Kane’s grants were abruptly canceled as part of the cuts, and as of May 20, she’ll lose nearly 30 AmeriCorps members.“They're literally just left stranded,” she said. “You know, I have members who are single moms with kids and suddenly don't have insurance, or at least by the end of the month they won't.”Five of Kane’s members were placed in three high schools in West Philadelphia helping students with career exploration, resumes and college applications. They also provided recreation activities after school.“We’re in under-resourced schools,” Kane said. “We've got schools that have one counselor for 300 students, and they're not even primarily a college counselor, right? They're guidance counselors who are dealing with all kinds of other issues.”Even more short-staffingThe cuts have produced upheaval for many nonprofits.AmeriCorps members serve various roles in organizations that support environmental conservation projects, rebuild after natural disasters, prepare adults for the GED exam, tutor children and more.Rick Cohen, of the National Council of Nonprofits, said the announcement was a blow to community organizations that are already stretched thin.“Groups that were already short-staffed and facing all these other headwinds are now even further short-staffed and trying to figure out how to keep things going and how to keep helping people,” said Cohen, the chief communications officer and chief operating officer for the advocacy organization.“It's a very difficult time for a lot of people in the nonprofit sector because you never want to have to tell somebody that’s coming to you for help that you can't help them, and that there's not somewhere else for them to turn,” Cohen said.Aaron Gray, who helped run an AmeriCorps program serving at-risk youth in Pennsylvania’s Allegheny County from 1997 to 2017, said “it’s a shame.”Over the years as an assistant director, Gray placed thousands of service members with community organizations, faith-based programs and schools.“I think this is gonna be detrimental. AmeriCorps has been around since the 90s, and it took a long time to build up to this, and it's just being eviscerated overnight. If it survives, or if it's brought back at some later point, it's going to take a generation to rebuild.”Clinton administrationCongress created AmeriCorps in 1993 when President Bill Clinton was in office. Then titled the Corporation for National and Community Service, the agency absorbed other government service programs including Volunteers in Service of America, or VISTA, created in 1964 to combat poverty, and the National Civilian Community Corps, referred to as NCCC, created in 1992 to assist natural disaster recovery.The agency grew to include FEMA Corps in 2012 and Public Health AmeriCorps in 2022, among other specialized programs.Service members, who are not federal employees, are provided a meager stipend of a few hundred dollars a week and receive an education award to pay for college or student loans upon completion of service, which typically lasts just under a year. As of 2024, the award was roughly $7,300.Members, who range in age from young adults to senior citizens, can also receive health insurance while serving. While participants are not allowed to apply for unemployment, some can seek food assistance.The administration terminated all NCCC programs in mid-April. Then, late on Friday, April 25, more than 1,000 grantees were told to pull their members from service immediately, according to court filings.AmeriCorps did not respond to questions about the cuts.Lawsuits filedTwo lawsuits challenging the cuts are working their way through the federal courts. Fourteen organizations, the union representing AmeriCorps staffers and three individual plaintiffs who were AmeriCorps members filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on May 5.The nonprofits bringing the lawsuit are based in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Virginia.Plaintiffs say the immediate termination of grants has caused irreparable harm to nonprofits and AmeriCorps members who have now lost income, health insurance and large portions of their education awards, according to the complaint.Plaintiff J. Doe 3 relocated to Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a second year of service, embedded with the Kingdom Community Corporation, a nonprofit that helps first-time homebuyers learn how to avoid foreclosure and that provides counseling certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.According to the 55-page complaint, Doe 3 began service in February and was engaging with community members on a daily basis, answering anywhere from 25 to 75 calls. Doe 3 planned to use the education award to continue higher education.“The sudden cancellation of Doe 3’s AmeriCorps position has left them in a new city, without a job, lacking the experience, skill building, and community they signed up for,” according to the complaint.States left reelingStates are also affected by the cuts.AmeriCorps’ structure puts the agency in close connection with states. Each state government establishes its own commission to determine which priorities and organizations receive the annual federal dollars.For example, in Kane’s state of Pennsylvania, more than 8,500 members were placed in various roles at 1,000 nonprofits in 2024. The state’s commission received $38.8 million in federal dollars, while local dollars supplemented the rest, reaching $54.8 million in total funding for the year, according to the latest AmeriCorps annual state-by-state reports.On April 29, state attorneys general from nearly two dozen states and the District of Columbia sued the administration, alleging the cuts were illegal.The 123-page complaint details how U.S. DOGE Service officials arrived at AmeriCorps offices in D.C. on April 8 and began working with the interim agency head, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi, to plot program cuts.“This case presents only the latest chapter in an ongoing saga, as the Administration attempts to dismantle federal agencies without Congressional approval,” according to the court filing.States that brought the legal challenge include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.White House responseIn a statement provided to States Newsroom Thursday, the White House defended the cuts.“AmeriCorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in unaccounted for payments in 2024 alone. President Trump is restoring accountability to the entire Executive Branch,” said spokesperson Anna Kelly.Editor’s note: D.C.

SPRINGFIELD – Two state-run health care programs that extend Medicaid-like coverage to noncitizens may have provided significant financial benefits for Illinois hospitals.

That’s according to preliminary results of an ongoing study at the University of Chicago that suggests the programs corresponded, at least in part, to a 15% reduction in the amount of bad debt Illinois hospitals incurred each year since the programs have been in full effect.

“The number that we find is a 15% reduction,” Aresha Martinez-Cardoso, an assistant professor and researcher at U of C’s Embodying Racism Lab, where the study is being conducted, said in an interview. “We think that that might be a high estimate, given what we know about perhaps other things that are going on that we can't entirely rule out, but we do think that part of that reduction is associated with the policy.”

That translates to an average of $1.5 million per year, per hospital, according to the report, although the exact amount would vary greatly depending on a hospital’s size and the volume of patients it treats who are covered by the programs.

“Our early findings show that this landmark policy isn’t just about access — it also serves as a strategic investment in our hospitals and the health of entire communities,” Martinez-Cardoso said.

Those findings come as Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration is preparing to shut down the larger of the two programs as part of his budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year. The Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults, or HBIA, currently covers more than 31,000 eligible noncitizens aged 42-64, at a cost of about $21 million per month, according to the most recent data from the Department of Healthcare and Family Services.

The other program, Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors, covers eligible noncitizens aged 65 and over. That program currently covers about 8,900 individuals at a cost of about $10 million per month. Pritzker has not proposed eliminating it.

The programs were launched in 2020 and 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a means of extending health coverage to individuals who did not qualify for other publicly funded health care programs solely due to their immigration status. Those include individuals who are in the United States without legal authorization as well as certain legal permanent residents who have not yet been in the country long enough to qualify for Medicaid.

The programs have been controversial since they were first proposed. Republicans have been especially critical, saying the programs serve as an incentive for immigrants to cross into the United States illegally and settle in Illinois to receive taxpayer-funded health benefits.

With the state facing slow revenue growth and a projected budget deficit in the coming year, Pritzker surprised many of his supporters in February when he proposed closing the HBIA program.

Eliminating the program for middle-aged adults is projected to save the general revenue fund about $330 million, according to the governor’s office. Pritzker told reporters after his address in February he expects the federal government will stop reimbursing states for costs associated with programs providing services to noncitizens.

A week after the governor’s budget address, the Illinois Auditor General released a report that said enrollment in both programs and their eventual costs had far exceeded their original projection. The cost for the two programs, the report said, exceeded $1.6 billion over the course of four fiscal years.

Unlike Medicaid, which is jointly funded with state and federal funds, the health programs for noncitizens are funded almost entirely with state dollars.

The study looked at publicly available hospital financial reports to analyze changes in the amount of uncompensated care they provided from 2017 to 2023. It also looked at similar data from hospitals in Indiana and Wisconsin, neighboring states that do not provide health benefits for noncitizens.

“We tried to flip it a few different ways,” Martinez-Cardoso said in an interview. “There could be a lot of other things happening. But when we test a bunch of different models … we kind of see a consistent pattern that the policy timing is associated with bad debt.”

She said the results so far are only preliminary and that analysis of the data is continuing. But she said the analysis so far shows a strong link between the enactment of the programs and an overall reduction in uncollectable debt.

(Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana legislative committee has dramatically rewritten an anti-DEI policy proposal for state agencies that would now prohibit schools from requiring certain race and gender-based curriculum for undergraduate students. 
The House and Governmental Affairs Committee approved a substantially re-written version of House Bill 421 by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, which would prohibit compulsory classes that cover any of the following subjects: 

Critical race theory
White fragility or white guilt
Systemic racism, institutional racism or anti-racism
Systemic bias, implicit bias or unconscious bias
Intersectionality
Gender identity
Allyship
Race-based reparations
Race-based privilege
The use of pronouns 

Courses that include these topics could still be taught, but the classes could not be required for graduation. The bill makes an exception for majors, minors and certificates that are specifically related to race or gender studies. 
In its original state, Chenevert’s bill would have prohibited diversity, equity and inclusion practices in state agencies, but an amendment made public late Wednesday night drastically re-wrote the bill, focusing it on college and university curriculum in addition to forbidding DEI trainings. 
Rep. Denise Marcelle, D-Baton Rouge, objected to Chenevert putting forward major and controversial changes to the bill with little notice. Committee members voted 10-6 to advance the proposal.
Contacted for his reaction after the vote, LSU Faculty Senate President Dan Tirone said the measure would restrict subject matter experts from determining what topics are necessary for students to learn, though he said he appreciates the bill does not place a blanket ban on those subjects. 
“Having state statutes which limit what can be taught in many of the mandatory introductory courses across a wide array of fields …  seems to be the imposition of a bureaucratic process which will diminish the ability to adequately prepare our students and substitute policymaker preferences for the professional expertise of our professors and instructors,” Tirone said in a statement. 
Opponents of Chenevert’s revised bill include the Southern University Foundation, the NAACP Baton Rouge chapter, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Louisiana Democratic Party. 
“It’s been a known fact that there have been pervasive instances of racial and gender discrimination in our state and nation,” Louisiana Democratic Party chairman Randal Gaines said. “Those particular consequences have not been eliminated. So DEI programs not only help to remedy those consequences, but they make sure that they’re not repeated.” 
Conservative groups supporting the bill include the Foundation for Government Accountability and the Louisiana Family Forum. Chenevert told committee members that Gov. Jeff Landry supports the legislation. 
While Chenevert said she believes her bill promotes equality and eliminating bias, Black lawmakers on the committee raised concerns with eliminating practices they view as necessary. 
“I’ve only been able to get jobs in government agencies because they were forced to see me, they were forced to give me an opportunity,” Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, said. “Because with my three degrees, I still was not given opportunity based on my merit because the color of my skin, and the gender that I was born kept me out of those places.” 
Marcelle also expressed concern that the bill’s language could prohibit law enforcement from receiving racial bias recognition training. Chenevert said she did not believe the bill would prohibit that training, but she indicated she was open to amendments that would clarify that. 
As it reads now, the legislation would prohibit any training, policies or procedures “designed in reference to race, color, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation.” 
Last year, Chenevert sponsored legislation to require K-12 schools, colleges and universities to issue reports to the legislature on their DEI spending. Schools at all levels reported minimal expenditures on DEI activities.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers on the Maine Legislature’s Judiciary Committee heard more than eight hours of public testimony Thursday on a package of Republican bills that would roll back protections for transgender students in schools. The proposals include measures to restrict access to bathrooms and locker rooms, limit participation in sports, and prohibit school staff from using students’ affirming names and pronouns without parental permission.
Supporters of the bills described them as efforts to protect girls’ safety and fairness in athletics, as well as to uphold parents’ rights in decisions about their children’s gender identity. But critics argued the legislation mirrors a national wave of attacks on transgender rights and would put trans youth at risk.
Maine, which has drawn national attention for its gender-inclusive school policies, has seen an influx of proposals targeting those protections this session. In addition to sports, bathroom, and pronoun restrictions, lawmakers introduced bills that would strip gender identity from the Maine Human Rights Act and limit access to gender-affirming care.
Transgender teens and allies crowd State House to fight anti-trans bills

Similar bills have been passed by at least 28 states across the country, a statistic some Republican lawmakers cited during their testimony on Thursday. 
But in Maine, similar attempts to restrict trans students’ rights have failed, said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine. 
“They’re trying to rehash issues that we’ve already had debates on here in the Legislature time and time again,” she said. “The tactics some of the opposition have used are dangerous, and this has been going on for years now.”
The issue of trans girls’ participation in sports has been central to Maine’s months-long standoff with the Trump administration. After Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) posted a photo of a trans student athlete on her legislative Facebook page, President Donald Trump singled out Maine for its policy, prompting Gov. Janet Mills to tell the president she would see him in court. Since that exchange, at least three federal agencies opened investigations into Maine, claiming the state’s inclusion of transgender athletes violated Title IX, a federal anti-discrimination law.
Supporters cite safety and fairness in girls’ sports
Before the hearing, a group of female student athletes spoke at a press conference in support of the bills, which they said would address unfair competition from trans athletes. 
The issue of fairness was one that came up repeatedly during the hearing, from the bill sponsors as well as the student athletes that testified in support, who focused on biological differences between boys and girls, such as strength and speed, and argued that allowing trans girls to compete in women’s sports creates safety risks and takes winning opportunities away from cisgender girls.
“Girls shouldn’t have to feel uncomfortable in their sports, or be worried about getting seriously hurt,” said 17-year-old Biance Wright, an athlete from Benton.

Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook), who sponsored one of three bills addressing school sports, said the issue “boils down to one question: Should a person be allowed to self-identify with a gender and be allowed to compete with an automatic advantage?”
Rep. Elizabeth Caruso (R-Caratunk) echoed those concerns, saying the bills she sponsored aimed to restore compliance with Title IX and referenced the Trump administration’s executive order banning trans girls from girls’ sports.
“This is not a political issue, and it’s not a partisan topic,” said Caruso. “Athletic potential depends on biology and not identity. Gender identity may be neutral in many areas of school life, but when it comes to sports and private spaces, terminology matters.”
Caruso and other lawmakers described the bills as a win for all Mainers. Judiciary Committee member Rep. Ellie Sato (D-Gorham) pushed back, asking, “How is it a win for all Mainers if trans students are being discriminated against?”

Bill critics highlight discriminatory rhetoric 
The hearing drew hundreds of people, with critics of the legislation vastly outnumbering supporters. Many who testified, including other student athletes, said they didn’t see an issue with trans student participation in sports.
Paige Lambert, a student athlete from Fairfield, told the committee: “I’ve never felt threatened by a trans athlete. Never felt unsafe or mistreated by a trans athlete.”
“Let me be clear: trans people are not the threat, trans people are under threat,” said Betsy Rodman, an educator and mother of a trans child.
Some speakers warned that the legislation would endanger trans students by increasing bullying, mental health risks, and creating unsafe school environments. They underscored the need for inclusive spaces and highlighted the disproportionate discrimination trans students face, with several citing research that has found high rates of bullying and suicide attempts among trans youth. 
“I can’t count the number of times students have taken refuge in my office to avoid unsafe hallways, locker rooms or bathrooms,” Rodman said. “I’ve never heard of a cisgender student feeling threatened or assaulted by a trans person in a bathroom, but I have many stories in the other direction, unfortunately.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)ChatGPT was hardly a household name when Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski first pitched state regulations limiting artificial intelligence in elections in January 2024.
Seventeen months later, the AI-powered chatbot is part of the zeitgeist. 
“Probably everyone has it downloaded on their phones right now,” Baginski, a Cranston Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday.
It’s only a matter of time, in Baginski’s view, before the rapid embrace of artificial intelligence filters through to local elections, potentially harming candidates and voters manipulated by deceptive images, audio and video created by generative AI. Which is why Baginski is again pushing for legislation that would restrict and regulate election deepfakes for the second year in a row.
Like last year, her proposal sailed through the Rhode Island House of Representatives Thursday, with a 64-1 vote, with one abstention.
Rep. Jennifer Stewart, a Pawtucket Democrat, cast the sole vote against the bill. Stewart did not immediately return inquiries for comment Thursday. Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat, abstained. Corvese’s son-in-law works as policy director for Meta.
But across the rotunda, companion legislation from Sen. Lou DiPalma remains held for review by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, the same place where it languished and eventually died in the 2024 session.
DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, insists he intends to shepherd the legislation “across the finish line” this year.
“This is an opportunity for us to get out in front of what’s going to happen,” DiPalma said in an interview Thursday. “It’s going to happen in Rhode Island. Let’s get out there and put some regulations in place before it does.”
Longstanding fears that AI could be used to manipulate elections and deceive voters was put to the test in 2024, with mixed results, according to experts. In January 2024, a robocall impersonating then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden urged New Hampshire voters not to participate in the state’s presidential primary. The high-profile example of deceitful AI was later linked to a Democratic political consultant fined $6 million by the Federal Communications Commission.
But AI was used in positive ways too, helping candidates connect to voters more efficiently through self-deployed chatbots, emails and text campaigns. In Tokyo’s 2024 gubernatorial election, an obscure independent candidate placed fifth out of 56 contenders after using AI to respond to 8,600 submitted questions from voters, according to analysis by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation out of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Secretary of State Gregg Amore acknowledges there are positive and negative outcomes for AI in elections. The legislation, which has Amore’s backing, doesn’t stop anyone from relying on artificial intelligence to advance campaigns or candidacies. Instead, it simply requires that the candidate, campaign or political action committee wielding AI disclose they are using manipulated images, audio or video in any ads that run within 90 days of an election.
“We’re not designing a felony here, we’re not trying to put someone away,” Amore said in an interview Thursday. “We’re just trying to make sure the public has accurate information 90 days before an election. And that they’re comfortable with the information they’re receiving – who it’s from and how it was created.”

Proactive, not reactive
It’s not unlike the 2012 state law that forced special interest groups to publicly report donations and spending to the state elections panel and include financial disclosures in any campaign ads, John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, wrote in a March 18 letter to the House Committee on State Government and Elections.
“We hadn’t yet seen large expenditures of dark money, but we knew we soon would,” Marion wrote, referring to the 2012 state law passed in reaction to the 2010 Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case. “In 2014, that prediction came true and the state was ready to respond because of the General Assembly’s foresight.”
At least two dozen states have passed some form of regulations around AI advertising in elections, the bulk of them enacting laws in 2024 or later, according to an online tracker by D.C. think tank Public Citizen.
Rhode Island sought, but failed to join them in 2024, with the bill languishing in the Senate Committee on Judiciary. 
Amore chalked up the stall to concerns raised by broadcasters and technology companies afraid of legal action from AI ads broadcast or posted through their platforms without proper disclosure. This year’s bill shifts the onus, and risk of civil court charges, from the content creator to the candidate, political action committee or campaign. 
And it expands disclosure requirements to AI ads promoted via mobile applications and streaming services. Like last year’s iteration, satire and parody are exempt.
Despite these tweaks, the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island again raised First Amendment concerns in a March 18 letter to lawmakers.
“While we recognize that free speech standards in the political arena are not limitless, this legislation, as worded, suggests that any image or recording that meets the definition of ‘synthetic media’ is deceptive or fraudulent and can therefore be regulated,” the ACLU wrote in its unsigned letter. “To allow the government to regulate or ban political speech that some might view as misleading undermines the breathing space that robust political speech requires, whether generated with the help of artificial intelligence or not.”

Indeed, misinformation and deception in elections is a centuries-old malady, considerably worsened and more evident as technology has advanced, as documented in a 2022 report by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Ahead of the 2000 election, a humor magazine manipulated Google search results so that a search of “dumb motherf****r redirected to a George W. Bush merchandise center. The lighthearted “Googlebombing” devolved into more sinister tactics by 2016, when Russian interference into the U.S. presidential elections prompted a yearslong special federal investigation and report, resulting in 100 criminal charges to 34 individuals and 3 companies.
Given the rapid adoption of ChatGPT, Baginski and DiPalma don’t want to wait for the next iteration of technology to sow confusion in elections.
“It may not seem urgent yet because nothing has happened here yet,” DiPalma said. “Once something happens in a local election, watch how fast this passes.”
A committee vote on DiPalma’s bill has not been scheduled as of Thursday, according to Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson. 
Senate President Valarie Lawson remained noncommittal.
“I will be reviewing the committee testimony and speaking to the [Senate Committee] Chairman [Matthew] LaMountain regarding the particulars of this legislation,” Lawson said in a statement Thursday. “All elections should be conducted with the utmost fidelity and the highest standards of transparency and fairness.”

File photo by Natalie Williams/VTDiggerThe Rutland Education Association, the union representing Rutland teachers, voted Thursday afternoon to strike after 18 months of contract negotiations. They said their strike will begin May 14 if an agreement with the school board cannot be reached before then. “After 18 months of fruitless talks with a board that seems more eager to fight, manipulate, threaten, and walk away than reach a settlement with us, we have had enough and we’re not going to take it anymore,” union president Sue Tannen, said in a press release.The Rutland City Board of School Commissioners is scheduled to meet May 9, and Tannen said the union set aside time for more talks with the board then.“We’ll be there,” she said in the release. “We hope the board joins us, so we can avert a disruption of the school year.”The teachers have been working without a contract since the previous one expired in July 2024. Negotiations for a new contract between the Rutland City Board of School Commissioners and the union have been ongoing since January 2024. The teachers’ union maintains it is seeking pay on par with other educators in the region. The school board has said it is bound by the city’s $63.83 million education budget for the 2024-2025 school year, which residents approved on Town Meeting Day in 2024. This year, Rutland voters approved a $67.18 million education budget for the 2025-2026 school year.Faced with an impasse after a year of negotiations, the two sides engaged with an independent fact finder. The fact finder, whose report was released to the parties April 7 and to the public April 18, recommended that salaries be increased by 4.8% for 2024-2025, 5.0% for 2025-2026, and 5.0% for 2026-2027, in order to keep pace with other public employees in the region. The fact finder also recommended an increase in allowed sick days from 10 to 12. The union accepted those terms — though it had initially proposed annual increases of 15%, 10% and 10%, respectively, for each year under the contract.The board, however, rejected the fact finder’s recommendations and instead offered increases of 4.5%, 4%, and 3.5% — an increase from its initial offer of 3% each year. In a press release issued after publication of the fact finder’s report, Rutland City School District Superintendent Bill Olsen wrote that the report “fails to consider” the existing town budget and did not “properly” account for the 10.3% pension benefit teachers receive.Following release of the report, the district announced it would need to cut 18 positions and some programs next school year to stay in line with the budget and the suggested increases. The union has argued the current base teacher salary of $42,078 is well below the living wage for Rutland, which they calculate to be $47,133.This story will be updated.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rutland teachers vote to strike .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rutland-High-School_Natalie-Williams-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-08 18:06:16.247640

Winsome Earle-Sears signed Virginia’s in-progress reproductive rights constitutional amendment, but noted her personal objection to it in a handwritten note on the bill. 
As president of the Senate, she is legally required to sign bills that the legislature passes but she doesn’t have to add any comment to her signatures. Documents obtained by The Mercury show her explanation for why she is against Virginia’s effort to protect reproductive rights like abortion, in vitro fertilization and contraception access in Virginia’s Constitution. 
“I am morally opposed to this bill; no protection for the child,” she wrote above her signature. 
It is the second known message Earle-Sears has penned on a bill she signed but disagreed with  — the first being her note of objection scrawled on a bill last year that would prohibit officials from denying marriage licenses to same-sex or interracial couples, as The Virginia Scope first reported. It is also one of the clearest signals Earle-Sears has sent concerning her views on abortion and reproductive health care since beginning her campaign for governor.
A Sears campaign representative the Mercury reached Thursday afternoon said Earle-Sears had no comment on the matter.
SJR 247 Handwritten Notes
 The motivation behind Earle-Sears’ message

While Earle-Sears’ appearance as a keynote speaker at the Virginia March For Life has already solidified her stance in opposition to proposals that would protect abortion access in Virginia, she’s yet to speak in depth about where she may hold nuanced views on reproductive matters.
Virginia March For Life tees up constitutional amendment ahead of this year’s elections

Abortion access is one of the most politically divisive issues in the state, as Democrats work to shore up protections while Republicans largely support anti-abortion measures, with some GOP members of the legislature having carried life-at-conception bills. In the 2023 elections, many Republicans supported a proposal backed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest or life-threatening situations for the parent. It lacked fetal anomaly exceptions — several of which aren’t diagnosed until at or after 15 weeks. 
Early in her 2021 campaign for liuetenant governor, Earle-Sears had called abortion “genocide” and objected to the procedure in all instances, except for ones that could save the life of the pregnant person. Just over a month before the 2021 elections, she’d scrubbed anti-abortion messaging from her campaign website where she’d vowed to “do everything in my power” to stop abortions in Virginia. 
Because Earle-Sears’ 2021 campaign occurred before federal abortion protections were overturned, stating an opinion against abortion was more a signal to like-minded voters than a legislative promise to eradicate it. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal protections in 2022, the matter has become more salient in campaigns. Some states have fortified protections while others have enacted bans or restrictions. Virginia is currently the least-restrictive state in the south. 
As Virginia’s constitutional amendment has already passed the legislature once, it must do so again next year before appearing on ballots statewide for voters to finally approve or reject. That progress, however, hinges on Democrats retaining their majority in the House of Delegates this year, because the amendment has only advanced on partisan lines. 
Governors don’t formally advance or block constitutional amendments, but should Virginia’s fail to  advance, the next governor will be able to sign potential attempts to restrict or ban abortions within state code.
With Earle-Sears gubernatorial opponent Abigail Spanberger in support of reproductive healthcare access — to include abortions, contraception and fertility treatments — their divergences on the issue may be a deciding factor for some voters later this year.

(Rhode Island Department of Transportation photo)Roughly $251 million in federal funding designated to rehabilitate 15 bridges along Rhode Island’s Interstate 95 between Providence and Warwick has been officially secured, the state’s congressional delegation announced Wednesday.
The funding awarded in July 2024 under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bridge Investment Program had been in doubt after President Donald Trump froze the grant not long after taking office to make sure all federal spending aligned with his new administration’s priorities.
“Transportation investment should be driven by need and merit — not partisanship,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement. “We’re talking about overdue, needed upgrades and maintenance to bridges along our interstate highway system.”
Reed credited Rhode Island’s U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse’s work on the chamber’s Environment and Public Works Committee in getting the funds released. 
“I’ll continue pressing to free and secure federal funding for Rhode Island’s job-creating infrastructure investments,” Whitehouse said in a statement.
The delegation’s announcement comes over a month after the federal government released $221 million in grant funding allocated by the Biden administration to rebuild the westbound Washington Bridge.
This latest $251 million federal funding secured by the state will go toward replacing 11 bridges, while eliminating four in order to improve vertical clearances along I-95. The bridges range from Pettaconsett Avenue in Warwick to Eddy Street in Providence.
The entire project is estimated by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) to cost $723 million. Collectively the bridges serve 180,000 vehicles daily, according to RIDOT.
An additional $549,770 in federal funding will be unfrozen for the city of East Providence to modernize its traffic infrastructure, the congressional delegation announced.

Johnson told reporters that the bill will not change the portion of state Medicaid costs paid by the federal government for states that have expanded Medicaid, like Massachusetts.
The post Speaker Johnson sends signals on two key Medicaid reforms appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","US HOUSE SPEAKER Mike Johnson sent signals Tuesday about the approach his caucus will take to Medicaid as it works this month to craft a budget bill that is expected to seek $1.5 trillion in savings to pay for President Donald Trump’s domestic policy and tax cut agenda.After meeting with moderate Republicans who have been hesitant to go along with conservatives’ ideas to make significant changes Medicaid, The Hill said Johnson told reporters Tuesday that the bill his chamber puts forward will not change the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate, the portion of state Medicaid costs paid by the federal government, for states that have expanded Medicaid, like Massachusetts.Johnson also said the House GOP plan will probably not seek to implement per capita caps on Medicaid benefits for enrollees in expansion states, though he told The Hill and others to “stay tuned.”Changes to FMAP and per capita caps are among the policy ideas being watched closely by Beacon Hill. Cuts in Medicaid would ripple through MassHealth, the largest single chunk of spending in the state budget and a program that affords health care coverage to about 2 million Bay Staters. Under Gov. Maura Healey’s budget plan, federal reimbursement for MassHealth spending was expected to increase by $1.8 billion to $14.2 billion in fiscal 2026.Nearly every dollar in MassHealth spending is reimbursed by at least 50 percent in federal revenue, with expenditures from the Children’s Health Insurance Program reimbursed at 65 percent and expenditures for the state’s Medicaid expansion reimbursed at 90 percent.An analysis from KFF found that MassHealth enrollment would drop by 391,000 people or 19 percent over 10 years if the 90 percent match rate for the expansion population were ended. If Massachusetts wanted to cover the federal share, it would have to increase state spending by $15 billion over 10 years.Switching from the current FMAP reimbursement structure to one in which Medicaid is funded through per capita spending caps or block grants was seen as a way to shift costs from the federal government to state.The Hill reported Tuesday that House Republicans are aiming to get a budget bill through the chamber by Memorial Day, but also called that “an ambitious timeline that is on thin ice amid a host of key policy disagreements — including those surrounding Medicaid.” The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is supposed to find $880 billion in savings and has jurisdiction over Medicaid, delayed its vote on its crucial portion of the budget bill until next week, the outlet reported.Johnson made clear Tuesday that a proposal to impose new work requirements on healthy adults in Medicaid expansion states like Massachusetts in order to keep the 90 percent match rate is still in play.“That will be part of the bill, it always has been,” Johnson said Tuesday.The post Speaker Johnson sends signals on two key Medicaid reforms appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/US-Capitol.jpg?fit=1024%2C531&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-08 18:06:16.247640

The Mississippi River is the nation’s most endangered river, a national conservation group says, because of federal plans to cut flood relief programs as severe weather threats grow.
American Rivers, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization, has issued an annual list of U.S. rivers it views as most at-risk for the past 40 years. The Mississippi’s place at the top comes as communities along the lower river flooded from torrential rain in early April, and as Trump administration officials consider eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, which helps state and local governments respond to disasters.
The list calls attention to the threats rivers face and prioritizes those for which the public can influence policies that affect their well-being, said Mike Sertle, senior director for American Rivers’ Central Region. For the Mississippi River, he said, the organization’s goal is to press the federal government to maintain a role in disaster relief, which it says is critical to safeguarding people in river communities.
“We don’t disagree that things need to be reviewed and updated,” Sertle said. “But we also see there’s importance to keeping the agency.”
The Mississippi River has always flooded. While flooding threatens human structures, it is an important part of the Mississippi River’s life cycle and actually builds land. But experts say floods are growing more frequent, erratic and severe due to climate change. In 2019, the river’s most recent major flood, water stayed at or above flood stage for months and caused $20 billion in damage.
FEMA assists communities during floods and other types of disasters, provides funds for recovery and oversees preparedness efforts, like its flood maps that predict risks in different areas. And it’s doing so more often today. A January 2025 report to Congress found that the average number of major disaster declarations has increased by 61% from the 1980s and 1990s, partly due to climate change.
But it has faced broad criticism for not moving quickly enough after disasters and not helping disaster survivors equally. President Donald Trump has floated the idea of dismantling the agency and in February the agency fired more than 200 of its staffers as part of Trump’s push to shrink the size and scope of the federal government. The White House did not comment on the American Rivers’ report’s criticism of these actions.
Mississippi River flooding touches multiple states
FEMA is especially important for coordinating flooding responses along the Mississippi River because it touches so many states on its journey to the Gulf, said Kelly McGinnis, executive director of the environmental advocacy group One Mississippi.
She and Sertle both described significant room for improvement in how FEMA operates, including speeding up timelines for getting help to communities. The American Rivers report says a more effective and efficient FEMA is critical for flood management as the cycle of drought and flooding on the Mississippi River becomes increasingly extreme.

Cuts to other federally funded flood management agencies will likely impact the Mississippi River beyond the threat to FEMA, the American Rivers report noted.
“FEMA plays a critical role in helping address issues in the aftermath of the flood,” said Alisha Renfro, coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation. “On the front end, it’s really about the Army Corps of Engineers and their budget is being threatened as well.”
In March, a stopgap bill to fund the federal government through Sept. 30 slashed $1.4 billion from the Army Corps of Engineers’ construction budget, which funds hurricane and flood mitigation projects.
With budget losses to both FEMA and the Army Corps, grant programs to address riverine flooding could be impacted substantially. According to FEMA, every federal dollar spent on flood mitigation yields $7 in benefits.
In a statement released after the announcement, the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative announced that it does not agree with the river’s designation as the “Nation’s Most Endangered Waterway,” citing significant improvements including new natural infrastructure, landscape protections, added conservation lands and water quality integrity measures. But the group of mayors agreed that federal oversight of emergency management is needed.
“Disaster response along the Mississippi River is inherently a multi-state question and thus, FEMA needs to continue to play a vital role in coordinating the efforts of many states to systemically mitigate risks, recover, and restore infrastructure. MRCTI Mayors are ready to work with the President to reform FEMA, expand states’ role and save taxpayer resources,” said Belinda Constant, MRCTI Louisiana State Chair and Mayor of Gretna, LA.

American Rivers’ announcement comes as states along the lower Mississippi are experiencing and bracing for flooding from heavy rains upriver. Vicksburg, Mississippi officials are reinforcing flood walls as they wait for water to arrive. In Louisiana, the Army Corps is patrolling New Orleans levees for problems. On Monday, the new Bayou Chene floodgate was closed for the first time due to high water to protect several parishes from backwater flooding as the Atchafalaya River continues to rise.
The Mississippi has made the endangered rivers list in the recent past for other problems. In 2022, the entire river appeared on the list because of pollution and habitat loss, and in 2020, threats from climate change and development landed the upper Mississippi at number one.
The river’s continued appearances on the list show that there isn’t enough progress being made on its biggest challenges, McGinnis said.
But although the distinction may be negative, she said it’s a good excuse to put river issues in the spotlight.
“I think it’s very useful to be having these important conversations,” McGinnis said, “so we can hopefully really begin to change how we handle big rivers.”

Kevin Stitt announced DOGE-OK during the State of the State Address on Feb. 3. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Dozens of people suggested that state government could be made more efficient without state Superintendent Ryan Walters and Gov. Kevin Stitt, according to submissions made to a statewide portal that asks the public for ideas about how to save money.
In all, of the 90 submissions made to the Oklahoma Division of Government Efficiency portal around half targeted Walters, Stitt, and other Republicans leaders, including those serving in state’s congressional delegation, according to Oklahoma Voice’s analysis of portal submissions, which were released in response to an Open Records request.
Submitters were particularly critical of Republicans’ policies, including spending public money to pay for private school education, attempts to incorporate “religion in schools and government,” and for removing options for state employees to work from home.
Better known as “DOGE-OK,” the Stitt-led initiative is modeled after President Donald Trump’s federal Department of Government Efficiency. It requested submissions from the public in what a spokesperson for Stitt said is intended to be a “jumping off point” to find savings within the state government. Stitt’s office did not return a request for comment on if any submissions have been used to inform savings yet.
DOGE-OK has reported finding over $51 million in savings in state government spending since its launch in February, though none of the existing savings appeared to align with the public suggestions in the portal.
Stitt’s DOGE effort is separate from the Oklahoma House portal launched in December. House lawmakers said submissions to that portal informed budget conversations, but also received “spam” targeted at a statewide elected official legislators refused to name.
Some submissions to Stitt’s portal though appeared to be legitimate attempts at pointing out perceived inefficiencies. These included complaints about the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, too many public relations contracts at state agencies and recommendations to consolidate some of the state’s law enforcement agencies. 
At least two individuals identified themselves as current or former state employees. They critiqued inefficiencies in the current process for purchasing orders and asked that the state revert to a previous process. 
One submitter suggested using artificial intelligence to gather public records for those requesting them from the state.
Another recommended providing Department of Corrections officers with tablets to scan inmate IDs to “allow for quicker, safer, and more accurate completion of counts.”
Another suggested that the Oklahoma Tax Commission unnecessarily spends “a lot of time and money going after tax balances that may not be collectable from many years ago.”
But around half of the submissions targeted Walters, Stitt, or other Republican leaders, including U.S. senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin, U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice and anyone who is serving on the DOGE-OK team. 
One person suggested Walters and Stitt not be paid a salary. At least one called for the increased deportation of undocumented immigrants though didn’t include any specifics.
Some submissions contained expletives or were left blank. 
Another commenter questioned the need for an “entire new agency” to tell existing ones to be more efficient and criticized the creation of DOGE-OK as duplicating efforts and “inventing a whole bureaucracy.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)When Ellsworth High School student Ash Blair learned about the slew of bills aiming to restrict transgender students’ rights in schools, the 16-year-old told his friend Felix Markosian he couldn’t imagine living in a world where he and other trans people would be denied access to bathrooms and athletics — or where teachers and classmates wouldn’t be allowed to call him by his chosen name.
Markosian shared how Blair told him he doesn’t know what he’ll do if the bills pass. “I’m trying so hard to stay optimistic and not be doom and gloom, but I genuinely don’t think I’d be able to live like that, with everyone calling me a name that isn’t mine,” Markosian recounted him saying.
That conversation is what compelled Markosian, a senior at Ellsworth High, to join Blair at the State House on Thursday to testify before the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee against several bills that would restrict the rights of transgender youth in schools. 
Maine GOP lawmakers push suite of bills targeting trans students amid federal scrutiny

“Hearing that, I knew I had to be here,” Markosian said after his testimony.
As Markosian and Blair walked through the circular hallway beneath the State House rotunda, dozens of advocates greeted them with applause. In the background, three supporters held a hand-painted sign in the colors of the transgender flag.
The students were among hundreds of Mainers who packed the State House on Thursday to oppose a slate of legislation, brought by Republican lawmakers, that would limit trans students’ access to bathrooms and locker rooms, participation in sports, and the use of names and pronouns that reflect their gender identity.
The dozens of young people and other supporters of the bills were substantially outnumbered by the crowd gathered to oppose the legislation. 
Citing national attacks on trans rights and uncertainty in Maine due to federal investigations, hundreds of students, parents of trans youth, faith leaders, educators and other community members came to Augusta to show their support for transgender rights. They lined the halls and crowded into rooms throughout the capitol building to watch the proceedings, cheering and clapping as one speaker after another testified against the bills.

That turnout in opposition to these “dangerous bills” is telling of where Maine stands on these issues, said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine.
“There is a small number of folks who want to roll back civil rights for trans folks, but they’re outnumbered,” Drew said. “But it’s unfortunate that young people are in the crosshairs of this, and they’re hearing negative comments about who they are as people.”
Although their school is supportive of their identity, the bullying by other students has gotten much worse for Blair and his friends, which they attribute to national anti-trans rhetoric. 
“Especially since our current president has been around, it’s gotten a lot worse, really fast,” Blair said. “I remember in January I had to go to the office three or four times a week for horrible transphobia.”

Blair and 15-year-old Axel Cough, a gender-fluid student from Ellsworth, said they are frustrated about the view that trans girls are “predators.” Cough, who uses he/they pronouns, said they are afraid violence may increase if these bills pass.
“They’re targeting trans women and saying they’re predators, which only furthers the discrimination,” Cough said. “The fact that I, as a child, even had to come here and fear for my safety, and that other children have to fear, is incredibly disturbing.”
Soon after Markosian and Ellsworth High School teacher Carolyn Kutny testified on Thursday, the students returned to school.

Oliver Holtz from Casco Bay High School in Portland also testified that if the bills were to pass, Maine schools would no longer remain a safe space for fellow trans students, particularly those without supportive families. 
Holtz particularly opposed LD 1704 and LD 1002. These respective bills would bar trans students from using the bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity, and restrict them to using the names and pronouns assigned at birth unless there’s written parental permission and official documentation of a legal name change, according to sponsor Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls).
“Some people don’t really have anywhere to have that safe space, except at school,” Holtz said. “Letting students identify and be their truest selves at school literally saves lives.”

Phil Murphy said language changes to the bill are needed to protect the rights of legitimate protestors.  (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy, citing First Amendment concerns, has conditionally vetoed legislation intended to deter disruptive pop-up parties that have harried shore towns in recent summers.
Murphy on Thursday said he supports the bill’s intent but worries its language could chill free speech and peaceful protest, and he warned provisions could criminalize lawful mask wearing. Civil rights advocates had urged Murphy to veto the bill.
“My proposed changes recommend modest revisions that preserve the intent and integrity of the bill, while ensuring that First Amendment rights are not inadvertently hindered,” the governor said in his veto message.
The bill, which won unanimous votes in both legislative chambers in March, would have created new criminal charges of inciting a public brawl for those who “engage” or “promote” at least four others to engage in disorderly conduct.
Murphy’s conditional veto suggests lawmakers change the bill to say those who “incite” or attempt to incite at least four others to such conduct could be charged with inciting a public brawl. Under both versions of the bill, inciting a public brawl would carry maximum penalties of 18 months’ imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.
Civil liberties advocates who had cautioned about the impact the bill could have on constitutionally protected speech hailed the governor’s action.
“By conditionally vetoing this bill, we can now work to ensure that no New Jerseyan can be targeted by law enforcement for exercising their First Amendment rights,” said Jim Sullivan, interim policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “Amidst unprecedented attacks on the right to protest and assemble, we’re calling on state lawmakers to protect our most fundamental civil rights and liberties.”
Lawmakers backed the bill in a bid to stop pop-up parties that have drawn teens and young people in numbers that have overwhelmed local law enforcement in some shore towns. Last Memorial Day weekend, a fight between large groups of teenagers in Ocean City ended with a 15-year-old stabbed.
The bill would also have added a disorderly persons offense for those who attempt to conceal their identities while engaging in disorderly conduct. Murphy wants lawmakers to add exceptions for medical, religious, or expressive masks, and for disguises.
Disorderly persons offenses are what New Jersey calls misdemeanors. They carry penalties of up to six months’ imprisonment and fines of not more than $1,000.
The bill’s chief Senate sponsor said legislators would take up the changes, which he viewed as largely technical.
“I’ve showed it to police chiefs in our district. They don’t believe it substantially changes their ability to use this statute on people that are coming into their jurisdiction and trying to create public brawls and major disruptions and take over events and cause mayhem and havoc,” said Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester).
He said he hopes to have both chambers concur with the conditional veto by the end of the Senate’s June 2 voting session.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Merck Animal Health will build an $895 million capital expansion project and add 200 jobs at its De Soto manufacturing facility, Gov. Laura Kelly and the company announced Thursday.
Merck will invest $860 million in its existing facility and $35 million in its research and development laboratories, a press release said.
Kelly billed the announcement as the second-largest private investment in Kansas history.
“This extraordinary investment by Merck Animal Health underscores my administration’s commitment to securing a strong economic future for our state and ensuring prosperity for generations to come,” Kelly said. “Public-private partnerships that lead to major global projects, such as those with Merck, Fiserv and Panasonic — just to name a few recent successes — are occurring because people believe in Kansas.”
Merck Animal Health has been in the De Soto community for more than 20 years, said Mayor Rick Walker.
“We’ve watched them grow. They’ve grown with us. So we’re excited to see them continue to make this level of investment in our city,” he said. “The Merck property, the way their project lays out, it’s pretty much all upside on that. It’s very little stress on our transportation infrastructure and our utility infrastructure.”
City administrator Mike Brungardt said other economic developments, like the decision by Panasonic to build a 300-acre facility in the city’s Astra Enterprise Park, are “wonderful,” but seeing Merck expand is special in a different way.
“It’s a recognition that not only did they come here 20 or 25 years ago, but they made the decision again to redouble their investment in our community,” he said. “This one when it came across as a possibility, it stood out from the others because this is an existing partner in our community with an existing employment base. They’ve already invested an enormous amount in the fabric of our community.”
Brungardt added that Lt. Gov. David Toland, who also serves as state commerce secretary, said in a speech Thursday that if the company had decided not to do this expansion, its future plans for the campus were uncertain.
“This was a very big win in ways that the others just weren’t,” Brungardt said.
Brungardt said a tax incentive package for the project has not been finalized. Merck Animal Health has been investing in its existing facility for the past five or 10 years, he said, and has received an incentive package.
That package has been an 80% property tax abatement for 10 years, Walker said, adding that there likely will be a construction sales tax exemption.
The 200,000-square-foot manufacturing facility project will expand filling and freeze dryer capacity for large molecule vaccines and biologic products for Merck Animal Health, the press release said.
Site preparation and facility design will start immediately, creating 2,500 construction jobs. Commercial manufacturing is expected to begin in 2030.
“Our De Soto manufacturing facility is strategically located in the heart of the Animal Health Corridor. This region is renowned for its concentration of animal health companies, fostering an unparalleled ecosystem for innovation, collaboration and industry leadership,” said Richard DeLuca, Merck Animal Health president.
The KC Animal Health Corridor is anchored by Manhattan, Kansas, and Columbia, Missouri, and is home to about 300 animal health companies. Those companies represent 56% of total worldwide animal health, diagnostics and pet food sales, the organization’s website said.
The corridor supports jobs in this field, Brungardt said. Workforce has been an ongoing topic of discussion.
“Within a 30-minute drive of De Soto, we’ve got 2 million people living here,” he said. “Mechanisms to deliver the pipeline for workforce for advanced manufacturing and research and development jobs tie in with the Animal Health Corridor. Manhattan will be a pipeline for the research development jobs.”
Since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Merck has allocated more than $12 billion to enhance domestic manufacturing and research capabilities, with additional planned investments of more than $9 billion over the next four years, the press release said.
“Merck’s massive expansion in De Soto further elevates Kansas’ long-established status as a global leader in animal health,” Toland said. “The opportunities and ripple effects of having almost $1 billion surge into the local economy will have far-reaching and long-lasting reverberations across the entire state.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5020092-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-08 17:09:21.466134

,DC,2025-05-08 20:46:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,'Out of control': Kristi Noem on defense over Homeland Security spending overrun,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/out-control-kristi-noem-defense-over-homeland-security-spending-overrun,,"WASHINGTON  — The top Democrat on a U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee panel Thursday slammed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for her handling of her agency’s funding and the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.Sen. Chris Murphy warned Noem that DHS is at risk of running out of its $65 billion in funding by July – two months before the end of the fiscal year – and therefore close to triggering the Antideficiency Act, a federal law prohibiting government agencies from spending funds in excess of their appropriations. “Your department is out of control,” the Connecticut Democrat told Noem. “You are running out of money.”Noem, who appeared before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, was also grilled by Democrats about the high-profile case of a wrongly deported Maryland man sent in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador.The White House’s “skinny” budget proposal suggests $107 billion for DHS starting Oct. 1, and assumes that Republicans pass the reconciliation package under consideration to allocate a massive $175 billion overall in border security.  “If we now live in a world in which the administration spends down the accounts that were priorities for Republicans and does not spend down the priorities that were priorities for Democrats, I don't know how we do a budget,” Murphy said.Sen. Patty Murray, top Democrat on the full Senate Appropriations Committee, slammed Noem for not following “our appropriations laws.”She was critical of how immigration enforcement has caught up U.S. citizens and immigrants with protected legal statuses.“Your crackdown has roped in American citizens and people who are here legally with no criminal record,"" the Washington Democrat said. She also criticized Noem for spending $100 million on TV ads that range from praising the president to warning migrants not to come to the United States or to self-deport.Noem in addition launched this week an initiative to provide up to $1,000 in “travel assistance” to immigrants without legal authorization to self-deport, which would amount to $1 billion if President Donald Trump’s goal of deporting 1 million people is met. The source of those funds in the DHS budget is unclear. Murray asked Noem about more than $100 billion in DHS funds not being used or re-programmed elsewhere for immigration enforcement, and called it “an illegal freeze.”She then asked Neom when DHS would unfreeze those funds.Noem did not answer and instead blamed the Biden administration, and said the previous administration “perverted” how the funds were used.Murray said she did not think it was “credible that $100 billion is used to break the law.”“I am very concerned that DHS is now dramatically over-spending funding that Congress has not provided,” Murray said. “We take our responsibility seriously to fund your department and others. We need to have answers, we need to have accountability, and we need to make sure you're not overspending money that you were not allocated.”Abrego Garcia deportationNoem got into a heated exchange with one of the Democrats on the panel, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to speak with wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The Trump administration has admitted his deportation was an “administrative error.”The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia, who was sent initially to brutal CECOT but is now housed in another prison.Van Hollen asked Noem what DHS has done to bring back Abrego Garcia, who had a 2019 court order barring his return to his home country of El Salvador for fear he would be harmed by gang violence.Noem did not answer what steps the Trump administration was taking and said that because Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador, he is in that nation’s custody and cannot be brought back.Trump has contradicted his own administration, stating that if he wanted to bring back Agrego Garcia he would, but won’t because he believes Abrego Garcia has gang ties.While Trump officials like Noem have alleged that Abrego Garcia has ties to the MS-13 gang, no evidence has been provided in court and federal Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the case, called the accusations ""hearsay.""Noem then questioned why Van Hollen was advocating for Abrego Garcia in the first place.“Your advocacy for a known terrorist is alarming to me,” she said.Van Hollen said that he was advocating for due process, which the Trump administration has been accused of skirting in its deportations. A federal judge in Louisiana next week plans to hold a hearing to determine if the Trump administration violated due process in deporting a 2-year-old U.S. citizen and her mother to Honduras.Murphy also pressed Noem on the issue and asked how she was coordinating with El Salvador for Abrego Garcia’s release.“There is no scenario where Abrego Garcia will be returned to the United States,” she said.Noem then said that even if Abrego Garcia were returned to the U.S., “we would immediately deport him again.”GOP worried about students, TPS holdersSome Republicans on the panel, including the committee chair, raised concerns with Noem about how the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is affecting students with visas.“There are so many others who do deserve scrutiny,” said Chairwoman Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, who said she was worried about students from Canada who attend school in her home state. “But these are dually enrolled Canadian students, and they've been crossing the border for years without trouble.” She said Canadian students are being stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and given intense screenings.“They have student visas, but they're being subjected to extensive searches and questioning,” she said to Noem. “I don't want us to discourage Canadian students from studying at the northern Maine institutions that we have for education.”Noem said she would look into it.Alaskan Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski raised the issue of paperwork not being processed for those with Temporary Protected Status in her state. TPS is granted to those who come from a country that is considered too dangerous or unstable to return to due to war, natural disasters or other instability.Murkowski said several groups of immigrants in her state with temporary protected status and humanitarian protection are at risk of losing their work protections, such as Afghans, Haitians, Venezuelans and Ukrainians.  “The majority of these folks are just truly valued members of their new community,” Murkowski said. “They're helping us meet workforce needs and really contributing to the tax base here. They've expressed great concern about their status and work authorizations that may be revoked or allowed to expire.”She said that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has not processed TPS or humanitarian protection renewals for up to five months.Noem said that those with TPS are being looked at, and admitted that some Ukrainians got an erroneous email that notified them their status was revoked.She said DHS has not made a decision on whether or not to renew TPS for Ukrainians, who were granted the status due to Russia's ongoing invasion of the country.“Some of these TPS programs have been in place for many, many years, but the evaluation on why TPS should be utilized and when it can be utilized by a country is the process that the administration is going through,” Noem said.",,,,2025-05-08 17:09:21.466134

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Progressive advocacy groups frustrated with what they saw as a tone-deaf and unproductive legislative session will host an all-day organizing event May 16 at the Heritage Center.
Called “The People’s Session,” the goal of the event is to hear what North Dakotans’ policy priorities are. Representatives from its organizers — Gender Justice, Prairie Action and the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition — met Thursday morning on the steps of the Capitol to share what they have planned for the conference.
“It’s time our Legislature listens to people across our state and leads with our values that we share — like fairness, privacy, freedom and respect,” said Prairie Rose Seminole, who is vice chair of Gender Justice’s board and also sits on the board for the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition.
North Dakota lawmakers approve needs, some wants with $20.3 billion budget

A survey of North Dakota residents commissioned by Gender Justice last fall indicates that North Dakotans support policies like expanding reproductive rights, and investing in child care and affordable housing, Gender Justice Executive Director Megan Peterson said Thursday. The survey, which was conducted by firm PerryUndem, gathered responses from 800 adults across the state.
The policy priorities reflected in the survey aren’t what lawmakers spent most of their time on this session, Peterson said.
She pointed to legislation that prevents K-12 schools from having multi-stall all-gender restrooms, as well as a bill that would have required school and public libraries to put “sexually explicit” material in areas children cannot easily access, which Gov. Kelly Armstrong ultimately vetoed. 
“Why did lawmakers spend their time on book bans and bathroom bills while families are struggling to find affordable child care, pay the rent and access basic health care?” Peterson asked.
While lawmakers defeated many of the most controversial proposals introduced this session — including a bill to require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in lunchrooms, and a resolution to declare the kingship of Jesus Christ — advocates at the Thursday morning gathering said these bills took valuable time and resources away from more pressing policy issues. 
The group acknowledged that the Legislature passed bills this session aimed at improving access to child care, housing and health care, but argued the policies do not go far enough.
“When politicians can’t or don’t want to solve real problems, they create fake ones to divide and distract us,” Peterson said. 
She said “The People’s Session” will put together policy proposals for the next legislative session that better reflect what North Dakota residents actually want. 
The event is free, but registration is required. It will take place at the Heritage Center from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Topics of discussion will include health care, housing, schools, LGBTQ issues, reproductive rights and more.
“We hope to take the people’s agenda forward, crafting and refining it into bills through public input, and then put it forward for sponsors to bring to the 2027 legislative session,” North Dakota Human Rights Coalition Executive Director Dalton Erickson said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s sheriffs asked for legislative clarification of a “clunky” 2024 school-safety law. Lawmakers responded, sending classroom door-locking revisions through both chambers.
Last summer, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judge espressed concern that law enforcement officers might unintentionally violate state laws designed to lock out threatening people. 
“You know, we passed this legislation last year, and it’s unfortunate that the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Commission had to request that it be passed in the first place,” Judd told the Phoenix in a phone interview.
“But, despite our best efforts, there were some schools and some administrators who weren’t keeping the doors locked,” he continued. His county didn’t have that problems but that other counties did, he said.
Judd said the law, before amended, was “clunky and difficult to understand and easy to violate it even without the intent to violate it.”
Legislative clarification may be needed on school safety law, commission says

Lawmakers passed SB 1470 during the last week of the scheduled legislative session. The bill builds on the school guardian program, developed after the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas shootings that killed 17 people, and looks to clarify door locking requirements in hopes of preventing the next school shooting. 
The bill builds on HB 1473, a 2024 law mandating classrooms be locked, as well as campus access doors, gates, and other access points, when students are present.
Among the concerns sheriffs raised were the extent to which doors were required to be locked and whether to lock career and technical education classrooms during lessons that require ventilation, like welding.
“I think it’s much better now than it was before,” Judd said this week. In July, voicing concerns from his employees, he had said, “We’re having a really hard time” and “we need something from the state to come down to these folks.”
Specifically, the new bill would allow classrooms to use temporary locks, require school safety protocol to apply for 30 minutes before and after school, and allow door locking exemptions for career and technical education classrooms where ventilation is required. 
  Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd via Polk County Sheriff’s Office
“No two doors or classrooms are equal, depending on the type of instruction that’s going on there,” Judd said. 
The bill requires the perimeter of campuses to be locked or guarded, protecting students behind a locked gate or door. 
“The law was a little clunky last year and it needed to be cleaned up so we more clearly could make it reasonable to lock all the doors, and that’s what this legislation did this year,” Judd said. “You would think it would not be necessary to have to put in law to lock a school door to protect a child, however, that’s exactly what we had to do.”
Sen. Danny Burgess, the measure’s Senate sponsor, said the bill helps clarify that schools would not need to provide security for non-school meetings happening at night, such as a Boy Scouts meeting. The 2024 law requires security “when students are on campus,” whereas the new language sets the timeframe for security measures to 30 minutes before and after school.
“SB 1470 builds on last year’s school safety policy that we passed by strengthening school safety training and campus security measures while supporting practical implementation for schools and law enforcement. Essentially, the goal is to balance enhanced safety against the need for efficient operations in schools,” Burgess said when presenting the bill in committee in March.

Consulting stakeholders
The House bill was sponsored by Reps. Brad Yeager and Christine Hunschofsky, who was mayor of Parkland at the time of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shootings.
Hunschofsky said in March that she and Yeager made sure to consult with school leaders in crafting the legislation “so that whatever we’re doing up here also makes sense in a school environment, because it’s about safety but it’s also about making sure the kids and the teachers have the environment that they need to thrive.”
  Christine Hunschofsky via Florida House
The bill passed unanimously in all of its stops.
Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, chair of the safety commission, worked with legislators to address the needed changes, Judd and Burgess said.
Subject to the still incomplete Appropriations Act, the bill would implement a centralized panic alert system connecting the state’s schools. 
It would allow childcare facilities, at their own cost, to partake in the school guardian program to train staff or guards in school safety. 
“It’s like building a new park — you pour sidewalks and then sometimes you see people want to walk in areas where there’s not a sidewalk so you go back and you pour more sidewalks where people really want to walk,” Judd said. 
“We’ve got this law in place to make sure children are kept safe and if we need to tweak it or modify it in the future, just as the Legislature was more than willing to do it this time, then we’ll do that at the appropriate time.”
The bill has not yet been sent to the governor.

Steve Livingston, R-Scottsboro, listens to discussions during a special session on redistricting on Wednesday, July 19, 2023 in Montgomery, Ala. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)A federal court Thursday ruled that the Alabama Legislature intentionally discriminated against Black voters in approving a congressional district map in 2023 that would only have had one majority-Black district. 
In a nearly 600-page order, the three-judge panel — U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, and U.S. District Judges Anna M. Manasco and Terry F. Moorer, both appointees of President Donald Trump — accused the Legislature of ignoring its orders in 2023 to replace a map approved in 2021 with a new one that had two districts where Black voters had a substantial opportunity to elect their preferred leaders. 
“The Legislature knew what federal law required and purposefully refused to provide it, in a strategic attempt to checkmate the injunction that ordered it,” the opinion said. “It would be remarkable — indeed, unprecedented — for us to hold that a state legislature that purposefully ignored a federal court order acted in good faith.”

The three-judge panel also said it would consider a request from plaintiffs to place Alabama back into preclearance for future congressional redistricting efforts — which Alabama has not had to go through for over a decade following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. 
The judges wrote that they had “no doubt” that the the 2023 map was designed to “crack Black voters across congressional districts in a manner that that makes it impossible to create two districts in which they have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice, and thereby intentionally perpetuate the discriminatory effects of the 2021 plan.”
“So we observe that although the success of the Milligan Plaintiffs’ claim of intentional discrimination is unusual, we also do not regard it as a particularly close call,” they wrote.
Deuel Ross of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, representing plaintiffs who originally challenged an Alabama congressional map approved in 2021, said in a phone interview Thursday that the court’s decision confirms the “unfortunate reality of Alabama’s illegal and unconstitutional actions in this case.”
“It’s an incredible victory for Black voters, and all voters, really in the Black Belt, who have been denied representation by the state for decades,” Ross said.
Messages seeking comment were left Thursday with the Alabama Attorney General’s office; Rep. Chris Pringle, R-Mobile and Sen. Steve Livingston, R-Scottsboro, who led legislative redistricting efforts in 2021 and 2023, and attorneys for Pringle and Livingston.
The decision will not immediately affect the shape of Alabama’s congressional districts, but could require the Legislature to tread carefully with future redistricting. 
The court in early 2022 cited racially polarized voting in Alabama — where white Alabamians tend to vote for Republicans and Black Alabamians tend to vote for Democrats — in ruling that Alabama’s 2021 congressional map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by making it practically impossible for Black Alabamians to elect their preferred leaders. The panel ordered the Legislature to draw two congressional districts where Black voters would have an opportunity to choose those leaders.
The state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court ruling. In the summer of 2023, the Legislature approved a map that the panel later rejected, finding it fell far short of their directives. The panel appointed a special master who drew a map where two of Alabama’s seven U.S. House districts — the 2nd and the 7th – have majority-Black or near-majority Black populations. 
The court’s finding of intentional racial discrimination, drawn from actions and statements from lawmakers during the redistricting process and their initial refusal to draw a second majority-Black district, is significant.
“The Legislature’s conduct and that concession thrust this case into an unusual posture: we are not aware of any other case in which a state legislature — faced with a federal court order declaring that its electoral plan unlawfully dilutes minority votes and requiring a remedial plan that provides an additional opportunity district — responded with a plan that the state concedes does not provide that district,” the judges wrote.
Ross referred to it as “the uniqueness of Alabama’s defiance of the law.”
“If there’s a court order that’s been affirmed, particularly by the Supreme Court, then the result is that the defendants need to comply with it, or any party, especially a state,” Ross said.
Laurel Hattix, an attorney with the ACLU of Alabama, said in a statement that the ruling is “an overdue acknowledgment of Alabama lawmakers’ persistent attempts to shut out Black voters from the electoral process.”
“For decades, Black Alabamians have organized and fought for not just their voting rights, but the voting rights of all Americans. Today, the courts have affirmed what Black voters have long known: fair representation is not optional — it’s a right,” Hattix said.
Ross also said the special master’s plan used in the 2024 elections will remain in effect at least through the 2030 redistricting cycle, barring intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Alabama obviously has the right to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has an opportunity to weigh in if it wants to, but we’ll see what happens there,” Ross said.
U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, won the election in the 2nd Congressional District last November. Coupled with U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham, winning an eighth term in Congress, the election marked the first time in history that Alabama elected two Black U.S. Representatives at the same time. Alabama’s population is about 27% Black; in the 19th century, it was between 45 and 49% Black.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Lawmakers rejected a last-minute amendment Thursday to keep Lincoln city elections in off years, rather than allowing city officials to tie them to statewide elections.
The amendment, from State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, came after concerns from some Lincoln city officials that the amended Legislative Bill 521 could cause problems for the capital city. The original bill from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha would have allowed just Omaha to move its elections, but when the proposal was amended and attached to LB 521, it added Lincoln.
The amendment to remove Lincoln from the bill failed 16-30. A reconsideration motion failed 18-26. The broader bill advanced by voice vote to the third and final round of debate.

Century-old state laws dictate the election timing for cities the size of Omaha (metropolitan class, 400,000 or more residents) and Lincoln (primary class, 100,001 to 399,999 residents).
Omaha and Lincoln city officials can already advance changes to their city charter to move election timing, but without a law such as LB 521, the changes could not be carried out.
Dungan, who said he just started talking with Lincoln officials shortly before the debate on Thursday, said Lincoln’s city charter is “significantly different” than other cities, such as Omaha. He argued LB 521 didn’t necessarily contemplate what to do with elections for Lincoln Airport Authority or Lincoln Public Schools board members.
“I would encourage my colleagues who are not from Lincoln to maybe just defer at this point,” Dungan said.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln asked Cavanaugh if he “would agree that what’s good for the Omaha elections to be on some sort of consistent patterns … that same logic would apply uniformly then in other areas.”
Cavanaugh responded that he would like to see the elections moved but that he would support Dungan’s motion. Cavanaugh has said the back-to-back elections can lead to voter fatigue.
Changing the elections could save about $500,000 for Lincoln and more than $1 million in Omaha.

State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a former member of the Lincoln City Council and Lancaster County Board of Commissioners, said she would have preferred a separate hearing and proposal related to Lincoln, with more local input.
In odd-numbered years, Omaha primary elections are the first Tuesday of April, while general elections are the first Tuesday after the second Monday in May. Omaha city elections are every four years, the year after presidential elections. For Lincoln, the general election is the first Tuesday in May, and the primary election is four weeks prior, every other year.
Omaha’s general mayoral election is this Tuesday. Lincoln held its general election this week; its mayor is not on the ballot until 2027.
Of the nine senators who represent parts of Lincoln, the vote fell along party lines. Democratic State Sens. Eliot Bostar, Danielle Conrad, Dungan, Jason Prokop and Raybould, all of Lincoln, supported the carve out. Republican State Sens. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, Bosn, Rob Clements of Elmwood and Myron Dorn of Adams opposed it.

Judge releases detained Palestinian Vermonter Mohsen Mahdawi

Because immigration offenses are considered civil offenses, the federal government is not obligated to provide lawyers for people facing deportation. In Vermont, data shows up to two dozen people may be held in state prisons for immigration offenses at any given time, though that number fluctuates. Starting recently, some of those people are sent from Vermont to facilities in Louisiana and Texas, attorneys have said.A limited number of lawyers specialize in immigration practice in Vermont, and people detained for immigration offenses in the state may never contact a lawyer, according to Diaz. The asylum assistance project — and the immigration fund — will help recruit and train legal volunteers to assist with more cases. Mohsen Mahdawi, A Columbia University student whose detention in Vermont by federal authorities for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinian human rights has drawn national attention, spoke at the launch event and praised the fundraising for its support of democracy. He recalled being held in a Vermont prison cell with a migrant farmworker.“Before he goes to bed, he would kneel on his knees, and he would hold his hands, and he would do a prayer from the Catholic tradition,” Mahdawi said. “I think his prayers have been answered today by this initiative.” Money raised through the defense fund will support the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project — which has represented over 300 people since it was founded in 2021 — and other partner organizations. The United Way of Northwest Vermont is expected to “provide administrative support for the fund and to ensure donations to the fund are tax deductible,” according to a press release announcing the initiative.State Treasurer Mike Pieciak and Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, helped launch the fund, though not in their professional capacities. Read the story on VTDigger here:  With support from Mohsen Mahdawi, state leaders launch immigration legal defense fund.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mohsen-Mahdawi-Statehouse-Vermont-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-05-08 17:09:21.466134
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-08 20:19:18+00:00,CT Mirror,Emails link Deidre Gifford to scandal; OHS commissioner to retire,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/08/deidre-gifford-emails-ziogas-scandal/,"Deidre Gifford knew that the Medicaid audit of Helen Zervas' eye care practice was being cancelled, emails show, but didn't intervene.","One of the highest-ranking officials in Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration was involved in the decision to cancel a 2020 audit that threatened to expose how a Connecticut eye doctor with powerful political connections had billed the state’s Medicaid program for procedures she never performed, documents show. 
Emails and text messages obtained by The Connecticut Mirror show that Deidre Gifford, the former commissioner of the Department of Social Services and current leader of the Office of Health Strategy, was involved in discussions about the state’s audit of Helen Zervas, the owner of Family Eye Care in Bristol, in the days before officials decided to abandon that probe. 
Employees at Gifford’s agency were weighing whether to drop the audit in return for Zervas voluntarily repaying $599,000 to the state’s Medicaid program, according to records subpoenaed as part of a federal criminal investigation into former state deputy budget director Konstantinos Diamantis and former state Democratic lawmaker Christopher Ziogas.
Gifford is not facing criminal charges.
The documents show Gifford signed off on that settlement, even though a DSS employee informed her that circumstances surrounding the audit were “unusual.” 
Gifford is expected to retire by July.
Gifford did not respond to questions for this story. Her attorney, Thomas J. Murphy, declined to comment. 
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office issued a statement to The Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday evening, defending Gifford and reiterating his support for her. 
“Throughout Dr. Gifford’s career in public service, including her leadership at the Department of Social Services and the Department of Public Health during one of the most challenging health crises in our state’s history, she demonstrated an unwavering commitment to ethical conduct and transparency,” Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesperson, said. 
“The governor understands that she was asked to provide information to federal authorities in connection with an ongoing investigation and that she cooperated fully and responded truthfully, as any public servant should,” Blanchard added. “However, being asked to provide information in a federal inquiry does not imply wrongdoing. The legal process should continue to unfold without jumping to conclusions or making assumptions.”
Several hours after issuing that statement, Lamont confirmed that Gifford would be stepping down from her post and retiring from public service. 
The news of Gifford’s impending retirement was shared as CT Mirror was preparing to publish this story. CT Mirror provided the governor’s office with the records it obtained and sought comment late last week.
Gifford’s direct involvement in the abandoned audit is likely to make her a primary witness in a pending criminal trial involving alleged extortion, bribery and influence peddling at the highest levels of the Connecticut state government.
Zervas, who is a licensed optometrist, pleaded guilty in March to fraudulently overbilling the state’s Medicaid program over the course of more than five years. And federal prosecutors accused Diamantis and Ziogas of conspiring with Zervas to undermine the 2020 audit of her practice. 
The charges filed in federal court allege that Ziogas and Zervas, who are engaged, paid Diamantis $95,000 in the spring of 2020 in exchange for him advising and pressuring several “senior” state officials to drop the audit, which threatened to lay bare Zervas’ years of fraudulent medical billing. 
The indictments that were unsealed in March did not identify the state officials that Diamantis allegedly pressured by name, although it pointed to key players by their titles and relationships. 
But the records reviewed by the CT Mirror show prosecutors were keenly interested in the interactions that took place between Gifford, Melissa McCaw, Lamont’s former budget director, and John McCormick, who was the director of the state’s Medicaid audit division at that time. 
Those records included a number of Gifford’s emails and two months of text messages from her state-issued cell phone, which included several conversations between her and McCaw. 
‘Unusual’ circumstances
Most of those text messages were focused on the state’s early response to the COVID-19 pandemic. But one text exchange from late April 2020 included a vague reference to what was described as a “constituent matter.” 
“Can you give me a call re: a constituent matter when you have time?” McCaw asked Gifford on April 28, 2020. 
McCaw’s use of the word “constituent” mirrors the term that state officials used on May 12, 2020, to describe Zervas when Diamantis scheduled the delivery of her $599,000 check to the state’s Medicaid office in Hartford on that day. 
Gifford responded to McCaw’s text message the following day, and she informed McCaw that she would be available to discuss the matter that evening — exactly a week before the audit was called off, the records show. 
McCaw, who is now the finance director in the town of East Hartford, did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls, as well as messages that were left at her office by CT Mirror reporters in recent weeks.
Shortly after Gifford spoke to McCaw, records show, she also discussed Zervas and her medical practice with McCormick, who had overseen the state’s Medicaid audit division for more than a decade. 
The two initially spoke on the phone, according to the records. McCormick followed that call up with an email to Gifford on April 30 explaining that the circumstances surrounding Zervas’ audit were “unusual.” 
Gifford replied by telling McCormick that he should manage the audit like he would for any other Medicaid provider in the state. 
“I do not want to intervene in this process and want you to proceed as you normally would under these circumstances,” Gifford wrote. 
But there was nothing normal about the political nature of Zervas’ case, as McCormick later explained to other DSS officials. 
In an email on May 5, 2020, McCormick told a deputy commissioner at DSS how Gifford, one of Lamont’s top appointees, had called him directly to discuss Zervas’ case. And he said he’d learned that Zervas had a powerful ally in the governor’s budget office, where both McCaw and Diamantis worked. 
“The commissioner called me about this provider last week,” McCormick told DSS’s deputy commissioner, Michael Gilbert. “The provider has a friend at OPM.” 
McCormick went on to explain in that email that Zervas overcharged the Medicaid program, and he said he initially considered taking additional steps to hold Zervas accountable for the “substantial overbillings.” 
But after further review, McCormick said, he dropped that plan and agreed to bring the audit to a close. 
“I was considering additional action, but I think the self-disclosure showed good faith,” McCormick told Gilbert. 
But as early as mid-February, McCormick wrote that he had his doubts about Zervas’ billing irregularities. 
“Hold off on additional work,” he wrote to a member of the auditing team at DSS. “Looking like a fraud case.”
McCormick’s attorney, Steve Manning, did not respond to phone calls for this story. Gilbert, who is now retired from state service, declined to comment when provided with the emails at his home earlier this month. 
Norm Pattis, Diamantis’ defense attorney, said the emails from McCormick clearly show that Gifford was closely involved in the decision to cancel the Medicaid audit, and he said that will make her an indispensable witness when Diamantis and Ziogas go to trial early next year. 
“It seems obvious to me that Ms. Gifford knew of, and approved of, the settlement of the Medicaid claims,” Pattis said. “She will obviously be an important witness at trial.”
Before the audit was officially closed, records show, McCormick also sent an email to Gifford, briefing her on the final terms of the deal with Zervas. 
“I have proposed to accept a lump sum payment of $599,810,” McCormick told Gifford. “We will cancel the open audit and the provider will have a billing consultant review weekly billings for one year.” 
Gifford, who worked at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and served as Rhode Island’s Medicaid director before joining Lamont’s administration, told McCormick that she was comfortable with that plan, as long as there wasn’t anything nefarious about Zervas’ actions. 
“John: as long as this is how you would normally handle such a matter, it sounds fine to me,” Gifford replied. “I assume you determined there was no fraudulent intent here?”
Records reviewed by the CT Mirror last year show the deal that Zervas received was not typical of the way McCormick handled audits for other Medicaid providers, even when they voluntarily repaid money to the state.
Even so, McCormick confirmed for Gifford that he would finalize the deal and drop the audit.  
“The provider is blaming the billing person,” McCormick wrote to Gifford. “I think it wise to take the money with the added compliance. I don’t want to discourage future disclosures.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024_0328_SR_ProspectPressConference_001-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-08 17:09:21.466134

SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker issued an executive order Wednesday that bars state agencies from collecting and disclosing data about autism to the federal government unless it's medically or legally necessary.

The order was in response to a move by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier Wednesday to research and create a national autism database.

In a statement, Pritzker called the project a “threat” to the rights of disabled individuals. The order stated that the project raises privacy concerns about the collection and use of data, as well as potential “discriminatory profiling or surveillance of individuals with disabilities.”

“Every Illinoisan deserves dignity, privacy, and the freedom to live without fear of surveillance or discrimination,” Pritzker said. “As Donald Trump and DOGE threaten these freedoms, we are taking steps to ensure that our state remains a leader in protecting the rights of individuals with autism and all people with disabilities.”

Executive Order 2025-02 also requires state agencies to follow strict privacy and data protection requirements when they do disclose such data, including making personal information anonymous where it’s practicable and only disclosing the minimum amount of personal information that’s legally necessary.

The move was prompted by an HHS announcement of a research project on Wednesday. The project will allow the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to have access to data and medical records of Medicare and Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with autism in an effort to research autism, Newsweek reported.

It also directly responded to remarks made last month by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who called autism an “epidemic” and said that President Trump has tasked him with finding a cause for the “epidemic.”

“Autism is a neurological difference—not a disease or an epidemic,” Pritzker’s order read. “People with disabilities, including individuals with autism, are too often stigmatized and underestimated, and public policy should never diminish the diverse strengths and potential of this community.”

This is not the first time Kennedy has touched on his beliefs about autism. During an interview in 2023, he confirmed that he believes that vaccines cause autism, a theory the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a wide body of research have long since debunked.

Executive orders aren’t often enacted by the Illinois governor, as last year he only signed three. This is the second order he has signed this year and is his latest action against the Trump Administration since his trade mission to Mexico this spring.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)It was supposed to be a compromise between environmental and business interests. Rhode Island’s beverage sale industry representatives agreed to help work on a solution two years ago when a legislative study commission formed to study the best way to craft a deposit-refund program for recyclable bottles and cans.
But at least two of the commission’s 20 members, both of whom work in the industry, remained firmly opposed to two of the “three bottle bills” receiving an initial vetting before the Senate Committee on Environment and Agriculture Wednesday.
Their displeasure was targeted toward a bill sponsored by Sen. Bridget Valverde, a North Kingstown Democrat, and another bill by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, calling for a 10-cent fee on individual beverage containers. Consumers could get their money back upon returning the containers to designated redemption sites run by a nonprofit contractor hired by beverage producers.
The point of a redemption program is twofold: to discourage littering and to reduce the waste accumulating in the state’s Central Landfill in Johnston. A report published last month by the commission notes roughly 1,000 tons of microplastic was detected by University of Rhode Island researchers within the sediment of Narragansett Bay — which ultimately end up being consumed by marine species that humans then eat.
Of the six New England states, only Rhode Island and New Hampshire do not have a bottle refund program.
But reaching a compromise with industry leaders was always going to be an uphill battle. Even before the final report was issued in April, five beverage industry members who sat on the commission issued a letter stating they supported none of the recommendations for a proposed bottle deposit program, citing concerns over cost, implementation, and balance issues in the region.
“The intention of this bill is definitely honorable,” Rhode Island Food Dealers Executive Director Scott Bromberg, who served on the commission, told lawmakers Wednesday. “But we beg the question: Is this the right time to propose additional fees to everyday, regular Rhode Islanders?”
He added that businesses would ultimately pass on the 10-cent fee to consumers — at a time when tariffs threaten to drive prices even higher.
“While 10 cents may not seem like a lot on one bottle, $2.40 for a case of $5 bottles of water is significant,” Bromberg said. “This can be recouped, but return is often unpredictable.”
Nicholas Fede Jr., executive director for the Rhode Island Liquor Operators Collaborative, also served on the commission, said the state should instead focus on updating existing curbside infrastructure to better sort out recyclable materials that may end up crushed in the landfill.
“People want to do the easiest thing possible, and that is curbside,” Fede told the committee. “The fact that we’re going to make people take their recyclables to a redemption center is a massive inconvenience.”
McKenney, commission co-chair, sees a bottle bill as an obligation to a cleaner future.
“We can kick the can down the road — it can be our children’s problem, it could be our grandchildren’s problem,” said McKenney, a Warwick Democrat. “But we do have to ask what kind of state we are leaving for them.”

Lack of consensus
Bottle bill supporters and opponents have tried to show the public is on their side. But the results of surveys on the subject favor whoever commissioned the poll.
A survey released Tuesday by a group calling itself Stop the Rhode Island Bottle Tax found that 60% of 600 respondents were opposed to the legislation. The group is backed by the American Beverage Association.
“Raising prices at a time when Rhode Island families are already struggling with inflation is not the way to improve recycling, especially when there are other models available,” Busra Toprak, owner of Baba’s Original New York System Wieners in Providence, in a statement released with the poll.
But 55% of respondents in a poll released March 7 by Save the Bay expressed support for a 10-cent deposit on all beverages in recyclable containers. The poll of 400 registered Rhode Island voters found that environmental concerns were a major driver in their push for a bottle bill.
Peter Trafton, co-vice president for policy at the Environment Council of Rhode Island, told the committee Wednesday he was particularly concerned about microplastics in Narragansett Bay. 
“Over the next few years we will learn how much damage it is going to cause to our kids, our grandchildren, and everyone who eats the wonderful tasty foods we get from the sea,” Trafton said.
Trafton highlighted passage of the bottle bills as one of the council’s top priorities for the 2025 legislative session.
The commission’s report also cited a 2023 coastal cleanup conducted by Save the Bay where volunteers picked up 114,914 pieces of trash, of which 25,276 pieces were disposable drink containers. 
“What we are doing is not working,” Jed Thorp, Save the Bay’s director of advocacy, told the committee Wednesday. “We have to do better.”
The root of the waste problem, lawmakers and advocates say, is beverage retailers. Which is why McKenney and Valverde’s proposals call for the creation of an entity known as a producer responsibility organization, overseen by a state advisory panel, that would work with manufacturers to meet state recycling requirements.
Industry leaders rejected the notion that they should bear responsibility for litter in Rhode Island.
“The accusation that we are the problem and not part of the solution is disingenuous and insulting,” John Holahan, general manager of Coca Cola Beverages Northeast, told lawmakers.
Holahan called the state’s litter issues a “behavioral problem,” which he said should be addressed through recycling education programs. Such an idea is outlined in a third bill by Sen. Jake Bissaillon, a Providence Democrat. The committee held an initial hearing on Bissaillon’s bill on April 30.

The recycling education component is also included in McKenney’s bill. But McKenney said education only goes so far. 
The commission had asked industry leaders for information on how effective education and anti-litter campaigns have been in upping a state’s recycling rates. But McKenney said the commission has yet to receive an answer.
“When you’re talking about programs that only nibble at the problem, they’re not solutions,” McKenney told lawmakers. “They’re not effective in terms of making a strong, actual impact.”
Supporters of the bottle bill, including McKenney, argue that adding a monetary incentive will encourage consumers to return containers for a refund. Scott Breen, vice president of sustainability for the Can Manufacturers Institute in Washington, D.C., pointed to Maine and Oregon, where consumers often receive store credit in exchange for recycling.
“People can actually get more than they pay in the deposit,” Breen said in an interview.
If a bottle deposit fee is considered a tax, a majority of Rhode Islanders would be opposed, Breen said. 
Not every industry representative who testified Wednesday was opposed. 
Liz Donohue, vice president of government affairs for Primo Brands, told lawmakers that incentivizing better recycling habits would help her clients meet its goal of making 50% of all of its bottles produced recyclable. Her company represents Poland Springs, PureLife, and Saratoga Water.
 “We need a greater supply, and we need it to be domestic,” Donohue said.
Kurt Wells, director of regulatory affairs at the Aluminum Association in Washington D.C., said bottle bills across the country have been effective at collecting recyclables of consumers who don’t have access to curbside pickup.
“This is a particular advantage in terms of litter prevention and marine debris avoidance — obvious clear benefits here in the Ocean State,” Wells said.
Both McKenney’s and Valverde’s bills were held for further study by the committee, as is standard procedure for a bill’s introductory hearing. The companion trio of proposals introduced in the House in April have not yet been scheduled for a hearing across the rotunda.
Rep. Tina Spears, a Charlestown Democrat, introduced the House’s version of the bottle bill. Rep. David Bennet, a Warwick Democrat, is behind the legislation establishing a recycling education and enforcement program. Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat who co-chaired the commission, sponsored the chamber’s combination bill.

(Photo via Google Earth)Two Iowa-licensed pharmacies affiliated with the Walgreens and CVS chains are charged with violating state regulations.
The Walgreens store located at 3910 University Ave., Waterloo, is charged by the Iowa Board of Pharmacy with failing to maintain ultimate accountability of controlled substances and records; failing to ensure accountability of controlled substances; failing to create and maintain complete and accurate records as required by law; and committing acts that would render their Controlled Substances Act registration “inconsistent with the public interest.”
The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges or indicated when it occurred.
A board hearing on the charges is scheduled for Sept. 24, 2025.
In an unrelated action, the board recently charged CVS/Caremark CarelonRx Mail operation, which is based in Pennsylvania but is a licensed pharmacy provider in Iowa, with multiple regulatory violations.
The board has charged the company with distributing a drug or device to a patient without a prescription; knowingly making misleading, deceptive, untrue, or fraudulent representations in the practice of pharmacy or engaging in unethical conduct; violating the pharmacy laws or rules of another, unspecified state; and having a license revoked or suspended by another entity for conduct that is roughly equal to the grounds for disciplinary action in Iowa.
A board hearing on the charges is scheduled for June 25, 2025.
The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that forms the basis of the charges. The charges may be tied to a recent decision by the Missouri Board of Pharmacy to place on probation for three years the license of CVS/Caremark CarelonRx Mail. That decision was based on a finding that the company’s California license had been sanctioned due to allegations the company was dispensing controlled substances for no legitimate medical purpose.
In December 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued CVS and many of its subsidiaries, including Iowa CVS, alleging the company sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for illegal prescriptions. The case is still pending, although the company has denied any wrongdoing.
The government alleges that from October 2013 through 2024, CVS knowingly filled prescriptions for controlled substances that lacked a legitimate medical purpose. Among the unlawful prescriptions that CVS allegedly filled were prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, early fills of opioids, and “trinity” prescriptions, an especially dangerous and abused combination of drugs made up of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant.
According to the government, CVS ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources, including its own pharmacists, indicating its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions. The complaint alleges the violations resulted from corporate-mandated performance metrics and incentivized compensation for employees that prioritized corporate profits over patient safety.
“CVS’ actions helped to fuel the opioid crisis,” the Department of Justice has alleged, adding that in “some particularly tragic instances, patients died after overdosing on opioids shortly after filling unlawful prescriptions at CVS.”

Members of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas last month ordering Democrat Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to turn over educational and training documents used in preparing clerks and poll workers to oversee elections, which Benson’s office said Wednesday would be a violation of the law.
The subpoena is the latest maneuver in a months-long effort by House Republicans to obtain copies of training materials, beginning with Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin) requesting them late last year, before she became chair of the House Election Integrity Committee.

“We’re not talking about state secrets here; these are just basic election training materials regularly provided to Michigan clerks,” Smit said last month in a statement. And given Benson has lost legal challenges to rules her office has set after court intervention, Smit said, it’s important to ensure those overseeing election processes around the state are getting accurate, up-to-date instruction.
It’s not as simple as transparency, and the subpoena needs to be narrowed in order for the secretary of state to be able to comply, the Michigan Department of Attorney General said in a letter on behalf of Benson and her office Wednesday.
The letter, written by Deputy General Counsel Catherine Edwards, notes that Smit was the original party requesting the training materials and now the House Oversight Committee, for which Smit is not a member, has issued a subpoena. Edwards argues one committee authorizing a subpoena on behalf of another committee violates state law and the rules of the House.
“Additionally, having one committee subpoena sensitive information for another committee blurs the lines of who potentially has access to that information, making it clear that the House fails to appreciate the sensitive nature of certain of the information requested,” Edwards’ letter reads.
Michigan law dictates that all standing or select committees in the state House and Senate have subpoena power, but in an effort to utilize subpoenas in the interest of accountability in governance, the House Oversight Committee was granted “the full scope of power” when it comes to subpoenas in the House at the start of the new session this year.
The cost estimate for the time and labor it would take to move materials to a platform for the committee to view with redactions, would be around $9,000, Edwards said in the letter.
Costs for compliance could shrink if the subpoena is narrowed, Edwards said.
There appears to be no legislative purpose to the subpoena, Edwards added, which she argues would put the subpoena outside the parameters of what is permitted under state law.
A news release from Benson’s office Wednesday says that what the subpoena is asking for would chip away at the security and integrity of elections. Part of training for election workers includes information on security features and other sensitive areas that would be at risk of “intentional or accidental disclosure to those who would misuse it”.

Edwards’ letter clarifies that the secretary of state’s office is not saying that those seeking the subpoena are desiring the information for “nefarious intent.” But it asserts that House Oversight Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), a former clerk, “has failed to appreciate the sensitive nature of information pertaining to the functioning of Michigan’s qualified voter file and election equipment.”
“Since the November 2020 general election, unprecedented efforts to gain unlawful access to voting equipment have occurred,” Edwards wrote, noting that there have been several other attempts to obtain sensitive election information through freedom of information act requests that the department has fought against.
When the subpoena was delivered to Benson’s office in April, DeBoyer said in a statement that in order for the Legislature to do its role in providing oversight and legislating on election law, lawmakers have to understand how the secretary of state’s office operates. DeBoyer added that pushback from Benson on providing the subpoenaed materials is “incredibly disappointing” and could be an attempt to hide practices the public would be opposed to.
If the matter needs court intervention, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said during a news conference Wednesday Republicans would be ready to defeat Benson in court.
“We’re asking for training manuals, because we want to see whether these local clerks are being trained according to the law. We know that Jocelyn Benson has a history of not training them according to the law,” Hall said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Facetune_06-11-2024-02-23-05-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-08 17:09:21.466134

Ned Lamont during the COVID-19 pandemic, informed him a month ago of her intention to retire, he said.","Dr. Deidre Gifford, a key adviser to Gov. Ned Lamont during the COVID-19 pandemic as a physician who simultaneously ran the departments of social services and public health, intends to retire by July from her current post overseeing the Office of Health Strategy.
Lamont said Thursday the 66-year-old Gifford informed him a month ago of her intention to retire after six years in his administration, beginning in June 2019 as the commissioner of social services. In 2020, the firing of a public health commissioner thrust her into a dual role, running that agency as well as the DSS.
Gifford could not be reached for comment.
Her departure comes months after bribery charges were brought against a former state official and former lawmaker for their alleged roles in influencing the Department of Social Services to cancel an audit of suspected Medicaid fraud at a Bristol optometry practice in 2020.
Konstantinos Diamantis, the former deputy budget director, was charged in February with accepting $95,000 in bribes to pressure state officials to cancel an audit for Helen Zervas, the owner of Family Eye Care and the fiancée of former state Rep. Christopher Ziogas, D-Bristol, who also was charged.
The DSS audit director sent an email to Gifford on May 5, 2020, explaining Zervas would voluntarily repay nearly $600,000 to the state Medicaid program and in return McCormick’s team would discard the audit.
On May 12, 2020, the same day Diamantis and Ziogas delivered the money to DSS, Gifford took over DPH, a job she held on an interim basis until September 2021. Gifford left the DSS job in January 2023 to take over the Office of Health Strategy, which was spun off from DPH in 2018 to manage Connecticut’s certificate of need process on health system closures, expansions and consolidations, and monitor the rising cost of health care across the state.
Zervas pleaded guilty in February to fraud and conspiracy charges. Diamantis and Ziogas were indicted the same month in a complaint that did not name any other public official.  
Lamont, who praised Gifford’s service in all three posts, said her retirement was neither sought nor related to the audit. He said she expressed a desire to spend more time at a home she and her husband purchased in Rhode Island, where she formerly was the state Medicaid director.
Her husband, Dr. David Gifford, is the chief medical officer of the American Health Care Association and is on the faculty of Brown University Medical School and School of Public Health.

A yard sign in Mellen, Wisconsin reads: ""This Time Wisconsin Deserves Fair Maps,"" paid for by the Fair Elections Project, FairMapsWI.com. The political sign supports redistricting legislation to reform gerrymandering.A lawsuit filed Thursday seeks to have the Wisconsin Supreme Court declare the state’s current congressional maps unconstitutional because they pack a “substantial share” of the state’s Democratic voters into only two of eight districts. 
The lawsuit, filed against the Wisconsin Elections Commission by the Democratic law firm Elias Law Group on behalf of nine Wisconsin voters, seeks to have the case bypass the lower courts and be taken up directly by the state Supreme Court. The filing comes one month after the state elected Susan Crawford to the Court, maintaining a 4-3 liberal majority on the body until at least 2028. 
“Wisconsin’s congressional map is antithetical to virtually every principle necessary to sustain a representative democracy,” the lawsuit states. “It impermissibly disadvantages voters based on their political views and partisan affiliation, systematically disfavoring Democrats because they are Democrats. By packing the substantial share of Wisconsin’s Democrats into just two congressional districts, while cracking other Democratic communities into uncompetitive Republican districts, the map condemns the party that regularly splits or wins the statewide vote to permanent minority status in the state’s congressional delegation.” 
The lawsuit argues that the nine voters are deprived of their rights because they are Democratic voters who have been drawn into districts that prevent them from electing their chosen candidates. 
In 2021, Gov. Tony Evers and Republicans in control of the Legislature reached a stalemate in negotiations over new congressional and legislative maps, which required the Court to step in. The Court, then controlled by a 4-3 conservative majority, ruled that it would only consider proposed new maps under a “least change” standard — meaning maps had to adhere as closely as possible to the maps that Republicans instituted in 2011. Those 2011 maps were considered among the most extreme partisan gerrymanders in the country. 
In 2022, the Court ultimately chose congressional maps proposed by Evers, but the lawsuit argues that the Court rejected the “least change” approach when it declared the legislative maps unconstitutional in 2023 and should therefore do the same for the congressional maps. 
Last year the Court rejected a similar effort. 
“This Court has since determined that the novel ‘least change’ approach that directly led to this result lacked any basis in this Court’s precedents, the Wisconsin Constitution, or past Wisconsin redistricting practice,” the lawsuit states. “Yet the congressional map adopted under the “least change” approach is now in effect and will remain in effect for the remainder of the decade absent this Court’s action.”

While no bill has been proposed, a report from the Office of the Child Advocate on Monday offered several recommendations for laws officials said would make Connecticut safer for children and ensure they’re getting a proper education. Several families on Thursday said they planned to come to Hartford every day until the end of session in case legislators add homeschooling regulations to an omnibus bill.
The response is just one in a wider landscape of political reactions to the questions raised about homeschooling after a man escaped his Waterbury home, where he was allegedly held captive for decades after his parents took him out of school in the fifth grade. 
The Office of the Child Advocate issued a report suggesting some abusers have used homeschooling as a way to further isolate a child and ensure school officials don’t notice the abuse. The Waterbury case isn’t the first time child abuse has occurred after a family pulls their child out of public school, the report said.
It also said Connecticut stands out as one of few states that doesn’t require homeschooling parents to compile reports about their plans for their children or their educational progress.
The Children and Education committees had an informational hearing on homeschooling on Monday, and Republicans held a press conference decrying the hearing as a distraction from failures by the state Department of Children and Families and the local district to keep the Waterbury man safe. Thousands of people gathered at the Capitol in support of homeschooling.
On Wednesday, Senate Republicans again raised the issue during debate on an unrelated bill about child welfare.
“I think it’s tenuous at best to draw any connection between homeschoolers and that incident,” said Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, on Wednesday. “It is much more likely that it had something connected to inadequate supervision by the Department of Children and Families.”
DCF Commissioner Jodi Hill-Lily said Monday that there are limits to what her department can do, and that closing some loopholes in state law could help keep kids safer. Meanwhile, Democrats have said they don’t intend to attack homeschooling and aren’t sure whether they’ll put forward a bill this session. They want to ensure children are safe and that people aren’t misusing the state’s homeschooling system, they say.
“Our colleagues on the other side are suggesting we’re attacking people,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, at a Thursday press briefing. “When you use that language, it’s naturally going to gin up the kind of energy that it has. 
“This is part of the problem with our politics right now, where people want to leap to headlines, leap to social media posts, and suggest that Democrats are attacking homeschool families when it’s absolute nonsense, when there’s a legitimate issue here about the safety of children who are no longer enrolled in public schools and what is happening to them.”
The fear is about what could happen, parents said Thursday. They think the narrative about the Waterbury case is being unfairly spun to paint homeschooling in a bad light and they worry that lawmakers will try to sneak in measures to change the way they educate their children into a last-minute bill.
“One of the things that drew us to Connecticut was the freedom when it came to homeschooling. And so infringement upon the very open policy that they offer, we see as infringement on our right to parent the way that we want,” said Jacqueline McGovern, a mother of two young children who she plans to homeschool. “You give them an inch, they go a mile. We want to make sure that our right, uninfringed, uninhibited by government regulation, is protected.”
McGovern said some of the proposals discussed wouldn’t be bad. But she worries about where the law will end up and what that will mean when her toddler and baby are ready to start their education. She wants them to have time to play and the freedom to explore topics they’re interested in, she said.
“We can build their own curriculum, teach them different moral values that we strongly believe,” McGovern said. “And again, at the end of the day, you can teach your kids reading, writing, and arithmetic in two hours a day, and then the rest of it can be being a kid.”
During a Wednesday debate on a bill to establish a working group to study guardianship proceedings in probate court, Senate Republicans pushed to pass an amendment that also would have required the Office of the Child Advocate to study the effects of DCF employees working from home on child welfare in Connecticut.
Republicans centered the conversation on homeschooling during the debate, saying the practice was being scapegoated and that to address what happened in Waterbury would require a more holistic approach.

“On Monday, there was not a public hearing, there was an informational hearing on a topic regarding homeschooling. And I’ll be willing to bet we’re going to see a bill here in the next few weeks about that topic,” said Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, who introduced the amendment.
The amendment was voted down along party lines.
“I would recommend to everyone that we stay focused on the work on our bill,” said Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton.
Speaker of the House Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, said it’s still to be determined whether there will be a bill on homeschooling and what those regulations might look like — it could be a form or some sort of reporting requirement. 
The Waterbury case was an outlier, he added.
“My guess is the overwhelming majority of people who are homeschooled are done with love, care and great education, good outcomes,” Ritter said. “There probably are bad outcomes for which we have no way of tracking or having any knowledge of that happening. So you have to decide, should you say, ‘Look, we’re willing to tolerate the incidents that may happen to children to prioritize this notion of I can do whatever I want with my children?’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0505_SR_HomeschoolingHearing_356-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-08 17:09:21.466134

Brian Meyer, D-Des Moines, spoke with reporters outside the House chamber at the Iowa Capitol May 8, 2025 following his election as House Minority Leader. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Rep. Brian Meyer of Des Moines said House Democrats will be “more aggressive” on showing Iowans alternatives to Republican policies at the Legislature under his leadership as House minority leader.
“People are living paycheck to paycheck,” Meyer told reporters Thursday. “There’s no relief in sight, and we need to address those things moving forward as to how, as a caucus, we are going to say to Iowans, ‘we are the better option’ when we go to vote in November of ’26.”
Meyer was elected to serve as House minority leader following the 2o25 legislative session, House Democrats announced Thursday. He will take over from current House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Des Moines, who has held the leadership position since 2021. Konfrst will step down from the position at the end of the session as she pursues a campaign for Congress, running in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District currently represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn. She plans to serve out the rest of her term in office, through 2026.
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner thanked Konfrst for her service and congratulated House Democrats for electing Meyer as leader in a statement Thursday.
“I look forward to working closely with Leader Brian Meyer as our caucuses continue to work together to move Iowa forward and focus on lowering costs for all Iowans,” Weiner said.
Konfrst said in a statement she was honored to serve in the position and was looking forward to working with Meyer “through the transition when session adjourns.” Meyer, representing Iowa House District 29, was first elected to the Legislature in 2012 after winning a special election. The seat was previously held by former Rep. Kevin McCarthy, under whom Meyer served as chief of staff.
He has also served on the Des Moines City Council, was a member of the Iowa National Guard and works as an attorney at the Hope Law Firm in Des Moines.
Meyer, who was serving this session as the House minority whip, told reporters Thursday he plans for the Democratic caucus to focus on “kitchen table issues,” like rising property taxes and costs of living, at the Statehouse and on the campaign trail.
At the Capitol, that will mean proposing amendments to major bills and legislative proposals that showcase Democrats’ plan to tackle these issues. Though most Democrat-backed policy proposals are not able to gain traction under the Republican trifecta, Meyer said this approach will show Iowans “an alternative” to what Republicans are passing — and may help shift the needle in control at the Statehouse.
“Iowans have to decide — you want to just continue giving tax cuts to millionaires and giving away tax dollars to private schools? No property tax relief?”  Meyer said. “We have these alternatives, and we will be proposing them as we move forward.”
Meyer said the current stall in budget negotiations between House and Senate Republicans shows the need for new leadership in the Legislature. He compared the lengthy process for reaching a budget agreement with the quick turnaround on passing and signing into law a measure removing gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
“Get us out of here — move as quickly on this stuff as you did taking away rights,” Meyer said. “But at the end of the day, they’re running the budget into the ground. They have been for multiple years. The budget is a disaster.”
Heading into the 2026 election season, Meyer, 51, said he will work with other members of the caucus including Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, to recruit candidates to run as Democrats across the state. He said it was his goal to have Democratic candidates running in all Iowa House districts, and putting a focus on winning back areas that have flipped from blue to red in recent election cycles.
“I think some of these places are hurting, and I think they’ve been let down by their legislators,” Meyer said. “And I think we plan on having candidates in all of those kind of mid-level — mid-level for Iowa — smaller, former industrial communities that have had Democrats in them before.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bmeyer5.8.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-08 16:05:08.251327

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)An election bill requiring new Florida voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship failed to advance in the just-concluded regular legislative session, drawing sighs of relief from both voting-rights and voting-integrity groups, although for different reasons.
The measure arose shortly after President Trump issued his executive order requiring voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. “This bill fully answers the president’s call,” said Lee County Republican Persons-Mulicka when introducing her proposal (HB 1381) before the House Government Operations Subcommittee on April 1.
The bill would have mandated that all voter registration applications, including any with a change in name, address, or party affiliation, could only be accepted after the Florida Department of State verified that the applicant was a U.S. citizen in one of three ways:

The applicant’s voter record indicated that his or her legal status as a U.S. citizen had been verified.
The applicant’s legal status as a citizen was matched against records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Or the voter showing one of seven identification sources, such as a driver license, a U.S. passport. or a birth certificate.

Critics noted that the provision removed several previous categories to verify voter identification, such as a debit or credit card, student identification, or retirement cards.
“It’s not just an issue for noncitizens,” said Brad Ashwell, Florida state director for All Voting is Local Action.
“If the bill had passed, after Oct. 1 any of us who are renewing IDs due to an address change, a party change, a name change, would all have to show proof of citizenship. And it had a list of IDs to do that are pretty cumbersome and that a lot of people don’t have — like a passport or an original copy of a birth certificate.”
The bill resembled the federal Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives last month with four Democrats joining all Republicans in supporting it, Ashwell said.
One of the talking points that critics formed in that debate was how the bill would potentially disenfranchise married women who changed their last names. An estimated 69 million American women and 4 million men lack a birth certificate that matches their current name, according to the Center for American Progress, a progressive group.
What about passports? In Florida, approximately 40% of the voting population, or around 8.1 million citizens in the state, lack passports, also according to statistics provided by the Center for American Progress.
Read the details
Voting integrity activists also had major problems with the bill.
“There were multiple things in there that appeared good at first glance but, when you read the details, weren’t good at all,” said Deb Monks of the group Defend Florida, which held town hall meetings throughout the state discussing the bill. “I call it window dressing. Some were positive, but if you really looked in it, it didn’t accomplish what we needed.”
Monks said her organization had more involvement with bills filed in the House by House Republicans Berny Jacques (HB 831) and Webster Barnaby (HB 1203) plus several by Miami Sen. Ileana Garcia (SB 1330, SB 390, SB 394 and SB 396). “Those fully addressed the citizenship issues as well as cleaning up the voting rolls,” Monks said.
None of them received a hearing.
The citizenship bill also called for replacing the existing ballot machine recount and audit process with an automated, independent pre-certification vote validation process for every vote cast in every election — the first state in the country to do so, Persons-Mulicka boasted.
The likely software that supervisors of elections would need to accommodate that change would be ClearAudit, which creates an image of every paper ballot and lets election officials quickly call up ballots with questionable markings to verify votes.
However, not every county in the state uses the ClearAudit technology, which is produced the company ClearBallot. That was a problem mentioned by both voting rights and voting integrity advocates.
“My issue with that is economic — the only way that they’re going to be able to comply with that law is if they get software that allows them to audit every precinct for every vote before the certification deadline,” said Ashwell.
“So, if they can’t do that, it’s going to delay the certification deadline and that’s a huge problem. If they do get the software to do that, it wouldn’t be a problem, but that costs money, and my understanding is that only about 2/3rds of the counties have that software at this point.”
“The way that we feel, we don’t need another machine,” added Cathi Chamberlain of the voter integrity group Pinellas Watchdogs.
“We want to get rid of the machines, so we’re really strong on that. We saw what VR [Systems] did in the last election, so these systems are not really reliable. We don’t trust them at all. Clear Ballot is extremely expensive, especially for your smaller districts that can’t afford that, not just the machines, but the upkeep as well.”
A glitch in VR Systems’ machines delayed results in the August primaries last year.
A spokesperson for the Florida Department of State told the Phoenix that the agency was looking into how many counties use ClearAudit, but did not provide those numbers before this story was published.
Not all conservatives were critical of the measure.
“Section 6 [of the bill] authorizes data sharing with other states to purge deceased or ineligible voters, and Section 8 leverages federal jury data to flag ineligible voters,” said Karen Jaroch of Heritage Action. “That’s smart, practical reforms to protect every lawful vote.”
Voting integrity advocates
Meanwhile, election-related bills sponsored by Democrats and voting rights advocates predictably went nowhere, with none of them getting a hearing.
Those advocates’ favorite bill encompassing an assortment of provisions was packed into the Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore Florida Voting Rights Act (SB 1582/HB 1409) originally sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Geraldine Thompson, who died just weeks before the session began (Jacksonville’s Tracie Davis later become the Senate sponsor).
The 113-page omnibus measure proposed a variety of changes, including establishing Election Day as a holiday and authorizing same-day voter registration. It would have required counties with histories of voter suppression to get pre-clearance before making voting changes (a provision of the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 2013).
It also would have repealed recent laws on vote-by-mail and created a database for felons to determine whether they have had their voting rights restored.
Realizing the bill would never get a hearing on its own, Orange County Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis opted to insert the entire measure onto Persons-Mulicka’s bill as an amendment when it came before its sole committee hearing last month. It was voted down by the GOP-dominated committee.
Both sides say they expect a version of this bill to be resurrected next year. While Persons-Mulicka was unsuccessful in moving this measure, she was also the sponsor of one of Gov. DeSantis highest priorities this year. That would be HB 1205, a proposal designed to reduce fraud in the signature petition process with citizen-led constitutional amendments, a bill that critics say will make it much harder to get such measures on the ballot.
Florida voters have already shown that they want only U.S. citizens to vote in state elections. A 2020 constitutional amendment calling for that was approved by more than 79% of the electorate.

President’s attack on public broadcasting, which covers 95% of rural Wyoming, also weighs on state’s PBS television station in Riverton.
The post Trump order threatens public radio’s daily programming in Wyoming, and more appeared first on WyoFile .","President Donald Trump’s May 1 order to halt federal funding of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service jeopardizes news and other programming broadcast by Wyoming’s affiliate stations that serve about 95% of the state’s rural population.
The executive order ensures that “Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage,” Trump wrote about the attack against the two national news nonprofits and their parent Corporation for Public Broadcasting. NPR distributes audio content to Wyoming Public Media, based in Laramie and PBS distributes video content to Wyoming Public Broadcasting, based in Riverton.
Trump’s order threatens radio programs broadcast in Wyoming from news shows like Morning Edition to niche broadcasts like Fiona Ritchie’s The Thistle & Shamrock. NPR programs account for about 9 hours of Wyoming Public Media fare enjoyed by listeners between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., General Manager Christina Kuzmych said.
“We don’t see that much of a dislike for public broadcasting in Wyoming.” Christina Kuzmych
The attack against the media by Trump and other Beltway critics “has us rattled,” Kuzmych said in a recent interview. “We don’t see that much of a dislike for public broadcasting in Wyoming,” she said.
Trump’s order also threatens to upend programming at Wyoming Public Broadcasting in Riverton, which airs PBS News Hour and other PBS shows like Antiques Roadshow and Nature. Paula Kerger, the CEO of the nationwide PBS television service, told News Hour that defunding CPB would create “an existential crisis” for stations across the country. Only 10% of national PBS programming is news, she said.
At Wyoming Public Broadcasting in Riverton, CEO Joanna Kail said the station has not yet lost any funding. But, “we can’t send our dues to [national] PBS” because of Trump’s order.
Public broadcasting plays an outsized role in rural Wyoming, which Broadbandnow ranks 48th in the country for internet coverage, speed and availability. Wyoming’s public radio and television stations reach internet-poor communities and operate with considerable public and foundation support, as well as federal and state money.
There’s more (or less)
Trump’s order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private corporation created by Congress, and all federal agencies to “cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS.” The order applies to direct and indirect payments.
The CPB has a FY’25 budget of $545 million, all of which is federal money or interest on it. In addition to supporting the two national broadcasting stations, CPB makes grants to individual stations around the country.

Wyoming Public Media gets 13% of its $3.4 million budget from the CPB, Kuzmych said in an email. All told, 32% of all airtime on Wyoming Public Media is dedicated to NPR programming, which the local station pays for, she said.
Trump’s order also states that “CPB shall cease indirect funding to NPR and PBS,” a clause that keeps Wyoming Public Broadcasting, and presumably Wyoming Public Media, from purchasing and broadcasting an NPR or PBS programs.
Wyoming Public Broadcasting gets about 33% of its approximately $5 million budget from the CPB. Fully 66% of its programming comes from national PBS sources, the television station said Wednesday. It just received a $2.2 million grant to upgrade emergency alerts to the Next Generation Warning System.
The nonprofit KHOL radio station in Jackson gets 20% of its budget from the CPB, which only gives money to stations that can show $275,000 in local support. All three nonprofits also produce local news stories and reports on cultural events and other topics.
CPB also supports NPR’s backbone infrastructure called the Public Radio Satellite System that distributes programming to Wyoming Public Media and more than 1,200 public radio stations across the country. 
In addition to Trump’s order, public broadcasting faces financial uncertainty as Congress, members of which are hostile to the news organizations, sorts through a federal budget.
A suit against the suits
Trump’s attack against CPB began April 28 when Trent Morse, a deputy director of “presidential personnel,” emailed three of the five sitting CPB board members, on behalf of Trump, saying their positions were “terminated effective immediately.”
CPB is a private corporation and it sued Trump the next day, saying he didn’t have the authority to fire Laura Ross, Thomas Rothman and Diane Kaplan. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order halting the firings, a motion that remains on the table.
Two days after CPB filed the suit, Trump signed the order cutting funding. Government funding “is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence,” Trump wrote.
CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison rejected Trump’s attacks. “Congress expressly forbade ‘any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control’” over CPB and its affiliates, she said in a statement.
In an emergency hearing before federal District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., a CPB attorney said replacing the board members could lead to DOGE “physically and forcefully” invading private CPB offices the way it did at the U.S. Institute for Peace. Consequently, Moss said if Trump wants to replace any CPB board member, he must inform the court two days in advance so the broadcasters have a chance to challenge the move.
On Tuesday, the government filed court papers saying that because Trump appoints the CPB board members, he can also fire them. The board includes Chair Ruby Calvert of Wyoming Public Broadcasting.

At the public television station in Riverton, CEO Kail said she believes dissatisfaction with national PBS grew when the newsroom stopped listening to complaints about perceived bias. “We were trying to make PBS understand our concerns,” she said. 
“It’s just not addressed,” she said of worries that came from Wyoming and southern and midwestern states. Beltway broadcasters have forgotten the tenet that “we don’t know more than our viewers.”
On the public radio front, NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said NPR “will vigorously defend our right to provide essential news, information and life-saving services to the American public … using all means available.”
About 65% of Wyoming Public Media’s fundraising pledges are made when Morning Edition and All Things Considered are on the air, Kuzmych said. “Removing these two NPR programs impacts WPM’s fundraising ability and begs the question: Replace them with what? CBC? BBC?”
Public service is an essential part of the public broadcasting sphere, broadcasters say. At KHOL, CPB support “has enabled our coverage of women’s health, the Teton Pass landslide, immigration and so much more,” the station said in a newsletter.Funding cuts could endanger not just news but off-beat shows that have cult followings.

Vargas, Justice Michael E. Vigil, Chief Justice David K.
Thomson, Justice C. Shannon Bacon, and Justice Briana H. Zamora. (Photo courtesy of the Supreme Court.)The state Supreme Court on Thursday issued a unanimous opinion it says reconciles conflicting rulings by the Court of Appeals regarding the state’s Whistleblower Protection Act.
Specifically, the new opinion says for a public employee to receive protection under the act, disclosures about wrong or illegal actions by a public employer must benefit the public in some way.
While case law is “sparse” regarding the Whistleblower Protection Act, the opinion says, the Appeals Court decision in the case of corrections officer Manuel Lerma conflicted with one of its earlier rulings, the state Supreme Court said, and too narrowly interpreted the law.
Lerna, who had 16 years’ experience with the New Mexico Corrections Department, transferred to a new facility where he guarded the prison’s sally port and ensured, as “safety protocol” that one side of the dual-gate system remained closed when the other was open. dual-gate system was to have one gate closed when opening the other gate as a “safety protocol.”
Lerna’s “strict” enforcement of this protocol led to “disagreement” between him and other transportation division corrections officers, who wanted him to leave both gates open “at the same time…so they could come and go as they pleased.” Lerna alleges that “one day while he was driving home from the prison, his vehicle ‘kept [being] block[ed]’ when it was sandwiched between two vehicles, each driven by a DOC employee, causing him to pull his vehicle over and stop in an empty lot. Plaintiff, ‘fearing for [his] life,’ was beaten by a fellow corrections officer. A prison supervisory lieutenant filmed the altercation using his agency-issued cell phone.”
Lerna reported both the pushback on the protocol and the violent episode, and Corrections cited and disciplined two people involved for what the department acknowledged as “egregious conduct.” Lerna, however, contends he was reassigned after disclosing as retaliation.
He subsequently filed a lawsuit citing violations of whistleblower protections, which a district court dismissed in response to Corrections Department arguments that Lerma’s grievances were personal and not covered by the act. Lerma challenged the district court’s summary judgement against him and the Appeals Court ruled in his favor, saying his grievances did not have to be for the benefit of the public. This, the state Supreme Court said in its opinion today, is incorrect.
“A public employee’s disclosure of illegality or wrongdoing qualifies for protected whistleblower status, if otherwise eligible, so long as the disclosure confers a benefit on the public, irrespective of which benefit – public or personal – may be said to predominate,” the opinion written by Chief Justice David K. Thomson said.
The court returned the case to the Appeals Court to decide if Lerma qualifies for whistleblower protection under that standard of public benefit.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/supremecourt-1024x689.jpg,,,2025-05-08 16:05:08.251327

April 17. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature’s Education Committee has been trying for a month to get one of its packages of education proposals out of committee and onto the floor. But the past few executive sessions have been tense, and committee members remain divided.  
Now, the committee chair, who until last week had been optimistic about the package’s chances, says the bill that includes giving teachers more time off to deal with significant life events is running out of time to reach the legislative floor this year. The obstacle: lawmaker objections to including one senator’s priority proposal that would allow K-12 students to be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework. 
Two Democratic-aligned lawmakers and one Republican on the committee have questioned the inclusion of the religious-themed bill in the package. But the Education Committee chairman, State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenville, continues to emphasize the importance of including the bill. 
The inclusion of Central City State Sen. Loren Lippincott’s Legislative Bill 550 was part of a “deal” involving the state Legislature’s Retirement Systems Committee, one Democrat and other Republicans on the committee and the state’s largest teachers union. 
Earlier in the session, people weighed in during a public hearing about a handful of religious-themed, school-related proposals from Murman, Lippincott and State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender. 
Murman’s proposal would require displaying the Ten Commandments in every state school. Meyer’s bill would require “In God We Trust” to be displayed prominently in K-12 schools. Lippincott, in addition to the “release time” bill, proposed allowing school districts to employ unlicensed religious chaplains to counsel students. 
Murman’s Ten Commandments proposal follows a successful effort by conservatives in Louisiana  requiring it last year, the first new state law requiring the change in decades. Other states are attempting to do the same. 
Lippincott’s “release time” bill, LB 550, is part of a national lobbying effort by a Christian education organization, Lifewise Academy, with populist right ties. It also indicates that a decades-old push to infuse more religion into schools still has a pulse in the Nebraska statehouse. 
In other states, resistance from teachers, advocates and lawmakers to putting more religion in public schools has been used to build political support for taxpayer-funded vouchers or school choice for K-12 students to attend private schools. The latest victory for school vouchers came in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott signed a voucher bill into law, ending a years-long battle. Nebraska voters repealed a similar voucher law in November, though lawmakers have pledged to keep trying to pass a replacement.

Some religious experts said Lippincott’s LB 550 would help “already privileged groups,” and a few lawmakers from both sides of the aisle shared concerns about blurring the line between church and state. A few said its passage could lead to the adoption of other religious bills. One GOP lawmaker who has proposed religious bills said LB 550 would just be the start.
“If we let these things go by unchecked,” State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said.  “It can absolutely lead to larger bills down the road.” 
The Education Committee effort to include Lippincott’s bill in the package could signal a tipping point toward more openness in the Legislature for passing religious-themed bills. Senators this year have debated several bills with culture war undertones, including proposals relating to transgender youth and lab-grown meat some call elitist and unnatural. Gov. Jim Pillen has said in the past that Catholics and Christians should “have more courage” to stand up for Christian values.
Nebraska’s religious bills mirror a national push by Republican state lawmakers that has been emboldened by President Donald Trump and recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that appear to have altered the legal landscape for such proposals in schools. 
“Release time” proposals like Lippincott’s LB 550 have been legal since the 1950s. A 1952 ruling by the high court held that New York City schools could allow students to be “released” for religious education and activities outside of school with parental consent. 
Deal blown up
Murman aides had been confident for weeks that the broader education package would advance out of committee, repeatedly saying they had the votes to get out, including from State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, a Democrat.
Juarez, who deal brokers and Republicans on the committee had viewed as a key vote for the package, told the Nebraska Examiner she flipped positions to a likely “no” during a roughly month-long effort to get the package to the floor. 
Juarez said she was misled about why the Lippincott bill needed to be included. She said she was under the impression that the committee was required to include all of the bills discussed during the executive sessions.  
Republicans on the committee say they had been pretty clear about the terms of the deal.
Murman said he secured a “deal” with the Retirement Systems Committee to combine LB 550 with a bill from State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha that would help schools find more long-term substitutes so teachers could take paid time off around significant life events. 
Lincoln Sen. Beau Ballard, chairman of the Retirement Systems Committee, said his deal was with education “stakeholders.” He said he wasn’t part of the negotiations on the package’s parts. Juarez also confirmed the Nebraska State Education Association was aware of the deal and could live with Lippincott’s proposal. 
Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, had said earlier that finding common ground regarding religion is a centuries-old issue in America, but “the battleground shouldn’t be in our public schools.” 
Democrats on the committee said Murman’s strong-armed approach about needing LB 550 in the package caused the stalemate. Lippincott’s bill was chosen because it was seen as less controversial than the three other religious-themed proposals, people familiar with the package said 
On religion in schools, Nebraska Republicans seem more conflicted than some of their red-state counterparts. Some Nebraska Republicans in the Legislature — not on the committee — privately told the Examiner Lippincott’s bill could be a step too far for them. 
Lippincott has said the bill would “empower parents by giving them a stronger voice in their children’s education.” Fellow Education Committee member Meyer called LB 550 a “good first step.”
Some Nebraska Republicans join national quest to infuse more religion into schools

‘America is always losing its way’
Currently, 12 states require school boards to adopt release-time policies for off-site religious instruction, while 18 other states have laws or regulations allowing boards to adopt release-time policies. Nebraska, Washington, D.C. and 19 other states have no laws requiring or prohibiting release time for such instruction. In those states, parents or religious organizations can petition their local school boards to establish a program, but the boards could reject it.
One national tie to Lippincott’s bill is LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based religious instruction program. 
During a National Association of Christian Lawmakers meeting last December, the group proposed a model bill on “release time” from school. After Lifewise Academy proposed the model bill, NACL approved embracing it. Lippincott’s bill is similar.
Lippincott confirmed that his bill is modeled after other states’ “release time” legislation. Jesse Vohwinkel, LifeWise Academy’s Vice President of Growth, testified in favor of Lippincott’s bill during its public hearing in February. 
LifeWise serves over 630 schools in 31 states, it told the NACL at its meeting. LifeWise has seen its revenues increase from $2 million in 2021 to $35.3 million in 2024, according to the group’s IRS reports. 
“We see a viable path of reinstalling Bible education for the public school system across the nation,” Joel Penton, the founder of LifeWise, said during a Family Research Council’s, a Right-Wing Think Tank, podcast last year.  
LifeWise has received legal support from rightwing groups like America First Legal and has allied with some groups on the populist right, including Moms for Liberty.  One Democratic-aligned lawmaker said during a recent legislative discussion that LB 550 catered to Lifewise. 
Nebraska Family Alliance, a lobbying group that has a history of being against abortion and advocating Biblical values, supports LB 550. On his podcast, Nate Grasz, the group’s executive director, said Nebraska parents must have the same “rights and opportunities” as those in other states. 
“That must include giving their children a religious education,” Grasz said.

Meyer said the Lippincott proposal could provide school boards “cover” for those who wanted to implement a policy but didn’t because of potential pushback, since every school would be required to do so. 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln Religious Studies Professor Max Mueller said the Family Alliance and other supporters of similar bills appear to want to blur the lines between church and state.
Grasz interviewed Vohwinkel, who said the group “enables communities to provide Bible education to their public school students during the middle of the school day.” 
Lippincott proposed a similar bill during the last legislative session, but it was bottled up in committee. 
“We aim to support families who seek religious education with their children while strengthening character education in our public schools, fostering a well-rounded and inclusive learning environment for every student,” Lippincott said.
He said the difference with his bill this year is that it would cost school districts nothing and that all religious studies would be conducted off school grounds. 
“We got away from some of the things that made this country great,”  Meyer said. 
That echoes what he said during his LB 122 hearing: “We have somewhat lost our way on values.” 
Narrative matters
Mueller said this type of framing of a type of moral decline, known as declension narrative, has often been used throughout U.S. history. 
“America is always losing its way, and most often it’s lost its way from its founding principles of this kind of Christian experiment … of Christians governing themselves,” Muller said.
Meyer said he didn’t expect his “In God We Trust” bill to be included in an education package because it was “controversial.” But he said he would not give up. Mueller said some lawmakers are more candid than others about their goals regarding these religious bills.
“Which is to have schools promote a very specific set of ideas about religion, ideas and about gender and sexuality,” Mueller said. 
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, a pastor and Democrat, said he doesn’t think the state should try to infuse more religion into schools. He said such decisions should be left up to school districts and families. 
“I send my kids to school to be educated,” Rountree said. “If there were things in the public school that went against how I felt religiously, then I pulled my kids out or had them with an alternative course of instruction.” 
Dungan said he has seen an increase in “extreme social bills” during his time in the Legislature. He pointed to term limits as a reason why the statehouse is seeing more “model bills,” because lawmakers are newer and less independent.  
“When you have either lobbyists from Nebraska or other states able to influence senators at a greater rate, you’re going to see more bills like this get introduced,” Dungan said.
Murman said the committee could consider an amended version of Lippincott’s bill as early as this week. Time is not on senators’ side, with many of the remaining days of the session dedicated to the budget and other contentious bills.

(Photo by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, via Flickr)The future of energy will be bolstered by lessons from beavers, enthusiasm from lawmakers, and consultation with tribal nations.
Those were some of the messages panelists shared Wednesday at the Clean and Affordable Energy Conference hosted by the NW Energy Coalition with an estimated 100 in attendance throughout the day.
Patrick Yawakie, a lobbyist with the Blackfeet Tribe and conference panelist, said non-Native American companies and state agencies have a long history of failing to consult with tribes on energy.
He said those entities have left tribes in the dark on development within their reservations.
“There needs to be much more transparent and regular conversations that are happening with the tribes and these entities,” said Yawakie, also co-CEO of Red Medicine, a civic engagement and lobbying organization.
The conference focused on energy resources for tribal communities, reliability and transmission, and energy efficiency and housing.
The NW Energy Coalition is an alliance of more than 100 organizations, utilities and businesses in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and British Columbia that promote clean, affordable energy.
Panelist Gerald Wagner, with the Blackfeet Nation, shared the way the tribe is applying the way beavers work to help with water storage and, therefore, energy conservation.
Beavers build dams, which hold onto water, and in Montana, spring runoff is taking place earlier, and the land is becoming arid more quickly, Wagner said.
As a pilot project that mimicked the ways of beavers, the Blackfeet dammed a couple of smaller streams, he said.
He said workers, 10 or 12 Native American youth, collected earthen material, such as rocks and willows, and then built a series of dams roughly 50 yards apart.
The dams don’t stop the water, but they slow it and allow storage. He said cameras took pictures of the dammed areas every 12 hours, and the effects were visible.
“The riparian zones came back, vegetation came back,” said Wagner, director of the Blackfeet Environmental Program for the tribe.
The idea is part of the Blackfeet Climate Change Adaptation Plan from 2018, and the dams were installed as part of a pilot project around 2021, he said. They are good for a season or so, and then require patching.
“If you look at the beaver, they’re always maintaining their structures,” Wagner said.
The larger idea, he said, is to observe what is occurring in nature, and then apply the lessons toward green energy.
He said the dams may result in less energy use because people don’t have to look for water or buy it.
“If you’ve got it stored, your wildlife, your cattle, your horses have more access to the water,” Wagner said.
Montana needs more energy transmission capacity too, and panelists discussed the work underway and how to expedite energy development so it doesn’t take 15 or 20 years.
Appropriate planning from the beginning is key, panelists said. 
Maranda Compton, an attorney and founder of Lepwe, said whether talking with communities or tribal nations, it’s important to hear criticism and have dialogue about projects.
Lepwe is a consulting firm providing advice and education to tribal nations and entities that seek to engage with tribes. 
Developers need to understand tribal nations are government entities with their own political processes and priorities, Compton said.
“Really understanding who in the government should be involved, what the tribe’s strategies and goals are, and how your project can work with those strategies and goals I think is really, really important,” Compton said.
Compton said a direct relationship between planning and development groups and tribal nations “has largely been missing,” and more robust conversation is needed, well before permitting is underway.
The energy summit took place on the heels of the 69th Montana Legislature, and Makenna Sellers, with the Montana Renewable Energy Association, said lawmakers see the need to increase transmission capacity, and they understand the urgency.
“State lawmakers are more open and proactive about how we can solve transmission than ever before,” Sellers said. “I’ve never seen more unanimous interest and policy prioritization happening at the state legislature on transmission.”
Sellers said some proposals didn’t make it to the finish line this year, but Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, sponsored a study resolution that will look at how state government can help solve regulatory barriers.
“Lawmakers are very open minded to some creativity here … this was the first session that I’ve seen this with seriousness,” Sellers said.
Senate Joint Resolution 21, to study the power grid, says competitive policies in some jurisdictions hinder transmission development, and as a result, hurt ratepayers and markets. It calls for an examination of a cooperative interstate compact.
When it comes to energy conservation, Yawakie said homeownership also plays a role, especially on the Flathead Indian Reservation, where he lives.
If people don’t own their own homes, he said, they can’t access programs such as those that help people install solar panels, and many tribal members live in poverty and in low income housing.
“Probably the biggest issue that lies on our reservation is the lack of homeownership to be able to access a lot of these (energy conservation) programs,” Yawakie said.
Brant Johnson, with Grid United, talked about the North Plains Connector project, a high-voltage transmission line being developed to connect the eastern and western electric grids in Montana and North Dakota.
Johnson described it as a “giant extension cord” that can transport power in either direction and be moved whichever way the market needs.
It’s intended to improve the reliability of the electrical grid and provide electricity when people need more power, such as during extreme weather.
“The value is in trying to make a grid that’s bigger than the weather,” Johnson said. “The wind doesn’t blow in Montana at the same time that it’s blowing in North Dakota.”
He said energy demand peaks in the east at different times than in the northwest, so the needs can counterbalance each other. He said more work remains, but the project is “a nice start.”

WKAR General Manager Shawn Turner said during a public forum the station hosted this week that about 16% of the station’s budget comes from federal funds.
“I will tell you that it absolutely will have an impact on local programming,” Turner said. “It doesn’t mean that it will all go away; I’ve been very fiscally conservative in trying to make sure that we have reserves here to continue to do work. But it does mean that some of the capacity – to me, 16% of my budget will just be gone overnight, so some of the capacity to do that work will go away.”
President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this month directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to “cease federal funding for NPR and PBS.”
“Neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to tax-paying citizens,” the order says. “The CPB Board shall cancel the existing direct funding to the maximum extent allowed by law and shall decline to provide future funding.”
Turner said the legality of the executive order remains an open question, noting that the CPB has indicated they do not believe it is valid.

But Trump also plans to introduce a rescission package asking Congress to strip federal funds for public broadcasting out of the budget, which were most recently allocated in March.
Turner said he believes supporters of public broadcasting contacting their members of Congress about the reportedly forthcoming rescissions package were “making some real progress.”
He speculated that waning support among members of Congress for a potential rescissions package may have prompted the abrupt pivot to an executive order, though he said the rescissions package is also likely still on the horizon.
“Either way, we recognize that the threats are real,” Turner said. “Whether it’s through the executive order or whether it’s through the rescissions package or whether it’s through one of the dozens of bills that members of Congress have put forward to zero out funding for NPR and PBS, the threat is real and it’s significant.”
If federal funding for public broadcasting is cut, Turner said WKAR would focus on doing their top priorities well – meaning some programming would be cut – rather than trying to maintain all of their existing programming in a potentially watered down format.
One key area is emergency alerts. WKAR is designated as the primary Emergency Alert System station for the state of Michigan, Senior Director of Station Operations Brant Wells said.
Additionally, they are part of the Warning, Alert & Response Network, sending out alerts for FEMA.

While the emergency alerts also go to cell phones, Wells noted that cellular networks can get overloaded, making public broadcasting a helpful backup for times of emergency.
Turner pointed to his own experience being in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, as an example. While he said he had a cell phone, he said it was nothing more than a brick for four days.
“We really won’t know how well that system works until something like that happens,” Turner said. “Right now, the Public Radio Satellite System can reach 99.7% of Americans. There’s absolutely nothing that exists in the commercial world that can do that.”
Last year, more than 11,000 alerts were sent out through WARN.
“If you think about that, just one alert, if that saves one life, isn’t it worth it?” Wells said.
NPR and PBS aren’t the only ones whose funding the Trump administration has targeted.
Trump has promised to begin “fundamentally changing, terminating, or overhauling FEMA,” the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And the National Weather Service has been significantly downsized.
Turner said the most likely scenario, if Trump’s sweeping cuts to the federal government are successful, is that “you will see our emergency alerting system basically be taken over by the commercial sector.”
“I’m very concerned about that, and I think we should all be concerned about that, because the commercial sector does not exist to do nonprofit sort of work for the community. It exists to make a profit,” Turner said.
Federal funding cuts are also already being felt in WKAR’s educational programs, said Director of Education Robin Pizzo.
She said PBS member stations were told earlier this week that they could no longer spend any money connected to the Ready to Learn program, which targets preschool and early elementary school children.
“Many of the programs that were already in the queue to be developed – high quality, educational programming that supports 60% of children who are ages three and four who cannot access preschool education – many of these programs will not move forward with production,” Pizzo said.
She said WKAR also partners with Head Start, whose regional office serving Michigan was abruptly closed last month.
“We see a ripple effect throughout our educational system,” Pizzo said.
She said WKAR has provided more than 11,500 reading kits to more than 130 organizations in 30 counties throughout mid-Michigan, as well as partnering with various local organizations, making them a bridge between educators and families.
“In being that bridge, we really are like a gap filler for many of our children and many of our families,” Pizzo said. “They just don’t have the resources to be able to give the high quality school readiness supports to their children that they might need for a variety of reasons.”
With federal funding more uncertain than ever, Turner said one of the best things people can do to support public media is to donate to their local member stations.
While federal funds make up about 16% of WKAR’s budget, he said they account for just 1% of NPR’s budget.
“The reason that donation to the local station matters is because what we try to do at the local level is to bring you NPR and PBS programming, and to take those national level stories, and our reporters, our team, they look at how those stories impact us on a local level,” Turner said.
“When you’re listening to All Things Considered or Morning Edition and you hear that local twist on what’s happening at the national level, that is because your donations have allowed us to purchase in to be NPR member stations and to purchase that programming.”
But while one audience member wanted NPR and PBS to take a more forceful stand against Trump’s actions, Turner defended public broadcasters’ approach.
“I can bang on the window and say, you know, ‘what you’re doing is wrong and you should do something different,’ and it’s very clear what my message is if I do that,” Turner said. “But I can also do the work that sends a clear message, that is that we have a set of values and beliefs that are fundamental to who we are as Americans, who we are as a nation.”

Jolene Baxter’s daughter, Marlee, has overcome immense challenges in her first eight years of life.
Marlee, who was born with a heart defect, has undergone four open-heart surgeries — suffering a stroke after the third. The stroke affected Marlee’s cognitive abilities — she’s in the second grade, but she cannot read yet. A mainstream class with neurotypical students felt overwhelming, so Marlee mostly attends classes with kids who also have disabilities. Her care includes physical, occupational and speech therapies.
For years, Baxter has relied on Medicaid to cover Marlee’s medical expenses while advocating for her daughter’s right to an equal education. Medicaid — which covers therapies, surgeries and medication for Marlee — and disability protections under the Department of Education have been a critical safety net for Baxter, a single mom in Oklahoma City. Now Baxter fears that proposed cuts to Medicaid and those already underway at the Department of Education, which President Donald Trump has effectively gutted, will have a disastrous impact on her daughter.
As the Trump administration overhauls federal agencies with budget cuts, layoffs and inexperienced leadership, parents of children with complex medical needs and disabilities told The 19th they are navigating uncertainty over how the federal government plans to maintain key pillars of their kids’ lives.
Baxter, who fostered and, later, adopted Marlee, fought to give her life-saving medical treatment when the child was an infant. Since Marlee was both an abandoned child and is Kiowa, the officials overseeing her welfare weren’t invested in getting her the care she needed to survive, Baxter believes. Cuts to Medicaid would be yet another obstacle for the Baxters to overcome.  Just getting Marlee enrolled in local public schools that tried to turn her away was a battle, Baxter said. Now, the mom is gravely concerned that her daughter will be left behind due to the restructuring of the Department of Education.
“I’ll do everything I can at home, but she’ll just fall through all the cracks, and she won’t get the education that she deserves,” Baxter said.
In March, Trump signed an executive order to close the Department of Education. The Republican-controlled Congress is also considering massive funding cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health insurance to millions of low-income Americans and is a key safety net for Americans with disabilities.
“It is 50-plus years of work to get these protections for people with disabilities that we could potentially see — maybe not fully diminished — but very deeply eroded, in a very short period of time,” said Robyn Linscott, director of education and family policy at The Arc, an organization that advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

The Department of Education’s primary duty has been to ensure that all students have equal access to education, and it is equipped with an Office for Civil Rights to investigate schools accused of discrimination. In March, the Department of Education cut nearly half of its staff, with workers who enforce students’ civil rights hit particularly hard. Advocates worry how this could potentially impact students with disabilities, and a lawsuit filed in March began to paint a picture: Newly closed regional offices, frozen investigations and new alleged politically-based cases.
The Trump administration claims that the nation’s most vulnerable will be spared from his plans for federal downsizing.
The White House has tentative plans to assign oversight of special education to the Department of Health and Human Services. Conservative groups are calling for the Trump administration to refer civil rights complaints to the Department of Justice, an agency that has had an exodus of staff departures since Trump returned to office and changed its mission.
Nicole Jorwic, chief program officer at Caring Across Generations, a national caregiver advocacy organization, said the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights receives about 20,000 complaints annually. She worries about the impact of staffing cuts on handling these complaints on the families of children with disabilities.
“Some of those staff were the ones who were looking into those complaints,” she said.

It’s not just OCR complaints, she added. When she was a practicing special education attorney, Jorwic turned to reports and guidance issued by the agency. That helped local school districts, superintendents and special educators know how to implement different laws or changes.
“The lack of that federal agency to provide that clarity is also important, as well as something that we’re really worried about,” she said.
Parents and advocates are doubtful that students with disabilities won’t be impacted. Before the Department of Education was created in 1979, schools often denied these children a right to education with impunity. Dissolving it, families fear, could see a return to the period when states and schools failed to prioritize special education.
Baxter’s daughter, Marlee, is guaranteed the right to free and appropriate schooling by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1975, which is enforced by the Department of Education. This federal law mandates that children like Marlee attend classes suited to their cognitive and physical abilities and that they get the services needed, such as speech, physical and occupational therapy, to attend school . Ninety-five percent of students with disabilities attend public schools, a higher share than the 90 percent of students overall who do — and that’s largely because of the services federal policy requires public schools to provide. 
Kim Crawley, a mother to a teenager with medically complex needs, has a 25-year career as a special education teacher. As part of her training, she learned about the history of education, including how five decades ago, schools were not obligated to accommodate students’ special needs. The agency never took power away from the states, she said, but stepped in to ensure that they educated all students equitably.
“We learn about this for a reason because we don’t want to repeat it,” Crawley said. “We don’t want to have to start over again. To think of losing everything we have gained through the Department of Education over these years is scaring not only parents but teachers. Teachers are scared because we don’t know where this is going to end up for those kids. And that’s why we go to work every day.”
Critics of closing the department and redirecting disabled children’s needs to other agencies say that it will create a bureaucratic nightmare for parents. Instead of one federal agency overseeing research on students with disabilities, state funding for special education or discrimination claims, multiple departments would be involved. Families might not know which agency to reach out to with questions and concerns.
As it is, families are sometimes unaware of the services legally available to them — a reality that has cost them time and energy in the past and could be even more complicated in the future.
Baxter, for one, pulled Marlee out of class for two years to homeschool her after the child’s kindergarten teacher retired and subsequent teachers did not know how to educate her properly, she said. It was not Baxter’s first choice to homeschool Marlee, an option unavailable to most working parents, but one she made after multiple public schools said they could not accommodate her child.
“Our special needs are full,” Baxter said they told her. “We don’t have room for her.”
When an acquaintance told her that public schools could not lawfully refuse to enroll Marlee, Baxter finally got a local public school to admit her. But after her ordeal last year, she has no faith that the federal government will hold schools that discriminate against children with disabilities accountable if the education department is disbanded.
“We have enough stuff to worry about [with] making sure that she gets taken care of as far as medical care,” Baxter said of parents like herself. “We don’t need to worry about what we’re going to do as far as their education.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For some families, the potential Medicaid cuts could both unravel a child’s well-being and their family’s finances.
In Philadelphia, Meghann Luczkowski has three kids with varying levels of specialized health care needs, including a 10-year-old son who spent his first year of life in a hospital intensive care unit.
“His ability to grow and thrive and be part of our family and part of this community is dependent upon significant health care support at home,” said the former special education teacher, who now works in public health.
Luczkowski said her husband has robust health insurance for the family, but it does not cover a lot of her son’s home-based medical needs — a reality for many families whose children are on Medicaid for care related to a disability. Private insurance never paid for his ventilator to breathe, or home health nurses that allow family caregivers to sleep at night.
“It doesn’t pay for the nurse to go to school with him, to make sure that he can be at school, accessing his education with his peers,” she said. “That’s all been provided through Medicaid.”
In the first months of his second term, Trump has mostly indicated support for Medicaid when asked about his budgetary plans for other popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. But the president has also said he supports cutting fraud and waste — a description that health policy experts warn could be used to defend more expansive cuts. Congress is considering hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts, a dollar figure that goes way beyond known cases of fraud.
Among the considerations are work requirements and a cap on Medicaid enrollee spending. Such restrictions could have ripple effects on state education budgets and subsequent reductions in services for students with disabilities. Medicaid is one of the largest providers of funds to public school districts. It is the responsibility of school districts and states to find funding if Medicaid reimbursements are insufficient. Trump has not addressed general concerns about how such spending cuts could impact disabled children and adults.
“We know that before 1975 and the passage of IDEA, 50% of kids with disabilities were not educated at all. So we know that this is a crucial piece of legislation, and that mandate to find funding for these is really important,” said Linscott, who previously worked as a special education teacher in New York City. “But we also recognize that school districts and state budgets are so limited, which is why we want Medicaid to be able to provide as robust funding and reimbursement as they possibly can for students and for these services.”
Jorwic said federal funding for special education services is crucial, and local governments cannot make up for the lost funds. The federal government currently spends more than $15 billion annually on special education services, and Medicaid funding accounts for about $7.5 billion annually in school-based services.
Jorwic said Medicaid cuts could also translate into higher taxes on a local or state level. This week, the Democratic Kansas governor said she had asked the state’s congressional lawmakers not to cut Medicaid in large part because of the ramifications on services.
“There’s no state, even the wealthiest states, that could afford cuts to those programs, either when it comes to education or when it comes to providing home and community-based services,” Jorwic said.
Rachael Brown is the mom of a medically complex second grader in Washington, D.C., who receives special education services and multiple therapies at his public school.
Brown’s son, who has autism and cerebral palsy, has a rare vascular anomaly in his brain that has required multiple surgeries. He receives extensive support from Medicaid and IDEA, which are crucial for his care and education. Brown is concerned about how cuts to Medicaid would impact her son’s care and her family’s personal finances. She noted that pediatric hospitals are heavily reliant on Medicaid. If the rate of that reimbursement is cut, those hospitals’ operational costs would be on the line — impacting everything from how many doctors and other health care providers are hired to what therapies are covered for her son.
“There’s just a ripple effect for our whole community,” she said, adding: “We are relatively privileged. There’s a lot of families who aren’t. It would be much worse for families for whom Medicaid is their only insurance.”
Brown said she lives in fear and worry about what happens next, and it’s exhausting. While she and other advocates have some experience fighting for health care rights given previous political battles, “this time, everything feels a little more cruel.”
On Wednesday, Luczkowski planned to travel to D.C. — taking a day off from work and rearranging child care needs — to advocate for Medicaid as part of a multi-organization advocacy day. She said parents of kids with medically complex needs and disabilities often aren’t able to get out and advocate as much as they would like to, in part because of the needs of their families.
“Despite the fact that it’s an incredible hardship on my family for me to be in D.C. talking to legislators and being at rallies on the Capitol steps, that’s what me and a great number of families are doing — because our kids’ lives depend on it,” she said. “We’re hopeful that our voices will be valued, and our children will be valued.”

Chief Judge Carl Ashley said he was told the arrest occurred after a court hearing. Since March, at least four people have been arrested for immigration enforcement in or near the courthouse. Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was charged with obstruction after escorting a man sought by ICE into a public hallway outside her courtroom. 
The identity of the person arrested Wednesday has not been released. ICE officials have been unable to provide information at this time to Wisconsin Examiner. 
In late March, Marco Cruz-Garcia, 24, a Mexican citizen, was arrested in the courthouse as he appeared in family court on a domestic violence restraining order. In a statement, ICE accused Cruz-Garcia of being a known member of the “Sureños transnational criminal street gang,” and cited his 2020 deportation order by a judge.  
Edwin Bustamante-Sierre, 27, a Nicaraguan citizen, was arrested days after Cruz-Garcia on April 3. ICE said in a statement that Bustamante-Sierre had been charged with reckless driving, endangering safety, reckless use of a firearm, use of a dangerous weapon and cocaine possession in Fond du Lac County and Milwaukee County. 
On April 18, agents arrested Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 30, a Mexican immigrant lacking permanent legal status, who faced three misdemeanor domestic battery charges. 
The arrest of Flores-Ruiz led to Judge Dugan’s arrest. On April 25, Dugan was arrested outside the courthouse, with agents leading the judge to an unmarked squad car in handcuffs. Protests erupted that day and over the weekend at the FBI Milwaukee office, which conducted a speedy investigation into Dugan, after right-wing media outlets claimed to have broken a story about Dugan helping the man evade ICE by leading him out a side door in  her courtroom. 
A bipartisan letter from judges around the country objected to the unusual, high-profile arrest and “perp walk” of Dugan. 
Local officials in Milwaukee have spoken out against the ICE arrests at the courthouse, saying they are disrupting proceedings as community members seek crucial services and are discouraging people from coming to court.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A weeklong celebration of “freedom” is likely coming to Montana schools under a law passed during the 2025 legislative session.
House Bill 591 adds “Freedom Week” to a list of codified “commemorative days” that includes Washington’s birthday, Arbor Day, Flag Day and American Indian Heritage Day, among several others. All other commemorative days are for a single day, while the celebration of freedom will last a week.
The law, which is awaiting Gov. Greg Gianforte’s signature, requires school districts to adopt a policy to “ensure the effective conduct of appropriate exercises for the commemorative days,” according to the legislation.
Rep. Greg Oblander, R-Billings, brought the legislation and said its intent “is to educate students about the sacrifices that were made for freedom in the founding of the United States” during a House hearing on the bill in February.
Schools are already doing much of the work the bill seeks to accomplish, said Gordon Klasna, who is the executive director of secondary education for the Billings Public Schools. Klasna oversees the middle and high schools in the district.
Klasna said the district will look for guidance from the Montana School Boards Association as well as its attorneys as they adopt the new bill. The district was keeping an eye on the bill during the process, as it does with other legislation impacting schools, he added.
 No funding was attached to the bill, but the new commemorative week won’t be a cost to the district, and Klasna added it is, “something that we can easily do.” As he understands it, the bill directs districts to commemorate sacrifices made for this country while also “expounding” upon the values the United States was founded on.
The bill initially received pushback from the Montana School Boards Association in the form it was presented to the House. Originally, the bill asked for three hours of study on the U.S. Constitution, the Montana Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. 
As originally written, it would have also required “school districts to ensure that pupils in grades 3 through 12 recite a certain passage from the Declaration of Independence.”
That language was amended out. During the Senate hearing for the bill, both the Montana School Boards Association and Office of Public Instruction supported the legislation.
“We think we struck the right balance with the amendments here, without taking any of the value of what Representative Oblander brought to the table in the first place,” said Lance Melton, with the school boards association.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)When Berkshire Hathaway bought PacifiCorp — Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company — in 2005, stakeholders didn’t consider the losses future devastating wildfires in the West would bring. 
It was a mistake to keep PacifiCorp’s structure and not carve it up into the states that comprise the utility, Warren Buffett, CEO and chair of the conglomerate, said during an annual stakeholder meeting last weekend in Omaha. 
“There are some problems that can’t be solved, and we shouldn’t be in the business of taking your money, investor money, and tackling things that we don’t know the solution for,” Buffett said, explaining that these risks are often political decisions, since they deal with states or the federal government. “And if you’re in something where you’re going to lose, the big thing to do is quit,” he added.

It’s important that the country has a smart energy policy, Buffett said. During historical emergency times, like World War II, there was collaboration between the private and public sector. How does that work in today’s democracy? He’s uncertain.
A group of Utahns, joined by environmental activists from other Western states, attended the meeting to try to speak with stakeholders about the effects of burning fossil fuels — including the proliferation of wildfires. They watched as Buffett’s comments unfolded, just days after Utah’s Public Service Commission rejected an 18% residential rate increase proposed by Rocky Mountain Power attributed to rising prices of fuel and wildfire liability. 
“All of these costs are driven by Rocky Mountain Power’s reliance on fossil fuels, which is a majority of its energy mix in Utah,” the Sierra Club wrote in a release, arguing that coal reliance may have been empowered by SB224, which passed the Utah Legislature in 2024 establishing a $1 billion fund to allow the state to self-insure in case of fire events caused by electrical corporations.
Meanwhile, Rocky Mountain Power has also indefinitely extended the life of its coal-powered plants in its long-term resource planning.
PacifiCorp extends the life of Utah coal-powered plants — indefinitely

One of the Utahns attending the meeting was Luis Miranda, senior organizer with Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign, who said the organized opposition had a tough goal during the meeting — to ask stakeholders “to remove climate risk from their portfolio by decarbonizing their grid.” 
“Using the opportunity afforded by clean energy, that should resolve a lot of the problems being caused by climate change, which they feel is an unchangeable issue,” he said.
Greg Abel, chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and named successor of Buffett, however, defended the use of fossil fuels during the meeting, arguing that the company has to follow state policies.
While people would like to see coal plants retired, the reality is that the company still needs them to keep the system stable and rates low, Abel said.



Let us know what you think...


 


Wildfires are intensifying and, with them, the insurance risks the company is absorbing. Abel said that the company has learned from its mistakes and it is switching priorities to protect its assets, like de-energizing when a fire is approaching its equipment — which means the lights may not be kept on during these emergencies anymore. 
One thing is certain, Abel said: “We can’t just become the insurer of last resort, and that we’re going to cover any costs and all costs, irrespective of what occurred. And that’s a little bit of the situation we’re in right now.”
This isn’t the first time Berkshire Hathaway leaders have questioned the place of private enterprises in public utilities. Buffett has notably suggested he would be interested in selling the utility, saying “we’re not going to throw good money after bad,” when speaking on the conglomerate’s demand for protections against liability from the government.
PacifiCorp involved in bills in Oregon, western states, limiting utility wildfire liability, damages

Now, after a lawsuit over the massive 2020 Oregon wildfires, the company is now asking every legislature where it operates to get a clear definition of its liability. 
An example, cited by Abel in the past, is Utah’s SB224, which also limits the amount of money a person physically injured by a wildfire can sue for to $450,000, and $100,000 for those who aren’t physically injured. 
For Miranda, from the Sierra Club, listening to the meeting left him worried about what could happen for his utility bills as a Rocky Mountain Power customer. Also what could the lasting burning of coal may mean for his community’s public health?
“I have to live with those consequences. These folks do not care about our experience, about how much we are paying and about how we’re living with the consequences of burning unaffordable, dirty coal,” Miranda said. “Is this really the company and the incentive structure in which we are going to put our trust on?”

Idaho voters have until 5 p.m., local time, on Friday to request an absentee ballot, according to a press release issued Wednesday by the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office.
Idaho voters can request an absentee ballot online for free at voteidaho.gov, the official state election website run by the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office.
However, in order to request an absentee ballot, voters first must be registered to vote, elections officials said.
Anyone who is not yet registered to vote may still register to vote at their polling place and vote on Election Day. Voters can find their polling place, review their sample ballot and more at voteidaho.gov.
  What will be on Idaho ballots for the May 20 election? 

On May 20, local elections will take place in 37 of Idaho’s 44 counties. 
The specific elections voters get to participate in vary depending on where the voter lives, but local elections like library districts, highway districts, school district bond issues or supplemental levies, auditorium districts or hospital districts are being voted on across the state.

“This May, there are some important races happening in Idaho,” Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said in a written statement. “Across 37 counties, voters will have the chance to weigh in on candidates and issues, from highway districts in Canyon County, water and sewer districts in Eagle, to a library levy in Burley. I encourage all Idahoans to take part in the May 20 election.”
While voters in Blaine, Butte, Clark, Custer, Elmore, Lemhi and Washington counties do not have any elections on May 20, voters in all other Idaho counties do have elections on their ballots.
In Ada County, there are several important elections, depending on where voters live. 
In the Meridian Library District, there are four candidates running for two available library district trustee positions.
In the Greater Boise Auditorium District, there are four candidates running for two available seats on the board.
In the Ada County Free Library District, there are six candidates running for two available trustee seats.
“Local elections are a powerful way to shape the decisions that affect our daily lives,” McGrane said.
If voters do not wish to vote by absentee ballot, polls will be open across Idaho for in-person voting from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., local time, on May 20.

Recently, however, it was reported that the White House was considering eliminating Head Start funding for fiscal year 2026.
Given the incredible contributions the Head Start program has made in the lives of so many young children and families, it was hard to conceive how the cornerstone of early education in our country could be at risk of dismantling.
Much to our relief, the White House budget proposal released on May 2 did not call for the elimination of Head Start – the program that serves nearly 1 million children annually, providing them with year-round early learning, health screenings, and nutrition.
Congress will now work on finalizing the 2026 appropriations process, including funding for early learning programs. With this important task at hand, we would like to remind the Louisiana congressional delegation that more than 20,000 of our state’s children and families depend on Head Start funding. As a result, we urge Congress to preserve and protect this proven program that serves those most in need.
At Clover (formerly Kingsley House), we provide services to over 1,500 children from birth to age 5 through high-quality early care and education in Orleans and Jefferson parishes. We are also part of the Educare Learning Network, a national partnership of 25 high-quality early childhood schools committed to research-based practices and early learning excellence, with Head Start’s evidence-based practices at the foundation.
But this isn’t just about our organization — it’s about an established framework that ensures all children have a fair start in life. Programs like ours, and hundreds like it across the country, rely on federal Head Start and Early Head Start funding to perform this essential work.
Decades of research has shown that Head Start participation produces immediate and long- term positive outcomes for children, families, and communities. Providing education opportunities in safe, nurturing environments, accompanied by healthy meals, and comprehensive family-focused services, Head Start provides structure and an environment where young children, primarily from low-income households, are provided the tools they need to succeed in school and beyond.
Here’s what’s at stake:
More than one million parents depend on Head Start so they can go to work and support their families. Without it, many would be forced to choose between their job and their child’s care—a choice no parent should have to make.
The loss of early education opportunities will have a severe ripple effect on local economies, employers, and employees across Louisiana. Lack of access to affordable childcare, most particularly for women in the workforce, leads to higher levels of absenteeism, reduced productivity and job loss.
In fact, the Louisiana Association of Business & Industry (LABI) sees early education as essential to ensuring a productive workforce, calling for expanded access to high-quality, affordable early learning opportunities for all young children from birth to age 4, in centers that meet high standards of care. Head Start standards are the most rigorous in the nation.
Research shows that 80% of a child’s brain development occurs in the first 1,000 days —  from conception to their second birthday. Removing access to quality early childhood education during this period causes lasting developmental setbacks.
Reductions in Head Start funding would impact services to more than 20,000 at-risk children in Louisiana, widening school readiness and opportunity gaps before they enter kindergarten. Economically speaking, children who require additional support ultimately cost school districts more in the long run, which provides a compelling rationale for investing in Head Start at the outset.
The data is clear: children who struggle to read in early grades are far more likely to fall
behind, drop out, and face incarceration later in life.
As Congress now considers the president’s proposed 2026 budget, the stakes could not be higher. Head Start has supported tens of millions of children and families over the past 60 years. We cannot afford to roll back that progress now.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/teacher-classroom-1024x577.png,,,2025-05-08 15:05:16.394649

Johanelyz Arroyo, a senior from Hillhouse High School in New Haven, described how her school can’t afford sketchbooks for its art class. A teacher instead has made their own by hand through stapling pieces of scrap paper together. 
Indy Nunes hasn’t had a certified chemistry teacher in seven months at her Norwalk high school, she said. Her class is conducted online with a substitute teacher who takes attendance.
One Hartford student, who mainly spoke in Spanish, recalled a blood drive at his school that ended early — not because of a lack of volunteers, but because the school facility didn’t have air conditioning to properly store the donations.
And Estevan Martins, who migrated from Brazil five years ago to Bridgeport, took a deep breath before describing how he’s preparing for a pullback of multilingual services and supports that have been crucial to his education. He said budget constraints will likely eliminate the staff that’s helped him feel safe, supported and seen.
The four students were among hundreds from across the state who flooded the Legislative Office Building Thursday and led their own news conference urging Gov. Ned Lamont to “prioritize funding for our public education.”
“Over the years, I watched staff who changed my life, mentors who guided me, teachers who believed in me, disappear because of funding cuts. What will happen next? Will we lose our math teachers, our English teachers? When will we stop?” Martins said. 
“We’re not asking more than what others already have. We’re asking for fairness, for equity. Students in Bridgeport work just as hard and dream just as big as any student in any other district, but we are being asked to do it with less support, less opportunity and less hope.”

Students from Bridgeport, Hartford, New London, New Haven, Norwalk, Vernon and Waterbury were in attendance, joined by a handful of superintendents and other community leaders. 
The group later delivered a letter to the governor’s office that called for equitable school funding and the passage of Senate Bill 1511, which has passed out of the Education Committee and has been sent to Appropriations.
The bill calls to raise the “foundation” amount of per-pupil funding in the state’s Education Cost Sharing Grant by over $960, to at least $12,488 per pupil, and also proposes a new added 50% weight for students with disabilities who receive special education services.
“Districts across the state are suffering from our state’s failure to fully deliver on what should be the promise of public education. High need students, including low income students, students with disabilities and multilingual learners do not receive adequate funding to support their unique learning needs,” said New Haven Superintendent Madeline Negrón.
To the Honorable Ned LamontDownload
David Bednarz, Lamont’s senior press secretary, defended the governor’s investment in education in a written statement Thursday.
“Since taking office, Gov. Lamont’s budgets have increased school funding by 22%, which has made our schools among the best in the country,” Bednarz said, adding that the governor “continues to meet with legislative leaders and looks forward to signing a budget that continues to support our state’s outstanding schools.”
Districts stretch their budgets
The students and district leadership said Thursday that Connecticut school boards are working to finalize their 2025-26 budgets, where hundreds, even thousands, of school staff will likely be laid off in upcoming months if the state doesn’t provide more funding support. 
Layoffs are just one part among a series of other reductions to student services, which include cuts to reading intervention, tutoring and after-school programs.
In New Haven, a $23 million budget deficit could mean the removal of over 150 positions, including layoffs and closing vacancies. On the ground more specifically this means the district will not have a single librarian and will face major cuts to its art and music departments.
“Students and educators are here today to fight for simple truth, there is no single reason my fellow students and I cannot receive a quality education — a holistic one complimented by the arts,” said John Carlos Serana Musser, a student representative on the New Haven Board of Education and a junior at Wilbur Cross High School. 
“There’s not one reason why my fellow students and I cannot receive an education where our research and love of reading is fostered by the warm smile and guiding hand of a librarian. There’s not one reason for this to be happening in a state that sits on a $4.6 billion [surplus] in the richest country in the world,” he said.
In Bridgeport and Norwalk, district leaders said they are facing similar layoffs to staff and reductions of services.
“We are losing counselors, teachers, support staff, effective programs and resources that have been vital, particularly after the pandemic when our scholars lost so much,” said Norwalk Superintendent Alexandra Estrella, who also told The Connecticut Mirror that she’s anticipating layoffs of over 100 staff members.

“This isn’t just about budgets,” Bridgeport Superintendent Royce Avery added at the press conference Thursday. “It’s about whether our students have access to resources, opportunities and support they need to thrive in Bridgeport and districts across this state. We have plans, we have a vision, and now we need the state’s investment.”
The legislature’s proposal
In late April, the legislature’s Appropriations Committee adopted a $55.7 billion two-year budget that would require Connecticut to legally exceed its spending cap for the first time since 2007 and reform another key savings program.
Legislators pushed back against Lamont earlier this year, ordering $40 million in supplemental aid this fiscal year to local schools to offset what many called a crisis in special education. The School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan education policy group, estimated districts needed $108 million.
The governor has proposed sending schools an extra $40 million annually for special education, but not for another two years. The committee budget released on April 22 maintained the extra $40 million in state payments in both the 2025-26 and 2026-27 fiscal years, but also recommended $124 million in extra special education grants in each of the next two years.
The committee also pushed back on Lamont over the Education Cost Sharing grant, the main funding program to support local elementary and secondary school operating expenses. The committee proposed an extra $26 million in funding over the next two years combined to ensure that about 80 communities would not face a reduction in ECS as called for under the state’s statutory formula. The system weighs local wealth, enrollment totals and past local education spending in calculating the state’s contribution.
“Our state legislators have been loud and clear that they want to do more because they have heard from everybody across the state. They have proposed to add $124 million and I know, and you should know, that the only person that stands in front of that being a possibility that would help us all across the state is Gov. Lamont,” Negrón said.

Earlier this year, education advocates had pushed for $545 million in increased funding, a figure derived from an October report put out by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which offered recommendations for reengaging students who have lost touch with the education system.
New Haven’s Negrón said that ask is out of the question right now, “because there are other needs.”
“But at the very least, if [Lamont] would take the $124 million that the Appropriations Committee is suggesting, if he would just loosen up to give that $124 and if they were to add a 50% weight to the ECS formula [for special education], that would spread out. All of us would be able to have funding that would help us right now in the crisis that we’re in,” Negrón told the CT Mirror.
“We’re bleeding staff left and right and class sizes are going to increase. We also have issues that we might not be able to fully schedule students because we don’t have enough personnel. We just got out of a pandemic. The crisis has not ended yet. The resources have been depleted, and the need continues to live and what is the state going to do to help us maintain programs so that it doesn’t always fall on the taxpayers back?” Estrella added.

Applicants must obtain a nomination from one of their U.S. senators or from a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from their state. (U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Flickr photo)Rhode Island high schoolers interested in attending one of the nation’s five military service academies can learn about the application process on U.S. Service Academy Day on Saturday, May 10, at the Community College of Rhode Island’s (CCRI) Knight Campus in Warwick. 
Hosted by U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, this year’s event runs from 9 to 11 a.m. in the Bobby Hackett Theater on the CCRI campus. 
Representatives from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Merchant Marine and Coast Guard academies will be available to answer questions.
The service academies are a postsecondary experience on the government’s dime, with tuition, housing, and related expenses covered without any cost to students. But the application process is a little more intense than most colleges. To apply, one needs to be a U.S. citizen between 17 and 23 years old, not married or pregnant, and without dependents. The competitive admission process evaluates applicants on academic and physical performance, as well as leadership skills. 
The final piece needed for four of the academies is getting a congressional nomination. Reed did, and he attended West Point from 1967 to 1971 after successfully getting a nomination from then-U.S. Senator, and former Rhode Island Governor, John O. Pastore. 
Reed chaired the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee from 2021 through Jan. 3, when he was replaced by Sen. Roger Wicker, an Air Force Veteran and Mississippi Republican. 
The U.S. Military Academy is located in West Point, New York. The U.S. Air Force Academy is in Colorado Springs, Colorado, while Annapolis, Maryland, is home to the U.S. Naval Academy. The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy is in Kings Point, New York.
The U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, is the one exception and does not require nominations.
Applications for the 2025 cycle opened on May 1 and will close on Oct. 15. 
Reed’s website has more information on how to request a nomination. Congressional delegates are limited to the number of appointments they can make, so Reed’s website recommends applying “to all the congressional offices that apply to you.” Applicants can seek a nomination from Reed, Whitehouse, and whichever U.S. Representative represents the district where the applicant lives. (Currently, that’s either Reps. Seth Magaziner or Gabe Amo.)
Applicants who pass an initial round of consideration may be invited to Reed’s Cranston office for an interview with the senator and his selection committee, which includes people with military, educational, and leadership backgrounds. Applicants must also submit a complete package that includes a questionnaire, personal essay, two letters of recommendation, standardized testing results, and a high school transcript.
Students are considered to be on active duty from the day they enter their academy and hold the rank of cadet or midshipman. Like soldiers, academy undergraduates wear uniforms, live in barracks, and engage in military training every day. But there are also elements of civilian college life on military campuses like varsity sports and clubs.
Distinct among the service academies are the Coast Guard and Merchant Marine academies, as the institutions differ in key ways, including their statutory authorities and admissions processes, according to a Congressional Research Service briefing. These two academies are also overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Transportation, respectively, while the other three are the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).
Regardless of academic focus, all cadets and midshipmen learn professional development, and graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree. After completing their training and studies, graduates are commissioned as officers and begin an eight-year service obligation — typically five years on active duty, followed by three in the reserves.

Free.,Puzzled senators question Trump’s FBI chief on nonexistent spending plan,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/puzzled-senators-question-trumps-fbi-chief-nonexistent-spending-plan,,"WASHINGTON — The case of the missing Federal Bureau of Investigation budget request was on full display Thursday, when senators repeatedly asked the law enforcement agency’s director what resources he needed Congress to provide in the upcoming fiscal year.FBI Director Kash Patel did not disclose a dollar amount, an unusual development at a hearing at which an agency head traditionally discusses a budget request in detail with lawmakers who hold the purse strings.The Senate Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science Subcommittee hearing came one day after Patel testified before a House panel that he needs more money from Congress than was asked for in the Trump administration’s budget request.Patel’s written statement to the House subcommittee said the FBI’s total request was $10.1 billion, but during that hearing he told appropriators the agency needed at least $11.2 billion.Patel rejecting the Trump administration’s official budget request in support of his own proposal to Congress was significant in that Cabinet secretaries almost always stick to the official request, at least during public hearings.“The skinny budget is a proposal, and I'm working through the appropriations process to explain why we need more than what has been proposed,” Patel said during the House hearing Wednesday.Never mindLess than 24 hours later, he reversed course during the Senate hearing, saying his comments were misconstrued.“President Trump has set new priorities and a focus on federal law enforcement. I'm here today in full support of the president's budget, which reprioritizes and enhances our mission of law enforcement and national security,” Patel said in his opening statement. “We're fighting for a fully funded FBI because we want a fully effective FBI.”What that dollar amount might be was unclear, though.During an exchange with Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member on the full Appropriations Committee, about what exactly the FBI needs in terms of funding, Patel said: “I'm not asking you for anything at this time.”Murray responded by asking if he believed the FBI could “operate without a budget.” Patel responded that he “never said that.”Republicans and Democrats on the Senate panel repeatedly brought up that the Trump administration’s “skinny” budget proposal, released last week, doesn’t actually include a total funding level for the FBI. It only has one paragraph calling for lawmakers to cut funding by $545 million.Patel testified during the two-hour Senate hearing that he had identified most of the accounts that could lose funding, though he wasn’t prepared to share that information with the committee or give a timeline when he would.Patel also declined to tell lawmakers when the FBI would send Congress its spending plan for the current fiscal year, which is required by law and past due.“I don’t have a timeline on that,” Patel said.Kansas senator pleads with Patel for detailsKansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, the subcommittee’s chairman, said he was holding the hearing to get the ball rolling on the upcoming appropriations process and encouraged Patel to get the committee more details.“We wanted to get every piece of information we could as early as we could, even though the budgetary process and now the appropriations process is disjointed and things are lacking,” Moran said.Moran said that he was “concerned by the scale of the cut, especially as I know full well it comes on the heels of two years where the FBI’s budget was essentially held flat, forcing it to absorb hundreds of millions of dollars in unavoidable inflationary increases.”Patel declined to say if he would testify before the committee again after the Trump administration releases its full budget request, which should include considerably more detail and is expected to come out sometime later this year, though the White House hasn’t said when.The House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees that fund the FBI will write the bill over the summer and will likely negotiate final bipartisan, bicameral bills this fall.That bill is one of a dozen that provide funding for many of the departments and agencies that make up the federal government, including Agriculture, Energy, Defense, Health and Human Services.

Wisconsin has joined 14 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for cutting off federal funds that had been approved for states to build up their electric vehicle charging networks. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A group of states, including Wisconsin, that were promised federal funds to establish electric vehicle charging station networks sued the Trump administration and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy this week for cutting off the promised grants.
“The Trump Administration and Secretary Duffy are singlehandedly trying to block Wisconsin from receiving the investments we were promised,” Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement Thursday. “It’s bad for the people of Wisconsin, it’s bad for our infrastructure, it’s bad for our economy, and it’s illegal.”
The lawsuit alleges that President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking electric vehicle charging station grants was illegal.
The lawsuit was filed late Wednesday in federal court in the state of Washington, which is the lead plaintiff among the suit’s 15 states and the District of Columbia.
Trump’s order “Unleashing American Energy,” signed the day he was inaugurated, told federal agencies to pause the distribution of funds that were appropriated during the Biden administration as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act or the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.
The order said the pause was “including but not limited to funds for electric vehicle charging stations made available through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program.” The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, or NEVI, is part of the 2021 infrastructure law.
Wisconsin has been approved for $62.65 million in funding under the program for 15 EV infrastructure projects that were held up after Trump’s order. The governor’s office said several projects were “located in the congressional district that now-Secretary Duffy used to represent in the U.S. Congress.”
Trump’s order stated that it was written to eliminate an “electric vehicle (EV) mandate.” No such mandate exists, the lawsuit points out.
“But in the name of eliminating this fictional mandate, the Executive Order directs the Federal Highway Administration … to usurp the legislative and spending powers reserved to Congress by withholding congressionally appropriated funding for electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure required by statute to be distributed to States,” the lawsuit states.

Derrick Van Orden receives the endorsement of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden says he’s working on a proposal that would alter two current work authorization programs to make it easier for businesses including farms and hotels to hire immigrant workers. 
Van Orden, who sits on the House agriculture committee, told the news outlet NOTUS that he’s working with Trump administration officials on a proposal to alter the H-2A and H-2B visa programs. Both programs currently provide temporary work visas for people working seasonally. 
The H-2A program, which is targeted at seasonal farm labor, has frustrated Wisconsin dairy farmers because year-round workers, including in dairy, are not eligible for the program. Immigrant workers comprise an estimated 70% of the labor force on Wisconsin dairy farms. 
“Rocks are heavy. Trees are made of wood. Gravity is real. There’s 20 million illegal aliens here that have been floating agriculture, hospitality and construction for decades, and we need their labor,” Van Orden told NOTUS.
Van Orden said the proposal is in line with the Trump administration’s increased immigration enforcement efforts because it doesn’t offer a pathway to citizenship or encourage an increase in unauthorized crossings of the border while making it easier for people to come to the U.S. to work. 
“That’s why people come here illegally, because it’s so hard to come here legally,” Van Orden said. “We’re all working towards the goal of making sure that our economy can maintain its relevancy.”

Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)This story was first published by WyoFile on May 7, 2025.
A grizzly death attributed to a fatal vehicle strike has triggered an outpouring of rage on social media about people driving too fast, but law enforcement could not determine whether speed was a factor in the collision.
The bear that died, Grizzly 1058, is one of the famous “quads” of their even more famous mom, Grizzly 399, who died last year after being fatally struck by a vehicle on a highway south of Jackson.
Grizzly Bear 399 lived to old age because we made room for her. She died because we’re in her wilds

In the death of Grizzly 399, authorities ruled that the driver was not speeding.

As for Grizzly 1058, “law enforcement rangers were not able to determine if speed was a factor” in the collision, Grand Teton National Park spokeswoman Emily Davis said in an email Wednesday.
 Grand Teton National Park officials urge visitors to watch out for wildlife

Nonetheless, park officials asked people to slow down and be vigilant for wildlife in a Tuesday news release confirming the bear’s death.
While reducing speeds can help protect wildlife along Wyoming highways, it’s not the only factor setting the stage for fatal collisions.
“It’s terribly unfortunate that this happened,” said Brian DeBolt, large carnivore conflict coordinator with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “But it’s becoming all too common with these bears that spend so much time roadside.”
The more time bears hang out near roads, the higher the probability that they’re going to be struck and killed by a vehicle, DeBolt said. Game and Fish is finding that younger bears, like the 5-year-old subadult found Tuesday, are being forced to make a living in more marginal habitat along roadsides because more prime habitat is already occupied.
What park officials have confirmed so far is that Grizzly 1058 had been spotted in the park since he and his three siblings split from their mom in 2022. But there were no confirmed sightings of him this spring, the park release said.
Park law enforcement found the bear’s remains Tuesday in a patch of willows about 125 yards from the highway, within park boundaries east of the Buffalo Fork River. The Jackson Hole News&Guide reported that a law enforcement ranger found the dead bear after spotting ravens and eagles scavenging along the highway and stopping to investigate. The park bear biologist told the News&Guide the animal had likely been there for several days.

The park relied on ear tags and a “PIT” tag to identify the 5-year-old bear, which the park release said “appeared to be in good condition for his age and the time of year.”
 More to it than speed to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions

The outer park highway sees more diverse traffic — including commuters and semis — and higher speed limits than the inner park road. Just up the highway on Togwotee Pass, where vehicles have struck roadside grizzlies, wildlife managers and law enforcement have struggled to manage traffic jams created by bear watchers.

As more bears live roadside, and get habituated to people, the more risk of collisions, DeBolt said Wednesday. “We don’t want bears to be so comfortable roadside,” he added.
The speed limit on Togwotee Pass is 55 miles per hour, but once drivers cross into Grand Teton National Park, there is a nighttime speed limit of 45 mph on that same highway. Safety concerns along that highway, where it crosses through the Bridger-Teton National Forest, prompted one retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent to propose a “grizzly bear speed limit,” using variable speed limits similar to how the state handles blizzards on the interstate.
“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know, when the bears are around the highway,” said Steve Stoinski, a retired Fish and Wildlife Service agent who spent a summer managing bear traffic jams on Togwotee Pass.
But that speed limit would only work with regular enforcement, Stoinski told WyoFile.
DeBolt said he’d be open to reducing speed limits if it would reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and was reasonable and logistically possible. But setting speed limits is not Game and Fish’s call to make. DeBolt also sees larger factors at play.
“Although it seems like maybe a simple fix,” DeBolt said. “It’s not that simple.”
Inside Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks where reduced speed limits are enforced, wildlife still die in vehicle strikes, DeBolt said.

On Thursday, the New Mexico Economic Development Department awarded more than $2.3 million to 15 outdoors projects, including a mountain bike jump park in Santa Rosa, restoration of Gila trails burned by wildfire and a children’s garden in Santa Fe.
The projects span 14 counties and promote outdoor access and conservation stewardship, Outdoor Recreation Division Director Karina Armijo said in a statement to Source NM.
“The Trails+ Grant program is increasing safe and inclusive outdoor access, especially in rural and historically underserved communities,” Armijo said. “It’s boosting local economies and is a long-term investment in quality of life for all New Mexicans.”
In total, the Outdoor Recreation Division has spent more than $28.7 million from the Trails Grant+ fund on 221 projects since the program started in 2020.
Elias Quinn, a mountain biker and member of Los Senderos de Guadalupe, told Source NM the nearly $100,000 grant will be used to plan and design a mountain bike park and trail system in an underserved part of the state.
“I just felt like there was a missed opportunity for Santa Rosa, just off Interstate 40, lots of people are stopping at the lakes,” he told Source NM. “I felt like a bike park could help attract more tourists.”
Àngel Peña, executive director for Nuestra Tierra Conservation Project in Las Cruces, told Source NM his group will use the $75,000 state grant to restore trails and start a community education program in the La Mancha Wetlands. The nonprofit has owned the four-acre area, which has water in pools year-round, for several years.
“We’ve been doing what we can on a shoestring budget, and this is really the first real investment we’ve been able to secure for the specific project,” Peña said. “The state is truly investing in its local community down here.”
The grant will also help develop a resource management plan, Peña said, and then aid trail crews to start building new paths for youth hiking programs.
A new round of Trails+ Grant funding will open later this year on July 1, for $11.6 million in funding available. The state agency has more information about applications on its webpage at  www.NMOutside.com.

Attorneys for inmate Mikal Mahdi claim bullets mostly missed his heart during his execution last month. (Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Bullets mostly missed an inmate’s heart during the state’s last execution by firing squad, attorneys for condemned inmates claimed in a Thursday letter to the state Supreme Court.
The court filing doesn’t ask the state’s highest court to take any action. Attorneys felt “obliged to share this information” with justices and other condemned men offered the option to die by firing squad, according to the letter, filed as a “notice of botched execution.”
Three members of the media who witnessed the April 11 execution said Mahdi groaned and continued to breathe after the bullets struck him, then continued to let out periodic low moans for about 45 seconds. A doctor declared him dead about a minute after marksmen fired.
“The autopsy confirms what I saw and heard,” David Weiss, who witnessed Mahdi’s execution, said in a statement. “Mikal suffered an excruciating death. We don’t know what went wrong, but nothing about his execution was humane.”
SC executes second death row inmate by firing squad

Under the state’s protocol, when an inmate is executed by firing squad, three marksmen fire live rounds at a target over the heart of the condemned inmate, who is strapped to a chair about 15 feet away.
Mahdi’s chest had only two gunshot wounds, unlike the three that were clear in Brad Sigmon’s chest following his March 7 execution by firing squad.
The doctor performing the autopsy reported that to a corrections official, who suggested the third bullet might have struck the same place as another, leading to only two entrance wounds, according to an autopsy report.
That possibility is “extraordinarily uncommon,” wrote Jonathan Arden, a pathologist hired by inmates’ attorneys to analyze the autopsy’s findings.
Where else the third bullet may have gone is unclear. The two that did strike Mahdi appeared to have hit his chest below the heart, causing more damage to his liver and pancreas than the heart itself, Arden wrote.
That’s also in contrast to Sigmon’s autopsy, which showed the bullets destroyed his heart, according to the report.
It’s likely Mahdi “did experience excruciating conscious pain and suffering” for up to a minute after he was shot, Arden wrote. An inmate struck directly in the heart should die within 15 seconds, he added.
“The implications of this botch are horrifying,” the Thursday court filing reads.
Attorneys also raised questions about the autopsy itself.
Mahdi’s autopsy included no close-up photos of the gunshot wounds or X-rays that might show their path, and the doctor performing the autopsy didn’t examine or document his clothing, which might have given more information about the wounds, Arden wrote.
Sigmon’s autopsy did include those details, according to the report.
“Such rigorous documentation is especially critical for deaths that carry special interest or importance, such as homicides and deaths in custody, both of which pertain to the death of Mr. Mahdi,” Arden wrote.
Attorneys have also raised concerns about executions by lethal injection. Autopsies showed that inmates’ lungs filled with fluid as they died, and they laid on the table for upwards of 20 minutes before being declared dead. Media witnesses reported that inmates stopped breathing after several minutes in each case.
Mahdi was sentenced to death in 2006 for a crime spree committed two years prior, in which he shot Capt. James Myers, an Orangeburg public safety officer, to death with his own gun after hiding out from police in Myers’ shed.
Mahdi also shot gas station clerk Christopher Boggs to death in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and stole multiple cars during his 10-day flight from Virginia to Florida.
His execution was the fifth in the state since September, when the state resumed carrying out death sentences after an unintended 13-year hiatus. He was the second to choose to die by firing squad in state history after legislators added it as an option in 2021.
Another inmate, Stephen Stanko, is expected to be scheduled for execution in the coming weeks after running out of appeals in one of the two killings for which he was sentenced to death.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-08 14:09:14.658531

(Screenshot courtesy of the Lea County Board of County Commissioners)Local officials said Thursday they don’t know what will happen to a private prison in southeast New Mexico set to close this summer, but the company running it has expressed interest to the federal government in converting it into an immigration detention center.
The Lea County Correctional Facility in Hobbs is owned and operated by private prison company GEO Group, which holds people convicted under state law and in New Mexico Corrections Department custody.
In January, GEO Group officials told the Lea County Commission they don’t intend to extend the company’s agreement beyond Nov. 24, 2025, according to a letter read by County Attorney John Caldwell during the Lea County Commission’s regular meeting on Thursday. 
GEO Group and the state have been “unable to reach a decision” in negotiations, Caldwell said, after the company on April 21 offered to sell it to the Corrections Department for $175 million. GEO Group had previously offered to sell the prison to the county and the state government for $240 million, he said.
GEO Group on May 1 informed its 203 workers, the county, the state Department of Workforce Solutions and Hobbs Mayor Sam Cobb that it would stop operating the prison on June 30, Caldwell said.
Then last week, the New Mexico Corrections Department told the county it would stop sending incarcerated people to the prison and would transfer everyone currently held there to other prisons by June 30, he said.
As to whether anyone else has expressed interest in taking over the prison, Caldwell said that in his discussions with GEO, “I know that they have spoken with the federal government, but nothing specific.”
GEO Group mentioned the Lea County Correctional Facility in response to an ICE request for information last September as one that “might be available for ICE use.” The American Civil Liberties Union obtained the document via a Freedom of Information Act request.
ACLU filed the FOIA request in August 2024 and a month later sued to force ICE to hand over the records. ICE in April released the document mentioning the Lea County prison — along with other records showing CoreCivic’s interest in renewing the migrant detention contract for the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia.
“The documents received provide important details regarding what we have long feared – a massive expansion of ICE detention facilities nationwide in an effort to further the Trump administration’s dystopian plans to deport our immigrant neighbors and loved ones,” ACLU National Prison Project Senior Staff Attorney Eunice Cho said in a statement. “This expansion is a disastrous waste of billions of taxpayer dollars that will only line the coffers of the private prison industry.”
The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic, Stateline reports.
Source NM has asked spokespeople for ICE and GEO Group whether the agency intends to detain people at the prison in Hobbs and will update this story if a response is received.

Andy Beshear, two potential Democratic candidates for president 2028, will headline the Florida Democratic Party’s (FDP) annual Leadership Blue Gala next month at the Seminole Hard Rock in Hollywood, officials announced Thursday.
Booker, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, made history last month when he stood on the Senate floor and gave a 25-hour speech protesting the actions of the Trump administration. It was the longest floor speech in the history of the U.S. Senate.
Beshear is the popular two-term governor of Kentucky who has shown an ability as a Democrat to win in a red state. He is believed to be seriously considering a run for president in 2028.
“Senator Booker and Governor Beshear are two of the brightest starts of today’s Democratic Party, and their visit to Florida is more proof of the party’s commitment to the future of our state and the importance of the South,” said FDP Chair Nikki Fried in a written statement.
The event is considered the FDP’s premier fundraising event of the year. It will take place with the party once again back on its heels following the defection two weeks ago of one of its legislative leaders, South Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo, who turned independent, saying that the state party was “dead.”
The Republican Party of Florida is holding its Florida Freedom Forum on Aug. 2 at the Rosen Shingle Creek Hotel in Orlando, which will feature U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, among others.
The FDP’s Leadership Blue Weekend is scheduled to take place from June 20-June 22.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)In a dramatic late-night vote that capped more than a year of escalating infighting, the Republican Party’s 2nd Congressional District Committee voted Wednesday to remove Laura Hughes as chairwoman of the Virginia Beach GOP, accusing her of mismanagement and failing to perform her duties. 
But Hughes says the move was political payback — and an affront to the grassroots Republicans who elected her. 
“This was a ‘screw you’ to the Virginia Beach voters,” she said of her detractors’ actions in a phone interview Thursday, “because they wanted this small little group who likes to stay in charge, and they installed a chair that will do their bidding. And I am most likely going to file an appeal with the state Republican party.” 
The 11-4 vote took place after four hours of closed-door deliberations at the Chesapeake GOP office, with 15 ballots cast, including five by proxy. The use of proxies and the closed nature of the meeting drew swift criticism from more than 50 Hughes supporters gathered outside, who said the decision undermined transparency and local control.
“It was a difficult decision,” Dennis Free, chair of the 2nd District Committee, told The Virginian-Pilot after emerging from the meeting around 11 p.m. He did not respond to requests for further comment Thursday.
The committee unanimously appointed Larry Lane as interim chair, a decision that must still be ratified by the full Virginia Beach Republican Committee on Monday.
Hughes, who was elected in March 2024 by a margin of 95 votes at a standing-room-only mass meeting of over 1,100 Republicans, said that her ouster was not about performance, but about control.

“This, in my opinion, is something they’ve been working on for quite some time,” she said. “There have been irregular elections (for local party chair) going on in Virginia Beach for years, and they finally lost one. The Virginia Beach voters spoke regarding the chair race, and this took it out of their hands.”
But Bruce Meyer, vice chair of the 2nd District GOP Committee and a vocal critic of Hughes’ leadership, said the vote was based on a pattern of dysfunction that began months into her tenure. 
“Laura’s removal was massively performance-based,” Meyer said. “Between the precinct operations that were a disaster and the financial books — my God, how many organizations would tolerate not having a treasurer’s report in eight months?”
Meyer cited the resignation of Hughes’ secretary and treasurer last summer as signs of internal collapse, and said the party was still missing finance reports and meeting minutes months later. 
“In October, we had a meeting and we’re missing full finance reports and minutes, and there’s a lot of concerns about precinct operations being a disaster,” he said. “(U.S. Rep.) Jen Kiggans’ campaign had to kick in and take over probably 80% of our precinct operations, which is unheard of.”
Hughes forcefully disputed Meyer’s characterization. 
“I would not call what Bruce says an honest assessment,” she said. “And it’s interesting because one of the things I’ve said consistently is that Bruce was running the party through the previous chair, and he has said as much to other people. And now they’ve installed a new chair. ”
The clash over party finances was central to Hughes’ term. After discovering the committee had not conducted an audit since 2014, she said she repeatedly requested access to financial documents but was stonewalled by the former treasurer. Her push for a review eventually led the state party to step in — but only after she signed a non-disclosure agreement to view the findings.
Meyer argued that Hughes not only mishandled the process but also overstepped her authority.

“She tries to bring the city auditor into it, but doesn’t give him all the information,” he said. “She wasn’t given authority to share financial records with an outside person.” He said the state GOP’s audit committee — which included no Hampton Roads members — conducted a full review and found structural problems dating back years.
The state party’s report, Meyer said, confirmed what many already suspected. “It was totally objective. And they found a lot of bad issues,” he said.
Hughes has long maintained the review was used as political leverage. “Let’s call this what it is: a political hit job disguised as a procedure,” she wrote in a Facebook post last week.
Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake told The Mercury earlier this week that he was concerned about the optics and timing of the conflict. 
“In my tenure as RPV chairman, the last thing I want to have happen are intra-party fights,” he said. “I don’t think it is good for the party to try and remove people that have been elected unless there’s a crime.”
Meyer acknowledged Peake’s point but said the district committee had little choice. 
“This is really the last resort,” he said. “The organization’s controls were such a disaster — such a dumpster fire — that if we didn’t act, we’d be in deep trouble in November.”
He added that Lane has already presented a plan to rebuild the city’s precinct operations and that many members — including elected officials — support the change. “You’re going to have some people upset,” he said. “But there are hundreds who are not.”

Durante años, los legisladores han estado trabajando en los detalles de un plan para cambiar la forma en que los municipios de Connecticut evalúan el valor de los vehículos motorizados a efectos fiscales.
Una ley de 2022 exige que los municipios de Connecticut utilicen el precio de venta sugerido por el fabricante (MSRP, por sus siglas en inglés) en lugar del sistema de valoración de la Asociación Nacional de Concesionarios de Automóviles para determinar el valor de los vehículos. La ley busca que la valoración de los vehículos sea más predecible y uniforme a medida que envejecen.
Pero ahora que el cambio entró en vigor, algunos funcionarios municipales afirmaron que están recaudando menos dinero y que están aumentando sus tasas impositivas para compensar la pérdida.
Los legisladores ajustaron la ley durante una sesión especial durante el verano y, en respuesta a las preocupaciones de los municipios, la modificaron de nuevo con un proyecto de ley con certificación de emergencia al comienzo de esta sesión legislativa. Aun así, algunos legisladores quieren eliminar gradualmente el impuesto a los vehículos por completo.
Esto es lo que necesitas saber sobre los cambios.
¿Cómo afecta esto a mis impuestos?
Es probable que el valor de los vehículos de la mayoría de las personas sea menor, lo que reduciría sus impuestos. El precio de venta sugerido por el fabricante también tiene un calendario de depreciación de 20 años, a diferencia del de la Asociación Nacional de Concesionarios de Automóviles, que fluctúa más.
Esto significa que los propietarios de automóviles podrán predecir mejor el importe de sus futuras facturas de impuestos sobre vehículos, en función de la antigüedad de su vehículo.
El nuevo sistema de valoración de vehículos es menos susceptible a las fluctuaciones del mercado. El cambio busca evitar grandes fluctuaciones, como la que muchos experimentaron durante la pandemia, cuando el precio de los vehículos y el coste del impuesto sobre vehículos se dispararon.
¿Qué significa esto para mi municipio?
Los municipios han informado que el cambio ha supuesto importantes descensos en sus listas generales, es decir, en el valor total de las propiedades imponibles del municipio. El municipio recibe un porcentaje de ese valor como ingresos fiscales, que utiliza para financiar proyectos y programas municipales como el presupuesto escolar, las carreteras, los sistemas de agua y las bibliotecas. Algunos municipios han aumentado sus tasas impositivas para compensar la diferencia, lo que significa que los impuestos prediales podrían aumentar el próximo año.
¿Qué ha hecho la legislatura?
Los legisladores estatales han trabajado en este tema durante años.
Cuando la ley de 2022 exigió que los municipios utilizaran el precio de venta sugerido por el fabricante (MSRP), la lista comenzaba con una valoración del 80% para vehículos de hasta un año de antigüedad, lo que significa que se reduce al 80% de su valor original ese año.
Pero los legisladores afirmaron que necesitaban realizar correcciones a la ley antes de que entrara en vigor en octubre de 2024. Se reunieron en junio en una sesión extraordinaria para realizar cambios técnicos a la ley, incluyendo el inicio del programa de depreciación con una valoración del 85% para vehículos de hasta un año de antigüedad, lo que reduciría el impacto en los presupuestos municipales.
Pero tras la entrada en vigor de la ley en julio, algunos municipios se quejaron de que sus presupuestos habían sufrido pérdidas excesivas. En febrero, los legisladores respondieron a las preocupaciones aprobando un proyecto de ley con certificación de emergencia que permitía a los municipios optar por establecer el programa de depreciación a partir del 90% del valor original, en lugar del 85%. Desde entonces, varios municipios han decidido aplicar esta disposición y modificar sus programas.
La mayoría de los demócratas han apoyado los cambios, afirmando que ayudarán a los municipios a planificar mejor sus presupuestos y a reducir los impuestos sobre los vehículos para la población. Algunos señalaron que no era suficiente y que Connecticut debería eliminar por completo el impuesto sobre vehículos.
Varios republicanos se opusieron a la medida y expresaron su preocupación por las pérdidas excesivas que los municipios podrían generar con el nuevo sistema.
¿Qué está pasando ahora con el impuesto sobre vehículos?
Los políticos de Connecticut llevan décadas hablando de lo que consideran problemas con el sistema de impuestos sobre vehículos. Dado que cada uno de los 169 municipios del estado tiene diferentes tasas impositivas, los residentes pagan cantidades distintas por los mismos vehículos según su lugar de residencia.
A menudo, esto ha significado que quienes viven en ciudades que suelen tener tasas impositivas más altas, pagan más impuestos sobre vehículos que quienes viven en zonas residenciales más adineradas. Legisladores y gobernadores han manifestado su deseo de cambiar esta situación. 
El senador MD Rahman, Demócrata por Manchester, ha trabajado durante las últimas dos sesiones legislativas en proyectos de ley que eliminarían por completo el impuesto a los automóviles. Ahora trabaja en una forma de eliminarlo gradualmente, aunque los detalles de ese plan aún no están claros, ya que los legisladores aún están negociando la redacción, con el objetivo de aprobar un plan en esta sesión.

Martin Heinrich questioned USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday regarding the potential closure of a dispatch center that handles responses to wildfires in the Gila National Forest. (Photo courtesy Heinrich's office)U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) questioned the nation’s agriculture secretary Wednesday about the potential closure of a key wildfire dispatch center in the Gila National Forest that remains on a list of lease cancellations the so-called Department of Government Efficiency announced earlier this year.
The Silver City Dispatch Center handles communications and resource orders, among other duties, to ensure small wildfire starts in the fire-prone Gila National Forest do not burn out of control. It’s housed in the Gila National Forest’s 29,000-square-foot supervisor’s office in Silver City, an office whose lease could be canceled in the name of federal cost-cutting measures.
Congressional staffers and Forest Service employees have raised alarm about the potential closure, particularly in the remote Gila, because it’s not clear where else in the area would be suitable.
‘It’s bad’: How drought, lack of snowpack and federal cuts could spell wildfire disaster in NM

Heinrich opened his questioning yesterday during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee meeting by asking USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins about the center. His office previously told Source New Mexico that Heinrich had received “assurances” the office would remain open, but that official word would have to come from the federal General Services Administration, which holds the leases. 
“In our conversations, you assured me that you would seek to keep this dispatch center open, that you would designate it ‘mission critical,’” Heinrich said to Rollins. “Talk to me about what you are doing to make good on that promise.”
Rollins said her agency has been “in conversation with” the GSA regarding the center, but did not provide any status updates.
“We agree that this is important and, especially as wildfire season is heating up, ensuring that we are operationally ready at every turn in your state and in other states that are highly affected by that,” she said. “So we remain focused on that, and if you hear something different, please call me.”
A GSA spokesperson Thursday referred comment back to the USDA about the status of the lease, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The spokesperson also said the administration is “reviewing all options to optimize the federal footprint and building utilization.” 
The GSA spokesperson, while not mentioning the dispatch center lease directly, also said the administration is “actively managing lease contracts,” which allows it to work with agencies on their longer-term needs and possibly negotiate better rent prices.
Brace for a bleak water year on top of ‘nightmare’ fire weather season

Heinrich, in his question to Rollins, cited the ongoing Iron Fire in the Gila. That fire ignited Sunday afternoon and has burned, according to the latest figures, 822 acres. Dispatchers coordinated the response of more than 180 personnel to the fire, including two helicopters, two engines and two Hotshot teams. 
As of Thursday, the fire is 10% contained with reduced smoke activity. Investigators have determined lightning caused the fire, and crews are focused on mopping up hot spots and strengthening containment lines. 
The fire ignited in a remote area within the 2012 Whitewater Baldy Fire burn scar and is burning in grass, as well as heavy dead and downed fuel and timber, according to an update from the Gila National Forest.
The fire occurs in an area where snowpack is far below normal, including some areas in Southwestern New Mexico where it is 0% of the median snowpack that accumulated there between 1991 and 2020. 
‘Stonewalling’: Forest Service mum on firings during wildfire briefing for congressional staff

According to the May national wildfire outlook from the National Interagency Fire Center, citing drought and other factors, all of Southwestern New Mexico should expect above-normal fire conditions. The outlook for much of the rest of the state has improved to normal, however, according to the outlook.
In addition to the dangerous conditions and threatened closure of the dispatch center, more than 25 people who work in the Gila National Forest were fired earlier this year as part of federal cost-cutting measures. It’s not clear how many of them returned to work due to federal orders or how many are on administrative leave.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/heinrich.png,,,2025-05-08 14:09:14.658531

(Kentucky Department of Corrections)A federal court denied an appeal from one of Kentucky’s inmates serving decades on death row.
Eighteen judges of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied an appeal from Benny Lee Hodge, 73, who was convicted in 1986 of killing 23-year-old Tammy Acker and attacking her father, Dr. Roscoe Acker, in Letcher County. Hodge was sentenced to death for Tammy Acker’s murder and 60 years’ imprisonment for non-capital charges. 
  Benny Ray Hodge (kentucky.gov)
A  three-judge panel overturned the sentence last year. But in a 14-4 decision issued by the court Wednesday, judges upheld Hodges’ sentence. Kentucky Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman had asked the appellate court to reconsider the case, which it did in a special sitting of all judges on the court. 
“We are not deciding the issues in this case on direct appeal. Instead, we review the Kentucky Supreme Court’s decision through the lens of AEDPA (Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996) and respect the boundaries of our authority under the statute,” says the opinion, written by Judge John K. Bush, who is from Kentucky and was appointed by President Donald Trump. “That means stepping in only when a state court unreasonably interprets or applies U.S. Supreme Court precedent, or unreasonably determines facts. The Kentucky Supreme Court did neither of those things here.” 
Coleman is seeking to restart executions in Kentucky. The state has not carried out a death sentence since November 2008. In 2010, Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd blocked the planned execution of Gregory Wilson after finding the lethal injection protocol was inconsistent with state law and lacked safe­guards to pre­vent executing someone who is intel­lec­tu­al­ly dis­abled or crim­i­nal­ly insane. Gov. Matt Bevin later commuted Wilson’s death sentence. Coleman contends regulatory changes have brought the protocol into compliance with the 2010 ruling. But the state Supreme Court last year rejected a filing by Coleman and left the matter with the circuit court. Last week, Shepherd ruled in a case involving Hodge and others on death row that Coleman’s motion “is not ripe for adjudication.” 
“The Commonwealth has not shown that the 2010 injunction is preventing it from taking any specific action to implement the death penalty,” Shepherd wrote. “If and when the Commonwealth shows it is actively seeking to take specific steps to implement the death penalty with regard to any specific death sentenced inmate, the Commonwealth should present that matter to the Court, and the Court will address whether the injunction wrongfully prevents the Commonwealth from taking those specific actions, or whether the injunction even applies to the Commonwealth’s actions.” 
Kentucky death row inmates spend years waiting for executions that aren’t coming

In a news release about the Hodge decision at the federal level, Coleman called Hodge a “brutal murderer” who “has tried to escape justice, hoping that we would eventually give up and forget about this case” for almost four decades. 
Tawny Acker, Tammy’s sister, in a statement thanked Coleman and his staff “for their excellent preparation and presentation to uphold the sentencing of a cold-blooded murderer” before the appellate court. 
An attorney for Hodge did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Thursday morning. 
Some Kentucky Republicans have sought to abolish the death penalty. Earlier this year, Rep. James Tipton, of Taylorsville, filed legislation to replace the death penalty with life imprisonment without parole, but it did not receive a committee hearing. However, the GOP-controlled legislature passed an omnibus crime law in 2024 that included expanding crimes that could warrant the death penalty, particularly in cases where a person is convicted of intentionally causing the death of a first responder.

BROOKWOOD — The Trump administration has announced it will aim to fast track the permitting and environmental review of a major coal mine expansion in central Alabama as part of a larger effort to accelerate the construction of what the government has labeled “critical mineral” infrastructure.
While administration officials said the change is aimed at “significantly reduc[ing] our reliance on foreign nations,” coal produced as part of Warrior Met’s expansion in Alabama is almost entirely exported overseas to support foreign steelmaking markets, according to the company.
Warrior Met’s Blue Creek mine expansion, set to be one of the largest coal build-outs in Alabama history, is one of 20 planned developments deemed “transparency projects” by the administration over the last two months. The mine expansion will be placed on the federal government’s permitting dashboard as it moves its way through the regulatory and permitting process.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The projects’ inclusion on the dashboard authorized under the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST) will, according to the Trump administration, “make the environmental review and authorizations schedule for these vital mineral production projects publicly available and allow all of these projects to benefit from increased transparency.
“The public nature of the dashboard ensures that all stakeholders, from project sponsors and community members to federal agency leaders have up-to-date accounting of where each project stands in the review process,” the administration said in its announcement. “This transparency leads to greater accountability, ensuring a more efficient process.”
During the Biden administration, the so-called FAST-41 dashboard was used to fast-track projects aimed at benefiting tribal nations, as well as various projects advancing renewable energy, coastal restoration, broadband and electricity transmission sectors. The program was created as a means “to enhance transparency and increase the efficiency of the permitting process,” the Biden administration said at the time. With a new president, though, the programs designated to participate in the program—and the policy priorities they represent—have now changed.
The Trump administration has already signaled its support of the Alabama project. In April, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum visited an existing Warrior Met mine outside Tuscaloosa and took a windshield tour of the Blue Creek facility currently under construction.

During that visit, Burgum emphasized the administration’s stated commitment to fossil fuel production and said that its actions would “unleash American energy.” He did not acknowledge Warrior Met’s checkered safety and environmental record or that nearly all of its product—metallurgical coal—is shipped overseas for foreign steelmaking operations, not used in the U.S.
“We sell substantially all of our steelmaking coal production to steel producers outside of the United States,” a recent Warrior Met corporate filing said. “For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our geographic customer mix was 37% in Europe, 43% in Asia, and 20% in South America.”
The planned expansion of Blue Creek involves a major build-out of Warrior Met’s ability to mine for underground coal using the longwall method, a particularly destructive form of mining in which large machines shear walls of coal, leaving vast, empty expanses in their wake. Land above those empty caverns sinks, causing what is often permanent damage to the surface and structures there.
Longwall mining has devastated communities in Alabama and beyond. In March 2024, an Alabama home exploded above a longwall mine with a different owner after methane—a gas released during mining—seeped into the residence and ignited. The resulting blast killed an Alabama grandfather and seriously injured his grandson. Since then, the community above the Oak Grove mine in western Jefferson County has continued to crumble, homes’ foundations cracking as the longwall mine expands below. 
Earlier this year, just as President Donald Trump was announcing efforts to promote “clean, beautiful coal,” a West Virginia woman was hospitalized after a methane explosion in her home atop a longwall mine left her seriously injured. Workers from the mine beneath her home had stood behind Trump during his White House announcement.
Once completed, Warrior Met’s Blue Creek expansion will increase the company’s coal production by 60 percent, providing additional supply for overseas steelmaking markets hungry for met coal that can meet production needs. Taxpayer-funded support for the facility may top $400 million.
The company has also asked the federal government to allow it to mine publicly owned coal as part of the Blue Creek project. The federal Bureau of Land Management announced last year that it would conduct an environmental assessment related to Warrior Met’s Blue Creek project and, specifically, its proposal to mine 14,040 acres of federal minerals underlying privately owned land in Tuscaloosa County. Warrior Met’s applications to lease the coal rights propose the extraction of approximately 57.5 million tons of recoverable public coal reserves.
Initial government scoping documents indicated that any environmental assessment of the Blue Creek project would include an analysis of its impact on climate change, both direct and indirect. Since those initial documents were released, however, federal guidance on the inclusion of climate change considerations in government decision-making has been in flux.
A day one executive order by Trump, for example, disbanded the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which was established pursuant to a Biden executive order. The order said “any guidance, instruction, recommendation, or document issued by the IWG is withdrawn as no longer representative of governmental policy.”
That guidance had emphasized the importance of government analysis of the social cost of carbon, a way of putting a dollar figure on the economic damage that comes from emitting a ton of carbon dioxide. The Trump White House has said without evidence that the concept “is marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.”
Public comments on the project already submitted to BLM included concerns around greenhouse gas emissions and Warrior Met’s contribution to the climate crisis.
“Please do not approve any new or expanded coal mining,” one commenter wrote. “The climate crisis is already deadly and rapidly getting worse. There is an overwhelming international consensus on the severity of this crisis and the urgent need to phase out the use of harmful fossil fuels.”
The draft environmental impact statement for the Blue Creek project, originally set to be released sometime in the fall, is now scheduled to be published on May 30, according to BLM.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-08 16:59:54+00:00,CT Mirror,Secretary of the State aims to make voting easier for incarcerated people in CT,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/08/ct-incarcerated-voting-absentee-ballots/,"A bill would require absentee ballot application forms be distributed in correctional facilities, but some say it wouldn't go far enough.","Advocates for incarcerated individuals in Connecticut say it needs to be easier for people in custody to cast their ballots. And while a bill being considered in the legislature seeks to expand access, some say it wouldn’t go far enough. 
The proposed bill which passed out of committee in March and awaits a vote in the House, would require the Secretary of the State to provide the Department of Correction with absentee ballot application forms that eligible individuals in custody could fill out, and to distribute them to those people. 
“It is the very least we can do to chip away at this problem,” Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas said during a forum at the Capitol on Tuesday.
An incarcerated person who wants to vote in Connecticut has to do so by absentee ballot, and they remain voters in the town they last resided, not where the prison is located. Thomas explained that this means incarcerated people — who have no access to the internet — must research the name of their town clerks, write a letter to the clerk requesting an absentee ballot application form, mail that letter to the town, receive the application form, fill it out, mail it back, and wait for the absentee ballot itself to arrive.
“And hopefully this all happens by 8 p.m. on Election Day,” Thomas said.
Absentee ballots are only available 31 days before a general election, Thomas said, and the slow speed of the postal system often prevents the ballots from arriving in time to be counted by a town clerk. 
Only people convicted of a felony lose their right to vote in Connecticut — and only while they’re incarcerated. People convicted of a misdemeanor, or people awaiting trial who can’t afford to post bail, retain their voting rights. According to Department of Correction statistics, about 3,800 of the 11,200 people incarcerated in Connecticut have not been sentenced. 
Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, chair of the Government Administration and Elections Committee, said the bill was developed in collaboration with the Secretary of the State’s Office and in discussion with advocates. 
“Obviously with legislation like this, there’s always a balance between trying to provide as much access as possible to the voters and the logistical details which need to be practicable and communicable,” Blumenthal said.  
Avery Gilbert, a clinical lecturer at Yale Law School, said the state’s voting restrictions for people convicted of felonies should be revisited, too. Some of those individuals who’ve completed their sentences remain afraid to vote, even after the right is restored. 
Gilbert also said simply providing absentee ballot applications to incarcerated individuals isn’t enough because the bill doesn’t require the Department of Correction to distribute the applications — and it doesn’t cover the cost of postage. 
“Simply putting absentee ballot applications in facilities is a nice first start. There’s no guarantee that those are going to be handed out. There’s no guarantee that someone is going to be informed enough to know to put it in the envelope, have the resources to get the postage, mail it, and do all those things in a timely fashion,” Gilbert said. 
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, said he opposed the bill — and he voted against it — because he’s concerned about simply giving absentee ballot applications to the Department of Correction to distribute. “I think that there’s an opportunity for abuse there,” Sampson said. 
Sampson said in similar situations where a large number of voters is living in one place, such as with a nursing home, a local registrar of voters would go in person to the facility to distribute absentee ballots. 
Thomas it was difficult to offer in-person voting at a correctional institution, since Democrat and Republican registrars of voters from multiple towns would have to be at the correctional facilities to oversee the process.
Sampson said he believed incarcerated people should instead vote in the town where the correctional facility was located, rather than their hometown.
Blumenthal said while he understands the bill isn’t a “panacea,” legislators are waiting to see how the new absentee ballot application regulations work before making additional demands on the Department of Correction. 
“Before we require DOC to take specific action, I think we want to see how this process works on a voluntary basis in terms of DOC’s involvement,” Blumenthal said. 
The bill does require Department of Correction staff to ensure absentee ballots are delivered to each incarcerated person even if they’ve been transferred to another facility in the system.
Blumenthal added that some advocates had also expressed concern around DOC staff forcing people in custody to vote rather than just assisting them. And he said he feared covering the cost of postage might make the bill less likely to pass at a time when state finances are limited.
Thomas said her office has created printed and digital materials for incarcerated individuals describing the voting process, and she said her office is working with DOC to schedule voter registration drives at different prison facilities through the remainder of the spring, summer and fall.  
Gilbert said that communities with the highest rates of incarceration, like Hartford and Bridgeport, also have the lowest numbers of people voting. 
“These are habits, they are behaviors, and they inform and impact generational poverty for years to come,” she said. “I don’t think anybody in this room would disagree that all children’s interests should be represented in some way, and incarcerated parents don’t have that opportunity to influence resources going to their children’s schools, to influence the issues that matter deeply to their community.” 
James Jeter, the executive director of the Full Citizens Coalition to Unlock the Vote, echoed Gilbert, saying that many people he knew from his time being incarcerated hadn’t even thought about voting. He blamed this partially on the policy of eliminating the right to vote for people convicted of felonies during their time in prison. 
“When you talk about civic engagement and even real forms of rehabilitation, how do you make someone more communal and civically minded when conditions that are completely results of policy decisions have really not allowed them to?” he said. “The degradation of levels of poverty in this state don’t allow people to think as a community. They just think about surviving.” 
And he added that if one generation in a family hasn’t made a habit of voting, the younger generations tend not to either.
Thomas said she knew simply showing up with absentee ballot application forms wasn’t going to be enough to convince people to vote. She said her office has uploaded civics information and a voter guide to the tablets incarcerated people use to communicate. 
“Yes, we need to look at access to the actual ballot, but I also believe that we need to look more closely at — how do you offset this lack of belief that your voice even has agency?” said Thomas. “I hope the legislature will take that up in addition to providing access in future sessions.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8658-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-08 13:11:43.086208

Maxwell Frost will host a town-hall meeting on Saturday.
The venue is in Sarasota in Florida’s 17th Congressional District, held by Republican Greg Steube.

The two Democrats held a similar town hall in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District in a seat held by Republican Rep. Richard Hudson last month.
The Sarasota Democratic Party notes in a statement that Steube voted for a budget resolution earlier this year that could potentially make deep cuts to Medicaid, and that like many other congressional Republicans this year hasn’t been hosting town-hall meetings.
“If Steube won’t meet with his constituents to explain his vote, Murphy and Frost will,” the statement says.
The two Democrats filed legislation in February to establish a permanent office focused on gun violence prevention in the U.S. Department of Justice. The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention was established in 2023 under legislation filed by both Murphy and Frost, but was dismantled by the Trump administration immediately after returning back to the White House in January.
Democrats have held several town-hall meetings in GOP-held congressional districts this year, including ones held by Republicans like Anna Paulina Luna and Neal Dunn.
One Republican who had no qualms about hosting a town-hall meeting this year has been Byron Donalds, now a candidate for governor in 2026.
Also on Friday afternoon in Tallahassee, Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland Democratic governor and and commissioner of the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration, will host a “Save Social Security” town-hall meeting at the Moon nightclub, along with DNC member Samantha Hope Herring.

After repeated requests by Oklahoma Watch dating back to December, the Oklahoma Tax Commission sent the tax credit recipient data to the state’s open data website. The information is limited to just the name of the taxpayer and the amount of private school tax credits they received in 2024. It doesn’t include school or student information.

If they qualified, most taxpayers received half the credit early in the year and the other half later in the year. The total credit amount doesn’t show how many children in a family received the private school tuition tax credit. The top recipient received more than $24,000 in tax credits in the second half of 2024, according to the data.

Oklahoma Watch requested private school tax credit data in December from the Tax Commission under the Oklahoma Open Records Act and the Oklahoma Taxpayer Transparency Act. Though most taxpayer data is confidential, recipients of tax credits are an exception under the taxpayer transparency law. Lawmakers passed that law in 2010 to address budget planning issues caused by transferable tax credits.
Initially, the Tax Commission referred Oklahoma Watch’s request to the state’s open data website, which lacked the relevant data. Commission attorneys later determined the data could only be released through the Office of Management and Enterprise Services. Although the Tax Commission administers the program, it would not release the data directly. After a delay and agency miscommunication, the data was finally posted on the state’s open data site on April 29.
Snapshot Shows Credit Goes to Higher Incomes 
The Tax Commission last week released its latest snapshot of the recipients of the Parental Choice Tax Credit. It showed just 2,963 of the 36,921 students approved for the tax credit so far this year were enrolled in public school the previous semester.
In setting up the program, lawmakers gave priority consideration to families making an adjusted gross income of less than $75,000. Proponents frequently referred to that group as “low income,” even though the state’s median household income is $63,600.
About 2,700, or 9%, of the students in the program came from families that qualify for income-based public assistance programs, according to the data snapshot.
More than 27,000 students receiving the private school tax credit – almost 75% – came from families with household incomes above $75,000, according to the latest Tax Commission data.
Shiloh Kantz, executive director of the Oklahoma Policy Institute, said at a minimum, lawmakers should put additional accountability measures into the Parental Choice Tax Credit program. She said it would be helpful to know which private school the student attended and the local public school district. There should also be regular audits of the credit and the percentage of audits where errors were found. Those types of safeguards are built into state and federal programs like the earned-income tax credit, food stamps and Medicaid that benefit low-income families.
“We got told this program will uplift educational outcomes, that it offers families educational choice and opportunity through that choice,” Kantz said. “But really it just rewards those people who can already afford private education, and it just leaves our public school students further behind, especially in a state where one in five kids live in poverty.”
Kantz said few private schools are adding capacity to take additional students. Meanwhile, some schools have increased tuition since the tax credit was implemented.
“So it is not about having parental choice,” Kantz said. “It is about checking a box as a political red state to say, ‘We did the thing.’ But it’s not helping working Oklahomans.”
The Legislature considered several changes to the program this year. Lawmakers didn’t act on Senate Bill 229, by Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, this session. It would have eliminated the $250 million annual cap on the private school tax credit, a change Gov. Kevin Stitt called for at a rally at the Capitol in March celebrating the private school tax credit program.
SB 684, by Senate Pro Tempore Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, could come up for a vote in the House this week. It mostly deals with accreditation organizations for private schools participating in the Parental Choice Tax Credit. But it also prioritizes existing recipients if they still meet income eligibility requirements.

daughter asked, “Don’t you feel so guilty?” I said, “yes” and also, “I so rarely carry cash”— a kind of
excuse that, as I said it, felt insulting and weak — especially given the values I’ve raised both my kids
with. My oldest, for example, gives cash frequently and once ran into REI to buy gloves for a man
shivering on a bench during a particularly cold winter day.
As I drove, I wondered how anyone panhandling makes it now because I know I’m not alone in
infrequently carrying cash. I thought about how hardened I became when I lived in India, how at
first I gave all my money away and then learned to shut off the part of me that felt empathy and
responsibility because there was no actual way I would ever have enough money to give to everyone
on the street. That hardness scared me then but it scares me more now because it gives me raw,
personal insight into our capacity to diminish another person’s humanity and suffering. It is easier to
turn away from another person than it is to truly see them. It is easier to look past a person sleeping on
the street than to begin to acknowledge the systems in which we are embedded that makes it possible for
some people to have multiple homes and some to have no homes at all. It is easier to make the kind
of pitiful excuse I made to my daughter than to stop at an ATM and get some cash.
In light of the ramping up of the federal government’s dehumanization of broad categories of
people, from immigrants, trans people, people with autism, Palestinians and other people calling for an end to
genocide in Gaza — to name just a few groups — it is clear that denying someone’s humanity is a way
of deflecting shame and the feeling of powerlessness. I feel powerless when I see someone
panhandling because whether or not I have cash or a sandwich to offer, I don’t know what to do to
make a world where everyone has access to housing and healthcare and where no one is seen as
disposable.
I don’t even know where to begin with countering stereotypes that serve as a kind of justification for
disposing of people; myths about who was homeless and why that were propagated when Reagan
came into office in 1981 and gutted federal funding of housing development — along with many
other poverty alleviation safety net programs. These stereotypes rooted so deeply into our society
that it hardly matters what side of the political spectrum you fall on — I have heard rabidly anti-
homelessness rhetoric from self-described “liberals” as much as I have from people on the right.
I can’t help wondering what would happen if we all sat with the discomfort of homelessness. While
conversations about people living on the streets most often center on stereotypes or discussions of
“safety” (it’s worth noting that our safety is being threatened much more by those in power right
now), sometimes it becomes clear that there are many people who think homelessness is what a
person deserves. This perspective is an eerie reflection of current conversations about ICE
abductions and due process — there are an alarming number of people in our country who seem
comfortable with the idea that some humans don’t deserve due process, or housing or food. I can’t
help wondering if this perspective is, at its root, based in fear: What if I am not deserving of a freedom or a
home?
So much of my life and anyone’s life is about chance — the randomness of being born in a particular
time and place. The randomness of having a family that supports me — and the randomness of being
alive right now to face the violent collapse of empire. This is as intimate and personal as it is global.
Even if we can’t individually fix giant systems designed to pit us against each other, we can practice
empathy and humanity toward each other. We’re in this together.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/homelessness-1024x823.jpeg,,,2025-05-08 13:11:43.086208

(Getty Images)If nothing else, modern American politics has taught us that ideologues are often good at wooing the people but they always stink at serving them.
And that truism is on full display at the state level, too. Consider, for example, the saga of New Hampshire’s paint can bill.
Our state Legislature isn’t exactly known for an abundance of impactful, no-brainer bills, but House Bill 451 is one of them. The point of the bipartisan — if you can believe it — legislation is to help residents and businesses recycle paint cans and keep the environmentally unfriendly contents of those cans out of our landfills.
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a basement or garage in New Hampshire that wasn’t bulging with old paint cans — often bequeathed by previous owners — so for that reason alone my citizen homeowner vote would be a resounding, “Yes, please!” 
But the unceasing proliferation of cans is only part of it: A lot of paint contains PFAS — the harmful “forever chemicals” linked to cancer, liver damage, and other health problems — and New Hampshire should be doing everything in its power to, you know, not poison people for eternity. If preferring that families not get sick from industrial chemicals seems too “woke,” let me spin it another way: Cleanup of bad stuff is more expensive than not dumping the bad stuff to begin with.  
For their own good reasons, House members were sold on the efficacy of the recycling legislation and passed it on a voice vote. So of course the Senate would get behind HB 451, too — right? — and maybe even whistle a little bit while dropping it on the governor’s desk.
Well, no. This is New Hampshire after all, and that means you can always count on a hefty segment of the Legislature stepping forward at some point to proclaim — through action or inaction — that their allegiance is to an ideology not, silly goose, the well-being of the people who elected them. 
But before I get to the heart of the bewildering opposition, which led to the bill being referred back to committee and most likely punted to the fall, it’s important to understand how the program established by the bill would work.
Amateur and professional home remodelers would take their paint cans to their local participating retailer, who would accept them at no cost. Those same retailers could then arrange with PaintCare, the American Coatings Association’s nonprofit that already operates the program in 10 states, to pick up the collected cans. To pay for the program, a fee would be added to new paint cans, ranging from 30 cents to $2.45 depending on the can’s size. So, for one of those 5-gallon cans of interior paint that sell for $100 or more, we’re talking a couple bucks added to the total cost. I know, I know — a buck’s a buck and nobody wants to pay more than they have to. But what does that little extra get you in the end? For starters, a place for that soon-to-be forgotten container other than the corner of your garage. Also, the not-poisoning-people-forever thing.
To call this bill bipartisan doesn’t do it justice. Here’s a partial list of the strange bedfellows who also see HB 451 as a slam-dunk: Casella Waste Systems, the Conservation Law Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, Aubuchon Hardware, and the Business and Industry Association. Oh, and the paint manufacturers themselves.
And here’s the list of people who oppose it: Libertarian lawmakers who, if they close one eye and squint with the other, see an evil tax rather than a clear solution that everybody who has willingly chosen to exist near other people should be able to live with.
Among the opponents is Sen. Victoria Sullivan, a Manchester Republican who presumably arrives at the State House on session days via public roads paved and maintained thanks to funds we all contribute. But here’s what she said of this no-brainer bill: It’s “a tax on every single can of paint that is purchased,” and “the same paint tax that we’ve been fighting for years.” 
Jeez, really? A tax? Not a refreshing agreement of responsibility between an industry and its consumers? That’s some pretty hardcore adherence to a misanthropic philosophy about personal freedom, isn’t it? I guess if you ask New Hampshire Senate Republicans, the old poet John Donne had it all wrong: Everybody is an island.
I understand that America is at a complicated moment in its political history, where the ruling party’s most favored policies carry the taste of retribution against imagined enemies. But punting a sensible bill just because it veers from a rigid ideological blueprint doesn’t look like governing to me.
It looks like a newly popular brand of inflexibility that’s wholly incompatible with public service.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/paintcanbill-1024x783.jpg,,,2025-05-08 12:24:22.518715

(Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria/CommonWealth Beacon)BOSTON — State lawmakers session are looking to take hemp-derived intoxicating products – which contain the same active ingredient as cannabis but are not regulated the same way – off shelves in gas stations, convenience stores, and vape shops across Massachusetts.
The hemp products, which are generally edible and intoxicating like gummies or candies, have already been declared illegal in the state by several state agencies but continue to pop up in certain stores outside of dispensaries. Most of these products come from out of state.
Some business owners who sell the intoxicating products argue that the state agencies haven’t settled the matter because hemp is legal federally – through a loophole in the 2018 federal farm bill which legalized hemp. Hemp and cannabis are the same plant, but this law removed hemp from the classification of cannabis as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC – the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis – by volume.
Four bills have been filed on Beacon Hill to bring any consumable hemp-derived products like edibles, concentrates, tinctures, oils, and capsules, under the purview of the Cannabis Control Commission or give local boards of health oversight to remove these products from stores other than dispensaries. Hemp products that are sold in dispensaries like CBD gummies are already regulated by the commission. These bills would specifically target intoxicating products being sold outside of dispensaries.
“[Hemp products] face no additional tax impositions, no host community agreements, no recall process, no FDA testing requirements, no age limits,” said Rep. Dawne Shand, a Newburyport Democrat, at a Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy hearing on Wednesday. “The intoxicating hemp industry makes a mockery of cannabis laws.”
Shand, a member of the committee, is pushing a bill that would prohibit intoxicating hemp products from being sold without an endorsement from the Cannabis Control Commission.
Rep. Michael Soter, a Republican from Bellingham, has two bills that would address hemp-derived products.
The fourth bill, presented by James C. Arena-DeRosa, imposes an excise tax on the sale of hemp products in addition to the existing state tax and directs that money to be used to empower local health board to remove certain hemp products from stores.
“I think [hemp] should be up to the control of the Cannabis Control Commission,” said Soter, in an interview before the hearing. “You’ve got people who are following the rules … and then you’ve got some things that are kind of being sold in convenience stores and gas stations. Some of this stuff is really geared towards kids, and that’s not a good thing.”
Soter emphasized that he wants to be very careful in creating legislation to deal with hemp products because he doesn’t want to inadvertently harm businesses that sell non-intoxicating hemp products, like oils or creams that contain CBD and are meant to be applied topically.
“What scares me about regulating this is that sometimes we over-regulate and we put more problems on an industry,” said Soter. “We’ve got to walk that fine line. I want to keep us on a straight path of going after what we need to go after and what we don’t need to go after and make sure when we do this regulation, we do it correctly.”
At the hearing, Jesse Alderman, a lawyer who specializes in cannabis, and Peter Gallagher, the CEO of the cannabis company INSA, brought a bag of intoxicating hemp products that they said they collected from over 20 different gas stations, convenience stores, and vape shops.
Many of these products had high concentrations of THC. One of the packages contained 10,000 milligrams of THC. For cannabis, the state allows only 100 milligrams per package and 5 milligrams per serving.
They passed the bag around to the legislators, who commented that the products smelled like cannabis.
“If it smells like it, looks like it, I think it is it,” said Adam Gomez, the Senate chair of the cannabis committee.
Gallagher said that they tested these products and that over 90% of them would qualify as cannabis products because they contained well over 0.3% of THC. About a third of the products wouldn’t have passed the regulatory testing required on cannabis products because of the presence of microbes, pesticides, heavy metals, and residual solvents. None of the establishments where he purchased the hemp products checked for identification to enforce age limits, he added.
“This really looks a lot like what we saw in 2019 with the vape crisis where illegal, unregulated, untested vape cartridges [were] being sold with cutting agents in them and [that] ultimately led to people harming themselves,” said Gallagher. “A lot of consumers today don’t understand that what’s being purchased in these gas stations, convenience stores, vape shops or even online is different and potentially more damaging than what you’re able to purchase in the regulated dispensaries.”
In Massachusetts, several state agencies issued guidance in May 2024 that said that these types of products are illegal. The Alcohol Beverage Control Commission warned its licensees that their licenses could be suspended or revoked if they were caught selling hemp-derived products.
Soon after, many of these products were taken out of liquor stores, smoke shops, restaurants, and many other places that were selling them. But the crackdown on these products has remained uneven because the enforcement on these products has largely remained in the hands of local boards of health, which are already overburdened and don’t have the resources to go from store to store.
Last session, legislators decided not to intervene on the issue of hemp-derived products, but representatives of local boards of health said that they are unable to get these products out of stores and out of the hands of children without more resources allocated to them for this issue.
John Nathan, the CEO of a company called Bay State Extracts, which produces hemp-derived compounds like CBD, said that the legislation proposed at the hearing would be redundant because these products – as per the guidance from the state agencies – are already illegal. He also expressed concern about the Cannabis Control Commission’s ability to actually regulate hemp products effectively. The commission has had internal conflict, allegations of misconduct, and a slow-moving regulatory process that has frustrated many within the cannabis industry.
“The CCC has barely enforced their existing hemp regulations and guidance is as it stands,” said Nathan. “The cannabis industry is in turmoil. There’s over saturation, struggles for bill payments, layoffs, competitive and low-paying job market, what seems like monthly closures. I feel effort should be directed towards supporting the existing market and coordinating to fix these issues, rather than disrupting the supply chain in an effort to make something already illegal illegal again.”

Pictured is Elite Octane in Atlantic, which U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins toured on a recent trip to Iowa.(Photo by Cecilia Lynch/USDA)The economic impact of the renewable fuels industry in Iowa was $800 million less in 2024 than it was in 2023, according to a recent study released by Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. 
The industry association said “stagnant corn demand” has impacted biofuels’ impact on Iowa’s economy, and said the best way to increase demand is entry to the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets.
“That is the most cost-effective and impactful tool we can provide our farmers and producers,” Monte Shaw, IRFA executive director, said in a statement. 
IRFA holds that the direct impacts of biofuels “remain strong” in the state, with another “record for fuel production.” 
Overall, the report found the renewable fuel industry accounted for 2% of Iowa’s 2024 gross domestic product, or $5.7 billion. The industry also created more than 34,000 direct and indirect jobs across the state, which is down from 52,000 jobs in 2023.  
Shaw said some of the change comes from completed construction projects and a closed facility, but the majority of that figure is from the indirect impacts of the stalled market.

“The bigger thing is those multiplier effects,” he said. “When you’re buying corn at $7, that income goes over in the economy and supports jobs and other aspects of Iowa’s economy … When farmers don’t have money, they’re not out buying new equipment, they’re gonna make stuff last another year, and so that is where those job losses have happened.” 
Shaw said if the numbers are to increase across the economy, the overall demand for ethanol needs to increase. 
Right now, he said the supply outweighs demand for corn and soybean commodities, which has led to decreasing corn prices over the past two years. The trend is projected to follow suit for the 2024-2025 crop year. 
“Our farmers are very productive, very competitive … they’re producing more corn with fewer inputs on the same acres,” Shaw said. “But we have not been able to build demand fast enough.” 
Ryan Sauer, vice president of market development for Iowa Corn Growers Association, said if the current trends continue and Iowa doesn’t branch into new markets to utilize corn, there could be “a bit of a repeat” of the farm crisis from the 1980s. 
“You’ve got commodity prices that are going to stay stagnant, you’ve got input prices that will remain high, and I mean, there’s only so long that the banks can allow a farmer to do that,” Sauer said. 
One route for increased demand could come from the congressional approval of nationwide, year-round, E15, or a blend of ethanol fuel with 15% ethanol.
According to studies from the National Corn Growers Association, a 5% increase in ethanol blends, which E15 would represent, equates to an increased demand of 2.3 billion bushels of corn annually. The IRFA study found that 62% of corn in Iowa is processed by the ethanol industry.
Sauer said the E15 market would be especially important for Iowa farmers if tariffs upset corn export markets. 
“If we’re not going to be able to export it because of tariffs and all this, we need all the demand domestically we can get, and E15 will allow us to do that,” Sauer said. 
Low carbon markets
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association has also been pushing for year-round E15, but Shaw called it a “near-term market.”
“All the other market growth opportunities that we see on the horizon are low carbon, ultra-low carbon markets,” Shaw said. “That’s why we’re fighting so hard … to make sure that our ethanol producers have the tools they need to produce ultra-low carbon ethanol.”
Shaw said sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is one of the ultra-low carbon fuels the industry hopes to expand to, but there is also demand for fuels in the marine industry, trains and for some construction and tractor equipment. 
The study said ethanol producers would have to “lower the carbon intensity” of ethanol production in order to open up the market for SAF. 
“This is most easily achieved through environmentally friendly feedstock production practices and access to opportunities for carbon capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide from ethanol production,” the study said. 
The industries purchasing these fuels want them to be produced with lifetime greenhouse gas emissions below a certain level. Some iterations of guidance for sustainable aviation fuel, for example, required the fuel to be made from corn grown with carbon reducing farming practices.
Shaw said being able to reduce carbon emissions via carbon capture and sequestration, like the controversial Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, would equate to “tens of billions of gallons” of additional biofuel demand over the next 20 years. 
“Do you want to be sitting here around $3.50 corn, and having a bad farm economy?” Shaw said. “Or, do we want to access these new markets that will literally say, ‘Give me every gallon you can?’”
The Summit pipeline, and the now terminated Wolf Carbon Solutions pipeline, has drawn opposition from landowners, some politicians and environmental groups like the Sierra Club. 
Those opposed to the project believe carbon sequestration pipelines are dangerous for communities, often citing a rupture of a pipeline in Satartia, Mississippi. Landowners oppose the taking of easements in agricultural land for the pipeline, especially after the Summit project was conditionally granted the right of eminent domain in June. 
The issues have been a prominent topic of discussion at the Iowa Capitol this session. The House voted to ban the use of eminent domain on carbon sequestration pipelines, and more recently a group of senators vowed to stand their ground on budget negotiations until the pipeline issue is debated in the chamber. 
Emma Schmit, pipeline fighters director with Bold Alliance, said the “unyielding commitment to carbon capture pipelines” is what’s holding the biofuels industry back.
“To imply stagnation suddenly has the industry on death’s door unless a risky carbon capture pipeline is allowed to destroy over 1,000 miles of prime Iowa farmland is a stretch,” Schmit said in an email.
She referenced figures in the study showing another high year for ethanol production, and that corn utilization by the industry has remained consistent.
“If expanding markets via decarbonization is the goal, there are a multitude of options available that don’t depend on the destruction of thousands of parcels or the misuse of eminent domain,” Schmit said.
According to Summit Carbon Solutions, the project has already secured easement agreements for more than 75% of the route for the first phase of the pipeline.
Construction on the pipeline cannot begin until the company has secured permit approval in South Dakota, a process which has been complicated by the state’s recent ban on eminent domain for CO2 pipelines and subsequent denial of the permit application from Summit. The company has pledged to reapply with reduced scope in the state.
The project could face a similar situation in Iowa if lawmakers advance the bill passed from the House, though substantial amendments to the bill have been proposed in the Senate.
Shaw said without carbon sequestration capabilities, Iowa could lose its title as “most cost-effective place to turn corn into ethanol,” in favor of nearby Nebraska, where a roughly 400-mile carbon dioxide sequestration pipeline through the state is set to be operational by the end of 2025. 
“People are treating this like it’s some sort of political board game, and they’re ignoring the very real ramifications that are happening around us,” Shaw said.

April, 1985: Ronald Reagan was president. Bill Allain was Mississippi’s governor. John C. Stennis still represented Mississippi in the U.S. Senate. Chicago Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg was the reigning National League MVP. Madonna’s “Material Girl” was No. 1 on the hit charts. The Los Angeles Lakers, led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson were well on their way to the NBA Championship.

Rick Cleveland 
Yes, and on April 10, 1985, William Carey College (it would not become a university until 2006) named Bobby Halford as its next baseball coach, beginning in 1986.
Last week, more than 40 years later and at the age of 72, Halford coached the Crusaders to his 1,374th victory, thus passing Ron Polk to become Mississippi’s all-time winningest college baseball coach. He has won two more games since. Polk won 1,373 college baseball games at three different schools, including two stints at Mississippi State.
“That’s a lot of games, a lot of winning,” Polk said of Halford’s achievement. “What’s really amazing is that he did it at one place, one school. Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy. I am happy for Bobby.”
Said Halford of Polk: “He was the master. He set the bar in Mississippi baseball for all the rest of us.”
Younger fans might be surprised to learn there was a time when Mississippi State and William Carey competed against one another in baseball. Polk started that. In fact, at State, Polk played games against Carey, Delta State, Millsaps and Mississippi College. He played Jackson State at Smith-Wills Stadium in Jackson. 
“I just thought it was good for baseball in Mississippi,” Polk said. “People would ask me why we would go to Hattiesburg and play a couple games at Carey. Well, we had a lot of alumni in south Mississippi who got to see us play. Plus, Carey played good baseball. Most of those were really good, competitive games. There wasn’t a lot of travel involved. But the main thing was, I just thought it was good for baseball in a state where baseball needed to grow.”

Nearly four decades later, Knight remembers those games against Polk’s SEC powerhouse teams, including the day when the great Will Clark hit one far over the light poles at the old Carey ballpark. 
“They were the best coached teams I ever played against,” Halford said. “His guys were so professional, fundamentally so good and so organized. Sometimes, I felt like the pupil coaching against the master.”
And, sometimes, the pupil won. After losing 11 straight to the Bulldogs, Knight’s Crusaders won two of the last four meetings in 1992 and 1993 in Starkville.
“We’ve had some really good baseball teams,” Halford said. “We’ve had some teams that would have been very competitive in D1 at the mid-major level.”
That’s probably true of this spring’s Carey Crusaders, the Southern States Athletic Conference regular season champions, who have won 38 games and lost 12 and will host a four-team bracket beginning Monday in the NAIA National Championship tournament at Milton Wheeler Field in Hattiesburg. Top-seeded Carey will play Indiana-Southeast in the first round. The winner will advance to the NAIA World Series at Lewiston, Idaho
William Carey’s impressive baseball tradition precedes Halford’s tenure. The 1969 Crusaders, coached by the late John O’Keefe and featuring Petal natives Jim Smith and Junior Broome, won the NAIA World Series. In 1971, O’Keefe recruited a speedy centerfielder off Meridian High’s state championship team, and Halford became a four-year starter and standout for O’Keefe and then Johnny Stephenson, the 10-year Major League veteran who succeeded O’Keefe. In 1976, young Halford joined Stephenson’s staff as a graduate assistant. So, counting his playing days, Halford has been at Carey 53 years – and counting.

Bobby Halford was a Carey hitter before he was a coach.
Said Ron Polk, “It’s hard for me to believe that some Division I school hasn’t come along and hired him during all that time.”
Halford, a devout Baptist working at a Baptist school, has had opportunities at bigger programs but puts it this way: “I just feel like the Good Lord always knew where I needed to be. This school, this community has meant so much to be.”
And when you get right down to it, Hattiesburg is a terrific place to be a college baseball coach at any level. You are surrounded by high schools with remarkable baseball tradition: Oak Grove, Sumrall, Petal, Hattiesburg, Purvis, all the Jones County schools and more. Three of the nation’s best junior college programs – Pearl River, Jones and Gulf Coast – are within an hour’s drive. What’s more, sparkling Milton Wheeler Field, named for the late Carey history professor and baseball fan who left an endowment that still benefits Carey baseball, is surely among the best small college facilities in the nation.
The obvious question for Halford: How much longer to you plan to coach?
“I don’t golf, I don’t fish or hunt; this is what I do,” Halford answered. “I love it. I love doing what I do and I love doing it here. Why would I quit as long as that’s the case?”
Why, indeed?
•••
About Bobby Halford, did you know:

Early on, Halford also served as Carey’s women’s basketball coach and athletic director. He was Carey’s first women’s basketball coach and coached for 10 seasons, winning 152 games, losing 112 and winning one conference championship.
Halford’s first Carey baseball team in 1986 played 13 games against NCAA Division I teams. They opened the season against Vanderbilt in Hattiesburg, losing 6-4. The losing pitcher that day was Larry Knight, who would go on to coach Hattiesburg and Sumrall High Schools to a combined nine state championships.
As a freshman centerfielder in 1972, Halford batted against Southern Miss great Ray Guy, the future Pro Football Hall of Famer. Guy threw a no-hitter. “Best I ever faced,” Halford said. “He was Max Scherzer before Max Scherzer. He was mid-to-upper 90s and that slider was absolutely filthy.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/08102251/Carey-coach-Bobby-Halford.jpg,,,2025-05-08 12:24:22.518715

(Photo via FIU)Former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez was the sole finalist named for the Florida International University presidency Thursday, a job she has held on an interim basis since February. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office had reached out to the university “and suggested that we consider Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as the next leader for FIU,” FIU Board of Trustees Chair Roger Tovar said during a February special meeting in which Nuñez was introduced as interim president. 
Lt. Gov. Nuñez to head FIU, leave DeSantis administration

Then-President Kenneth Jessell became senior vice president and chief administrative officer even though his presidential term wouldn’t expire until November.
According to FIU, a search committee selected three finalists but two said they would only allow their names to be made public if they were the lone candidate. Those candidates withdrew, according to FIU. The committee unanimously agreed on Nuñez as the sole finalist, again according to FIU. 
Nuñez will participate in FIU community forums on campus on May 21 and trustees will meet on June 2 to interview her. 
FIU is the second State University System institution in the past week to name a sole finalist. The University of Florida on Sunday named University of Michigan President Santa Ono as its only finalist.
UF search committee Chair Rahul Patel said in an opinion column published by the Tampa Bay Times that other applicants for that position were only interested in being named a finalist if they were the only finalist.
“Interim President Nuñez’s distinguished career and commitment to further cement FIU’s position as a leader in higher education in Florida and across the country make her an excellent leader for FIU at this pivotal point in our university’s journey,” FIU Board of Trustees vice chair and chair of the search committee Carlos Duart said in a news release.
Nuñez graduated from FIU in 1994 with her bachelor’s degree and in 1998 with a master’s in public administration. She has served as an adjunct professor at the university and as Florida’s lieutenant governor from 2019 until two months ago. 
In February, FIU trustee Dean Colson said the “probable results of the search are already known.”
The unexpected move to name Nuñez as interim president came shortly before the 2025 legislative session, when legislators were supposed to determine how much money each SUS institution would receive from the state. The House ands Senate couldn’t agree on a budget and will return to Tallahassee to continue negotiations. 
In February, Tovar said Nuñez’s experience as a health care lobbyist and lieutenant governor make her “an ideal leader to help transition FIU into the future,” noting her connections in the community and in Tallahassee.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana legislators are advancing legislation to move the University of New Orleans, which has struggled with enrollment and finances, back into the LSU System.
Senate Bill 202 by Sen. Jimmy Harris, D-New Orleans, unanimously cleared the Senate Education committee Thursday. The bill would reverse the action legislators took 14 years ago to move UNO to the University of Louisiana System from the LSU System, where it had operated since the university was founded in 1958. 
The university’s possible return to LSU’s control is in response to UNO’s acute budget crisis. The school faces a $10 million budget shortfall and has implemented a spending freeze, layoffs and staff furloughs in an attempt to make ends meet. 
UNO administrators have kept open the possibility of further layoffs and furloughs. Its budget crisis is largely tied to enrollment. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. For the fall 2024 semester, its total enrollment was 6,488. 
Unlike UNO, every school in the LSU System has reported enrollment increases over the past few years, in contrast to nationwide trends of declining student numbers on college campuses. 
One notable opponent of the UNO transfer is Julie Stokes, a University of Louisiana Board of Supervisors member and former Republican state representative from Kenner. She also earned an accounting degree from UNO.
Stokes raised concerns that there is no transition plan yet for the system switch. Harris’ bill requires one, but not until April 1, 2026. That would be after an Aug. 1, 2025, deadline UNO President Kathy Johnson is required to meet to notify the Southern Association for Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges of its intent to transfer systems. The association is the accrediting body for UNO and other schools in the region, providing assurance that its educational offerings meet high standards. 
Stokes also objected to the composition of the transition team in Harris’ legislation. It calls for a committee made up of “stakeholders from the Greater New Orleans region” and members of the legislature’s two education committees. Stokes said she believed the committee should include members of the LSU and University of Louisiana system boards. 
The Louisiana Board of Regents, which oversees all higher education in the state, has already approved the transfer. Shortly after the Regents gave their approval, Johnson said in an interview with the Illuminator that she was “agnostic” on the plan. She declined to answer questions Thursday as she left the Senate Committee on Education meeting with Stokes. 
At the time of the system switch in 2011, UNO alumni and boosters applauded the plan, as many felt the university was overshadowed in the LSU System.
UNO would be the only institution in the LSU System classified as an R2 university, meaning it has high levels of research activity, second only to LSU’s main campus, which is a R1 school with the highest research activity rating. 
In the University of Louisiana System, there are two other schools with research-level rankings: the University of Louisiana Lafayette, an R1, and Louisiana Tech, an R2. 
UNO would also be the only other school in the LSU System with an NCAA Division I athletics program.
Harris’ bill will next be discussed by the Senate.

In July 2024, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged Lacy Dencklau, 45, with unethical conduct or a practice harmful to the public — specifically the use of methamphetamine. Last month, the board resolved the case by placing Dencklau’s license on probation for one year.
Dencklau said Wednesday she was working at Friendship Manor in Fort Dodge in January 2024 when she was asked to submit to a drug test that produced a positive result for methamphetamine. As a result of that test, she was fired, she said. “I don’t know how the drug got into my system because I have never used drugs,” Dencklau said.

The board’s publicly posted investigator’s notes on the case indicate Friendship Haven’s director of human resources told board investigators Dencklau had “not been acting right” in December 2023, and was sent home and given the week off after medication errors were made.
The records indicate resident medications had been documented as having been administered, although the drugs were later found still in their packaging. Dencklau had also failed to report or document a resident’s fall, according to the documents.
After her time off, Dencklau returned to work at Friendship Manor, but “did not remember that day at work,” the report states and so she was given a drug test that indicated no illicit drugs were present in her system. On Monday, Jan. 29, 2024, Dencklau arrived late for work at Friendship Manor “and was posting erratic social media posts” and texting random photos to colleagues, the investigative report states.
Dencklau was immediately given a urine test and the results were positive for methamphetamine. Dencklau later told investigators she spoke to a bartender who told her she had seen an individual put something in Dencklau’s soft drink days before the test, which Dencklau said could explain the positive result.
Board records indicate that on Feb. 2, 2024, Dencklau was fired from Friendship Manor, where she had worked for 20 years, due to the drug test. The same month, she took a nursing job at Rotary Senior Living in Eagle Grove, according to board records and court documents.
On April 10, 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing agreed to settle its case against Dencklau by placing her license on probation for one year, during which time she will have to work with a case manager, submit to chemical screening and follow any recommendations for treatment.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Sen. John Curtis has a choice of protecting the health of his constituents, i.e. the people of Utah, or the profitability of the fossil fuel industry. So far he is choosing the latter. 
Oil refineries, petro-chemical plants and pesticide manufacturers commonly emit a long list of 188 toxic chemicals the EPA classifies as HAPs (hazardous air pollutants). Polluters that annually emit more than 25 tons of these deadly compounds in combination, or 10 tons of a single HAP, are classified as “Major Sources” by the EPA. If that seems like a lot for toxins that are dangerous in micrograms, that’s because it is. For example, plutonium and other radionuclides are HAPs and ten tons of plutonium inhaled along the Wasatch Front would kill millions of people many times over, so let’s not get overexcited about how much protection this EPA rule offers. But Sen. Curtis wants even less.
But at least Major Sources must follow rules known as Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards, i.e. they must reduce the amount of each hazardous air pollutant they emit by the “maximum degree achievable,” and comply with monitoring requirements, and make their emissions and compliance data public. 
For the worst of these common 188 HAPs — the “murderers’ row” of lead, mercury, dioxins, furans, hexachlorobenzene and PCBs — manufacturers must use MACT, even if they emit much less than the threshold for a Major Source, because these toxins can cause cancer, birth defects, and brain damage in minute concentrations. Seems reasonable and necessary to protect the public. Sen. Curtis thinks that is unfair to industry, he’s apparently not worried about what’s unfair to you or your children if you end up inhaling more murderers’ row toxins.
So Curtis wants to go back to a time when these Major Sources of toxic chemicals could qualify as lesser “Area Sources” if their emissions fell under those thresholds, and thus would no longer have to comply with MACT and the stricter rules of recordkeeping and public disclosure of emissions for Major Sources. In other words, they would be moved to more of an honor system where the public just trusts the polluters to do the right thing. The refinery or plant could switch to less costly and effective pollution controls, or operate its controls less frequently, releasing more HAPs. 
The U.S. has a long history of what that looks like — unbreathable air and rivers so polluted they catch on fire, which is why the EPA and the Clean Air Act was established in the first place. An EPA analysis concluded that over 1,000 tons of the deadliest HAPs could be released nationwide as a result of Curtis’s bill. Local communities, for example residents of North Salt Lake and South Davis counties along “refinery row,” could be prime targets.
Curtis justifies his bill saying, “The rule put forward under the former administration shut the door on progress. It told companies that no matter how much they invest to reduce harmful emissions, they would still be punished with permanent red tape. That’s not good science, it’s not good governance, and it certainly isn’t good for the environment.”
These companies Curtis is talking about are a fantasy, i.e. big polluters that are just dying to reduce their harmful emissions but were being prevented from doing so by the Biden EPA. 
The fossil fuel industry didn’t run to Curtis to reverse the rule because they were desperate to preserve good science and our environment. This is the same industry that for over 50 years has lied and deceived the public about the climate crisis that their own scientists proved they were causing. They didn’t run to the Trump administration because they had been thwarted in their eternal quest to improve global health. This is the same industry that has fought every pollution rule ever made by the EPA. This is the plastics industry that doesn’t care one iota about how they are drowning the planet in microplastics or that the critical organs of most people on earth are now contaminated with their nanoparticles laden with toxic chemicals. These companies don’t invest in reducing harmful emissions unless they’re forced to. There was no mountain of altruistic investments that were being stymied by the rule Curtis is determined to reverse. 
Sen. Curtis apparently has no idea what good science is and his acting as handmaiden to the fossil fuel industry reveals he has no interest in what is good governance. His bill is a gift to the fossil fuel/petrochemical industry and everyone who lives and breathes along the Wasatch Front will pay for it.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-08 16:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Special education is in crisis in Connecticut,Cassidy Thomas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/08/special-education-is-in-crisis-in-connecticut/,"Adequate special education teaches kids to focus on their own challenges, improves self confidence, and allows a better chance of success.","Special education services are essential to fostering a happy and healthy lifestyle for children with disabilities, but what happens to children if these services are struggling to provide what they need? Children with disabilities, such as intellectual and learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, emotional and behavioral disorders, sensory impairments, physical disabilities, and more, deserve sufficient services, but Connecticut is having difficulties providing this because of both funding problems and systemic challenges. 


Special education in Connecticut is currently in the midst of a crisis. Specifically, Connecticut schools are in need of more teachers and specialists for children with disabilities, and funding for these professionals is lacking. Connecticut House Bill 5001, introduced on January 8th, 2025, aims to enhance the quality and delivery of special education services in Connecticut. The bill would mandate that the Commissioner of Education conduct a comprehensive study on the state of special education within Connecticut, to help policymakers better understand the rapidly changing landscape and the scope of the challenges they face. 
We can see these challenges best if we look at specific towns that are working to receive more funding. In Meriden, the Board of Education proposed a $136.9 million budget for the 2025-26 school year, which would be a $7.4 million increase from this year. Some of this money is needed due to the increase of enrollment in special education programs. 18.4% of Meriden’s students were enrolled in special education programs in 2015, and that percentage has since increased to 21.6% in 2024. 

Cassidy Thomas
In Bridgeport, Interim Superintendent Royce Avery is advocating for another bill, SB 1511, that would supply $57 million in additional funding, by changing the way the state calculates its share in helping to educate students in some districts. This bill would also provide funding for high-need students across all of Connecticut, proposing a new added 50% weight for students with disabilities who receive special education services. If this funding is not received, Bridgeport would face up to $30 million in cuts to staff and programs. It is essential that this not happen, because less professionals and staff directly hurts students, especially those with special needs. With more funding for special education, students would have more professionals to care about them and to support them in a time when youth mental health is struggling. 
Some districts choose the option of outplacing particularly high-needs children to special schools. But even here, the system is failing. An investigation conducted by The Connecticut Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) and Disability Rights Connecticut (DRCT) found that Connecticut’s special education services are falling short when it comes to staffing, individualized educational programming, State Department of Education (CSDE) oversight, and school district monitoring. High Road Schools is a provider of special education services in Connecticut, serves students from 38 school districts in the state, and was found to be underserving children, specifically those who are low-income and of color. 
These children deserve better than what is being given to them and should not be overlooked. High Road Schools also did not provide physical education, art, or music to students, which are all required by state law. It was also found that they used restraint and seclusion practices, which are extremely dangerous to students with disabilities. The findings of this investigation are very alarming to me personally, and should be to everyone else too, in my opinion. Adequate special education is so needed because it teaches kids to focus on their own challenges, improves self confidence, and allows for a better chance of success. 
Some may have opposing views, saying that the funding would be better spent elsewhere, or have issues funding something that does not directly affect them or their family. However, this issue should be of importance to everyone. 96% of parents reported to believe that proper special education can make up for their child’s learning disabilities. 
Special education services foster academic progress, social and emotional development, and individual growth and independence. Without appropriate services, students with disabilities will struggle. Improved resources for students with disabilities can improve academic achievement, mental health struggles, and socialization skills, like the ability and motivation to make friends with peers and become involved in their community environment. All of these factors would ultimately contribute to a healthier lifestyle for these children.
Overall, it is essential that Connecticut House Bill 5001 be passed, because it is clear that the state of special education is struggling greatly. Special education students deserve the very best schooling and attention from professionals, and that starts with adequate funding for these programs. This is an issue that everyone should care about because children with a variety of disabilities are not being given the resources that they need to live their best lives.

Don Bacon of Nebraska was the only Republican to vote against the measure.“Our country has more important issues to worry about,” Bacon said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.“The Administration is making great strides securing our border and cutting waste in government. But we need to focus on the reconciliation bill and how to strengthen Medicaid for every American who needs it. Renaming bodies of water is not a priority and sends a bad message to the rest of the world,” he said.All Democrats stood in opposition. Sixteen House members did not vote, including eight Republicans and eight Democrats.U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who introduced the bill in January, said “this is such an important thing to do for the American people,” during the floor debate Thursday.The Georgia Republican said “the American people deserve pride in their country, and they deserve pride in the waters that we own, that we protect with our military and our Coast Guard and all of the businesses that prosper along these waters.”The legislation is unlikely to move far in the Senate, where it would take 60 votes to advance. Republicans control the chamber 53-47. The Senate has 45 Democrats, but two independents, Sens. Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, caucus with the party. Meanwhile, a federal judge in April sided with The Associated Press and granted the wire service a preliminary injunction in its case against the Trump administration over allegations of denied access to restricted spaces at the White House due to its editorial decision to use “Gulf of Mexico” rather than “Gulf of America.”The bill says “any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the Gulf of Mexico shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘Gulf of America’” and directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “oversee the implementation of the renaming.”In a Statement of Administration Policy on Tuesday, the White House said it “strongly supports” passage of the bill and that Trump’s advisers would recommend he sign it into law if the legislation were presented to him in its current form.Ahead of the vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged a strong “no” against the bill, which he described as a “silly, small-minded and sycophantic piece of legislation.”“What are we doing, folks?

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. New — and new-ish — rental properties in St. Paul will no longer be subject to the city’s 3% cap on yearly rent increases. 
The St. Paul City Council, at the behest of Mayor Melvin Carter, voted 4-3 Wednesday to permanently exempt new construction and rentals built after 2004 from the rent control ordinance, which voters approved by ballot measure in 2021.
While increased interest rates and slower growth in rents reduced homebuilding across the country in recent years, local developers have pointed the finger at St. Paul’s rent control ordinance as a major factor in their reluctance to build in the city.
Since the council first implemented the ordinance in 2022, construction has dropped off a cliff in the city; In 2024, 80% fewer housing units were built in St. Paul compared to the previous three-year average, according to a MinnPost analysis. (In Minneapolis, voters gave the city council power to enact rent control in 2021, but the council has not passed a rent control ordinance. Minneapolis had an even steeper falloff in construction in 2024 than St. Paul.)
St. Paul’s rollback of the ordinance is a bad sign for rent control advocates in Minneapolis, who have pushed the council to implement rent stabilization in recent years. 
Prior to Wednesday’s vote, the St. Paul City Council weakened the rent control ordinance in other ways: In 2022, the council permanently exempted affordable housing developments; gave new construction a 20-year exemption, and instituted “vacancy decontrol,” which allows landlords to raise rents by more than 3% when a tenant moves out. 
Landlords could also request permission from the city to raise rents by more than 3% if their expenses rose significantly; St. Paul approved the vast majority of those requests.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The Washington Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the state’s ban on the sale of gun ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. 
The law, passed in 2022, faced a challenge from a Kelso gun shop that argued the ban on selling the magazines violates the state constitution, which protects “the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state.” 
Gator’s Custom Guns also said the law ran afoul of the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
In a 7-2 ruling, state Supreme Court justices disagreed.
They ruled that high-capacity magazines aren’t “arms,” but just a component of a gun, and are not generally used for self-defense. The ruling tracked with arguments attorneys for the state made before the court in January.
“By restricting only magazines of a capacity greater than 10, the statute effectively regulates the maximum capacity of magazines, leaving the weapon fully functional for its intended purpose,” Justice Charles Johnson wrote in Thursday’s opinion. “Indeed, we can safely say that individuals are still able to exercise the core right to bear arms when they are limited to purchasing magazines with a capacity of 10 or fewer.”
Justices Sheryl Gordon McCloud and G. Helen Whitener dissented.
Attorneys for Gator’s Custom Guns, including former Republican attorney general candidate Pete Serrano, had argued that the popularity of high-capacity magazines inherently proved they abide by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling protecting firearms that are “in common use” and are “typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.”
The case was a test of a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that moved the goalposts when it comes to assessing the constitutionality of gun regulations. 
Washington’s ban on high-capacity magazine sales took effect about two and a half years ago. The state is among at least 14 nationwide with similar restrictions. These laws have attracted lawsuits as lower courts grapple with the decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. 
In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled state firearm laws must stay true to the nation’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation.” Judges have now had to deduce how laws written over a century ago would square with technological advances, like high-capacity magazines and semi-automatic weapons.
In this case, attorneys for the gun shop argued justices have no historical analogue to compare with Washington’s high-capacity magazine law.
But the state attorney general’s office, led by Solicitor General Noah Purcell, countered that the comparison need not be so specific, pointing to Bowie knives banned after they rose in popularity in the 1800s. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has since clarified its decision in Bruen to note judges can use general principles, not just exact matches, when comparing modern gun laws to historical regulations.
The ruling comes about four months after attorneys from both sides argued before the justices about the law’s standing under the U.S. and state constitutions.
The case came to the state Supreme Court after a Cowlitz County Superior Court judge struck down the ban in April 2024. The judge, Gary Bashor, ruled the law violated the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms for self-defense granted in the state constitution.
That ruling had been paused until the case was resolved, so the ban has remained in effect. 
The case now returns to Cowlitz County Superior Court to decide if Gator’s violated state law in allegedly flouting the prohibition.
This year, Washington lawmakers passed another controversial gun control measure to force firearm buyers to get a state permit before purchasing a gun. Republicans uniformly opposed the bill, with some arguing judges would deem it unconstitutional under Bruen. 
That legislation now awaits Gov. Bob Ferguson’s signature.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-08 15:36:04+00:00,Mississippi Today,State auditor Shad White alleges health department mismanaged federal HIV dollars,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/08/auditor-mismanagement-hiv-funds-health-department/,"Three nonprofits received over $850,000 in federal grants for HIV prevention between 2021 and 2024 but administered only 35 HIV tests during that period, State Auditor Shad White alleges in a report released Monday.","Three nonprofits received over $850,000 in federal grants for HIV prevention between 2021 and 2024 but administered only 35 HIV tests during that period, State Auditor Shad White alleges in a report released Monday. 
The report identified reimbursements for alcohol, late-night rideshares, purchases from a smoke shop, the rental of a nightclub owned by one group’s executive director and a declined payment for gift cards. All of the payments were approved by the Mississippi Department of Health, the agency responsible for overseeing distribution of the funding to community-based organizations.
“The lapses identified are unacceptable and not reflective of our agency’s standards or mission,” the health department said in a press release Monday. 
The agency could not produce monthly reports for grant activities or documentation of hundreds of thousands of dollars of expenses, the report said. Nor could it provide all of the funding agreements or say whether the organizations were aware they were required to report testing data, a spokesperson for the auditor’s office told Mississippi Today. 
The grant funding was meant to help states establish and maintain HIV prevention and surveillance programs, and HIV testing was an element of each organization’s agreement. The grants also paid the nonprofits to educate the public about HIV and hire community health workers. 
Mississippi has the sixth highest rate of new HIV diagnoses in the country, and the majority of the state’s prevention efforts are funded with federal dollars. 
“It’s almost like our government hates us,” said Auditor Shad White in a press release. “This kind of spending defies all common sense and is an insult to hardworking taxpayers.”
Lorena Quiroz, the executive director of Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity, said the nonprofit submitted all required monthly reports and expense documentation to the health department. 
Love Inside for Everyone and Love Me Unlimited 4 Life, the other two organizations investigated by the state auditor, did not respond to questions from Mississippi Today. 
None of the organizations referenced in the audit report still have grants or contracts with the health department, and the agency has already taken steps to hire new leadership in its STD/HIV division and tighten management of grants, it said in a press release.
The audit probes a period when the health department’s STD/HIV division was severely understaffed after public health priorities shifted to the COVID-19 pandemic and skyrocketing syphilis cases in the state. Around the same time, the health department began receiving tens of millions of dollars in additional federal funding for HIV prevention efforts as a part of an initiative launched by President Donald Trump during his first term in office to end the domestic HIV epidemic. 
But the funding increases have resulted in only a slight dent in new HIV cases. New diagnoses dropped 5% in the first three years of reported data since the state began receiving the additional federal dollars, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data published by AIDSVu – far from keeping up with the federal government’s ambitious goals of reducing new diagnoses 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030.
Increasing HIV testing in community settings is one of the plan’s core strategies. 
Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity, a Jackson nonprofit that advocates for immigrant and indigenous communities in Mississippi, was contracted to take steps to become a rapid HIV testing site, but did not conduct any tests because the health department did not provide a phlebotomist, Quiroz told Mississippi Today in an email. 
It is unclear why the organization would have required a phlebotomist, as rapid tests are administered with a finger prick or saliva. Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity did not respond to a follow-up question for clarification. 
Quiroz said HIV testing materials worth $11,412 were lost in a storm that destroyed the organization’s building and roof. The storm occurred in June 2023, one month before the nonprofit’s agreement with the health department ended and 10 months after the supplies were purchased. 
Health department records showed that Love Inside for Everyone, a LGBT+ advocacy nonprofit, performed 35 HIV tests between 2021 and 2024. 
Love Unlimited 4 Life, a transgender advocacy organization no longer in operation, recieved grant funding between 2021 and 2023 for the salaries of two community health workers. Health department records showed that no HIV tests were administered by the organization. 
The nonprofits’ grant agreements also included education and testing events. The auditor’s report called several events “questionable,” including a Latinx pride month and HIV awareness event hosted by Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity that exceeded its proposed budget and included alcohol purchases in a request for reimbursement. 
Love Inside for Everyone used grant funding to rent Metro 2.0, a nightclub owned by the organization’s executive director, Temica Morton, a possible conflict of interest. 
Due to the health department’s lack of grant monitoring, it could not say if HIV testing or awareness activities occurred at the events, the auditor’s office said.
Several federal grants Mississippi relies on for HIV prevention efforts have been cut or destabilized since the Trump administration took office earlier this year. Public health experts have argued these cuts will undermine HIV testing activities. 
White said the audit shows that the Trump administration’s cuts to HIV prevention efforts have been unfairly criticized in a video on Fox News Digital. 
“Our audit shows that when you dig into how this money is actually being spent, it’s not actually helping people with HIV/AIDs, it’s not helping to test people for HIV, it’s instead being wasted,” White said.  
The health department reiterated the importance of community partners to advancing public health goals in a statement. 
“It is important to underscore that these findings do not reflect the value of many nonprofit partners we continue to work with across Mississippi. Partnerships remain critical to our public health mission.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06132903/Roundtable4.jpg,,,2025-05-08 12:24:22.518715

Delaware has been named the top state in the nation for hospital quality, according to the latest U.S. News & World Report “Best States” rankings released this week.
The First State rose to the #1 spot from its second-place finish in 2024, earning national recognition for its commitment to healthcare excellence.
The rankings, which assess 71 metrics across eight categories, praised Delaware hospitals for high performance in a range of treatments and procedures, including cancer care, joint replacements, and treatment of organ failure.
Delaware also climbed in other healthcare categories, ranking #5 for overall healthcare quality and #10 for healthcare access.
Brian Frazee, president and CEO of the Delaware Healthcare Association (DHA), attributed the state’s success to ongoing innovation and investment by healthcare providers.

“Delaware hospitals are proud to be first in hospital quality,” he said. “Our members innovate and invest in high-quality care daily in our goal to improve healthcare access and outcomes. While our foundation is strong, we can’t let the HB 350 hospital-control law bulldoze our progress.”
Frazee also used the opportunity to criticize proposed state legislation—House Bill 350—which would impose budgetary controls on hospitals.
He cited Vermont’s similar approach as a cautionary tale, pointing to high insurance premiums, hospital closures, and a #35 ranking in hospital quality as indicators of policy failure.
“Vermont still has some of the highest healthcare costs in the nation while most hospitals are operating at a loss, cutting jobs and services, and several are on the verge of closing, which is why no other state in the country is looking to them for advice on healthcare policy,” he said. “This is the moment to stand up for Delaware and demand real solutions that support a strong healthcare workforce and access to quality care for our uniquely aging and growing state.”
Delaware’s healthcare system has earned multiple accolades in recent years. Several hospitals in the state have received five-star ratings from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and others have been recognized by Newsweek and U.S. News as top regional and world-class institutions.
The state is also among the top 10 nationwide for patient safety, according to data from The Leapfrog Group.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cq5dam.web_.1280.1280.jpg,,,2025-05-08 11:07:08.912964

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-08 14:11:29+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘A casino in every pocket’: Mississippi illegal online sports betting thrives as legalization stalls,Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/08/a-casino-in-every-pocket-mississippi-illegal-online-sports-betting-thrives-as-legalization-stalls/,The persistence of a thriving black market and an estimated $40 million to $80 million a year in tax revenue legal sports betting could bring in has prompted a fierce push for Mississippi lawmakers to legalize the practice.,"On the heels of the Legislature’s most recent failed attempt to legalize mobile sports betting in Mississippi, a 52-year-old gambling enthusiast named Gary drew a distinction between himself and his fellow bettors: He is a winner, and most of them are losers. 
“To say it honestly, most people are losers when it comes to sports betting because they lose control. But I hope they legalize it because I have control over my gambling,” Gary said. “Certain members of my family call me a degenerate, but I guarantee you I’m not a losing sports bettor.”
Gary, whose full name Mississippi Today agreed not to publish so he could speak candidly about placing illegal sports bets, is among the Mississippi residents who have together placed, according to some analysts, billions of dollars in online sports bets through illicit offshore betting platforms. He is also among the dozens of people who told Mississippi Today, in a written survey and interviews, about what legalization would mean for those who currently bet illegally. 
What emerged is a portrait of the state’s shadow sports betting economy alongside growing concern among experts about the potential for gambling addiction. 
A thriving black market 
The push to legalize mobile sports betting in Mississippi has prompted a debate that has captured the attention of powerful moneyed interests and ordinary citizens alike. It has unfolded in bustling casinos on the Coast, church pews in the Delta and the group text chains of sports-obsessed college students. 
Favorable regulatory and technological shifts have led to rapid growth for the online gambling market in recent years. But the industry continues to be undercut by illegal operators. Online gross gaming revenue in the U.S. topped $90 billion in 2024, $67 billion of which went to unlicensed players, according to research commissioned by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, a group that lobbies against illegal gambling.
Mobile sports betting statewide has remained illegal in Mississippi, largely due to fears that legalization could harm the bottom line of the state’s casinos and increase gambling addiction. In 2024, illegal online betting in Mississippi made up about 5% of the national illegal market, which is about $3 billion in illegal bets in Mississippi, proponents said that year. 
From the start of the most recent NFL season to about March, Mississippi had recorded 8.69 million failed attempts to access legal mobile sportsbooks in other states, according to materials presented to House members at a legislative meeting.
Those who engage in illegal online sports gambling and spoke to Mississippi Today described a black market that bridges newfangled technologies with the illicit gambling practices of yesteryear. Some use “arbitrage betting tools” and virtual private networks, or VPNs, to bet across the globe on different sites, pitting casinos against each other. Others keep themselves a degree removed from placing bets directly, using “bookies” to place bets on offshore gambling sites.
However people place illegal sports bets, the persistence of a thriving black market and an estimated $40 million to $80 million a year in tax revenue legal sports betting could bring in has prompted a fierce push for lawmakers to legalize the practice. The sports gambling lobby, as it has done in other states, has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Mississippi politicians trying to win the Legislature’s support. 
The Mississippi House in 2023 and 2024 passed legislation legalizing online betting, but it died in the Senate.
Some form of sports betting is legal in 40 states, though only 20 have full online betting with multiple operators, according to Action Network, a sports betting application and news site. Some states have only in-person betting, and some only have a single online operator. Mississippi permits sports betting, but it only allows bets made in person at casinos or bets made with apps on mobile devices while inside casinos. 
That is how Greg, 38, placed his bets in Mississippi.
‘Hyper-targeted victimization’
Greg earned his master’s degree at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. When he was a student, Greg would make the roughly one-hour drive north to Tunica, home of several casinos along the Mississippi River. The area was one of the first to capitalize after Mississippi enacted the Mississippi Gaming Control Act in the early 1990s, which legalized dockside casino gambling. 
For Greg, driving through the rural Delta landscape to a casino was as a guardrail against over-indulgence, one that has been lost with the advent of smartphones and easy access to offshore betting platforms.   
“That’s a conscious effort, that you think the whole way, ‘is that money you need to be gambling or losing, versus (now) when you’re dialing it up on your phone,” he said. 
Greg has since moved to Kansas, a state that fully legalized mobile sports betting. He now bets on football and college basketball two to four times a week with wagers ranging from $55 to $500. He places bets on three different apps, all of which compete with special promotions enticing him to return. These deals are not typically matched by brick-and-mortar casinos 
“I can’t imagine walking into the Horseshoe in Tunica and them saying, bet $100 cash and we’ll give you a free $50.” 
Online betting is conducive to marketing campaigns that are precise in their execution and relentless in their frequency, experts told Mississippi Today. The rise of mobile sports betting has been accompanied by the introduction of new technologies in advertising and marketing, including those buoyed by artificial intelligence.
“You can absorb their betting patterns and use AI to predict when to send that notification reminding them to place a bet,” said Dan Durkin, an Associate Professor of Social Work at the University of Mississippi. “It’s hyper-targeted victimization, let’s just call it what it is.”
Durkin is chair of the steering committee for the Coalition on Intercollegiate Athletics, an organization that works to promote student well-being in intercollegiate athletics. The coalition has monitored the spread of mobile sports betting as college campuses have become hubs of activity for sports betting and, increasingly, gambling addiction.
According to a 2023 survey conducted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, sports wagering is pervasive among college students, with 67% of students betting on sports. Nearly 60% of students are likely to bet on sports after seeing an advertisement, the survey found. 
And more than 60% engaged in sports gambling are betting on sports using highly addictive “in game/micro bets.” This type of betting allows users to wager on specific in-game moments, such as the next football play or golf swing. That sort of betting would become easier if sports betting is legalized because, under current law, many bettors say they still rely on bookies to place bets on offshore gambling sites for them.
These forms of online gambling, made seamless and accessible through digital apps, can allow addiction to fly under the radar. 
Gambling addiction has the highest suicide rate of any addiction disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health. The disorder’s ability to fester in private makes intervention more daunting, Durkin said.
PODCAST: Mississippi citizens often left in the dark on special-interest lobbying of politicians
“If you have a drug problem, you are going to have physical symptoms. If you have an alcohol problem, you are going to have physical symptoms. Gambling disorder can remain hidden for a very long time. Most of the folks that have it stay very functional,” Durkin said.
“Until they’re not.”
‘Gambler is going to find a way to bet’
For some students, the appeal of mobile sports betting stems not from cleverly-constructed digital marketing schemes, but as a source of camaraderie.
Cole, a 19-year-old college student, likes to bet on soccer and March Madness and the NBA Playoffs. He and a group of friends recently placed bets on the Master’s golf tournament
“It’s fun to do with your friends cause you’re all watching the game together, you get that adrenaline rush, and you celebrate together,” he said. “It’s not life-changing money, it’s mostly a social thing.”
Nevertheless, some Mississippi universities have become so alarmed by the rise of online gambling on their campuses, they are taking steps to prepare for increased addiction, even as mobile sports betting remains illegal. In Oxford, the University of Mississippi plans to hire a gambling clinician to help students struggling with addiction, according to The Daily Mississippian.
Influential religious institutions in Mississippi, a Bible Belt state, have long opposed the spread of gambling, a stance many retained as mobile sports betting came before the Legislature. 
During the 2025 legislative session, David Tipton, District Superintendent for the Mississippi District United Pentecostal Church, sent a letter to the Mississippi Legislature opposing legalization on the grounds that it would harm young people in particular.
“The introduction of mobile sports betting would represent the most significant expansion of gambling in Mississippi since the legalization of casinos over thirty years ago,” Tipton wrote. “This development would effectively place a casino in the pocket of every Mississippian, creating new challenges, particularly for our youth and young adults who are the most vulnerable to gambling-related harm.”

“I’m a libertarian. It’s not my job to tell people how to live their life,” said Gary, the 52-year-old sports gambler. “If you can’t control yourself, I’m sorry, learn some control. Is that brutal? Probably, yes. If you want help, there’s way to get help. You can self-ban yourself.”

Gary says every gambler is responsible for managing their own “leak.”
The term often refers to a consistent weakness in a bettor’s strategy, but Gary also uses it to connote a weakness of will.  
“Every gambler has a leak, as we call them. Drugs, women, money, strippers, or the dice table, which was my leak. I could win every sports bet, but I’m going to walk through the casino and go to the dice table and lose money on a dice table,” Gary said.

Kristi Noem delivers her 2025 State of the State address to lawmakers at the Capitol in Pierre on Jan. 14, 2025. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)After a career in journalism that has let me have my say about a wide range of issues, it’s galling to me whenever a group wants to shut down someone else’s speech. 
At issue this weekend is an honorary degree that Dakota State University in Madison plans to bestow on former South Dakota governor and current Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. She will also deliver the university’s commencement address on Saturday.
DSU officials — who said they extended the invitation while Noem was still governor — want to honor Noem for her support of the university’s cyber initiatives and her backing of the creation of the Center for Quantum Information Science and Technology in partnership with South Dakota Mines, another state university in Rapid City. 
Graduation now likely for college student with revoked visa, but later deportation still possible

Noem’s contributions to those efforts are noteworthy. She helped DSU secure $30 million in state funding, launching it on a path toward leadership in cybersecurity research and essentially creating a new industry in South Dakota, all the while providing an important, lucrative path for DSU graduates to follow. 
A nonprofit, South Dakota Voices for Peace, has started a petition drive asking DSU to rescind its invitation to Noem. Voices for Peace makes its case, in part, by citing Noem’s actions on immigration in her current position.
Noem certainly has plenty to answer for. No doubt there will be international students in the DSU audience wondering just how welcome they are, and just how safe they are as the Trump administration makes the case for deporting as many immigrants as possible. 
The reality of that uncertainty for foreign students has reached into South Dakota with cases including Priya Saxena, a graduate student from India studying at South Dakota Mines. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of Noem’s Department of Homeland Security, is trying to deport Saxena due to a criminal records check that turned up a four-year-old traffic ticket. 
Saxena has sued to protect herself from deportation, and has so far succeeded. She’s scheduled to receive doctoral and master’s degrees Saturday in Rapid City, around the same time Noem will speak on the other side of the state in Madison.
In response to that controversy and a planned protest at DSU, Noem should use part of her commencement speech to explain why she thinks deporting a graduate student because of a traffic ticket serves the cause of public safety or national security. In reality, Noem, being a seasoned politician, will know how to tap dance around the elephant in the room. She might simply offer some praise for her past performance as governor, some graduation day bromides about tackling the challenges of the future, and some lofty talk about setting and meeting goals.










If we took the microphone away from everyone we disagreed with, the country would be blissfully quiet, but we would all be just as blissfully ignorant.


The speech at least presents an opportunity for Noem’s critics to protest, for her to respond, and for the public to hear that response. That opportunity will be lost if the petition from Voices for Peace succeeds. The group’s work advocating for immigrants is laudable, and because of that mission, its disdain for Noem is understandable. But that doesn’t mean Noem should be silenced. If we took the microphone away from everyone we disagreed with, the country would be blissfully quiet, but we would all be just as blissfully ignorant. 
Voices for Peace wants to punish Noem by taking away her honorary degree and her chance to speak. That’s not the right lesson for the students at DSU or for the rest of us. That lesson should center on supporting free speech, both for Noem and the people who oppose her.

The western Oregon transit service is warning of potential service cuts if the state does not provide more funding. (Courtesy of Tillamook County Transportation District)Compared with major American cities, the ridership on public buses in Minot, North Dakota, can seem relatively minuscule.
But the 82,000 rides taken each year allow people without cars to get to work, help those with disabilities get around and connect patients with crucial health care.
“The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system,” said Brian Horinka, the city’s transit superintendent.
Like in many cities — from sprawling metropolitan areas to smaller and rural communities — the financial future of public transit is questionable in Minot, population 48,000. While increasing, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. Federal funding and state budgets remain uncertain, while inflation is pinching transit services.
For example, Horinka said he’s looking to buy a new 30-foot heavy-duty bus. He expects it will cost up to $700,000 because of inflation. Just five years ago, a similar model could be had for about $400,000, he said.
“We’re in dire straits, from a financial standpoint,” he said.
North Dakota’s four largest cities, including Minot, asked lawmakers for millions in extra grant dollars this year to keep transit buses rolling. The state enacted a new law awarding $2 million in grants — a welcome reprieve, but far less than the $15 million initially requested.
Republican state Rep. Dan Ruby, a sponsor of the legislation, said cities will likely need to increase local funding for bus systems.
“I don’t think it’s enough,” he said. “I think it is going to just be somewhat of a stopgap for some of them to be able to function.”

The law also calls for a study to develop a proposed funding formula for fixed-route bus systems. Ruby said he would prefer a permanent funding model that doesn’t require cities to continually rely on legislative grants.
“We also want to make sure that they’re not sitting on funds or running inefficiently just because they have the funding,” he said. “That’s the key to get support from most of the legislators, to show that they really do have a need and there’s no way to find any more cuts in their operations without affecting the people that need the rides.”
It’s indicative of discussions occurring in state capitals across the country as public transit faces existential funding challenges.
Public transit systems in major cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco face the potential of deep service cuts without more funding. But the problems also extend to smaller systems that connect people in rural America and smaller cities.
Partisan debates over transit funding
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the transit financial crisis affects residents in all 67 of the commonwealth’s counties.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said at a news conference in April.
Transit funding has been stuck in a partisan battle in Harrisburg.
In November, to stave off cuts, Shapiro ordered the transfer of more than $150 million in federal highway funds to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, which serves the greater Philadelphia area with bus and regional rail lines. He’s also backed legislation to increase transit funding, which has found support in the Democratic-controlled state House but so far has not advanced in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
Late last month, House Republican Leader Jesse Topper proposed partially privatizing the Philadelphia-area transit agency rather than increasing funding, which he said in a statement would “only serve to patch over the problems of a system chronically in crisis.”
“The same old, same old is clearly not working,” he said, according to a report by public radio station WESA.
The transit agency has said it already operates one of the most efficient systems in the nation. On a special website it created to call attention to its $213 million budget deficit, SEPTA said there’s “nothing left to cut from the budget but service.”
The authority has said it may be forced to cut services by 45% and raise fares by 20% without help from the state.
Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents a portion of North Philadelphia, said that would be “catastrophic” for the region.
“It makes this not only a less appealing place to live for people who are considering moving here,” he said, “but it also makes it difficult to live for folks who call this area home.”
Kenyatta, who dismissed the idea of privatization, said the state has a moral and economic obligation to ensure sustainable funding for public transportation.
“We’ve done patches here and there,” he said. “And that patchwork approach is not one that inspires the type of confidence and allows our transit agencies to do the type of long-term planning that they need to do.”
Transit’s pandemic ‘death spiral’
Mass transit saw some of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 as people worked from home and avoided public spaces.
The federal government provided nearly $70 billion in pandemic aid to transit programs, which saw revenues drop sharply because of reduced fare collections.
But with the rise of remote and hybrid work, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels even as costs for labor and equipment skyrocket. A recent Bloomberg News analysis estimates the nation’s largest transit systems are facing a $6 billion shortfall — only heightening fears of a so-called death spiral in which a combination of service cuts and fare increases cause further erosion of riders and revenue.
In Oregon, Democratic lawmakers have proposed increasing the state’s dedicated transit payroll tax. Billed as “a starting point,” the plan would increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.18% — estimated to raise $269 million over each two-year budget cycle.
“That’s appreciated, but it’s nowhere near what it needs to be,” said Brian Vitulli, general manager of the Tillamook County Transportation District in western Oregon. “There could be some service reductions in the near future if we don’t get more funding.”
Aside from rising costs, Vitulli faces major hiring challenges: The district has 19 drivers but could use eight to 10 more. With too few drivers, bus service has been cut to six days a week.
For some riders, the transit services provide a lifeline. After last year’s closure of Tillamook’s only dialysis center, for example, the agency began offering rides to other dialysis clinics well outside its service area.
That has driven up costs and tied up drivers, making services such as the on-demand Dial-A-Ride less available for other residents.
“We’re kind of the only option for these dialysis patients,” he said. “And we’re kind of prioritizing those trips rather than somebody who just wants to go to the Elks Club for lunch or something.”
Vitulli also serves on the board of the Oregon Transit Association, which is lobbying instead for a 0.4% increase in the transit payroll tax phased in over eight years. The association said the current 0.08% proposal could force transit providers across the state to cut services by as much as 25% in the next few years as inflation and decreased fare collections push many into deficits.
TriMet, which operates rail, bus and paratransit services across 533 square miles of the Portland region, said it would still need to cut services even if the lawmakers’ proposed 0.08% funding increase were approved. The agency faces a deficit of nearly $75 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
Oregon lawmakers are broadly concerned about federal spending cuts, which could turn the state’s modest budget surplus into a gaping deficit, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. Nearly a third of the state’s budget comes from federal money.
Democratic state Rep. Susan McLain said budget uncertainty has heightened scrutiny of all state spending this session. She is one of the authors of the state’s transportation proposal, crafted after nearly two years of meetings across the state. Aside from increasing the transit payroll tax, it calls for boosting the gas tax and hiking vehicle registration costs to help pay for road improvements.
McLain, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Transportation, said budget negotiations are ongoing, with aims of having hearings later this month.
While the state wants to do more to ensure everyone can access medical care, schools and jobs, McLain noted that belt-tightening is imperative for all manner of agencies, including transit.
“We’re really trying to dig in and find ways to do more with less,” she said, “but also to make sure that we’ve got sufficient, adequate types of investment in areas that we value.”

Susan Estes, a Wichita Republican and vice chair of the state task force devoted to rewriting the public school finance formula, said she would welcome inclusion in the formula a mandate that public school teachers earn at least $45,000 annually so compensation was above the federal poverty level for a family of four. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two Republicans leading the Kansas task force developing a new public education finance formula expressed frustration that superintendents were being recruited to join a prospective lawsuit amid speculation the reform process would result in elimination of districts with fewer than 100 students.
Wichita GOP Sen. Renee Erickson and Rep. Susan Estes, who serve as chair and vice chair of the task force, said Wednesday disruptive speculation was rampant despite no formal policy votes by the task force on reshaping the frequently litigated formula.
“I’ve been disturbed that I’m getting phone calls from superintendents who are saying they are being told, ‘We’re going to need a lawsuit. Oh, districts with less than 100 students are going to cease to exist,'” Estes said.
Erickson said she was approached by superintendents who said they had taken part in meetings of the Kansas Council of Superintendents in which superintendents were told the task force would write the 10 school districts with fewer than 100 students out of the formula. She declined to identify the source of that claim, but characterized the assertion as “fearmongering.”
“There has been a poisoning of the well against this process already, and superintendents are worried,” Erickson said. “It doesn’t benefit anyone to poison the well and already start gearing up for an expensive lawsuit without having anything to sue over yet. That mentality is not helpful to anyone in this process.”
In 2017, the Kansas Supreme Court found the formula devised by the Legislature to be in violation of Article 6 of the Kansas Constitution. The decision was the culmination of years of litigation by Schools for Fair Funding which represented individual school districts that served as plaintiffs in the case.
Task force members Jim Porter, a Fredonia member of the Kansas State Board of Education, and Brad Neuenswander, superintendent of the Jefferson West School District, said they hadn’t participated in presentations to superintendents about a hypothetical lawsuit.
“That discussion has not happened in my presence,” Porter said.
Frank Harwood, a deputy commissioner at the Kansas Department of Education and a task force member, said he was skeptical the state would do away with the rural districts that enrolled fewer than 100 students.
“I don’t think Kansas can ever get rid of all districts below 100 because we just have areas where that’s what they need,” he said.
The current Kansas school finance formula expires in June 2027, but GOP leaders of the task force expect to submit a revised formula to the 2026 Legislature in January. Republicans hold supermajorities in the House and Senate, which suggested a school finance bill could pass on party-line votes. If the Legislature waited until the 2027 session to complete work on a new formula, the bill would be presented to a new governor because Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s second term would end in January 2027.
 
Teacher salaries
During the task force meeting at the Capitol, Estes triggered a lengthy discussion about whether the finance formula should set a statewide baseline for public school teacher salaries. She said a mandate that local school districts comply with a minimum teacher salary of $45,000 per year might be appropriate. Federal poverty status for a family of four was $41,000, she said.
“It’s reasonable to have a discussion that sets a minimum standard of teacher salary above the federal poverty limit,” Estes said. “There’s nothing more important in a classroom, that we touch, than teachers.”
Teacher salaries should remain a function of local school boards and district administrators while remaining outside of the state’s school finance formula, said GOP Sen. Beverly Gossage, a Eudora member of the task force.
Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, told colleagues on the task force the Legislature could direct districts to pass a percentage of state appropriations to teachers in the form of salary. She also said public school teachers had 190 contract days each year and had the option of securing a second job in summer months when schools were closed.
Erickson, the task force chair, challenged the premise higher teacher salaries would improve educational prospects of students.
“We overpay our ineffective teachers way too much,” Erickson said. “The longer they’re embedded in the system, the harder it is to get rid of the teachers who are not doing right by our kiddos. The sad truth of the matter is those are the teachers that are the highest paid because they’ve been there the longest.”
Erickson said it was discouraging for “young, effective teachers” to observe educators with 30 years of experience arrive at school just before the morning bell rang and beat half the students to the parking lot at the end of the day.
Kansas employs about 37,000 public school teachers, but districts reported 1,900 vacancies in fall 2024.
 
Pre-K funding
The task force debated whether the revised formula should continue to include state funding for at-risk pre-kindergarten children aged 3 and 4.
No vote was taken by the task force, but it appeared a majority was content to concentrate the formula on K-12 programs and leave pre-K initiatives to local school districts.
Williams, the Augusta House member, said Kansas hadn’t done a satisfactory job handling K-12 education and shouldn’t be part of preschool education. She said the federally funded Head Start program for 3- and 4-year-old children hadn’t lived up to expectations and the opening of Kansas public schools to pre-K programs undermined private schools that operated in that realm.
“We have put out of business many Christian schools, preschools and other types of classical education because they can’t compete with a free education,” Williams said.
Williams, who has been an advocate in the Legislature for distribution of state tax dollars to private schools, said that if the state wanted to continue investing in pre-K programs the funding should be made available to parents so they could decide where to enroll their children in preschool.
“I get heartburn when we talk about giving state funding to private entities, especially if they’re not accredited,” said Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat on the task force.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3190634-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-08 10:08:50.036867

Members began work about 8:30 p.m. and settled their differences on eight spending bills at 11:30 p.m. (Screenshot from livestream video via Missouri House Communications)Missouri’s public schools would be fully funded and a policy some blame for undermining a child care subsidy program would be fixed, legislative budget negotiators decided Wednesday night as they worked through eight of the 13 spending bills for state operations in the coming year.
Over about three hours, the conference committees of five lawmakers from both the House and Senate resolved differences between the spending bills, more often than not by selecting the option that spent more money.
Tracking by The Independent shows the eight bills completed Wednesday would spend $450 million more general revenue than Gov. Mike Kehoe’s January budget proposal, $636 million more than the House version approved in April and $118 million more than the version approved in the Senate last week.
The committees will reconvene Thursday to finalize spending decisions on five more bills, with the full House and Senate scheduled to vote Friday in advance of the constitutional deadline.
The differences that must be resolved are between the $49.4 billion plan for day-to-day operations approved in the Senate and the $47.9 billion plan approved in the House.
The education budget that will go to the chambers for final approval includes $4 billion for the public school foundation formula, including a $297 million increase that Kehoe opposed. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education budget will also include $107 million Kehoe recommended to revamp how child care providers are paid, basing it on enrollment instead of attendance.
House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, tried to defend the decision to back Kehoe’s view that the money shouldn’t be spent. But he was outnumbered, with Democratic House members joining unanimous backing from senators for Senate Appropriations Chairman Lincoln Hough’s position that state law required the money to be appropriated.
“This is the most important thing we’re going to do today, and this is a statutory minimum that we have in a commitment that we’ve made to our kids back home,” state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said as she advocated for the foundation formula increase.
As he agreed to the increase, Deaton looked forward to the commission Kehoe created to consider changes to the formula.
“I do hope, when you look at the formula, if we have an opportunity to rewrite it, that we won’t let unelected bureaucrats make a $300 million call or something similar to future general assemblies,” Deaton said.
Along with the two big items in the education department, the conference committees:

Adopted Kehoe’s pay plan proposal for state employee raises, which will reward longevity. State workers will get a 1% raise for every two years of state employment, capped at 10% for 20 years.
Agreed to increase the base budgets for all state colleges and universities by 3%, which was the amount approved in the Senate. The House had adopted Kehoe’s recommendation for a 1.5% boost and added $27.1 million for campus maintenance needs, which was cut by the negotiators.
Removed language directing the Missouri Lottery to begin a three-year pilot program for lottery courier services.

The budget negotiators began working about 8:30 p.m., about 12 hours later than the scheduled start.

The day began with tensions between Deaton and Hough. As Hough was wrapping up a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee two rooms away, Deaton was announcing that because Hough was absent, the conference meetings would begin at 10 p.m.
Deaton said he was kept waiting six hours Monday before Hough met with him. They worked for about seven hours to resolve issues that they could present to the conference committees, then for 15 minutes on Tuesday.
He said he was not informed of Hough’s intent to be ready to work in the afternoon after a recess of the committee for short floor sessions.
“I’ve not heard anything since yesterday at 1 o’clock,” Deaton said.
Hough said he worked with Senate leadership to plan time for the conference meeting. He thought it was communicated to the House. 
“It was stated by me on multiple occasions that my intention was to get together this afternoon after a few hours of floor time,” Hough said.
Hough tried to get the conference committees together about 3 p.m., after both chambers had adjourned for the day, but Deaton was not willing and did not appear.
The budget negotiations, when they finally began, went relatively quickly and without rancor. Deaton and Hough took turns reading through the budget lines and stating the intent to take the House or Senate position, or a compromise number in between.
Members interrupted often, usually to challenge a decision about an item among the 166 new earmarked items for programs or projects added to the eight bills. Only 12 added at some point didn’t make the final cut.
State Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat, spoke up in favor of one threatened with a cut, $50,000 for Global One Urban Farming in Kansas City.
“This really helps the children in that community with growing food,” Washington said. “It is only $50,000. It’s so little. I know I ask for a lot, but I don’t ask for a lot of money.”
Instead of being cut, the organization will receive $25,000.
Hough and Deaton both got the earmarks most identified with them in the budget. Deaton cut $8 million to restore a historic footbridge in Springfield and Hough cut $19 million to buy land for a state park in McDonald County.
Unsurprisingly, both made it into the budget.
State Sen. Brian Williams, a University City Democrat, questioned Deaton on the decision to cut $500,000 slated for an urgent care program for veterans in Kansas City. It was one of three earmarked items for veterans alongside $1 million for temporary housing for veterans in St. Louis and $1 million for a veterans housing program in Columbia.
Williams said one consideration for earmarked appropriations of general revenue should be where the money is generated in taxes. Kansas City and St. Louis need to be treated fairly as the richest areas of the state, he said.
“Jackson County makes up a significant amount of the economy in our state, we need to ensure that our budget reflects that,” Williams said.
Deaton said one factor in the decision was the amount being dedicated to veterans programs and the limited nature of state funds.
“There’s the give and the take, there’s money in, money out,” Deaton said. “We can’t do everything, unfortunately and be all things for all people at all times. We’re doing a lot for veterans in this budget.”
The final budget will have $500,000 for the Kansas City urgent care program and $500,000 for the St. Louis temporary housing program.
No one challenged Hough or Deaton when they said they were approving earmarked spending that was in or near their districts. Fogle, however, challenged Hough when he cut $4 million from an economic development organization called Innovate SOMO. 
“I know you feel like you gotta give a little bit, but I would rather not give with our community,” Fogle said.
“I think,” Hough replied, “our community is fairly well served in this legislature.”

With an uneven crackdown on hemp-derived products, which contain the same active ingredient as cannabis but are not regulated the same way, legislators are looking to put the Cannabis Control Commission in charge.
The post Legislators are pushing for more forceful action on intoxicating hemp-derived products appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","STATE LEGISLATORS THIS session are looking to take hemp-derived intoxicating products – which contain the same active ingredient as cannabis but are not regulated the same way – off shelves in gas stations, convenience stores, and vape shops across Massachusetts.The hemp products, which are generally edible and intoxicating like gummies or candies, have already been declared illegal in the state by several state agencies but continue to pop up in certain stores outside of dispensaries. Most of these products come from out of state.Some business owners who sell the intoxicating products argue that the state agencies haven’t settled the matter because hemp is legal federally – through a loophole in the 2018 federal farm bill which legalized hemp. Hemp and cannabis are the same plant, but this law removed hemp from the classification of cannabis as long as it contains less than 0.3 percent THC – the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis – by volume.Four bills have been filed on Beacon Hill to bring any consumable hemp-derived products like edibles, concentrates, tinctures, oils, and capsules, under the purview of the Cannabis Control Commission or give local boards of health oversight to remove these products from stores other than dispensaries. Hemp products that are sold in dispensaries like CBD gummies are already regulated by the commission. These bills would specifically target intoxicating products being sold outside of dispensaries.“[Hemp products] face no additional tax impositions, no host community agreements, no recall process, no FDA testing requirements, no age limits,” said Rep. Dawne Shand, a Newburyport Democrat, at a Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy hearing on Wednesday. “The intoxicating hemp industry makes a mockery of cannabis laws.”Shand, a member of the committee, is pushing a bill that would prohibit intoxicating hemp products from being sold without an endorsement from the Cannabis Control Commission. Rep. Michael Soter, a Republican from Bellingham, has two bills that would address hemp-derived products. The fourth bill, presented by James C. Arena-DeRosa, imposes an excise tax on the sale of hemp products in addition to the existing state tax and directs that money to be used to empower local health board to remove certain hemp products from stores.“I think [hemp] should be up to the control of the Cannabis Control Commission,” said Soter, in an interview before the hearing. “You’ve got people who are following the rules … and then you’ve got some things that are kind of being sold in convenience stores and gas stations. Some of this stuff is really geared towards kids, and that’s not a good thing.”Soter emphasized that he wants to be very careful in creating legislation to deal with hemp products because he doesn’t want to inadvertently harm businesses that sell non-intoxicating hemp products, like oils or creams that contain CBD and are meant to be applied topically.“What scares me about regulating this is that sometimes we over-regulate and we put more problems on an industry,” said Soter. “We’ve got to walk that fine line. I want to keep us on a straight path of going after what we need to go after and what we don’t need to go after and make sure when we do this regulation, we do it correctly.”At the hearing, Jesse Alderman, a lawyer who specializes in cannabis, and Peter Gallagher, the CEO of the cannabis company INSA, brought a bag of intoxicating hemp products that they said they collected from over 20 different gas stations, convenience stores, and vape shops.Many of these products had high concentrations of THC. One of the packages contained 10,000 milligrams of THC. For cannabis, the state allows only 100 milligrams per package and 5 milligrams per serving. They passed the bag around to the legislators, who commented that the products smelled like cannabis.“If it smells like it, looks like it, I think it is it,” said Adam Gomez, the Senate chair of the cannabis committee.   Gallagher said that they tested these products and that over 90 percent of them would qualify as cannabis products because they contained well over 0.3 percent of THC. About a third of the products wouldn’t have passed the regulatory testing required on cannabis products because of the presence of microbes, pesticides, heavy metals, and residual solvents. None of the establishments where he purchased the hemp products checked for identification to enforce age limits, he added. “This really looks a lot like what we saw in 2019 with the vape crisis where illegal, unregulated, untested vape cartridges [were] being sold with cutting agents in them and [that] ultimately led to people harming themselves,” said Gallagher. “A lot of consumers today don’t understand that what’s being purchased in these gas stations, convenience stores, vape shops or even online is different and potentially more damaging than what you’re able to purchase in the regulated dispensaries.”In Massachusetts, several state agencies issued guidance in May 2024 that said that these types of products are illegal. The Alcohol Beverage Control Commission warned its licensees that their licenses could be suspended or revoked if they were caught selling hemp-derived products.  Soon after, many of these products were taken out of liquor stores, smoke shops, restaurants, and many other places that were selling them. But the crackdown on these products has remained uneven because the enforcement on these products has largely remained in the hands of local boards of health, which are already overburdened and don’t have the resources to go from store to store.Last session, legislators decided not to intervene on the issue of hemp-derived products, but representatives of local boards of health said that they are unable to get these products out of stores and out of the hands of children without more resources allocated to them for this issue.John Nathan, the CEO of a company called Bay State Extracts, which produces hemp-derived compounds like CBD, said that the legislation proposed at the hearing would be redundant because these products – as per the guidance from the state agencies – are already illegal. He also expressed concern about the Cannabis Control Commission’s ability to actually regulate hemp products effectively. The commission has had internal conflict, allegations of misconduct, and a slow-moving regulatory process that has frustrated many within the cannabis industry.“The CCC has barely enforced their existing hemp regulations and guidance is as it stands,” said Nathan. “The cannabis industry is in turmoil. There’s over saturation, struggles for bill payments, layoffs, competitive and low-paying job market, what seems like monthly closures. I feel effort should be directed towards supporting the existing market and coordinating to fix these issues, rather than disrupting the supply chain in an effort to make something already illegal illegal again.”The post Legislators are pushing for more forceful action on intoxicating hemp-derived products appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240716_162212-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-08 10:08:50.036867

Three Delaware police departments have been reaccredited by the Delaware Police Accreditation Commission (DPAC), according to an announcement from the Delaware Police Officer Standards and Training Commission (POST), a Department of Safety and Homeland Security division.
The Newport Police Department and Ocean View Police Department each received three-year reaccreditations, while the Greenwood Police Department earned a two-year reaccreditation. The reaccreditation process included a review of each department’s policies, procedures, and practices, as well as an on-site inspection and interviews with personnel to ensure compliance with accreditation standards.

DPAC accreditation is a key part of state legislation under House Bill 206, which requires all Delaware law enforcement agencies to achieve accreditation by 2028. According to POST, departments statewide are actively working toward meeting that requirement.

Adak is served by the Essential Air Service, targeted by President Donald Trump's administration for cuts. (Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development; Division of Community and Regional Affairs’ Community Photo Library)A program that has subsidized commercial aviation rural routes and that is particularly significant in Alaska is a target for a more than 50% reduction in funding under President Donald Trump’s budget proposal. 
On May 2, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought released Trump’s recommendations for 2026 federal funding levels. One target for significant reduction was the nearly 50-year-old Essential Air Service program. In its rationale for the cut, the Trump administration wrote that EAS “funnels taxpayer dollars to airlines to subsidize half-empty flights from airports that are within easy commuting distance from each other.” 
It proposed slashing EAS current funding by about 52%, or $308 million. The administration offered no suggestion on what might replace EAS in airports that lose the service.
Congress established EAS in 1978 after the deregulation of the country’s airlines, in response to concerns that small communities would lose air service when carriers sought out more populated and profitable destinations. While the original EAS list included 184 Alaskan communities, with Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau initially appearing, it has been steadily reduced and, in the latest list, from October 2024, now has 65. 
EAS is funded primarily through fees collected by the Federal Aviation Administration from foreign air carriers to fly through U.S. airspace, as well as the Airport and Airways Trust Fund, which collects excise taxes from domestic passenger ticket sales and other users of the country’s aviation system. In a U.S. Department of Transportation report for October 2024, there are 177 communities receiving a combined $591.7 million in EAS subsidies; Alaska received $41.7 million of that total. There are about 15 airlines flying EAS routes in the state, with Grant Aviation operating the most, 21, and several carriers flying a single route. 
For Michele Greenamyre, McGrath’s interim city administrator, EAS has been “a game changer”. The Interior village of about 300 is not connected to other communities by road. Its residents fly on Alaska Air Transit for its EAS transportation. Greenamyre said for her community, EAS is about access to things like groceries, school clothes and a lot more. 
“I would not be able to travel to Anchorage for medical reasons without EAS,” she explained, “The round-trip airfare would be too much.” 
Connecting McGrath residents, who live 220 miles from Anchorage and almost 270 miles from Fairbanks, to the rest of the state is a significant part of what EAS offers, Greenamyre said. 
“What would it do to our little town to lose this?” she asked. “EAS allows us to be part of the larger world.” 
The Trump administration cited rising costs in its budget proposal assailing the program; EAS subsidies have risen over 50% since 2021. The General Accounting Office determined in a 2024 report on commercial air service trends that increased costs were due to higher airline operating costs overall, primarily for fuel, pilot wages and maintenance.  The report noted that the national pilot shortage alone resulted in wage increases among smaller air carriers of more than 100%. But focusing on cost without considering benefits makes it tough to weigh EAS’s value, according to local officials in Alaska. 
Adak, located at the end of the Aleutian Island chain, has a steady population of fewer than 200. Residents use an airport that was built for the now-closed Naval Air Facility Adak, which has runways that accommodate Alaska Airlines’ monthly cargo flight and twice-weekly passenger service, all in Boeing 737s. Alaska Air EAS service is quite popular and includes seasonal commercial fishing crews and military contractors who are currently working on a variety of projects involving the potential reopening of the military facility. 
“From a national strategic perspective,” said City Manager Breck Craig, “cutting off EAS to Adak would be a monumental mistake.” The town’s geographic position and existing infrastructure has brought increased attention from the military, which plans to include Adak in a training exercise, Northern Edge, this summer. 
The military past — and potential future — makes Adak unusual in the EAS group but illustrates the program’s versatility, Craig said.  
“As the need for contractor transportation increases, EAS will be even more important,” stressed Craig, who noted that the current travel time on the 737 to Anchorage is three hours. “Without Alaska Airlines and EAS,” he concluded, “traveling to Adak will be very difficult.”  
Essential Air Service has been targeted for cost cutting in the past. In 2007, then U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, called on fellow rural senators to “remain vigilant” in funding EAS, which he deemed a “lifeline” in their communities. In 2012, the Alaska delegation joined a bipartisan group of legislators in preserving EAS, with then Congressman Don Young noting he was “especially proud” that no Alaska communities suffered cuts in service. President Trump previously sought to eliminate EAS in 2017, uttering similar language to his recent proposal by referring to “half full aircraft” that he deemed were in close proximity to major airports. That effort was also defeated by a bipartisan group, including Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who signed a letter at the time urging appropriators to provide “robust funding” for the program.

As nonprofits, programs and advocates across the country brace for deep cuts from President Donald Trump and his administration during this year’s budget process, one popular early childhood program appears to be safe, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
The 60-year-old Head Start program provides low-income families early childhood education, meals and parenting support. Last year it served 800,000 children from birth through age 5, including 83,000 kids in California.
The program is relatively cost-efficient: Compared to a private preschool in California, which can cost more than $20,000 per pupil a year, Head Start’s per-pupil annual cost is roughly $13,700. But Trump’s initial April budget plan had the $12.27 billion program on the chopping block. 
The potential elimination of the program kicked off an intense crusade led by Head Start staff, families and advocates who argued that the program was vital for keeping families out of poverty. Congress received more than 300,000 letters and petitions to save the program amassed more than 48,000 signatures.
The fierce campaign seems to have been successful: Trump’s latest budget proposal released last week doesn’t touch the program. It’s a striking win given that the agency that oversees Head Start, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is facing dramatic cuts, including a more than 20% reduction in workforce.
But the uncertainty of other programs intertwined with Head Start, such as Medicaid, and the fact that the budget may change mean Head Start isn’t out of the woods just yet. 

Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the National Head Start Association: “Folks are scared. The fact that eliminating Head Start was even under consideration has been scary.”

Schools struggle to implement billing changes

The vision? Allow schools to directly bill health insurers, allowing them to hire more staff and offer more services.
In practice? More than a year after some school districts were supposed to implement the new billing changes, only a small portion have begun doing so, reports CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
In response to rising rates of depression and anxiety among young students, California in 2021 launched a five-year, $4.7 billion initiative to expand mental health services and workforce. One piece of the initiative included a new billing program for schools to charge Medi-Cal and private insurers for mental health services. 
The California Department of Health Care Services, tasked with overseeing implementation of the new billing practices, set July 2024 as a rollout target. But only 14 school districts and county offices of education have begun billing for behavioral health services, out of a total of 494 that have signed up to do so.
School leaders say that delayed guidance and training from the state are contributing to the slow rollout. In Santa Clara County, the delays in reimbursement forced its office of education to notify its mental health staff about possible layoffs.

CA sues Trump administration (again)

In its 19th lawsuit against the current Trump administration, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Wednesday that the state is suing the U.S. Federal Highway Administration for blocking funds geared towards building electric vehicle chargers across the country.
California joins 16 other states in filing the lawsuit, which accuses the administration of illegally withholding $5 billion that Congress had already appropriated to states. In addition to the $300 million California could lose, Bonta said thousands of jobs are at risk.

Bonta, at a press conference in Burlingame: “California has already signed nearly $37 million in contracts … to construct EV chargers, with projects along major travel corridors, ready to move into construction. But the Federal Highway Administration’s actions threaten to delay construction and stop local industries from building these chargers.”

Electric vehicles are critical to California’s ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions. About 30% of new zero-emission vehicles sold in the U.S. are sold in California, according to the California Air Resources Board. But the state lacks a robust network of charging stations — especially if it is to support the 7 million electric cars that are expected to be on its road by 2030.

Former state senator Dean Tran’s ethics violation case goes to the Supreme Judicial Court, tasked with considering just how broad “legislative immunity” protections are for lawmakers who run afoul of conflict of interest law. 
The post High court probes whether former state senator should be immune from conflict of interest charges appeared first on CommonW[...]","AN ATTORNEY FOR former state senator Dean Tran referenced famed attacks on the floor of Congress and 200-year-old case law as he argued before a somewhat skeptical high court that Tran should be immune from criminal ethics violation charges. Tran, a Fitchburg Republican, was indicted in 2023 for allegedly violating the state ethics law by directing members of his legislative staff to campaign for him during two reelection campaigns. A 2020 report from the Senate Committee on Ethics found that Tran’s senate office and campaign staff were deeply intermingled, which Tran denies, with legislative staffers knocking on doors, organizing fundraisers, and doing campaign work during normal business hours. “Senator Tran’s staff was reportedly so engaged with campaign activities that there was confusion over who actually worked in the office,” the Senate ethics report noted. This, according to Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office, was Tran using his official position to “secure an unwarranted privilege,” which is barred by conflict of interest law in Massachusetts that prohibits public employees from using public resources in connection with political campaigns or other private political activity. But bringing these criminal charges at all violates the protections of “legislative immunity,” Dean’s attorney, Michael Walsh, argued before the Supreme Judicial Court on Wednesday.  Because the activities in question involve Tran’s standing as a lawmaker and conversations with staff are quintessentially legislative in nature, Walsh said, only the Legislature can punish him. A lower court judge should have dismissed the case, Tran’s team argues, because of the legislative immunity and because a prosecutor dismissed a grand juror for appearing biased against Tran without getting approval from a judge. “Because of the co-equal branches of government,” Walsh told the justices, “the courts are not and cannot be – nor can the executive be – in a position to review the nature or decisions or acts of the Legislature.” The immunity protection, he said, is “essentially breathing room for the Legislature to act.” That may be significantly too broad a claim, suggested Justice Serge Georges. Prosecutors are claiming that Tran’s actions weren’t “about this bill or that bill” or decisions in an official capacity, Georges noted.  Rather, “this was a personal thing – I want to be re-elected,” Georges said of Tran’s actions. “I want [staffers] here, helping me do that. This is entirely divorced from the acts of a legislator in terms of the Commonwealth’s citizens, isn’t it?” Walsh harkened back to the caning of Charles Sumner, a Massachusetts antislavery Republican who addressed the US Senate in 1856 about admitting Kansas into the union as a free state or slave state. He accused other senators in mocking personal terms of committing a “crime against Kansas.” US Rep. Preston Brooks later attacked Sumner with a cane in the chamber in front of onlookers, survived a House censure vote, resigned, and was re-elected. Brooks’s attack, Walsh said, was clearly not “legislative” in nature. But Massachusetts offers substantial protections under Articles 10 and 11 of the state Constitution for its own legislators, he told the justices. It is the Legislature itself that is empowered to decide its own privilege, he said, and to judge its own acts.  Georges, calling this interpretation “troubling,” offered a hypothetical that Walsh said sits at the “absolute outer edge” of the defendant’s claim. “If I’m a state senator, and I have a bunch of staffers that I know that are really great carpenters, and I say, ‘Hey, you guys are going to build me a new deck,’” Georges asked, “are you saying to me that because I get to say, ‘my staffers are going to build me a new deck’ that I could somehow shoehorn that into legislative acts for purposes of getting immunity?” That would be a matter for the legislative body, Walsh argued. The matter would need to be referred to the House Ethics or the Senate Ethics Committee for an opinion, he said, instead of bringing an indictment. In Tran’s case, the Senate unanimously voted to strip Tran of his leadership position, barred him from using his physical office, and required him to communicate with his aides by email only. That did not count as lawmakers deciding to waive legislative immunity for conflict of interest charges, Walsh said. Walsh and Assistant Attorney General Tara Johnston referred to a seminal SJC case from more than 200 years ago, which established that state legislators are “entitled to this high immunity and privilege,” so long as “the member must be within the standing rules and orders of the house.”  They leaned on Coffin v. Coffin for entirely different arguments. Walsh pointed to the opinion’s statement that lawmakers alone can judge their rules and orders, enforce their observance, and punish a member for any violation of them. Johnston argued that the case and later decisions are clear that legislators are meant to be protected from having to face civil suit from actions that are “essentially integral to the due functioning of legislative activity,” she said. “There’s no reason why a state senator cannot be prosecuted under a criminal statute.” The SJC is expected to deliver its decision within the next 130 days. The conflict of interest charges against Tran – the first Vietnamese American elected to the State House in Massachusetts – are separate from his conviction on charges of wire fraud and filing false tax returns, for which he was sentenced to 18 months in prison in February. Tran said he would appeal regardless of the sentence.  Tran was also indicted in 2022 on charges brought by then-Attorney General Maura Healey that he stole a Colt .45 gun from an elderly constituent and then misled the investigation into the incident. Tran lost his bid for reelection in 2020 and saw the red district swing blue with Democrat John Cronin’s election. Two years later, Tran unsuccessfully challenged incumbent US Rep. Lori Trahan in the 3rd Congressional District. In a Facebook post in late 2024 Tran asked incoming President Donald Trump to pardon him. He claimed was targeted by the Democratic attorneys general – Healey and later Campbell – for being “an electable Republican in a deep blue state.” Tran’s lawyer also argued the prosecutor created a structural problem in dismissing a grand juror who displayed hostility toward Tran. The state argues that, even if the juror was dismissed improperly, the courts should specifically look to whether or not it created prejudice against Tran – which would depend on the facts of the case.  “Didn’t the prosecutor do what we want prosecutors to do?” Justice Frank Gaziano asked. “When the grand jury said, ‘Hey, he’s a Trumper,’ and they basically said, ‘You take a back seat.’”  This was something, Walsh argued, that should have been referred to a judge for approval. Prosecutors should not be dismissing jurors at the first sign signs of possible bias, he added. “This was done with the best of intentions,” Walsh said. “The problem is that if you say that this power exists at all, someone will later use it irresponsibly.”  The post High court probes whether former state senator should be immune from conflict of interest charges appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/642b18f0e1881.webp?fit=1000%2C670&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-08 09:01:42.225133

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jen Kimmich: The Vermont economy demands climate action.","This commentary is by Jen Kimmich, co-founder and CEO of The Alchemist Brewery, based in Waterbury and Stowe.My husband and I have always considered ourselves environmentalists, but prior to Aug. 28, 2011, we didn’t understand quite how vulnerable our small business was to climate change. Our efforts to address climate change and the drastic weather that it creates began after we lost our original Waterbury brewpub to Tropical Storm Irene in 2011.Flooding from that storm devastated our small business and permanently changed our lives and perspective. We did not realize it fully until then, but the future of our Vermont business, and many others, depends on effective and meaningful climate action.In that storm, we lost all of our inventory, all of our equipment, much of our building and our only source of revenue — our restaurant. Following the devastation of the flood we were hopeful since we had flood insurance, after all. But after several weeks of the dirtiest and toughest clean-up work you can imagine, we were informed that nothing below street level would be covered by insurance.Further, we found out that only about 30% of our losses would be covered. We found out the hard way that most insurance policies have fine print regarding floods (even when you have “flood” insurance).These financial blows were crushing.Our loss exceeded half a million dollars. Then we encountered barriers to rebuilding our business that went beyond replacing what we had lost. Our building was in the flood zone, and we discovered we could no longer have any new underground construction where our basement brewery had been located.Our bank would not finance it, and our insurance company would not insure it. No basement construction, no bank loan, no insurance. No brewery, no brewpub.People have asked me, what would it have cost you to reopen the pub? As though it was a choice not to reopen. To that I say, “There is no amount that would have allowed us to reopen. The door closed on our pub with that storm.” I understand the logic used by the bankers and the insurers. They were avoiding risk. But as a state, we are not doing enough to fend off the risks of climate disaster.The Alchemist was very lucky as a company. Prior to Tropical Storm Irene, we had started building out our new, small production facility up the road. Ironically, the day after our brewpub was destroyed, our first cans of Heady Topper rolled off our new canning line. This is what ultimately saved our company — a lot of good luck and good timing. Because frankly, if we had not had that new brewery up and running, we would have run out of money and hit a wall.That is the cost of climate disaster to small businesses — sudden, devastating, financially ruinous.Severe storms and flooding all too easily kill the small businesses that give our state and our main streets so much character. If it were not for our new business venture at the time, there would be no Alchemist today.Just like all of the independent cafes, bookstores, retail shops and restaurants Vermont has lost to flooding these past two years, The Alchemist would be something of the past. If we want to protect our small businesses and employers, we need to work together to take collective steps on climate action. No business can solve these issues alone.Today, after 22 years of business, drastic weather caused by climate change is still the biggest threat to our business. The three main ingredients in our beer — clean water, hops and malt — are all threatened by climate change. Between wildfires that impact hops, and droughts in the United Kingdom that devastate our malt growers, we understand how much our business, and most businesses, rely on a healthy environment.I agree with Gov. Phil Scott’s frequently saying how we need to keep finding ways to make Vermont more affordable. We also need to stay committed to a comprehensive climate action plan that works for all Vermonters. We need to make smart investments, and we need to support pragmatic legislation that will help build a cleaner and more sustainable Vermont.We need to make proactive investments today that will protect us and save us money in the future. Investments in flood and storm mitigation will only get more expensive in the years ahead. The time for action is now. Our company, The Alchemist, depends on swift and strategic climate action, but so does the future of our entire economy and the health of Vermont.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jen Kimmich: The Vermont economy demands climate action.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Commentaries_25-300x67.png,,,2025-05-08 09:01:42.225133

Tim Walz got dragged online and on cable news last week for some comments he made at the Harvard Institute of Politics.
“But I also was on the ticket quite honestly, ya know, because I could code talk to white guys watching football and fixing their truck and doing that. That I could put them at ease. I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look you can do this and vote for this.’”
If true, and it probably is, “it was an epic miscalculation,” as CNN’s Abby Phillip put it. 
As Walz himself goes on to say at the Harvard talk, they didn’t win enough of those voters in the swing states.  
Though that’s ultimately the responsibility of Kamala Harris, there are a few problems here. 
By saying the quiet part out loud, Walz condescended to these voters. 
Walz is supposed to be the Democrats’ “authentic” guy, and here he is, at the most elite institution in America, talking about how Harris thought she could win them over with this one weird trick. 
A lot of people — including a lot of non-college men in the Midwest — don’t seem to care about identity or representation as much as Democrats think. After all, many of them supported the least Midwestern guy imaginable: a draft-dodging, New York City billionaire who’s gone through three wives. 
Relatedly, the idea relies on the fiction that if you have a well-worn Carhartt duck coat, they’ll ignore the policies they don’t like, on immigration, on guns, on LGBTQ issues. 
Even if you could pull that off — it’s possible: We’ve seen Republican voters completely swap their beliefs on issues like tariffs and Russia because they are in thrall to Donald Trump — you don’t say it out loud. It’s like explaining a con to people who passed on the con. 
Or if you’re playing pundit for the day, find a way to explain your place on the ticket without the awful “code talk” and “permission structure.” 
Maybe he picked it up from the unnamed campaign aide who appeared in a CNN story about his (cringe) debate prep last year. 
“People assume that he is a walking permission structure for rural, exurban, White male hunters,” said a senior campaign aide. 
Walz has been traveling the country in the past few months, especially some ruby red regions — including Texas, Ohio and West Virginia — where big crowds are appreciating that someone is putting voice to their anger. 
The national media is back in swooning mode. 
The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty went out on the road with him to Ohio: 
“The Minnesota governor these days is looser, funnier, more profane — settling comfortably back into the style that got him picked for the ticket before he was shrink-wrapped and scripted by the hypercautious handlers of Kamala Harris’s campaign. He counts himself among the many Democrats who consider his 2024 performance a disappointment.”
Walz does indeed connect with people, his comments at Harvard about “permission structure” notwithstanding. 
In an impressive moment of self-awareness, he acknowledged his foibles in the same Harvard remarks, saying the Harris campaign may have kept him locked away because “I think I give you pretty good stuff, but I’ll also give you 10% problematic.” You may remember during the campaign when they had to clean up his false claim that his family used IVF, for instance. 
Walz’s full life before politics gives him access to the authentic way most of us live and talk, to the stress and triumphs of parenting and community.
But you can’t just say whatever comes into your Diet Mountain Dew brain.  
Americans have often elected the opposite of whomever is currently president — consider Barack Obama and Trump. If the pattern holds, the next president will be thoughtful, deliberate and grounded.
So if Walz is going to run for president — or, for that matter, another term for governor — he might consider thinking a touch more before he talks.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/05/08/bumps-ahead-trump-administration-evaluating-marylands-authority-to-set-medicare-rates/,The Trump administration has signaled interest in reining in Maryland’s ability to set rates for Medicare services – an authority the state has held for about 40 years.,"A look at Western Maryland Hospital Center in Washington County. (File photo by Hannah Gaskill/Maryland Matters)The Trump administration has signaled an interest in reining in Maryland’s ability to set rates for Medicare services – an authority the state has held for about 40 years.
Maryland’s system, unusual among states, gives the state significant say over the costs of health care services across different coverage plans to keep costs low and consistent, in what’s known as the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
But advocates worry that the feds’ apparent interest in changing who sets Medicare rates could disrupt health care payments for consumers, governments and providers.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) told reporters this week that he was “cautiously concerned” about the future of Maryland’s health care system while those negotiations continue between federal and state health officials.
“I don’t want to over-index anything … There’s reason to be concerned that there are going to be substantial changes,” he said.
The state’s ability to set Medicare rates has been in place for about 40 years under a waiver granted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI).
In the time since, the state’s health care system has evolved and the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission now determines the rates for care across all hospitals in the state, so that health care service costs are similar whether someone has private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.
But the current iteration of that payment system, called Total Cost of Care, is set to end in December 2025. Last November, Maryland entered into an agreement with the Biden administration to continue under the similar AHEAD system. The AHEAD model was actually based on Maryland’s Total Cost of Care model and similar systems in other states, due to its success in reducing health care costs.
But the Trump administration is now talking about taking another look at that arrangement and possibly making some changes. Specifically, federal officials are interested in removing Maryland’s ability to set rates for Medicare services
While current talks focus on Medicare rates, there could be ripple effects on rates for Medicaid and private insurance due to the state’s all-payer model that aims to keep costs for health care consistent across the board, according to health care advocates.
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees CMMI, did not confirm whether the Trump administration plans to end Maryland’s rate-setting authority for Medicare, but reiterated that “subject to discussions with State authorities,” the AHEAD model is currently set to begin in January 2026.
Maryland Health Secretary Dr. Meena Seshamani, a former CMS official in the Biden administration, said that those discussions are ongoing.
“Since the change in federal administration, the Maryland Department of Health has been in direct discussions about the future of the model, working with CMMI and in-state stakeholders to align the Maryland model with federal priorities to deliver high-quality outcomes for all Marylanders,” Seshamani said Wednesday. “The administration will not comment further, given that discussions are ongoing and confidential.”
There may be opportunities where CMMI and the state can find common ground over shared goals like preventing and reducing chronic disease, experts say, though it is unclear where negotiations will land at this moment.
Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, believes it is not time to panic, and that there is still opportunity for the state and the Trump administration to “meet in the middle” — even if CMMI officials signal interest in changing the rate-setting process for Medicare.
And despite his “cautious concern,” Ferguson said he hopes that any changes that come down on the state’s current health care plan will still help lower health care costs for Marylanders while pushing for greater quality of care.
“There could be changes that don’t have a dramatic impact on the financial stability of our marketplace for health care,” he said.
“I am hopeful that those in charge of CMS and CMMI will see the benefit that the Maryland model has provided for lowering costs over time,” he said, noting that there may be “important updates” in the next few weeks.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_4663-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-08 09:01:42.225133

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/05/youth-mental-health-insurance-billing/,"Only 14 school districts and county offices of education have begun billing for behavioral health services under the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Fee Schedule Program, according to state health officials.","In summary
Only 14 school districts and county offices of education have begun billing for behavioral health services under the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Fee Schedule Program, according to state health officials.


California made a huge one-time investment in youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic as rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders surged among children and teens. One piece of the state’s plan included a way to keep money flowing for schools that  wanted to expand mental health services for students. 
It involved allowing K-12 schools and colleges to charge Medi-Cal and private health insurance for behavioral health care provided on campus, a change that would allow them to provide more services and hire additional mental health staff. 
But that effort — among the first of its kind in the country — is off to a slow start, delaying dollars and resources for schools to help students with mental health challenges.Only 14 school districts and county offices of education have begun billing for behavioral health services under the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Fee Schedule Program, according to state health officials. Forty six school districts and county offices of education started the implementation process in January 2024 and were supposed to start billing last July. A total of 494 school districts, county offices of education and colleges have signed up to participate in the new billing program.
Some school officials are frustrated over program delays. They say the state was slow to release guidance and necessary training to submit claims for mental health services provided. Officials at schools that hired mental health staff say they may soon have to lay off recent hires because payments for services provided are not coming in as expected. This means students could lose newly gained access to services.
“There are so many unknowns and the timelines just keep getting pushed,” said Trina Frazier, assistant superintendent of student services at the Fresno County Office of Education. “And that’s really sad because it has so much potential.”
The California Department of Health Care Services, which is overseeing implementation of the program, told CalMatters in an email that while the target was to begin billing in mid-2024, “the scale and complexity of implementation required adjustments to provide additional flexibilities to schools.” “Major reforms of this kind require time, coordination, and phased implementation,” the department said in its email.
The department said it continues to work with schools to address any outstanding challenges. Its new goal is for that first group of 46 districts and education offices to start billing by the end of the current school year.
A boost for mental health in schools
California and the nation have seen a surge in mental health disorders among students. For example, about 284,000 California children and teens deal with major depression, and two-thirds of them do not receive treatment, according to state estimates. 
Despite the slow start for the new school billing program, other mental health efforts are underway through other components of the state’s $4.7 billion Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative that launched in 2021. That money has paid for mental health apps, education campaigns, and mental health workforce training programs, among a number of other efforts. About $400 million of that money was allotted in the form of one-time grants to education institutions to hire providers and prepare for this new billing program. 
In response to delays in the billing program, a group of lawmakers recently sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a letter requesting bridge funding that they say would allow schools to keep building mental health services while the program comes up to speed. The letter does not specify a dollar amount.
For the last 30 years and through a separate program, California schools have been able to get reimbursed by Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for low-income residents, for certain physical and mental health services. But there’s long been a gap for children with private insurance. This new billing program is supposed to address that, as well as allow schools to expand the types of mental health services they can provide and charge for.
Mental health experts regard school as an ideal setting for children to receive help. It’s where they spend most of their weekdays and generally feel safe. It’s also a “logistics problem solver” because schools resolve some potential barriers to care, like transportation to appointments, said Sarah Broome, a school Medicaid consultant. Also, teachers and staff see children every day and can notice when things are off. 
Broome said that the challenges that the state and schools are facing in rolling out this new fee schedule program are somewhat predictable, partly because what California is doing is new. “So it’s not even like you can call your peer states and be like, ‘Hey, how did you guys figure out how to do this?’ You are creating a lot of this as you go. So there’s absolutely real pain there.”
What’s behind the delays?
State legislators are hearing from frustrated local officials about the billing delays. The Fresno County Office of Education filed its first claim for reimbursement on Feb. 28, but as of last week continued to face challenges, according to Frazier. 
Frazier told lawmakers in a hearing last week that the program rollout “feels like building the plane while flying it.”
In Santa Clara County, the local office of education established 25 wellness centers across its schools and hired 50 new mental health workers, including clinicians and wellness coaches. But the delays prompted the office to notify its new staff about possible layoffs, Amanda Dickey, executive director of government relations for the Santa Clara County Office of Education, told lawmakers during the hearing.
“Because we didn’t receive reimbursement for a single claim until 15 months after (starting program implementation) … as of March we were forced to pink slip 27 of our staff. So 27 of the approximately 50 that we hired,” she said.
Dickey told legislators that the state and the third party administrator contracted to process claims, Carelon Behavioral Health, did not give schools access to or training for the billing software used to file claims until late last year.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Office of Education told CalMatters that one of the challenges has been collecting students’ health insurance information – a new task for schools, and one that requires parents and caregivers to cooperate in sharing information about their health plan. (Mental health care provided at schools under this program should not result in any out-of-pocket costs for families, according to the state.)  
Tanya Ward, a project director at the Los Angeles County Office of Education, said her office has yet to file mental health claims under this new program, but expects to do so later this month.
The California Department of Health Care Services attributes the delays to a “learning curve” for both the state and schools. 
According to the department, a number of factors contributed to the delays, including the fact that some schools requested edits to the contractual documents to participate in the program and that others expressed confusion about the process and needed additional support.
The department said that districts are allowed to submit claims retroactively for dates of service back to July 1, 2024, as long as those claims are submitted by June 30.
The 14 districts and education offices that are now able to file claims are starting to do so in larger numbers, Autumn Boylan, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Partnerships at the state health department, told lawmakers in last week’s hearing. 
“This is a significant change for the entire system, and changes of this magnitude take time,” Boylan told lawmakers.  
“There is still work to be done, but I do think we are making progress,” she said. 
Testifying next to each other at last week’s hearing, Boylan and Frazier from Fresno couldn’t agree on how much in claims had actually been paid out to the Fresno County Office of Education.Of the first 40 claims that had been processed for Fresno, 21 were denied, Frazier said. Boylan said that some claims are being denied because they are incomplete or not properly filed. Lawmakers questioned whether schools are filing claims incorrectly because they have not been adequately taught how to do so.
“This is brand new for schools,” Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, said during the hearing. “It is imperative on us, as government, to lead them in the right path if we want them to take on something that’s completely out of their scope.”

Head Start staff and advocates launched a nationwide campaign to save the program, which Trump eliminated in his budget draft.


Chalk one up for the 4-year-olds.
Thanks to a relentless onslaught of pleading, cajoling, lobbying and public pressure, Head Start appears to have dodged the federal budget axe — for the time being.
Last month, President Donald Trump’s early budget draft called for the elimination of Head Start, the free early-childhood program for low-income families. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s conservative policy roadmap, also called for the program’s demise, saying it has “little or no academic value.” 
That triggered an all-hands-on-deck response from Head Start staff, families and alumni, who touted the program’s success in propelling families out of poverty. The National Head Start Association said advocates sent more than 300,000 letters to Congress, added more than 50,000 signatures to petitions and attended rallies throughout the country. 
Meanwhile, Head Start advocates took to social media and national TV to plead their case and visited Republican members of Congress to convince them of the program’s value. They reached out directly to the White House. In their free time, advocates said they lobbied everyone from neighbors to hairdressers to gardeners — anyone who had even a remote interest in the program.
It appears to have worked: The latest draft of Trump’s budget proposal, released last week, doesn’t call for any changes to the $12.27 billion program. Still, advocates worry that new cuts may lie ahead.
“We mobilized absolutely everyone,” said Melanee Cottrill, executive director of Head Start in California. “We launched a very intensive campaign. We still have a lot of concerns, but right now there’s a sigh of relief.”
From prenatal to kindergarten
Head Start, launched in 1965, served about 800,000 children last year, including 83,000 in California. Originally a preschool, the program now serves children from birth through age 5. Children get meals and a play-based academic curriculum that prepares them for kindergarten, while families get housing and job assistance, referrals to social and medical services, prenatal visits and parenting support.
To qualify, families need to be below the federal poverty line, which is $26,650 for a family of three, be homeless or receive food assistance. Children in foster care also qualify.
The program is relatively cost-efficient: The per-pupil annual cost is about $13,700, compared to the cost of private preschool, which in California can easily exceed $20,000 a year, depending on the location.

Research is mixed on the program’s effectiveness. One study found that Head Start alumni had significantly higher rates of high school and college graduation. But another study found that children who attended Head Start outperformed their peers at first, but by third grade the advantage had all but dissipated. 
Regardless, the program is immensely popular with families and programs typically have waiting lists.
Head Start is helping families in San Diego
Oscar Gomez, vice chair of Episcopal Community Services’ board of directors, a Head Start provider in San Diego, attended the program as a child growing up in Tulare County. While his mother worked in the nearby almond and orange orchards and took English classes, Gomez and his three siblings learned to share and take turns, count to 20 and write their names.
Head Start imbued him with a love of school and allowed his mother to take classes that led to higher-paying jobs, he said. Gomez went on to get two master’s degrees and his mother now conducts home visits for Head Start.
“I can honestly say that without Head Start I would not be where I am today, and there are millions and millions of people like me,” Gomez said. 
Episcopal Community Services runs 17 Head Start programs, serving 1,200 children from Chula Vista, San Ysidro, San Diego and other communities. Parents typically work in local restaurants or hotels, and 60% share their living quarters with other families. 
If they lost Head Start, families would either have to curtail their work hours or leave their children with neighbors or other family members, arrangements not likely to provide the same high-quality curriculum or services, said Rosa Cabrera-Jaime, the organization’s director of early education and family services.
“Absolutely, some of our families would become homeless if they lost Head Start,” she said.
Precious Jackson, a single mother of four, has relied on Head Start while she earns her bachelor’s degree and works as a substitute school librarian in San Diego. She also credits Head Start for providing speech therapy to her son, when he wasn’t talking as a toddler, and providing an extra academic boost to her daughter, whom she believes is intellectually gifted.
“Head Start has made a tremendous difference in my life,” Jackson said. “I am not wasting one drop of this opportunity.”

Without Head Start, she’d be working two or three jobs just to pay for child care, she said. Now, she can plan a higher-paying career. She hopes to graduate soon with a degree from University of Arizona’s online campus and work as a school librarian.
But she’s rattled by potential cuts to Head Start, which could derail her own education.
“For me, Head Start is a necessity,” she said. “I want to tell Congress, Head Start works. Let’s keep it rolling.”
‘Folks are scared’
Congress will release its budget in the next few weeks, and Head Start advocates are confident that it will reflect Trump’s wish to save the program. But it’s not guaranteed, and the final budget may still include steep cuts. In addition, they worry about cuts to other programs, such as Medicaid, that could cause Head Start families to lose health care and other services.
Neither Trump nor Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who oversees Head Start, have addressed Head Start cuts directly, but Trump has said he wants to hand more education programs to the states and reduce federal spending. Meanwhile, some Republican lawmakers have come out in favor of Head Start, including numerous members of the California Legislature who last week joined their Democratic colleagues to send a letter to Congress asking to protect the program.
Cuts to HSS have already affected services, Cottrill said. Amid a 10,000-employee workforce reduction, the agency closed half of its regional centers, including one in San Francisco, leading to long delays in getting help and receiving payments. An HHS ban on public communications has prevented Head Start staff from getting clarity on funding.
“We’ve had programs within hours of closing their doors,” Cottrill said. “It’s been so hard to keep morale up and keep staff focused on their jobs, if they don’t know whether they’ll have a job tomorrow and families don’t know if they’ll have someplace to take their children.”
Head Start staff also worry about the Trump administration’s anti-diversity orders. The program requires a culturally sensitive approach in the classroom, which includes bilingual education and meals that children would recognize from home, among other things. Staff aren’t sure how to comply with Trump’s orders while also meeting program requirements.
Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the National Head Start Association, said the recent tumult has left staff and families nervous.
“Folks are scared. The fact that eliminating Head Start was even under consideration has been scary,” he said. “We’re confident that Congress will do the right thing, but even a 25% cut would be pretty austere.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/043025_ECS-Head-Start_AH_CM_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-08 09:01:42.225133

California’s climb to the world’s fourth-largest economy marks a milestone and illustrates a paradox. 
Fueled by innovation and ambition, we’ve cradled industries of the future and amassed extraordinary wealth. But, for the everyday Californians who keep the lights on in our world-leading economy, this newfound prominence is at odds with their daily struggle to make ends meet. 
The trophy we’re hoisting — surpassing Japan in gross domestic product — is tarnished by a jaded reception from the average Californian facing rising housing, health care and food costs. 
This paradox calls into question whether GDP is the best measure of financial success for state policymakers. If we’re first in homelessness and first in the cost of everyday goods, does being fourth in GDP matter?
As the glad-handing and horn-tooting settles down, this milestone is also a chance for state and local policymakers to reflect on their economic priorities. For Gov. Gavin Newsom, “California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” but our pace doesn’t matter if GDP is the wrong race and we’re last in affordability, which is what matters most to everyone living here.
When we take into consideration the high and increasing costs of living, California is the 11th-largest economy, barely beating Italy and trailing both France and the UK, where the cost of everyday goods are about a third or less of what they are in California, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
The price index helps us understand the average cost of everyday goods, like milk, eggs, transportation, health care and housing, for that community. Unlike GDP, it can measure inflation and gauge how expensive it is to live in once place versus another. California has led the world in this measure of expensiveness since 1997, when our price index surpassed that of the U.S.
The persistence of inflation is not some statistical trend. It reflects structural pressures: a housing market distorted by supply constraints and political inertia; a labor force both indispensable and precariously housed; and a tax regime that funds ambition while threatening the economic health of working families.

A healthy and equitable California economy must reconcile growth with governance and dynamism with discipline. It’s not just about size. To Newsom’s credit, his administration issued a first-of-its-kind “State Economic Blueprint” earlier this year with much less pomp and circumstance than the GDP announcement in April. This transformative plan focuses on bottom-up, regional economic planning to strengthen local economies and help communities deal with the affordability crisis.
Some might call this part of the “abundance agenda,” but California’s leaders don’t need to look to distant political commentators for an agenda. They should look to local organizations, such as Valley Vision, for example, just two miles from the Capitol.
Established in the mid-1990s, decades before the “abundance agenda” was ever discussed, Valley Vision began helping the Sacramento region cope with economic upheaval caused by the shutdown of local military bases, which had provided 80,000 jobs to residents. Utilizing a so-called triple bottom line approach, they called on businesses to work across sectors, governments to look past their boundaries, and people to think beyond their zip codes in the interest of the wider region. 
The result is that today, while we still struggle with affordability, Sacramento’s local economy is more diverse, resilient and has the building blocks necessary to ensure future prosperity for all of its residents. 
That is, if policymakers can come to a consensus and address costs for consumers. 
California must reconcile the gulf between its image as a land of opportunity and the lived experience of those priced out of that dream. Otherwise, our latest global economic ascent marks not the beginning of a new era but the high watermark of an unsustainable model.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/021225-Port-of-LA-JAJ-CM-24.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-08 09:01:42.225133

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)The Board of Public Works gave the green light Wednesday to “a once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reinvigorate horse racing in Maryland, even as one member questioned if this would be the last chance for the industry.
The three-member board approved contracts for the demolition and rebuild of Pimlico Race Course and the purchase of a Carroll County farm that will become a horse training center. The effort is not only another state attempt to save the industry, but is also seen as a way of revitalizing the Park Heights community in northwest Baltimore.
“Almost a year ago today, this board approved the transfer of ownership of the Pimlico race course to the state of Maryland, seizing a once in a generation opportunity to reimagine thoroughbred racing in the entire state with the celebration of the 150th Preakness states that is taking place next week,” said Gov. Wes Moore, who chairs the board.
Moore said the new track, once completed, will “become a year-round hub for economic activity within Park Heights” and “serve to revitalize Maryland’s horsing industry,” an industry he said accounts for 28,000 jobs and $3 billion in economic activity.
But it’s an industry that has struggled for decades, and one that some have questioned the value of using state taxpayer dollars to save. Treasurer Dereck Davis questioned whether this latest effort represents the state’s final attempt to steady a struggling industry.
  Maryland Treasurer Dereck E. Davis (D) asked if efforts to expand racing in Maryland were more than a “pipe dream.” (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
“The state, with the implementation and subsequent completion of this project, we will have done everything we could do to make racing successful, other than the third weekend in May every year” when the Preakness is run, Davis said. “Is there anything left that I guess we can do or — this has to be successful, I guess is what I’m getting at. The state’s invested a lot of money over the years. This has been an issue since I first came to Annapolis, literally 30 years ago.”
Davis said he did not question efforts to revitalize Park Heights but wondered aloud if remaking Pimlico and consolidating thoroughbred racing at the track would save the industry.
“I guess what I’m asking, is this just a pipe dream, quite frankly, … can provide racing, or is it just sort of a niche thing that we enjoy every third weekend in May, and then it’s just sort of out there waiting for the next May to come?” Davis asked.
Craig Thompson,  board chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority Board, which will have a hand in the redevelopment, agreed that the state “has done everything that it can to make sure that we lay the foundation for the success of not only the 150th running of the Preakness, but the racing industry, as it grows and expands and races to come in Baltimore.”
Continued success will hinge on what he called the “participation and spread the word” theory.
“It’s going to be very important for each and every one of us to participate in the Preakness and in the non-racing … days in Park Heights,” Thompson said. “Support the community. Make sure that on those non-racing days you come to the Park Heights community. You’re going to see a wonderful evolution and revolution in that area. So, when there’s not a race, still come. Participate in that area.”
The plan approved Wednesday includes a $15.2 million contract with Baltimore-based Clark Construction Group related to the demolition and redevelopment of Pimlico Race Course.

Demolition of the storied but deteriorating track could begin later this year. The 2026 Preakness Stakes will be run at Laurel Park, but is scheduled to return to a new Pimlico in 2027.
Thompson showed renderings of what the new facility would look like. In addition to the Preakness, the plan calls for consolidating all thoroughbred racing in the state at Pimlico, expanding race days.
“This is more than just about a racetrack, as historic and important as it is,” Thompson said. “This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investments to Park Heights. The Pimlico Plus plan that the state is implementing will transform Pimlico into the home of Maryland thoroughbred racing, going from hosting about 15 racing days per year to well over 100.”
The board voted unanimously to approve the contract with Clark Construction and voted 2-0 — Comptroller Brooke Lierman recused herself from the vote — to buy a 328-acre Carroll County farm for nearly $4.5 million. The property known as Shamrock Farm will become a new training facility to support expanded racing at Pimlico.
The purchase price was the highest of three appraisals conducted for the racing authority. The General Assembly in 2024 set aside $110 million for construction of a new, state-of-the art training facility as part of a thoroughbred racing centralization plan. The planned state-of-the-art facility will house 800 horses.
‘Too many cooks in the kitchen’
Davis was not the only board member to question the effort: Lierman raised concerns about who would have ultimate oversight as the state invests hundreds of millions into the project.

Currently, the project includes the Maryland Thoroughbred Race Track Operating Authority, the Maryland Stadium Authority, and the Maryland Economic Development Corp., as well as the reconstituted Maryland Jockey Club.
In July, the race track authority will be disbanded. The stadium authority will oversee construction while MEDCO handles economic development around the track and the possibility of a hotel and parking garage.
“It’s a lot of cooks in the kitchen on what’s already a very complicated project,” Lierman said. “Sometimes when there are multiple cooks in the kitchen, it’s hard to determine where the buck stops.”
Lierman asked Thompson to “help us understand how there is going to be oversight when there are so many different bodies who are involved, to be sure that there are loopholes, to be sure that we know where these bonded dollars are going, that … we are spending them efficiently. Because there is a limited amount of dollars, and I think the General Assembly has been pretty clear that there’s not going to be any more.”
Comptroller recuses herself from land purchase
Lierman recused herself from the Shamrock Farm purchase request and left the room for the discussion and vote. The comptroller said during the meeting that she recused herself “on the advice from the state ethics commission.” She did not elaborate.
A spokesperson for Lierman cited state ethics law that requires recusal ” because of a qualifying relative’s employment with a business entity that is a party to this matter.”
“As is the practice of members of the Board of Public Works, Comptroller Lierman notified both her colleagues on the board and made the appropriate disclosures to Ethics ahead of today’s meeting,” Robyne McCullough said in an email response to questions. “She did not participate in any discussions on this item and left the room prior to BPW consideration.”
McCullough declined to answer questions regarding the identity of the relative in question or the connection to the farm purchase.
“I don’t think we’re going to go into that,” McCullough said.
She said the decision to not elaborate on any recusal “is a practice for us and we’re just being consistent.”
Board approves payment to erroneously convicted man
The board also unanimously approved a payment of more than $1.2 million to Tyrone Jones and two law firms as compensation for time Jones spent behind bars on an erroneous conviction on charges of conspiracy to commit murder.

“Mr. Jones as the governor of this state, but also, more importantly, as a father and a husband and a son and a fellow Marylander, I want to share words that you deserve to hear, because I’m not just speaking on behalf of myself and the treasurer and the comptroller, I’m speaking on behalf of this entire state: I’m sorry. It should have never happened, and I know there are no words that can undo the injustice and what was taken away from you and your family,” Moore said.
Jones, now 48, was convicted in Baltimore City of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in 1999 related to the shooting death of Tyree Wright. In that trial he was found not guilty of first- and second-degree murder.
He spent the next 10 years in prison as part of a life sentence. In 2009, Jones filed a petition for post-conviction relief and a judge vacated his verdict. City prosecutors, who initially said Jones should get a new trial, declined to retry Jones, and dropped the case.
Jones applied for compensation under the Lomax Act but was initially denied. A hearing officer ruled that the charge of conspiracy to commit murder did not qualify for compensation. The General Assembly in 2024 passed legislation that changed the eligibility standards.
Jones was confined for 3,611 days. As a result, he was awarded $976,233.85 in compensation by the Office of Administrative Hearings. The money will be paid out in five installments. The first payment of $98,678 was due May 2. He will receive four additional payments of more than $219,000 each between December 2025 and July 2027.
The state hearing officer also awarded payments to two law firms related to the case. Brown Goldstein Levy will receive nearly $137,000. Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel will receive more than $110,000 in legal fees.
The money paid to Jones and his attorneys comes entirely from the state. In two months, that will change.
Starting in July, payments made to individuals who were wrongly convicted and imprisoned will be split equally between the state and the jurisdiction where the individual was convicted. That change is part of a compromise budget agreement reached by the House and Senate earlier this year.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0101-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-08 09:01:42.225133

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Projected on two large screens in front of a hotel conference room full of more than 300 people on Wednesday, a video told the story of Brandon Curtis, a Utahn who died at the age of 43 of a drug overdose on Aug. 16. 
In the video, his father and stepmother, Ken and Steph Curtis, said his exposure to drugs started when he was about 7 years old, “with a babysitter who gave him marijuana to calm him down.” Ken Curtis said “his mother contributed to that,” adding that was the main reason they later divorced. Then in 2012, he said Brandon’s mother “killed herself with a drug overdose.”

“And that’s when he took a nose dive,” Ken Curtis said. 
The video goes on to paint a sad story of Brandon Curtis’ life, saying he lived on the streets most of his life. Even though Ken and Steph Curtis tried multiple times to help, he’d always return to drugs. And they said the legal and criminal justice system failed him at every turn, allowing Brandon too much leeway at a time when they said he could no longer make decisions for himself. 
“I understand people having privacy rights, but when the kid won’t get himself off of drugs and cannot make those real decisions that keep him sober and keep him a normal member of society, we had no place to go,” Ken Curtis says. “Even as Brandon’s dad, biological father, I had no rights over Brandon.” 


They said Brandon’s sister at one point took him to Colorado, where he stayed in a group home and achieved six months of sobriety. In those six months, Ken Curtis said Brandon “became a totally different person.” 
“He could think rationally. I wouldn’t say he was completely healthy because he still had a lot of mental issues, but he was in a good place,” Ken Curtis said. 
But that didn’t last. 
“The pull was just too great to come back to Salt Lake City, because Salt Lake City was where he could do whatever he wants to do,” Steph Curtis said through tears. “Without repercussion,” Ken Curtis added. 
Within two months, Brandon Curtis was dead. 
The video then issued a call to action: something needs to change. 
‘Compassion trap’
Brandon’s story was a somber preface to a panel discussion between Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and author Sam Quinones, who has written multiple books chronicling the opioid crisis in America, the emergence of the synthetic drug market in Mexico, and their impact on homelessness and mental illness across America. 
For homelessness, Utah lawmakers want more enforcement — and ‘healing.’ Can they get both?

During their conversation, Cox and Quinones explored solutions to both America and Utah’s homelessness, addiction and mental health problems. Curtis’ story underscored a takeaway that both Cox and Quinones embraced – that there needs to be a better balance between compassion, law enforcement and accountability. 
“We’ve been given a false choice, that you can either be compassionate or you can hold people accountable and responsible. And I think that’s a huge mistake,” the governor said. “People are right when they say you can’t arrest your way out of homelessness. They’re absolutely right. But you also can’t do nothing. You do have to arrest people at times.” 
Wednesday’s conference was hosted by the homelessness advocacy group Solutions Utah. The group was formerly known as the Pioneer Park Coalition (originally founded as a coalition of business owners to advocate for revitalization around the downtown area that has a long history of grappling with homelessness issues) before it was rebranded last year to align with a mission of improving Utah’s statewide homeless services system.

Cox said he’s a “big fan” of Quinones, telling everyone they should read his book “The Least of Us: True Tales of America and Hope in the Time of Fentanyl and Meth.” He described it as key to understanding the intersection between pharmaceutical manufacturers “chasing dollars over lives” and what’s now become a vast synthetic drug market in Mexico that has exacerbated mental illness and homelessness across the U.S. 
“I was blown away,” Cox said, adding that he made everyone on his team read it. He also said he’s been working with state lawmakers “to now change the way we attack not just drug trafficking but homelessness and all of the adjacent issues.”
Cox said Quinones’ books also urge people not to “fall into this compassion trap that is not compassionate at all, but it’s a compassion that kills. And we’ve forgotten the other side of that ledge, which is the responsibility of holding people accountable and then giving them solutions and treatment.” 
A ‘sea change’ in Utah’s homeless system is already underway
Not a ‘bed crisis’ but a ‘human crisis’:  How a top homeless leader wants to change Utah’s system

The public talk between Cox and Quinones came on the heels of a legislative session in which lawmakers passed a slate of bills aimed at improving the state’s homeless system while also increasing enforcement. They passed laws formalizing a state partnership with Salt Lake City to police camping and drugs. They also passed legislation with anti-drug use measures, including enhanced penalties for drug offenses in homeless shelters and requiring homeless shelters to maintain zero-tolerance drug policies. 
State homeless leaders say they want to change Utah’s homeless system to be focused on a “human first” approach in contrast with “Housing First,” a model that homeless providers in and outside of Utah have used for years that prioritizes placing people experiencing homelessness in permanent supportive housing as a first step, then offering services including substance abuse and mental health treatment.
Arguing that approach is too rigid and hasn’t worked, lawmakers also passed a resolution urging the federal government rescind housing-first mandates on federal grants and instead allow Utah more flexibility to craft its own solutions, including programs that focus on “sobriety, goal-setting, and accountability.” 
In major cities across the country, including Salt Lake City, Cox said there’s been a “decay” that’s let homelessness, addiction and mental health issues fester. Over the past two years, he said state and city leaders have been trying to work together to make changes. 
“I refuse to believe that we have to allow our capital city to be a place where families can’t walk down the street together … where we just let people die on the streets,” he said. “We cease to function as a society if we’re going to accept that. Might as well just end it all and cash it in and head for the hills.” 
So while members of the Utah Homeless Services Board have been working to transform the state’s homeless system — including slow-going efforts to site a new, 1,200-bed homeless campus — Cox said more work needs to be done and “we’re not there yet.”
State leaders call SLC police ‘ineffective,’ urge mayor to act — or state will step in 

“We’re in the middle of this sea change,” he said. “We do need more jail beds. We do need more treatment beds. We’re working on those things.” 
Cox also said one of Utah’s “superpowers” is also “compassion.” But he said that doesn’t mean people shouldn’t be arrested for breaking the law. 
“I’m not going to allow people to put us in those boxes anymore … to tell us that if we’re getting serious about crime and serious about homelessness, and that means we don’t care about people,” Cox said. “We’re not going to do that anymore.”
Cox said Quinones’ book emphasizes that point. Quinones agreed. 
“‘Meeting people where they are’ is a common phrase,” Quinones said. “But, you know, we know where they are. They’re on death row, they’re at death’s door. And we leave them there? … It bewilders me how that’s confused with compassion.” 
‘Cheap’ dopamine, addiction and unbridled capitalism
Much of Cox and Quinones’ discussion revolved around the devastating impacts of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs that have sent the number of fatal overdoses in Utah and the U.S. to record highs. But their talk also zoomed out to highlight broader problems in American culture that fuel other types of addiction, which breed despair in many forms that can eat away at people and their communities. 
Surge in overdose deaths has moved westward, even as they fall nationally

It’s not just drugs. It’s an addiction to phones, doom scrolling on social media, and online gambling, Cox said. Things that made dopamine “cheap.” 
“There’s a hollowness that’s happening in our country today as we become more addicted to our cellphones, dopamine hits,” the governor said. “Social media? Dopamine hit. Outrage? Dopamine hit. We’re addicted to all this stuff. … And we’re in pain. There’s that God-shaped hole in our hearts.”
Cox said “friction” needs to disrupt these habits — but also Americans “need to change our mindset as a society.” 
“I’m just telling you right now, we’re going to have a lot of homeless people because of DraftKings on your phone,” Cox said, referring to an online sports gambling company.
While residents of Utah — one of only two states, including Hawaii, where gambling is illegal — have previously had to drive across state lines to place bets, now they can do it on an app. Cox asserted that the ease of placing bets and gambling ads are going to “destroy our country.” 
With a record-number of Utahns dying from overdoses, state announces new fentanyl task force

“If it’s in your pocket every damn day and they are sending you notifications that you have to bet on this, that’s fentanyl in phone form. That’s exactly what it is,” Cox said. “You’re going to be losing your house. And then you’re going to be sad, and you’re going to be on the street, and you’re going to be looking for something else to scratch that itch. And you’re going to be buying drugs to do it.” 
The problem, Cox said, is “dopamine got cheap,” and Americans have lost sight of what brings true happiness. 
“We decided that freedom to do anything we want is an American core value,” Cox said, “and we forgot that the pursuit of happiness in the Declaration of Independence was actually about self improvement and self excellence — about making ourselves better every day, about doing the hard stuff and taking care of people instead of just living for the moment.” 
Cox got a round of applause for those words. Quinones nodded his agreement, though he went a step further in pointing out problems that also stem from underregulated capitalism. 
“Today we have decided that it’s OK for corporate America to fine tune these products to be more addictive than ever,” Quinones said, calling gambling apps “vile things.”
He questioned whether any of these company owners have paid attention to what happened to the Sackler family, which owned the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma that recently agreed to pay $7.4 billion in a settlement over the role OxyContin played in the opioid epidemic. 
In a first-of-its-kind settlement, Utah will get millions from company that promoted OxyContin

“We do a really bad job of standing in the way of people who want to make money,” Quinones said.  
But what do synthetic drug markets have to do with social media and gambling apps? In a review of “The Least of Us,” Washington Post writer David Herzberg said Quinones’ “greatest accomplishment is to understand these newly dangerous drug markets as just one more consequence of a disastrously under-regulated corporate capitalism in the 2000s.” 
“In the annals of American drug journalism (of which, as a historian, I have read a lot), this is a remarkable argument: that drugs are not the problem, they are just one example of our decision to favor markets over communities,” Herzberg wrote. 
That’s where swimming pools come in. 
What’s the solution? ‘Swimming pools’
To explain, Quinones told the story behind the title of his other book, “Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic.” Though the word “dreamland” could also refer to the high heroin addicts chase, he said it more directly refers to a community pool that was once a popular spot in Portsmouth, Ohio. 
But after the Rest Belt phenomenon, when manufacturing and steelmaking regions saw industrial decline, “jobs left, businesses withered, half the population left, and Dreamland Pool … could no longer survive,” Quinones said. “They dug it up, and they turned it into a strip mall.” 
The community bonds were then “shredded,” he said. “And then within two or three years, the opioid prescribing got heavy. And the pill mill business model … was really invented in Portsmouth, Ohio.” 
Feds announce ‘largest fentanyl bust’ in U.S. history

He chose the name “Dreamland” because he said it was a “quintessential example of what I thought was really at the heart of our opioid problem, our addiction problem in general, which was a shredding of community. … Getting away from what held us together and bonded us, which we have lost in so many cases.” 
Cox said one of the biggest takeaways he got from Quinones’ books is “that we literally need more swimming pools.” 
He said there should be more investment in building community spaces, like swimming pools or splash parks. 
Though he said much of their conversation was grim, Cox said he hoped to end it on a hopeful note. If any state can combat loneliness and addiction, it’s Utah, he said. 
“As much as we’re losing these connections as a country, we still have them more than anywhere else here,” he said. “We still have a faith-based community that brings everyone together.” 
So as people contemplate trying to fix homelessness and addiction, Cox said to not forget about ways to prevent it from happening in the first place, and that’s to “build strong kids who have a sense of worth, who are tied to their communities, who know their neighbors, who hate to disappoint their scoutmaster or their church leader by taking one of those pills.” 
“That only happens if we have strong communities,” he said.

The Senate saw two filibusters on Wednesday: one from Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham that would have allowed the governor to appoint members of the governing board of the Alabama Department of Archives and History without Senate confirmation; the other from Singleton in protest of the House not taking up a bill he considered important for his district. The Alabama Legislature ground to a halt on Wednesday afternoon amid a dispute between the Alabama House and a senator over a gambling bill for Greene County. 
The stand-off on the next-to-last legislative day of the session punctuated a tense day in the chambers that saw another filibuster on a bill that would change the governance of the Alabama Department of Archives and History and two Republican representatives getting into a shouting match on the House floor. 
“The question about ending it today was the right decision, I believe, so that everyone stopped, we had a clean break, and then we’re going into the last legislative day, knowing exactly what’s in front of us,” said President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, after the Senate adjourned, adding that cloturing the Democratic filibuster would “create a little bit of animosity towards each side of the aisle, and we don’t want that.”

The disputes left the fates of high-profile legislation and dozens of local bills for individual districts up in the air. The last day of the session is May 14.
“[Next week] looks slow because I’m settled in They’ve got 40 more House bills,” said Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, who filibustered a Senate calendar for most of the afternoon. “I’m willing to talk 40 more hours.”

Singleton wanted the House to pass a SB 90, a bill for Greene County that would update the distribution of local gambling revenue in the county and change the appointing authority for Greene County Racing Commission members from the governor to the legislative delegation.
Wednesday was the last day for lawmakers to get bills to the governor’s desk before Gov. Kay Ivey can wield a pocket veto over legislation. Singleton said Ivey’s staff said she wasn’t going to sign his bill, and that a Senate agenda of 10 bills taken up by the chamber on Wednesday “needed to get out” because “she’s not going to sign the bills.” 
“The governor has said to leadership that there were certain bills that she was not going to sign … That’s why you saw all those bills because they needed to get out today, so that therefore they could override the veto on the last day if she decided to veto them,” Singleton said.
Gina Maiola, a spokesperson for the governor, wrote in a text message Wednesday “that’s not necessarily true regarding issues with local bills,” saying that the governor met with leadership to discuss the final days of the session and agree to a final schedule.

Singleton filibustered the local calendar but allowed the first five local bills on it to pass.
The House did not put Singleton’s bill on a calendar on Wednesday, likely dooming it for the session. In the House, Rep. Curtis Travis, D-Tuscaloosa, requested to bring SB 90 to the floor out of order, a move that requires four-fifths of members present to approve. After an hour and 45 minutes of debate, Travis withdrew the motion.
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said after the House adjourned that all gaming bills must be brought to the floor on a special order calendar, regardless if they are local legislation or statewide bills.
“(Singleton) was really adamant about getting on the floor, and gave a chance for Rep. Travis to have a conversation about it,” Ledbetter said after the House adjourned. “And I think that’s what he wanted to do. And unfortunately, our rules and rules in the Senate aren’t the same. And anything that’s got to do with gaming in the House, it’s got to be general and going to the House floor.”
Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, who co-sponsored a comprehensive gambling package last year, supported the motion saying Alabamians gamble anyway.
“I do feel that we failed our citizens last year by not voting on a comprehensive gaming package,” Whitt said. “This is a great demonstration of what happens when we let this patchwork gaming happen all across the state, and it will continue to happen. If you don’t think gambling and gaming is happening in your communities, you’re all wrong.”

Spat in the House

The House had its own internal drama Wednesday when Reps. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, and Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, had a heated discussion on the House floor over an amendment to SB 82, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur.
The bill requires municipal court magistrates and circuit court clerks to annually audit and recall outstanding warrants for Class B and Class C misdemeanors and violations that have not been served within 10 years.
Faulkner’s amendment allowed the presiding judge to decide if a warrant would be recalled. Simpson asked Faulkner to change his amendment to also alert the prosecuting attorney.
“We’re not amending the amendment,” Faulkner said. “You can amend the bill.”
Simpson argued Faulkner could not do that.
“I can have this debate with you right now because I’m asking to amend the amendment,” Simpson said. “Let’s let the body ask to amend the amendment.”
The pair got heated, then the bill was carried over to the call of the chair. The pair continued their debate away from the podiums on the House floor, then moved to a side room for about an hour.
They emerged, but the bill was not brought back up.
Final Day
Both chambers of the Legislature will return on Wednesday afternoon, but the battle between the chambers may not ease. Ledbetter said Singleton’s bill will not be on the calendar when the House returns.
But Singleton said after the Senate adjourned that he still wants his bill passed “like all other local bills.” The Senate minority leader noted the Senate still had to pass about 50 local bills and approve confirmations, and warned that he was willing to filibuster most if not all of them. 
“That’s where we will be. If that’s what game they want to play, I’m willing to play, and I think most of you know that I can play that game,” Singleton said. “We probably have another 25 confirmations out there. Somebody’s not going to get confirmed, and some local bills will die.”

The impasse could also threaten high-profile state bills, including a bill broadening police immunity that Ivey called for in her State of the State address in February. A bill to change the governance of the Alabama Department of Archives and History also stalled after Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, objected to the bill removing Senate confirmation of board members. The bill will go to a conference committee.
“As of right now, the local legislation is my main priority because all politics is local. We want to make sure that we try to take care of our members here and the members in the House,” Gudger said after the Senate adjourned Wednesday.

Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield) speaks after a Senate elections committee meeting on June 13, 2023. | Photo by Anna GustafsonState Sen. Jeremy Moss announced Thursday that he is running for an open Oakland County congressional seat. 
The Southfield Democrat is the first candidate to announce for the race after U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) said last month she would be seeking Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat next year, leaving the 11th Congressional District seat open.
Moss, who serves as the Senate’s speaker pro tem, is the first openly gay member of the Michigan Senate, having won election to that chamber in 2018, after serving two terms in the state House. He was also previously a member of the Southfield City Council.
“I represent hundreds of thousands of residents in this district who are looking for a bold voice for Oakland County in Congress,” Moss told Michigan Advance ahead of his announcement. “I hear about their alarm and anguish about our democracy and about our economy and we’re at a critical moment and it’s going to call on a new generation of leaders to step up and take action and that’s what I’m ready to do.”
  State Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield) | Submitted photo
Moss says he has been disruptive force in politics from the start, which he believes is the type of leadership Democrats need to project against the Trump administration’s attacks on civil liberties and American institutions.
“I’m not a status quo kind of guy. It was disruptive when I ran and was elected as the youngest ever member of the Southfield City Council, but it brought about new economic development and neighborhood growth to the city. It was disruptive when I ran to be the first out gay member of the Michigan Senate, but as a result, we enshrined LGBTQ protections in our state civil rights law, and it is disruptive now as I take on our institution and work to open up our records to public scrutiny and bring more transparency to state government,” Moss said.
Moss has been a peristent advocate for expanding the state’s Freedom of Information Act and also sponsored legislation that expanded the 1973 Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to protect against discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.
More recently, Moss garnered headlines when he literally stared down state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) at his own press conference after the Oakland County Republican introduced a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn its 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage. 
“I walked into that room and looked at the seat right in front of the podium and thought, “I’m going to sit right there as he’s going to try to inflict harm upon my community. I’m going to make him say it right to my face and then he cowardly left without taking any questions,’” Moss said.

He says he saw it as an opportunity to tell not just his side as a gay person, but also speak for those in the community who support their LGBTQ neighbors and family members and are tired of divisiveness and hatred in politics.
“We got such an overwhelming response to my office, not just from the district, but from across the state, and really across the country, of people telling me this is the way forward,” Moss said. “So you know my feet and my heart led me into that room and it’s just kind of intrinsic within me to keep the fight going and to stand up boldly in this moment.”
Moss said that moment is one rife with concern over the state of the economy and just what Michigan’s future will look like, especially with the Trump administration’s erratic tariff policy. 
“I don’t think you could tell me what the tariff policy is today, because it changes every day. It depends on what the president tweets every morning that’s created a lot of instability and economic anxiety, especially in our manufacturing economy here in the state of Michigan, so that is top of mind for folks in my district.”
When asked if he had the resources to mount and win a congressional campaign in a battleground state like Michigan, Moss said he was ready for that challenge, but also believes that the 11th District, which spans central Oakland County and includes Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills, Farmington Hills, Pontiac, Royal Oak, and Troy, is much more progressive than it has been in the past, which he says is largely due to the rise of President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement.
“Where people in this district, in Bloomfield and Birmingham and West Bloomfield, who may at one point in time traditionally have voted Republican could not sustain this continued attack on social issues driven by Donald Trump, so this district in this county has gone through a big shift over the last several years that I can stand boldly on my Democratic values and absolutely campaign on that record,” said Moss.

After more than 11 hours of debate in the U.S. House National Resources Committee, Nevada’s sole Republican in Congress, Rep. Mark Amodei, introduced the amendment as part of the Republicans’ budget package. The amendment passed the committee on a 24-19 vote along party lines.
“Nevada population centers are all encumbered by federal land that can’t meet their housing and development needs without disposal of federal lands. Unlike most other states, Nevadans rely on Congress to make these lands available,” Amodei said to committee members. 
Amodei’s amendment brought harsh condemnation from his Nevada congressional colleagues.
The amendment would order the sale of more than 65,000 acres of public land in Clark County identified for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management in resource management plans, but not yet sold.
It would also allow the sale of nearly 16,000 acres of public land in Washoe County, 12,000 acres in Lyon County, and the sale or exchange of more than 350,000 acres in Pershing County in order to resolve the checkerboard spread of public and private land in the county.
Public lands included in the amendment would need to be sold within 2 years of the proposal’s passage.
The amendment, which Amodei introduced along with Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy of Utah, would also compel the sale of about 11,000 acres of public land in Utah. 
Income generated from the sale of Nevada’s public lands in the amendment would not go to the state like it has in the past, instead it would be siphoned to the U.S. Treasury to help cover the Trump administration’s proposed tax cuts, according to the amendment.
Amodei said the Congressional Budget Office estimates the “amendment would generate billions in federal revenue.”
Republicans are looking to pass their larger budget package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by Trump, through the budget reconciliation process, which allows the Senate to pass legislation on fiscal matters with a simple majority vote.
Amodei, who represents much of Northern Nevada, acknowledged Nevada’s other representatives whose districts cover Clark County, do not support the amendment, but argued the public lands included in the amendment were identified by the four counties referenced in the proposal.
“This is a Nevada-centric amendment drafted and requested by Nevadans,” he said during the marathon hearing.
Democrats on the National Resources Committee strongly criticized the inclusion of the last-minute amendment as part of the Republicans’ budget package, characterizing the amendment as “stupid,” “slapdash,” “deeply irresponsible,” and “some truly odious sausage.” 
“This is just some truly odious sausage at 11:20pm at the end of a long markup,” said Ranking Member Jared Huffman of California. 
“This is unacceptable,” said New Mexico Rep. Melanie Stansbury. “This is disgusting. This is stupid.”
Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado urged the committee not to allow the provisions related to Clark County to pass without input from Nevada’s other representatives, whose districts cover Clark County. 
“Give those other members of Congress an opportunity to weigh in here, at least be heard, as opposed to an 11 o’clock PM, last minute amendment that they’re just finding out about right now as we’re texting them,” said Neguse. 
Neguse characterized the amendment as unprecedented and asked if Amodei had consulted with Democratic Reps. Steven Horsford, Susie Lee and Dina Titus from Southern Nevada before introducing the amendment.
“I don’t know how it works in Colorado, sir, but I can tell you, in Nevada, we all talk frequently, and this is not going to come as a surprise to any of them,” Amodei said. “Please feel free to consult them.”
Amodei ‘throwing Nevadans under the bus’
Nevada congressional Democrats told a very different story, in which Amodei pushed his amendment through the House Natural Resource Committee without consulting them..
Nevada’s Democratic federal delegation repeatedly called the amendment an attempt to sell off the public lands in Nevada for the purpose of funding the Trump administration’s proposed tax cuts.
Lee said Amodei’s amendment was “a slap in the face to Nevadans,” calling it a “short-sighted and bad faith proposal.”
“In the dead of night, Rep. Mark Amodei led House Republicans in throwing Nevadans under the bus — advancing legislation to pay for their disastrous tax bill by selling off Nevada’s public lands,” Lee said in a statement.
“For decades, federal law has ensured that proceeds from land sales in southern Nevada stay in Nevada. Last night’s traitorous maneuver instead would send Nevada’s land proceeds to Washington to pay for tax cuts for billionaires,” she continued.
Democratic Rep. Dina Titus said any “proposals to sell public lands should be done openly because public lands belong to all of us.”
“The land would be sold for ‘billions’ and the money would go directly to the U.S. Treasury with no financial benefit for outdoor recreation, protecting critical ecosystems, or wildfire protection in Southern Nevada,” Titus said in a statement.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen joined their counterparts in the House in condemning the amendment, vowing to oppose the proposal in the Senate. The amendment is part of a larger budget package that needs to pass the full House and Senate before landing on Trump’s desk for approval.
Cortez Masto called the proposal “insane” and said it was “one of the single biggest sell-offs of Nevada public lands in history.”
“In the dead of night, Representative Mark Amodei pushed House Republicans to move forward with an insane plan that cuts funding from water conservation and public schools across Nevada,” Cortez Masto said. “This is a land grab to fund Republicans’ billionaire giveaway tax bill, and I’ll fight it with everything I have.”
Cortez Masto said the amendment ignores her bill, the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, a bill years in the making that would open 250,000 acres of land in Clark County to development while conserving nearly 2 million acres.
Rosen said Amodei “sold out Nevadans in the dead of night by passing a flawed, hastily-drafted proposal.”
“I will not support a Washington-drafted proposal that will lead to Nevada losing out on millions of dollars in funding for our local priorities like education and restoration around the Truckee River, all so Republicans in Washington can pay for more tax cuts for billionaires,” Rosen said in a statement. 
Rosen likewise said the amendment undermines the Truckee Meadows Public Lands Management Act, a bill she crafted that would make nearly 16,000 acres of public lands in Washoe County available for sale while conserving another nearly 948,000 acres.
Amodei’s office did not respond to requests for comment about the criticism from his Nevada congressional colleagues.
Conservation groups said the proposal would only encourage more sprawl and unsustainable growth in a region with two-decades of severe drought. 
“We can’t fill Lake Mead with rhetoric about tax cuts and housing,” said Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
For years, Nevada’s federal delegation had attempted to pass their own public lands bills in Congress, with no success. 
Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that’s because the sale of public land for development is “deeply unpopular.”
“It puts Las Vegas on a collision course with a bleak future of taps running dry, unbreathable air, and disappearing wildlife. So instead, Mark Amodei is using the cover of night to hand over our public lands to his buddies in the real estate industry while he thinks nobody is watching,” Donnelly said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/amodei2023-sos-cropped-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-05-08 08:03:30.352205

“We are all familiar with mammograms and how important they are to detect breast cancer. But people who have survived breast cancer or have other major risks need to get more precise ultrasounds or breast MRI tests,” explained Rep. Mary Belk (D-Mecklenburg) in giving her bill a final push ahead of this week’s crossover deadline.
The diagnostic parity bill makes it so that all patients in North Carolina can get supplemental preventative screenings, with the same cost-sharing arrangement as routine mammograms. Far too many women, said Belk, cannot afford the medically necessary tests because of copays that can range from $252 to $1,200.
Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson) said that the Women’s Legislative Caucus would stand with Belk in supporting House Bill 297.

But Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry), herself a breast cancer survivor, said she could not support the bill that would likely raise insurance costs.
“This increases our health care costs because it increases our insurance costs. I’m afraid I can’t do this,” said the Surry County Republican. “This is one of those we put an extra burden on the insurance company, anytime we’re calling something parity.”
On any other day, such a critique by the veteran Republican might have been enough to sink Belk’s bill.
But House Speaker Pro Tem Mitchell Setzer (R-Catawba) came to the rescue.
“My mother is a 28-year breast cancer survivor. I hope you all will fully vote for this bill,” Setzer told his colleagues. “We’ll deal with the consequence later, but it is something that is desperately needed.”
But it was Rep. Howard Penny Jr. (R-Harnett) that shocked the chamber when he revealed he too was a breast cancer survivor.
“In April of 2021, I was diagnosed with breast cancer,” the House Deputy Majority Whip confided.
Rep. Penny said following a biopsy, a surgeon removed his right chest tissue where a lump was found. He was back at work the following week. Early detection and treatment are critical for improved outcomes.

“I was sitting here with a port in my side, back there on the House floor. Once a year, I go get a mammogram, which is a lot of fun for men because, guess what? We don’t have the anatomy to do what they’ve got to do,” Penny joked.
Penny urged his male colleagues in the House to be as brave as the women in their lives.
“If you’ve got any indication, you’ve got a lump in your breast, go get it checked.”
House Bill 297 passed 111-1, surviving crossover week. The bill now moves to the NC Senate where Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) is running Senate Bill 553. The “Save More Tatas Act” would provide health coverage parity for breast cancer diagnostic imaging. That bill would also allocate $3.5 million to help recruit and retain mammography technologists in rural and underserved areas.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages_breastcancer-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-05-08 08:03:30.352205

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)If you live in Minnesota, you may have already had an inkling, but a quick glance at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s U.S. solar resource map confirms: Minnesota is among the least sunny states in the Lower 48.
Yet Minnesota gets a surprising amount of its electricity from the sun. It’s in the top 20 for installed solar capacity overall and boasts the country’s fourth-largest community solar program, thanks in part to a trailblazing 2014 law allowing customers to purchase shares in the smallish arrays that now dot warehouse roofs and farmland across the state.
More recently, residential solar has taken off in Minnesota as more utility customers — mostly but not exclusively in the Twin Cities metro — look to lessen their reliance on the electric grid. Few local enterprises have done more for those folks than St. Paul-based All Energy Solar, which helped kickstart the market in 2009 and now does business across the United States. 
Solar power was still a novelty for most Minnesotans back then, but not for All Energy Solar co-founder and CEO Michael Allen. 
Allen became fascinated with the technology in junior high school, wrote the business plan for his company-to-be in college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and then spent several years in the 2000s learning the ropes as a California-based employee in BP’s nascent solar division. (His brother and fellow All Energy Solar cofounder Brian Allen was one of the first employees of SolarCity, now a Tesla subsidiary.)
Today, solar power is the world’s fastest-growing source of electricity. Deployments of large lithium-ion batteries to store excess power are rising quickly too. All Energy Solar installs both for a customer base that Michael Allen says is around 70% residential and 30% commercial.
But the U.S. solar industry also faces tremendous uncertainty thanks in part to stiff tariffs imposed by President Trump and instability around the future of generous federal tax incentives for clean energy equipment. SunPower, once one of the country’s biggest solar installers, declared bankruptcy last summer; another, Sunnova, is in serious trouble.
The Reformer spoke with Michael Allen last month about the state of the solar energy industry, the state and federal legislation he’s watching closely this year, and his not-sales pitch to solar-curious customers.
What’s your sales pitch to people who aren’t sure about the whole solar energy thing?
We actively say we don’t have a sales pitch, to be clear. Most people come to us because they’re interested in learning about solar. We listen to them and try to position ourselves as consultants who can help them solve their energy challenges. 
A lot of that is education, focused on the basics of how the technology works, how it helps customers produce their own energy and pay less for electricity, and getting past some of the myths and misconceptions. No, you don’t need a giant battery to make it work.
That said, it’s still surprising when people ask us, ‘Is this stuff for real?’ Yes, solar energy is a multibillion-dollar industry. We’re not doing it just for fun!
What are the biggest threats facing Minnesota’s solar industry right now?
The Minnesota Senate’s energy omnibus bill has some provisions that could harm the industry. The proposal to do away with Xcel Energy’s Solar*Rewards program, the primary funding mechanism for Xcel customers who want to go solar. There are also provisions to kill net metering for customers of municipal utilities and electric cooperatives [reducing how much they get paid for excess electricity] and to discontinue the community solar program.
Less talked about are the unfair solar access fees charged by some Minnesota cooperatives, which I brought up in Senate testimony earlier this year. They’re some of the highest in the country. We see solar access fees as potentially even more detrimental for rural solar customers than the proposed net metering changes. In effect, solar customers are charged an additional fee even if they never sell electricity back to the grid. It’s like charging someone who installs LED light bulbs. My biggest concern is that we continue this approach of imposing fees instead of trying to come up with better rules.
In general, we need to get away from emotional thinking on energy policy. Policymakers and state energy regulators should take into account the countless data-driven studies showing the long-term value of customer-owned energy production. Right now, utility companies seem to be dominating the conversation and winning these battles, which in turn is stifling our ability to innovate toward a better energy system. We should be considering more ideas and working with utilities to test them.
How would you characterize All Energy Solar’s relationship with investor-owned utilities like Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power?
We’ve worked with 400 or 500 different utilities across the country and Xcel is right up there with the most difficult, which is frustrating. Fighting each other on everything is not going to get us anywhere.
Our solution literally gives power back to the people, which not only makes customers more resilient but increases the grid’s resilience as well. In turn, that avoids the need to build as much new infrastructure, like substations and power plants. 
The problem is that investor-owned utilities make more money when they build new infrastructure. So they continue the traditional model of building big, centralized power plants. The technology [wind and solar power] might be newer and cleaner, but the model is the same.
Customers end up paying for this. We need to find a healthy balance before we get a snowball effect where more folks say ‘I’m done,’ and cut the cord, which increases costs for the remaining customers and ultimately hurts the people who can least afford to pay their bills. That’s where we’re headed if we continue to have an adversarial relationship with utilities. 
Can we bridge the divide between providers of smaller-scale energy solutions and big utilities? How?
We can. The solar industry is learning that we need to compromise, that we can’t just have our cake and eat it too. We can’t see ourselves as the only solution because we’re just one of many. 
The reality is, we build thousands of projects in Xcel’s territory every year, which shows that we can work together. They — and we — are willing to come to the table. 
We can do more, though. We would like utilities to be partners in allowing new solutions, like placing more customer-owned batteries on the grid to capture and store power for times when it’s needed most. That’s a powerful solution that utilities should value appropriately. We also believe utilities should value the non-energy benefits of customer-owned resources, like jobs and economic activity.
How worried are you about what’s going on in Washington, D.C.?
Yeah, it’s concerning to hear [government officials] speaking out of both sides of their mouths. You can’t say you want a manufacturing renaissance in the United States and then eliminate incentives for people to buy the products you want to make here. 
[Editor’s note: To pay for tax cuts expected to cost $4.5 trillion over 10 years, congressional Republicans are considering repealing or sunsetting tax incentives for buyers and manufacturers of clean energy products, including solar panels and grid-connected batteries. They’re also mulling deep cuts to Medicaid.]
So if the tax credits are reduced or eliminated, we’ll see a reduction in American manufacturing activity. That said, we believe that solar will continue to make sense regardless and that innovation could actually accelerate out of necessity in the absence of incentives. We’ll see added pressure to make these products better and cheaper.
From a global perspective, the industry will continue to grow. Just look at China.
What are you most optimistic about these days, if anything?
While I’m disheartened by some of the proposals under consideration in the state Legislature right now, I know that we have really intelligent, thoughtful lawmakers who are willing to fight for common sense. The House energy bill has none of the cuts proposed in the Senate, for example.
And I don’t think the Senate wants to kill everything either. They want to make programmatic adjustments because they want a smart, cost-effective electric grid. They’re just going about it differently.
That’s policy. From a technology standpoint, I’m encouraged by the ongoing adoption of batteries for energy storage. It’s happening fast, it’s already making the grid stronger, and it’s going to continue. We just need to push for a wider adoption of customer-owned and sited solutions so power continues to be put back into the people’s hands.

Heath Allbright, a 39-year-old business man and former member of the Cullman County Board of Education, has raised about $60,000 for his campaign, according to campaign finance records. His top donor is the Progress Political Action Committee (PAC), the fundraising arm of the Business Council of Alabama, which donated $7,500. 
Allbright said in an interview last week that he has gotten a lot of positive responses in his campaign.
“I know it takes money to run campaigns, and I was happy to get some support from some associations that I’m a part of,” Allbright said.
Allbright said he values conservative christian family values, funding local schools and tax cuts for small businesses.
“A lot of these go a whole lot deeper than just what they sound like on the surface,” Allbright said.
Don Fallin, a 60-year-old veteran, declined to comment Wednesday morning on anything related to the election until after the primary on Tuesday, if he wins. 
According to campaign finance records, Fallin has raised $30,000, most of which come from individual contributors. The Alabama Veterans PAC donated $5,000. 
The winner of the primary will face Democratic nominee Alex Braswell in a general election on Aug. 26.
Allbright accuses Fallin
Allbright accused Fallin on Sunday of attacking his character through campaign advertising. A mailer that Allbright said was sent to voters in District 11 that says Allbright was “hand picked” by Montgomery. According to Allbright’s campaign finance records, the Alabama House Majority Party PAC donated $5,000 to his campaign.
“As many of you have seen, my opponent has resorted to negative attacks on myself, my family and my character,” Allbright said in a video posted to his campaign Facebook page. “I just wanted to let you guys know I am not going to engage in this type of behavior because that is not what a true leader does.”
Allbright said the 1776 PAC funded the mailers. The PAC donated $2,150 in-kind for advertising to the Fallin campaign, according to campaign finance records. 
Fallin declined to comment on anything election related on Wednesday.
Braswell said she has not received the mail, nor can she find anybody in the district that has. Allbright did not respond to a request for a copy of the mail on Monday.
“I have called this district from top to bottom and cannot find a single person who has actually received one of these,” she wrote in a text Monday night.
The lone Democratic candidate
Although the primary election does not matter for Braswell with no challenger, she said she has enjoyed running a “blue dot campaign” and meeting people throughout the district that support her. 
“I’m enjoying getting to meet new people and meeting new supporters every day,” the 35-year-old said in a phone interview last week.
Braswell has raised about $4,000 for her campaign, most of which come from individual contributors, according to campaign finance records.
As her campaign has evolved, so have her priorities. While disability rights are still important to her, she is shifting her concentration on the topic to making sure the definition of special needs within the CHOOSE Act aligns with federal guidelines.
“The fights of the disabled are still facing disruption in my community with the CHOOSE Act for special needs children to qualify,” the American Sign Language interpreter said.
She also is prioritizing helping the “middle man” in Alabama’s tax structure.
“The middle man is not exactly meant to succeed here, and the low class families really bear a lot of the Alabama state tax burden here in the state,” she said.
She also wants to increase access to mental health care and substance abuse care. 
“Making sure that our mental health centers have the funding they need and aren’t turning people away because their insurance isn’t accepted there because of their inability to pay,” she said.
Local legislation
SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, received final passage on May 1. The bill allows the City of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol. Allbright and Brasswell oppose the legislation. Allbright said the timing of the legislation was poor.
“What I was against is the timing that all of that happened. The people that were giving me pressure, there’s not a representative from our district down there right now to tell them what was going on, other than Senator (Garlan) Gudger, (R-Cullman)” Allbright said.
Cullman County currently does not have representation in the House. Former Rep. Randall Shedd, a Republican, resigned in February to work for Gudger, the Senate President Pro Tem, opening the seat up. Rep. Corey Harbison, a Republican, resigned in April after not being present for most of the session. 
Brasswell said the bill should have been scrapped because there are no Cullman voices in the House.
“I think having economic development out on Smith Lake is a great opportunity for my county to have more jobs,” she said. “But that bill should have gone through the people.”
The legislation passed 74-0 with 25 abstentions. It goes to Gov. Kay Ivey to be signed into law. 
RAISE and CHOOSE Acts
Allbright said he wants more local control of education and said the CHOOSE Act is as local as it gets. 
“I’m all about more control at a local level, and if that’s able to go all the way down to the parents so that they can make the choice for their for their kids, then I’m a fan,” he said
He also supports the RAISE Act on the same principle.
Brasswell said that education should be accessible to everybody. Although she is skeptical of the CHOOSE Act expansion, she said $7,000 is not enough for private school tuition anyway.
“Education should be equally accessible, period. That’s why public schools are here,” she said. “And I feel like the money that we’re putting back in our community in these tax credits through the CHOOSE Act, we should be putting back into our public schools that can accommodate everyone across the board.”
For public education, Braswell said the RAISE Act is a step in the right direction, but wants to monitor it to make sure rural schools are benefiting from the program. 
“I just want to make sure that the funding is being distributed into our community, to make sure equal access is given to everyone, no matter their families, economic status, what language they speak, what disability they have,” she said.
How to vote
District 11 voters can choose between Allbright and Fallin for the Republican nomination on Tuesday. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here.

“You’re going to hear from parents back home if this passes,” Elliot said to the body.
Students can access their phones under three exceptions: if they study under an Individualized Education Plan that allows it, for teacher-approved instruction and for medical purposes.
Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, who sponsored a similar bill and handled the legislation in the Senate, said that students can use the school’s front office to contact their parents.
“In school systems where this has been implemented, it has worked,” Sessions said.
Cellphones can be stored in a locker, car or other storage device so long as they are not on the student’s person. According to the Pew Research Center, 72% of U.S. high school teachers say that cellphone distraction is a major issue in their classrooms. At least 11 states ban or restrict cellphone use during school hours, according to KFF, and 17 other states have introduced legislation.
Ivey in her 2025 State of the State endorsed legislation to ban cellphones in schools, saying that social media is negatively impacting students.

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)The Las Vegas Valley Water District implemented a water rate structure two years ago that imposed hefty levies on the valley’s biggest residential water users. Now state lawmakers are seeking to reexamine those fees following years of community pushback.
Residential water use accounts for 60 percent of the water consumed in the Las Vegas Valley. The excessive use fee was designed to affect the 10 percent of single-family residential customers who are the largest water users, and slow the flow of the valley’s diminishing water resources.
But critics of the excessive use fee say the measure does not consider the lot size of properties subject to the fees and disproportionately impacts those living in the City of Las Vegas and unincorporated Clark County. The cities of Henderson, North Las Vegas, and Boulder City do not have excess use fees.
The Assembly Committee on Natural Resources heard Senate Bill 143 on Monday, a bill that would authorize the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources to evaluate and review the excessive use fees and other water conservation efforts that impact turf and tree canopy.
If passed, lawmakers would be tasked with making recommendations for the 2027 legislative session.
The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen (D-Las Vegas), passed the Senate in April with unanimous bipartisan approval.
Nguyen said the bill’s intent is to examine water conservation efforts in Nevada, particularly in older neighborhoods with more mature landscaping and larger lot sizes that may require more water. 
“A large part of my district is in older neighborhoods, often historic neighborhoods, and a lot of those older neighborhoods have lots of mature landscaping, including a tree canopy that’s often 50 to 75 (years) if not older in age,” Nguyen said. “These older residential communities are really the closest things that we do have to an urban green space and places that are lacking investment by our municipalities and new parks and green spaces for outdoor recreation.”
Nguyen said residents in her district have repeatedly expressed frustration about the disproportionate impact of excess use fees incurred by maintaining their mature landscaping.
In Southern Nevada, the excessive use charge applies to residential water customers who exceed certain seasonal thresholds. The charge is $9 per 1,000 gallons of water used beyond the threshold.
“We have plenty of people that cannot afford the landscaping and water costs associated with maintaining their existing landscaping,” Nguyen said.
During the hearing, supporters of the bill said they fear the excess use fees would eventually drive the loss of mature tree canopy in Las Vegas, lower air quality, and increase the urban heat island effect — a phenomenon that creates higher temperatures in cities due to an abundance of superheating man-made surfaces like roads and pavement.
Robert Hillsman, an anesthesiologist and one of the top 100 water users in Las Vegas in 2023, spoke in support of the bill. Hillsman said he has landscaped much of his one acre property and his water bill has doubled due to the excessive use fees. 
“There are hundreds of thousands of dollars in landscaping, and despite the removal of grass, my water bill now exceeds $3,000 per month. This is due to the very unfair, lowered limited gallons and very abusive excess water surcharges,” Hillsman said. 
Hillsman argued the excess use fee does not help mitigate the “rapidly escalating urban heat island effect.”
Andy Belanger, the director of Public Services at Las Vegas Valley Water District, said the excess use fee is working as intended.
“The excessive use charge was designed to increase water conservation among people who are price insensitive to water conservation, and it has done that,” Belanger said during the hearing.
“It only hits the top 6% of water customers because nearly half of them have changed their behavior. The people who are still paying that, have been resistant to change,” he continued.
Belanger emphasized the importance of water conservation in a state that only receives about 2% of Colorado River flows. 
While the Las Vegas Valley Water District testified as neutral on the bill, Belanger said the agency would support the idea of a study on water conservation and was fully prepared to defend the excess use fee in front of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources if the bill passed. 
Laura McSwain, Founder and President of the Water Fairness Coalition, said the bill was a good first step in creating oversight for water conservation policies in Southern Nevada.
“For 20 years, [the Southern Nevada Water Authority] and the Las Vegas Valley Water District executive team has focused on the removal of grass from water savings and spends millions of dollars each year in community outreach advertising using Lake Mead levels to convince residents to submit to their policy prescriptions for water savings.”
McSwain, who lives on a half-acre lot in Las Vegas she purchased nine years ago, said current residents should not have to bear the brunt of the water savings if that water is only being conserved in order to fuel more growth in Las Vegas. The district, she said, should be aggressive in pursuing new water saving technologies to address needed conservation.
“Why would the agency responsible for water delivery and water safety so aggressively seek the removal of elements that so much protect our quality of life?” McSwain said.
Nguyen said if the bill passed, she wants the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources to investigate the impact of turf removal on urban heat island effects and the benefits of preserving trees and grass.
The committee would also be charged with reviewing advancements in landscape water conservation technologies and considering exceptions for turf grass growing under trees, based on research on the cooling benefits of the combination.
No action was taken on the bill. The bill will need to pass in the State Senate by May 23 before being sent to the governor’s desk for final approval.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sprinkler-in-shade-1024x642.jpg,,,2025-05-08 08:03:30.352205

Wes Moore signed more than 190 bills into law during a ceremony Tuesday at the State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)While Gov. Wes Moore (D) continues to be noncommittal on whether he’ll sign a Maryland Reparations Commission bill into law, a group of supporters plan to rally Friday in Annapolis to show their support for the measure.
“I would not tell the governor of Maryland what he should or should not do. All the rally is about is showing why people care about the issue,” said Prince George’s County Councilmember Wanika Fisher (D), who’s organizing the rally at Lawyers Mall in Annapolis.
When asked if Moore — the only sitting Black governor in the nation — plans to sign the bill, a spokesperson Wednesday pointed to a statement from last month that the governor will work with “all partners involved to ensure that we are passing legislation that will make Maryland safer, more affordable, more competitive.”
Moore could sign the bill, let it go into law without his signature or, potentially, veto it. There are two more bill signing ceremonies scheduled, on May 13 and May 20.
Fisher said there are a number of misconceptions about the bill, approved last month in the waning days of the 2025 legislative session.
“When you talk to people about the concept of reparations, everyone has 50 million ideas,” she said. “A commission’s important because you bring in different facets of the community together to say, ‘Hey, this is what we kind of think that would work.’ Nothing is going to be perfect. But it does allow you to have a meeting of the minds.”
Fisher is a former state delegate who sponsored legislation to establish a reparations commission in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Hearings were held, but none of those bills ever made it out of a committee.

Fiscal notes with those bills said “total expenditures would likely exceed $1 million,” for hiring at least five staff members and issuing any money to “individuals whose ancestors were enslaved in the State.”
But the fiscal note for this year’s reparations bill, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), is a much more modest $54,500 to hire one contractual archivist to help produce reports and conduct research.
Muse and Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a companion House version this year that did not advance out of committee, have stressed that this year’s bill is strictly a study.
The bill notes commission would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs.
The bill calls for a commission of nearly two dozen people, including two employees from the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities with expertise in the history of slavery; a representative from the Maryland Black Chamber of Commerce; and the state archivist or a designee from that office. Another eight people appointed by the governor could include members such as a mental health expert, an attorney with expertise in civil rights or constitutional law, and two members of the general public.
The committee would have to deliver a preliminary report of recommendations by Jan. 1, 2027, to explain any findings, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.
Maryland joins a handful of states including California, Illinois, New York and Colorado that have approved legislation to study reparations. But advocates say Maryland should be a leader in the effort.
“If the governor were to veto it, it would be pretty devastating to the reparation’s movement in general that has fought for years to put the issue on the table,” said Dayvon Love, public policy director for Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle of Baltimore, who plans to speak at Friday’s rally.
“It’s important for a state with the largest Black caucus. It has a Black governor. That has a political environment that would be favorable to that kind of policy to demonstrate that it can be done,” he said. “Maryland is poised to be a leader on that front.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0256-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-08 08:03:30.352205

Phil Murphy in the June 10 primary have shared recent tax returns with the New Jersey Monitor. (Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)With just over a month left until New Jersey’s June 10 primary, most of the 11 candidates hoping to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy are giving the public a glimpse into their finances.
But varying financial disclosure regulatory schemes at the state and federal levels mean some candidates must disclose more than others, and the most exacting disclosures — the release of a candidate’s tax returns — are purely voluntary.
Disclosure forms that candidates are required to file with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Committee reveal only the sources of income, forgoing any disclosure of income levels, even in ranges used on disclosures for sitting lawmakers.
Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics, called this level of disclosure “completely inadequate.”
“It’s absurd,” Rasmussen said. “It’s certainly useful to know what the sources of income are, but it tells us virtually nothing about the level of potential conflicts.”
Congressional disclosures elicit more transparency (the race to succeed Murphy includes two sitting members of Congress). On those forms, candidates and holders of federal office are required to report incomes in ranges across a broad array of categories.
Income information for some candidates can be gleaned from other disclosures. Forms that nonprofits are required to file with the IRS can reveal portions of some candidates’ incomes, for example. And candidates who hold public office are subjected to disclosure of their taxpayer-funded salaries.
“It sort of creates this patchwork where, if the public happens to be lucky enough to have candidates who meet the greater standard or run into a greater requirement, we’ll get a greater level of detail, but if we happen to have somebody who doesn’t meet the category, we’re going to get a much lower level of detail,” Rasmussen said.
As for tax returns, all six Democratic candidates for governor have disclosed returns for 2023 or 2024 when asked by the New Jersey Monitor. None of the five Republicans running have done so.
Dan Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll, said releasing this kind of information becomes an almost certainty for candidates once they win a primary, but not necessarily before.
“You don’t want to lose the primary and then have put that data out there if you don’t have to because it’s potentially embarrassing,” Cassino said.
He added that Republican candidates could follow President Donald Trump’s lead and forgo releasing their tax returns, though at least three of the five men seeking the GOP nomination have said they would release their returns at some point during the campaign.

Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11) and her husband, a broker at UBS Securities, reported roughly $3.2 million in income for 2024, their tax returns say.
The couple reported $114,970 in dividend income from index and exchange-traded funds, state and federal financial disclosures show. Sherrill does not hold individual stock. Wages and salaries, including a bonus for the congresswoman’s husband, accounted for the overwhelming share of their income.
They were billed $1.08 million in federal income tax for 2024 and were billed $279,010 in New York state income tax (UBS Securities is based in New York City). They were billed $29,002 in New Jersey state income taxes, which were offset by tax already paid to New York.
Sherrill’s 2023 congressional financial disclosure put her net worth between $4.8 million and $14 million. Her 2024 disclosure is due on May 15.
Members of Congress are paid a $174,000 salary.

 Rep. Josh Gottheimer
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) and his wife, who is general counsel at political consulting firm Tusk Strategies, reported $897,617 in income for 2023, according to their tax return.
They were billed $218,486 in federal income tax and did not share a state return.
Salaries accounted for the largest share of their income, $654,105, and they drew $208,754 from dividends, most of which were qualified dividends taxed at rates less than the income tax.
Gottheimer’s 2023 congressional financial disclosure — he has requested a 90-day extension for his 2024 disclosure, typically due on May 15 — shows a net worth of between $16.9 million and $75.3 million.
The congressman holds voluminous individual stock and is one of Congress’s most prolific traders. He has previously said he does not manage his own investments.

Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, a Democrat, and his wife, who runs a physical therapy practice, reported $908,926 in income in 2022 and were billed $274,288 in federal income tax, their tax returns say.
The majority of that income, $742,023, came from Jaclyn Fulop’s physical therapy practice.
They were billed $66,225 in state income tax in 2022.
Jersey City payroll records list the mayor’s 2025 salary as $245,521.
The financial disclosure Fulop filed with the state Election Law Enforcement Commission, which covers 2024, lists no sources of income apart from salaries.
Tax information for 2023 is not available because the Fulops have lodged a dispute over an overpayment, Fulop said. Their returns for 2024 have not been filed, and the couple typically seeks an extension and files in October, he said.

 State Sen. Jon Bramnick
As a state legislator, Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) is required to annually disclose sources of income, debts, and properties he owns to the Office of Legislative Services. Those disclosures require legislators to report their incomes in four ranges spanning from less than $10,000 to more than $50,000.
Bramnick reported earning more than $200,000 from his law practice on his 2023 legislative financial disclosure. He and his wife earned between $35,001 and $85,000 from Social Security and Patricia Bramnick’s pension that year.
Legislators earn a $49,000 annual salary. That wage will rise to $82,000 beginning in 2026. Legislators’ disclosures for 2024 are due on May 15.
The couple received between $50,001 and $101,000 in dividends in 2023 and between $10,003 and $55,000 from other investments.
They also drew income from rentals of five properties and held more than $50,000 in debt owed to three banks, according to legislative and state election commission financial disclosures.
It’s not clear how much the couple paid in taxes. Bramnick’s campaign said he would release his tax return if he won the primary.

He reported his wife, Melinda, received dividends from exchange-traded funds and some individual stock holdings, among other investment income (Ciattarelli said in 2023 that the two had separated).
Ciattarelli has not released tax returns for recent years but said he would provide them later, though he did not give a timeline. He released five years of tax returns when he sought the governorship in 2017.
Those filings showed a majority of his income flowed from a medical publishing company he owned and has since sold.

Spadea, a Republican, reported a salary from his former position at radio station New Jersey 101.5, fees from the Common Sense Club — a nonprofit he founded — and proceeds from the sale of a home in Holtsville, New York.
Spadea received $65,450 in compensation from the 501(c)(4) nonprofit in 2022, according to disclosures it filed. Its filing for 2023 shows no compensation to Spadea or the nonprofit’s other officers.
It’s not clear how much he was paid by the nonprofit in 2024. The deadline for 2024 forms is May 15.
Spadea reported no investment income of any kind, and it’s not clear how much he paid in tax. His campaign said he was seeking an extension and would disclose his tax return once he filed.

Kranjac’s campaign manager did not respond to a request for the candidate’s tax returns.
 Justin Barbera
Justine Barbera, a Burlington County contractor, reported that he and members of his immediate family generated no income of any kind on the disclosure he filed with the state election commission. Barbera, a Republican, confirmed the accuracy of the filing to the New Jersey Monitor.

“It costs money to file. Are you saying nobody paid for that? What in the world?” Cassino said.
Barbera said he had no income because he had spent more than a year campaigning for office. He ran for the 3rd Congressional District’s House seat in 2024 under the Join the Revolution Party banner, finishing with 0.3% of the vote.
“I ran for Congress, then I ran straight into the governor’s race, so I’ve been running back-to-back campaigns the past 16 months,” he said.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Four years after state lawmakers failed to pass legislation to abolish the death penalty, despite having a Democratic trifecta, a bill this year would extend the time period for carrying out a potential execution. 
Nevada law currently calls for an execution to take place between 60 and 90 days after an execution is warranted.
Senate Bill 350, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall of Las Vegas, would lengthen the timeframe to between 180 and 270 days.
Ohrenschall said he “personally doesn’t support the death penalty” and would rather see it abolished. 
There have been 23 states that have abolished the death penalty, citing concerns including but not limited to racial disparities in the number of death row inmates, the high costs of capital cases going to trial, and documented likely instances of people being put to death after wrongful convictions, as well as people being exonerated while on death row.
The legislation seeks to ensure attorneys have an adequate amount of time to litigate any issues that arise once an execution is ordered, Ohrenschall said.
The legislation would also ensure that there is only one execution warrant that would be pending in Nevada at any given time.
“In Nevada, unlike other states, an execution warrant is issued by the district judge in the county where the conviction occurred,” said David Anthony, an attorney who specializes in capital cases who alongside Ohrenschall described the bill to a legislative panel. “In many other states, execution warrants are issued by a single entity.”
The bill passed out of the Senate April 21 on a 13-8 party-line vote. The legislation was heard Wednesday by the Assembly Judiciary Committee. 
Nevada hasn’t executed anyone since 2006. The state tried, and failed, to execute Scott Dozier in 2017. A lengthy legal battle over the drugs being used to kill Dozier resulted in the execution being postponed until he died by suicide in early 2019.
Ohrenschall, along with Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, both introduced separate bills in 2021 to abolish the state’s death penalty.
Former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said at the time he had a “hard time with the idea of a complete abolition” and thought executions should be reserved for extreme cases.
Despite uncertainty on whether Sisolak would sign a bill abolishing the death penalty, the Nevada Assembly voted 26-16 in a party line vote to advance Yeager’s bill. 
The legislation then stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee and died without getting another vote. 
Anthony said SB 350 represented “a common sense reform that helps bring the law into conformity with what the actual practice is in litigating capital cases.”
While there are ways for people to appeal their cases and delay their execution, “there are certain constitutional rights that cannot be litigated until there is an execution warrant,” he said.
The bill, Anthony said, would also give the Nevada Department of Corrections additional time to complete all the protocols statutorily required prior to an execution, including mental health evaluations and health exams. 
NDOCDirector James Dzurenda told lawmakers Wednesday the logistics of training staff, notifying victims and procuring the drugs for an execution is hard to accomplish in a short time period. 
The logistics for planning more than one execution concurrently would be “a nightmare process for corrections,” he added.
“What we do is we prepare,” Dzurenda said. “Even right now we are preparing for an execution in case we get one next week. That’s a lot of wasted taxpayer money. If we had an extension at the beginning of an execution we could prepare when we get a warrant. Right now we have to prepare before we get a warrant.”
There are currently 59 people on death row in Nevada according to the Death Penalty Information Center. 
But Dzurenda also said that if the timeframe is extended “too much could actually hurt the process” and opens the possibility for “appeals that may not have been necessary in my eyes or get these far fetched appeals that could stretch out an execution.”
Similar to efforts to get rid of the death penalty, the Nevada District Attorneys Association opposed efforts to change the timeframe for carrying out executions.  
Jennifer Noble, a lobbyist with the association who testified against the bill  Wednesday, said there is already a lengthy and robust process for people to challenge and appeal their guilty verdict as well as the death sentence.  
“This bill will not make anything easier on victims,” Noble said. 
Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice, in a letter supporting Ohrenschall’s legislation, wrote it wouldn’t lead to unnecessary delays but “rather reflect the time actually needed to ensure due process at a time when the stakes could not be higher.”
Mark Bettencourt, the executive director with the Nevada Coalition Against the Death Penalty, said while the coalition was still pursuing an end to the death penalty, the legislation was a “common sense bill” to ensure that if an execution was carried out it wasn’t rushed.

Let’s show the next generation that Vermont isn’t just a great place to raise a family — it’s the best place.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Oliver Parini: What Vermont risks losing if we cut education.","This commentary is by Oliver Parini of Weybridge. He and his wife, Elsie, have two children, who both plan to attend Weybridge Elementary School this fall.I was born and raised in Vermont. Like many Vermonters, I left home for college and spent time exploring life elsewhere. But when it came time for my wife and me to decide where to plant our roots and raise a family, the choice was clear. We came home.We didn’t return just for the hiking trails, skiing or postcard views, though those were part of the attraction. We came back because Vermont offered something we hadn’t found elsewhere: a culture of care. A place where neighbors still show up, where local farms feed communities and where we protect the land out of reverence. We believed in the Vermont way of life, and we wanted that for our kids.We now live in Weybridge, where both of our children will attend Weybridge Elementary next year — the same school I attended as a child. It’s a small, magical place with multi-age classrooms and a warm, welcoming culture. Everyone knows our kids and their strengths, struggles and dreams. The teachers, staff and families — we all feel like we’re in this together. It’s not just a school. It’s a community.We’ve been embraced here, and we’re not alone. Many of our friends moved to small towns like this one for the same reasons. They were looking for connection. They were looking for Vermont.But after more than 15 years here as an adult, I can say honestly that this Vermont lifestyle — this ideal we talk about — doesn’t come without serious challenges.The biggest, by far, is housing. It’s incredibly difficult for young people to find a place to live, let alone afford a house. Without young people, everything else starts to unravel. Our population is aging. The tax base is shrinking. The workforce is thinning. Families who want to move here often cannot.Even for those who find housing, another wall stands in the way: child care. There aren’t enough providers, and the cost is staggering. Many families are forced to make impossible choices — one parent staying home, delaying or giving up careers — just to make it work.Then there’s health care. As our population ages, the system faces increasing pressure. Older Vermonters naturally need more care. With fewer young people to offset those costs, premiums rise, and that strain extends beyond families. Soaring health care costs are now one of the biggest drivers of rising education spending, as schools struggle to cover insurance for staff. It’s all connected.These challenges point to a core truth: Vermont needs more young people. More families. More working-age adults to power our economy and invest in our communities.Which is why it’s baffling that we’re considering cost-cutting measures that threaten the very things that draw families here. Montpelier — the governor and the Legislature — need to sit up and listen here. We’re at a crucial inflection, and the future of Vermont will turn on decisions they make this year.Yes, we do need change. The status quo isn’t working. But that doesn’t mean we should rush ahead without doing what Vermonters do best — building thoughtful, community-driven consensus. The problem isn’t that change is happening. It’s how it’s happening. Decisions are being made by the government in Vermont without input from the people most affected, such as families, educators and local communities. People like us, whose schools are on the chopping block.This kind of top-down, rushed approach isn’t just shortsighted. It’s downright dangerous. Change made without listening, without care and without collaboration leaves holes in our communities. The ones who fall through those holes? Young families like mine.Education isn’t just another budget line. It’s one of our most powerful tools for attracting — and keeping — young families. When people consider where to live, they look at the schools. They ask: Will my child be known here? Will they thrive? Will they feel safe, supported and challenged?If we slash budgets, close small schools and consolidate into larger, impersonal institutions, we send the wrong message. This is like telling families: We don’t have your back, so look for somewhere else to live.We can’t treat education like a fulfillment center, where efficiency and cost-cutting come before community. It may save dollars on paper, but it erodes the very fabric that draws people here.Let’s think differently.Let’s be the state that invests boldly in children. The state where families move because of the schools. Where teachers are valued, classrooms are vibrant and small-town schools are essential, not expendable.Let’s build affordable housing. Expand access to quality child care. Improve health care sustainably. Let’s recognize that strong schools are at the heart of every thriving community.Let’s do this hard work thoughtfully. Let’s center on kids and young families, providing them not just with services but with real support and a sense of belonging.We’re at a crossroads. This is our opportunity not just to avoid decline, but to grow, adapt and lead. Let’s show the next generation that Vermont isn’t just a great place to raise a family. It’s the best place.The Vermont I believe in is thoughtful. It’s compassionate, and it takes care of its own.If we want a thriving Vermont tomorrow, we have to start building it — with intention — today, and make exactly the right choices in Montpelier, ones that put families and schools first.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Oliver Parini: What Vermont risks losing if we cut education.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-08 08:03:30.352205

Now that I have, I think it’s kind of cool. It’s a wiggly little amphibian with black-and-white stripes, sort of like if you crossed a zebra with one of those lizards that race across your porch.
These salamanders used to live all over the South. Now they’ve vanished from most of the places where they once existed.
Fortunately, a group of biologists is trying to ensure the remaining few can hang on to what’s left of their Panhandle habitat of slash and longleaf pines.
To help the salamanders stick around, the biologists follow a practice called “headstarting.” It involves collecting salamander eggs from the wild, hatching them, raising them in places where they’re protected from predators, then releasing them once they’re larger and have a better chance of survival.
So far this year, they have released 1,204 of these little critters back into the wild. The most recent release was just two weeks ago. That’s a lot of salamanders wiggling through the pines.
  J.J. Apodaca via ARC
I talked to the leader of this effort, J.J. Apodaca, a man with an impressively bushy beard and a doctorate in biology. He’s the executive director of the Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, or ARC for short. Any resemblance between this ARC and that ark of Noah’s saving two of every species is, I think, entirely intentional.
I asked him why his organization is putting in all this work to save a little salamander that hardly any human knows about.
“We have to keep these species around as part of the ecosystem,” Apodaca told me. “They have just as much a right to exist as we do.”
The salamanders eat earthworms and spiders and are themselves food for larger animals such as armadillos, he said. I don’t plan to lead everyone in singing “The Circle of Life” from The Lion King, but you can see what would happen to the food chain if the all the salamanders called in sick.
That’s why the ARC biologists get down on their hands and knees to look for the salamanders’ small, translucent eggs in shallow wetlands near Tallahassee, the home of a LOT of slimy creatures.
Apodaca conceded that the way they’re doing this “would have been considered a radical approach 20 years ago. But we have to intervene in a more radical way to save biodiversity.”
His organization is spending $300,000 a year to save the frosted salamander and its habitat, he said. When I asked if it would have been cheaper to save the species and its home before it became nearly extinct, he said, “Oh, yeah!” in a tone even more enthusiastic than Kool-Aid Man.
When it comes to conservation versus restoration, conservation is “vastly more efficient,” he said.
 A painful degree
Restoration projects like the one involving the frosted flatwoods salamander are a major industry all over Florida. If I were Ethel Merman, this is where I’d start belting out, “There’s no business like restoration business!”
The biggest example is the Everglades, which has become the largest and most expensive environmental restoration project in human history.
State and federal agencies are spending billions on that one, a project that has already lasted for 25 years and still has a loooong way to go.
  Eve Samples via Friends of the Everglades
But it had to be done, explained Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades.
“We’ve lost more than half the historic Everglades,” said Samples. “The loss created a huge burden on the public and policymakers to try to restore them.”
The Everglades were once regarded as an obstacle to progress, development, and farming, all of which conspired to get rid of it.
But the River of Grass turned out to be important for the South Florida water supply, the fishing industry, and flood control. That’s why we’re now spending so much tax money on rebuilding what’s left.
Despite the clear lesson of the Everglades, our shortsighted leaders keep allowing the same damage or destruction of other precious parcels of Florida’s ecosystems, Samples said.
“There’s a painful degree of irony in this,” Samples told me. “We don’t have to keep repeating the same mistakes.”
 The tipping point
Another area where lots of our tax dollars are being spent on restoration is the Indian River Lagoon.
The Indian River Lagoon in real life (or “IRL IRL,” if you’re from the texting generation) was once an amazing estuary full of a lot of marine life. Now it’s become a graveyard for malnourished manatees.
This happened because the Department of Environmental Protection allowed so much pollution to flow into the lagoon that it stimulated toxic algae blooms. The blooms then killed off the seagrass that the manatees both eat and spread.
As early as 2010, the Save the Manatee Club was warning state officials that the lagoon was going downhill fast, said Pat Rose, the club’s longtime executive director.
“We were warning them that the lagoon would soon reach a tipping point and collapse,” Rose told me.
Instead of stepping up efforts to stop the pollution and save the lagoon, government officials let the decline continue until, as had been predicted, the ecosystem collapsed. With nothing to eat, hundreds of manatees starved to death.

State biologists grew so desperate, they tried tossing donated lettuce out in the water, something that had never been tried before.
Now we taxpayers are footing the bill for trying to bring back the seagrass in the lagoon and stop the pollution from messing it up. But Rose said the effort is taking so long — at least 15 years — that he’s worried there will be a second collapse and even more manatees will starve.
Just two months ago, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the state would spend $100 million on trying to fix what’s broken in the lagoon. He talked about why the lagoon is important.
“This is the most biologically diverse estuary in all of North America, and it’s a key economic driver for the region and the state,” DeSantis said.
Given how important that waterway is, wouldn’t it have been smarter — and cheaper — for the DEP to do its job and prevent the pollution in the first place?
“No disagreement there,” Rose said.
 The most polluted lake
  Clay Henderson, provided by subject
Among the experts I called for examples of this phenomenon was Clay Henderson, a longtime preservation advocate who literally wrote the book on the subject (“Forces of Nature”). He mentioned Lake Apopka, once considered the most reliable bass-fishing lake in the South.
“There were over 20 fish camps around the lake,” Jim Peterson of the St. Johns River Water Management District told Spectrum News 13 last year. “They had lodging, they rented boats, they sold bait, they had entertainment. It was a place to come visit.”
But then farmers were allowed to convert 20,000 acres of marshes on the lake’s north shore into dry land for growing row crops.
“They did a great job of growing … but it added a lot of pollution to Lake Apopka,” Peterson told the TV station.
The pollution fueled algae blooms that killed off all the aquatic vegetation (sound familiar?). As a result, the bass fishing declined. Lake Apopka became known as the most polluted lake in the state.
Florida started working on fixing the lake in the 1980s. In 1996, the Legislature approved buying those farms and converting them back into wetlands to help clean up the lake.
Meanwhile, the water district waded into removing the pollutants from the lake. By 2024, the water had become clear enough that 95% of the lake’s aquatic vegetation returned.
“The restoration of former muck farms has transformed this area into a haven for wildlife and a jewel for the recreating public,” the water district’s website boasts.
To attract anglers back to the lake, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is stocking it with 1 million largemouth bass.
The cost to the taxpayers for all this: $200 million, spent over four decades.
“Much of the restoration cost was to remediate hazardous waste,” Henderson told me. “What I’ve learned over 40 years in conservation is it is always cheaper to buy conservation lands than to restore damaged ecosystems.”

 Stay saved
Talking to people about these restoration projects reminded me of a scene from one of my kids’ favorite animated movies, “The Incredibles.”
At the start of the movie, several superheroes sit for interviews. One of them, named Mr. Incredible, complains, “No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know, for a little bit?”
We here in Florida know that feeling.
All over the state, we’ve put in strenuous efforts to save what’s best about our state. A lot of acreage has been preserved as state parks and state forests, not to mention the more recent Florida Wildlife Corridor.
The popularity of those programs shows very clearly that people want that land to stay that way — preserved in a natural state.
Yet we’ve also seen repeated attempts at breaching the wall around the preserves, to un-save what’s been saved.
Turns out there are lots of misguided people and politicians who want to build golf courses and big hotels in the parks and roads through the forests and preserves.
  Cris Costello via Sierra Club
“We fight to protect something,” said Cris Costello of the Sierra Club, “and then we have to be vigilant about protecting it from further threats.”
As a result, the Legislature has just passed a bill to block any further attempt at building golf courses in state parks, something you would think would be obvious. Yet we’ve now had two governors in a row whose definition of greenspace includes putting greens.
We’ll find out soon whether our sitting Duffer-in-Chief, Gov. DeSantis, will sign this bill into law the way he says he will. It’s an interesting situation, since the bill is a direct rebuke to his deeply unpopular anti-park moves from last summer.

 Fixing Florida
It never ceases to amaze me how often our elected officials will let developers and other profiteers damage a prime piece of our paradise, make a quick buck, and skedaddle.
Then, and only then, do they figure out that something is broken — usually after a hurricane or some other disaster highlights the flaws. As a result, it’s us taxpayers who usually wind up footing the bill.
“Even though the Florida Constitution requires those who cause the pollution to pay the cost of restoration, it’s the taxpayers who pay for the clean-up,” Henderson pointed out.
Thus, let me offer a suggestion that’s no more radical than “headstarting” a batch of frosted flatwoods salamanders.
Whenever a developer comes along with grand plans for wiping out wetlands or paving over some other parcel that will hurt the environment, their first step is frequently to ask for the local government to change the zoning on that property.
In other words, they want to build where they shouldn’t. I say, if they want to play that way, they should pay for the privilege. I think the local government should require them to put up a bond.
You can call it an impact fee, like the fees that make a developer pay in advance for the new roads, schools, libraries, fire stations, and sewer connections.
Or you could call it something that better describes its purpose: The cost of fixing Florida.
My proposal would be to require every developer who gets a zoning change to post a bond of at least $1 million for every 100 homes to be built.
The bond would need to stay valid for at least a decade. If, during that time, we discover that the houses were built in the wrong place, or are causing problems for the neighbors, or have some other flaw, then the bond could cover the cost of fixing the problem.
That way the taxpayers don’t have to bear the burden of repairs. Instead, any money would come out of the pockets of the people who actually caused the problem.
I think we need to hold these rascals to account for the damage they do, because, so far, they’ve proven to be slipperier than a whole herd of frosted salamanders.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said Iowans in the state’s 3rd Congressional District want a representative who will hear their concerns and speak up against President Donald Trump — actions she committed to take if elected representative in 2026.
Konfrst, a Windsor Heights Democrat, announced her campaign for Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District Thursday. The seat, representing most of the Des Moines metro and large parts central and southern Iowa, is currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn.
Speaking with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Konfrst said she decided to run for Congress after having conversations with Iowans in communities like Ottumwa, Red Oak, Atlantic and Jefferson, who told her they felt unheard by Nunn as they expressed frustrations about actions being taken by President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress.
“They want someone who’s going to go out there and stand up for them,” Konfrst said. “Again, when Donald Trump says he’s going to cut 83,000 jobs for veterans, and Congressman Nunn says nothing, that is unacceptable to these folks. … When tariff policy is so confusing that farmers are concerned about what’s going to happen next, they don’t expect their congressmen to just nod along and say, ‘Okay, that sounds great’ — they expect their congressman to stand up and say, ‘Wait a minute, this isn’t okay. What are we going to do for these folks?'”
Democrats have accused Nunn of not holding public town halls in the months since Trump’s election, a criticism Nunn has disputed. Town halls and other public events have become an issue of contention as the House GOP’s campaign arm advised its members to not hold town halls in March. This guidance came as some GOP federal lawmakers face fiery crowds, upset with actions taken by Trump, Congress and Elon Musk’s DOGE at these events. Some of Iowa’s federal delegation, including U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, were met with jeers and heckling about immigration, federal government cuts and the future of programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid at recent town halls.
Konfrst said across Iowa’s 3rd District, she has heard two major asks from Iowans: “People want to be heard and they need a fighter.” She said she has talked to many voters who felt Nunn was not listening to what they are concerned about or advocating for them at the U.S. Capitol.
“A lot of promises happen during the campaign, but at the end of the day, are you listening when bad things happen?” Konfrst said. “And are you fighting for us? Are you coming back to my community and listening? Are you in Wapello County listening, you know, to what voters here have to say — or are you not showing up?”
She said her experience, abilities and “fighting spirit” make her the best choice to meet these voters’ wants in 2026. Konfrst has served as House minority leader since 2021, having first been elected to the Iowa House in the 2018 midterm election. Many of the issues she has focused on in the Iowa Legislature are topics she wants to focus on in Congress, Konfrst said — economic, “kitchen table” issues like the costs of health care and housing.
She also said preserving Social Security and Medicaid funding would be major priorities if elected.
“Right now there are so many unknowns, and I think that’s what’s causing so much concern,” Konfrst said. “Folks are getting laid off, right? Layoffs are increasing in the state. You know, there are threats to Social Security every day. There are threats to Medicaid every day. People deserve to know that when they go to their mailbox, their Social Security checks going to show up. And with all of this uncertainty at every level, that every generation is facing right now, it’s just not a good time to have confidence in the economy. And we need to do better.”
Konfrst is not the only Democrat running for the position — state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, launched her campaign on Monday. Others, including Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, have also expressed interest in joining the race.
While Nunn has not officially announced he will seek reelection in 2026, he is expected to run again. Konfrst said her campaign focus will be on Nunn, not primary competitors.
Nunn first won election in 2022 against former U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, a Democrat, and won reelection in 2024 against Democratic challenger Lanon Baccam. But Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District is rated as a “tossup” by some political forecasters, including Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and has been highlighted as a focus by U.S. House Democrats’ campaign arm heading into the 2026 midterms.
While Republicans earned major victories in recent elections in Iowa, Konfrst said there is “dissatisfaction” among many Iowa voters who elected Republicans to state and federal office.
“Republicans are in charge nationally, and they’re in charge in Iowa,” Konfrst said. “And if things aren’t going well, it’s time to bring some balance back. … It’s not about Democrats and Republicans. It’s about are we having every voice at the table that’s going to work together to actually get something accomplished?”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/konfrst3.18.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-08 07:02:21.321360

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales on Wednesday celebrated the state’s forthcoming student ID voting ban — just two days after he and other Hoosier election officials were named in a lawsuit challenging the prohibition.
Since Indiana enacted its photo ID law in 2005, it has allowed students to use IDs issued by public colleges or universities as proof of identification at the polls. A card must include the prospective voter’s name, photo and a valid expiration term.
That’s changing under Senate Enrolled Act 10. Gov. Mike Braun signed it into law last month, but the ban goes into effect July 1.
Elections bill would strike down student IDs as voting option

A news release from Morales’ office asserted that the law ends the use of “unsecured” cards “that do not meet uniform security standards” — and instead “ensures that all forms of ID used at the polls are held to the same level of verification.”
“Voting is a sacred right, and it must be safeguarded through consistent and reliable security standards,” Morales said Wednesday. The law “reinforces my promise that only eligible Hoosiers are voting in our state,” he continued.
But a lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, called it a “surgical attack on young voters.”
Indiana University sophomore Josh Montagne — who is originally from Missouri — doesn’t have any other form of ID. He said obtaining one would be “burdensome” because his primary form of transportation is walking and he doesn’t have access to a car.
Count US IN and Women4Change Indiana, meanwhile, said the ban would hamper their get-out-the-vote efforts by requiring resource-intensive volunteer re-training and voter education campaigns. They anticipated needing to help students secure alternative forms of ID or provide on-site Election Day assistance so unaware students aren’t disenfranchised.
The trio of plaintiffs alleged that Senate Enrolled Act 10 “deliberately abridges young voters’ right to vote,” in violation of the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The plaintiffs further argued that the “sever(e) burden” on such voters, done “without any corresponding justification,” violates the 1st and 14th Amendments. They requested an injunction.
An estimated two-thirds of students at Indiana University’s flagship Bloomington campus used student IDs to vote at the in-campus polling place in the 2024 general election, according to the complaint. It cited Monroe County’s election supervisor.

The plaintiffs alleged the law’s narrow exclusion of student IDs was unfair.
“Indiana law does not exclude any other category of ID in this way. In fact, in recent years, the legislature has amended the voter ID law to expand the scope of acceptable IDs, even allowing for the use of certain IDs that do not otherwise meet the statutory requirements,” the lawsuit reads.
For example, documents issued by the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Indiana National Guard, a federally recognized Native American tribe or other entities can be used even when they don’t have expiration dates, or have indefinite expiration dates.
Morales and lawmakers justified the ban as ensuring that only Indiana residents and U.S. citizens can vote in the state’s elections.
The plaintiffs, however, noted that Indiana’s photo ID law isn’t structured to confirm a voter’s residence or citizenship — just that the person who shows up at the polls is who they claim. Proof of residency and citizenship are established during the voter registration process and “should not be conflated” with proof of identity requirements, the state’s guidebook reads.
Other accepted federal forms of ID, like a passport or military-issued card, don’t indicate where their subjects reside.
“While prohibiting the use of student IDs will not advance any of the legislators’ purported rationales, it will make it harder for a specific group of people — young voters — to participate in Indiana’s elections,” the complaint argues.
Meanwhile, Morales and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita are waging their own lawsuit to force federal citizenship verification for nearly 600,000 Hoosiers who registered without providing an Indiana driver’s license number or a Social Security Number — or who live overseas. Some of those could include those who registered before those numbers were required.
Morales also applauded the passage of legislation allowing county clerks to send a notice requesting proof of citizenship when someone registers to vote with a temporary credential ID.

They agree about Hailey, the young mother profiled in an outstanding story in The Independent. They agree that the behavior of the Children’s Division in surveilling, harassing, traumatizing and sometimes tearing apart Hailey’s loving family was, in the words of State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, “really horrifying.”
Over and over Hailey’s great-aunt, Jodi Spradley, overcame one obstacle after another to craft a fragile safety net first for Hailey and then for her infant as well.  Over and over the Children’s Division tore that safety net apart. The issue was never abuse, it was poverty – often housing.
As Kelley Fong, professor and author of the landmark study Investigating Families said: “[I]t’s really striking that rather than provide her with what she needs to provide a stable home for mom and baby, the response is just to separate everyone. That is extremely traumatic for the new mom, for the baby, for everyone involved.”
Yes, it’s horrifying. But here’s something more horrifying: A change in leadership at the Children’s Division means it’s likely to get worse.
Can anybody read Hailey’s story and seriously believe that, under the previous director, Darrell Missey, the focus was “just family preservation?” But that seems to be what his successor, Sara Smith, believes.
She’s even handing out stickers that effectively equate child removal with child safety. Of course, she doesn’t use those words. But, the message to the frontlines is clear: I’m handing out stickers that say “centered on safety” because your old boss wasn’t. So if you want to please the new boss, take away more children.
Was it true? Was Hailey’s case just a fluke? Was Missey fanatical about family preservation at the expense of safety?
The data tell a different story.
Year after year, Missouri tears apart families at a rate far above the national average, even when rates of child poverty are factored in. Yes, Missey curbed needless removals a little, but even using the Children’s Division’s own 2024 data, Missouri still takes away children at a rate at least 35% above the national average.
Most cases are nothing like the horror stories. Far more common are cases in which poverty is confused with neglect.
So it’s no wonder multiple studies find that, in typical cases, children left in their own homes typically fare better in later life even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care. Indeed, as The Kansas City Star once reminded us, children may bounce from foster home to foster home, until, as young adults, their stable “home” is a prison cell.
And child removal is no guarantee of child safety. On the contrary, in addition to the enormous inherent emotional trauma, there’s the high rate of abuse in foster care itself.
Study after study finds abuse in one-quarter to one-third of family foster homes; the rate of abuse in group homes and institutions is even worse. So where is Hailey’s infant likely to be safer: in the warm embrace of her mother and her great great aunt or moved from stranger to stranger?
But what about the horror stories about children who really should have been taken away? That’s almost always because caseworkers are too overloaded to investigate any case carefully — because they’re drowning in false allegations, trivial cases and poverty cases.
It takes a whole lot of time and effort to do what the Children’s Division did to Hailey.
Who might have been saved had that time and effort been spent looking more closely at cases where children really were in danger?
The idea that family preservation and child safety are opposites that need to be “balanced” is the Big Lie of American child welfare. On the contrary, for the overwhelming majority of children family preservation is not just the more humane option, it’s the safer option. The take-the-child-and-run approach makes all children less safe.
Missey understood that and tried to change it — with little success. But at least he tried.
Smith shows every sign of wanting to double-down on the approach that’s failed in Missouri and all over the country.
If Missouri lawmakers want to see fewer horrific child abuse deaths and fewer cases of trauma like that inflicted on Hailey and her child, they’re going to need to step in and make clear they won’t tolerate going backwards.
For starters, they might want to send Smith a sticker that says: “You can’t have child safety without family preservation.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8678-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-08 07:02:21.321360

SB 101, sponsored by Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscambia, would require parental consent for medical, dental, and mental health services for minors under 16 and prohibit health care providers and governmental entities from denying parents access to a child’s health record.
“Fourteen-year-olds’ brains are not fully formed. We don’t let 14-year-olds get a tattoo or vote,” Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, who handled the legislation, said. “We want parents engaged in the process.”

The House Health Committee approved the legislation on April 23 with a substitute that allows a child to receive emergency mental health treatment without the parent’s consent. The substitute passed the House 85-0.
The bill provides several exemptions to the age of consent requirement. Minors under 16 who are pregnant or emancipated can make their own medical decisions. Minors under 16 can also consent to services related to sexually transmitted diseases and alcohol or drug misuse. Health care professionals would also be allowed to provide emergency services without parental consent under specific circumstances, including imminent threats to the minor’s health, suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation.
Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, offered an amendment that requires parental consent for individualized counseling. The amendment was adopted 87-0 with 14 abstentions. 
“It also spills over into the area of education, so just for some clarity there on what’s allowed and what’s not allowed,” Shaver said. 
The bill passed 85-0 with 18 abstentions. It goes to the Senate for concurrence or conference committee. The last day of legislative session is May 14.

Bob Ferguson’s desk awaiting his signature. 
Students attending any of the state’s nine independent colleges, such as Gonzaga University, Pacific Lutheran University, Seattle University, and Whitman College, would see state tuition assistance under the Washington College Grant and College Bound Scholarship programs cut to 50% of the average level awarded to students at public universities.
Aid for students in online programs, such as Western Governors University-Washington and certain apprenticeship programs, would also be reduced. And students at for-profit universities and private vocational schools would no longer qualify for the assistance.
Income eligibility guidelines would also change for the college grant program. For the 2024-25 academic year, students from a family of four with an income up to $78,500 would be eligible for the maximum award. That income amount is equal to 65% of the state median income. The latest budget calls for dropping the threshold for a full award to 60% of median income.
These reductions would begin during the 2026-27 academic year, meaning second and first-year students, along with future students, would feel the effects. 
Lawmakers adopted the cuts to student aid as part of the package of spending reductions and tax increases they approved this year to solve a budget shortfall estimated to be around $16 billion over the next four fiscal years. 
The Washington College Grant, which lawmakers approved in 2019, is often celebrated by its supporters as one of the most generous state tuition assistance programs in the nation for low- and middle-income students.
Sen. June Robinson, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said that the financial aid program has helped a lot of people attain higher education, but that the grant is not financially sustainable as it is now. 
“Quite frankly, we just can’t afford it as a state,” Robinson said. 
The cuts would affect students like Diego Gonzalez, a second-year student attending Seattle University, who thought he could rely on financial aid from the state college grant program to help pay for his education. 
“I don’t know about my future, and it really does suck because I’ve made such a good community here at Seattle University,” he said. 
Gonzalez is a first-generation, low-income college student and relies on the aid to attend college. Since the budget has passed, he said he has stayed up late applying for scholarships, worried he will no longer be able to attend college because he can’t afford it.
Growing up in a low-income household, Gonzalez said his family could barely afford buying school supplies. He didn’t think college was obtainable because of the high costs, but receiving the state tuition assistance has allowed him to get one step closer to achieving his dream of going to law school. 
While tuition is higher at private colleges than public universities, they already provide low-income students with a substantial amount of financial aid using their own resources and wouldn’t be able to make up for the cuts to the state grant, according to Terri Standish-Kuon, president and CEO of Independent Colleges of Washington.
“Those financial aid dollars are finite,” Standish-Kuon said. “We will not be able to fill the cuts of this magnitude.” 
The majority of people receiving Washington College Grant funding at the private four-year schools are students of color, women, or first-generation college students, Standish-Kuon added. 
Independent colleges award one in every five bachelor’s and graduate degrees in the state and help give students who may be tied to a specific geographic area or who seek different learning environments, an opportunity to receive higher education, Standish-Kuon noted. 
Students at these colleges also graduate at higher rates than state and national averages. “Steering students away from these schools is materially harmful,” Standish-Kuon said. 
The Independent Colleges of Washington said they are urging Ferguson to veto the section of the budget legislation containing the cuts to the Washington College Grant and the College Bound Scholarship program. 
Gonzalez said he doesn’t know what will happen with his financial aid until Ferguson signs the budget. He also said that if the program is cut, even if it is restored in the future, it will not “reduce the damage or impact on the students.” 
“It’s students who kind of rely on higher education to pull themselves out of poverty, like myself, who might not have the opportunity to do that,” Gonzalez said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/graduates-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-08 07:02:21.321360

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland joined 15 other states in a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to overturn President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking billions in congressionally approved funding for electric vehicle charging stations and other infrastructure.
It was the third suit the state has joined this week, part of an aggressive strategy by Democrat-led states targeting Trump actions.
The states also won a preliminary injunction against Trump initiatives this week in an another suit, when a federal judge in Rhode Island blocked Trump’s order severely curtailing operations at federal agencies that oversee mediation services, minority business development, and museum and library services.
The EV-infrastructure suit, filed in U.S. District Court for Washington state, challenges the U.S. Department of Transportation for illegally withholding about $3 billion in previously approved funding to build electric vehicle infrastructure. The suit says Maryland stands to lose $49 million from the five-year funding program approved under former President Joe Biden (D).
“Charging stations and ports are critical to helping more families transition to cleaner vehicles that reduce pollution and support our environmental goals,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement. “By unlawfully withholding $49 million in approved funding, the Trump Administration is undermining efforts to expand our state’s charging network, reduce emissions, and build a healthier future for generations to come.”
The suit challenges Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, signed on his first day in office, which sought to “eliminate the electric vehicle mandate.”
Maryland, other states, take more legal actions against Trump administration

But Wednesday’s suit says there was never any such mandate, and that by trying to eliminate “this fictional mandate, the Executive Order directs the Federal Highway Administration to usurp the legislative and spending powers reserved to Congress by withholding congressionally appropriated funding for electric vehicle (“EV”) charging infrastructure required by statute to be distributed to States.”
In February, the U.S. Department of Transportation did just that, suspending the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program and directing states to stop spending money on electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The states’ suit says Congress approved a total of $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program when it approved the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021.
“The Maryland Department of Transportation values the U.S. Department of Transportation’s intent to modernize and update NEVI program guidance as soon as possible,Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul J. Wiedefeld said in a statement. “However, the action taken to indefinitely pause the NEVI program is harming current and future EV drivers in Maryland.”
Besides Maryland, the suit includes the District of Columbia and 15 other states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.
Maryland and 20 other states, meanwhile, won a temporary injunction Tuesday in another suit against a Trump order that would have critics said dismantle federal agencies that provide federal money to libraries and museums, promote labor peace and assist minority-owned businesses.
The Rhode Island Current, which is part of the States Newsroom network, reported Tuesday that the preliminary injunction handed down in U.S. District Court for Rhode Island blocks the order affecting the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
Trump on March 14 had ordered those agencies to “reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel.”The order violates the federal Administrative Procedures Act “in the arbitrary and capricious way it was carried out,” wrote District Judge John J.  McConnell.

“It also disregards the fundamental constitutional role of each of the branches of our federal government; specifically, it ignores the unshakable principles that Congress makes the law and appropriates funds, and the Executive implements the law Congress enacted and spends the funds Congress appropriated,” McConnell wrote.
The states’ lawsuit was filed April 4 against Trump, Keith E. Sonderling, the acting director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and other federal agencies and officials.
“This ruling safeguards essential lifelines for aspiring entrepreneurs, workers demanding fair treatment, and Maryland families who rely on their local libraries for internet access and childhood literacy support,” Brown said in a statement. “By defending these vital federal programs, we’ve ensured they continue delivering critical services to the Marylanders who depend on them every day.”
Brown on Monday, Brown joined two lawsuits against the federal government: one to challenge the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for cut staffing and close agencies, and another that ordered federal agencies to pause approvals, permits and loans for all wind energy projects both onshore and offshore.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Earlier this year, Dr. Avtar Roopra, a professor of neuroscience at UW-Madison, published research that shows a drug typically used to treat arthritis halts brain-damaging seizures in mice that have a condition similar to epilepsy. The treatment could be used to provide relief for a subset of people with epilepsy who don’t get relief from other current treatments.
But even as the culmination of a decade-long project was making headlines as a possible breakthrough for the 50 million people worldwide with epilepsy, Roopra’s research was put on hold because the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under President Donald Trump has stopped reviewing grant requests. 
Now, months after his funding was paused, Roopra says he is facing the choice between cutting corners in experiments to save costs or laying off research staff — which comes with its own loss of years of experience and institutional knowledge. 
“Experiments are being trimmed down,” Roopra says. “So the perfect experiment, which is what every experiment must be, we’re now trying to reanalyze and say, ‘Well, can we get by with less?’ If we do, we’re not going to have the perfect answer, and that’s always a danger.”
Roopra’s lab is currently working on an experiment comparing data from healthy mouse brains to diseased brains and, ideally, he’d have ten of each. But to save costs he now has to use three of each. The result is that the conclusions that can be made from the data are less certain, which only creates more expenses in the long term. 
“What that means is we’ll still get some data, but the confidence we have in our conclusions will be drastically reduced,” he says. “And so any experiments we then decide to do based on that will be on more shaky ground, and experiments further on that will be on even shakier ground. And so you have this propagating knock-on effect, but ultimately, the conclusions you get, they’re going to have to be interpreted cautiously, whereas, if we did the perfect experiment for which we were expecting funds, we would have robust data, robust conclusions. We could move forward, forthright into trials.”
Science is expensive, Roopra says, because results have to be replicated many times. Cutting grant funding, as the Trump administration has done, results in austerity measures at labs and universities. Those budget cuts mean experiments aren’t repeated as many times, which means data isn’t as complete and results in less work reaching the end goal — treatments that improve people’s lives. 
Roopra says that when a patient sees a doctor and is prescribed a drug, that is just the tip of an iceberg, underneath which are the thousands of hours of research and millions of dollars spent at pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials and university departments testing theories.
“So it’s actually going to cost everybody more money if we do it this way, because we have to go back,” he says. “And once this moves to clinical trials, which is our goal, if we don’t have the very best, the most solid foundation for doing so, if that trial goes ahead and it fails, it may never be done again. Because trials cost hundreds of millions of dollars, you’ve got to get it right the first time. So that’s what this new normal looks like.”
Roopra’s work is just one research focus in one department on one campus. Wisconsin institutions alone receive about $750 million annually from the NIH. The Medical College of Wisconsin has lost at least $5 million in research grants since Trump took office. 
The cuts affect “every lab, every department, and we’re very biomedical-research centric, but it’s also happening outside of biomedical research,” Dr. Betsy Quinlan, chair of UW-Madison’s neuroscience department, says. “It’s happening in physics and it’s happening in engineering. It’s happening to all research, environmental science.”
Researchers in Wisconsin have had at least $26.8 million in expected grant funding terminated, according to data compiled by Grant Watch, a project to track cuts to grant funding at the NIH and National Science Foundation (NSF). 
“I’ve heard a lot of panic in the community as if the support that the federal government has for science has ended and that science is no longer the priority,” NIH director Jay Bhattacharya said at an event at the Medical College of Wisconsin earlier this month. “One of the reasons I was delighted to be able to come here was to assure people that is not true.”
Nonetheless, among the terminated grants here in Wisconsin are projects to study science misinformation in Black communities, how to engage the public in water stewardship in urban areas such as Milwaukee, the effect of technology on children’s development, the cardiovascular side effects of hormone treatment on transgender men and ways to increase HIV prevention measures among gay men in rural areas. 
“It’s vital that we adopt reforms, real reforms in the research enterprise of this country, so that we depoliticize it, ground it in reality and build a culture of respect for dissent and free speech,” Bhattacharya said.
But discoveries can come from unexpected places, says Quinlan, who warns that the top-down approach to approving research grants that the administration appears to be moving toward will stifle scientific exploration. 
“If the agency says, ‘Here’s a very narrow range of things we will fund,’ it will squash all creativity and real discovery, because real discovery comes when you see something that is unexpected and you follow the unexpected lead,” she says. 
While the cuts to grants are having an immediate impact on research in Wisconsin, there are also concerns about morale among lab staff and a “brain drain” as researchers choose to leave the U.S.  or even abandon science entirely. 
“The biggest problem I think most researchers are facing is the uncertainty and decline in morale that these changes have wrought,” Jo Handelsman, director of the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, says. “These are extremely real and fairly devastating effects on the research community in terms of what’s already happened, almost every week there’s a wave of NIH termination. No one feels their grant is going to continue for sure. That’s a difficult way to do research.”
For decades, scientists have come from all over the world to work in the U.S. Now cuts to grants and the Trump administration’s harsh immigration policies are changing that. Last week, after decisions from a number of judges, the Trump administration walked back an effort to cancel the visas of 27 students at University of Wisconsin schools. Roopra says those fears hurt research. 
“Every minute that that researcher is worried is a minute they’re not thinking about the science,” says Roopra, whose work has also focused on breast cancer. “And so what it looks like is a continuous, chronic fear, which pushes us to think about maybe looking at other options, which we’d rather not do.”

DemasThis story originally appeared in ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Just one year ago, JD Vance was a leading advocate of the Great Lakes and the efforts to restore the largest system of freshwater on the face of the planet.
As a U.S. senator from Ohio, Vance called the lakes “an invaluable asset” for his home state. He supported more funding for a program that delivers “the tools we need to fight invasive species, algal blooms, pollution, and other threats to the ecosystem” so that the Great Lakes would be protected “for generations to come.”
But times have changed.
This spring, Vance is vice president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is imposing deep cuts and new restrictions, upending the very restoration efforts that Vance once championed. With the peak summer season just around the corner, Great Lakes scientists are concerned that they have lost the ability to protect the public from toxic algal blooms, which can kill animals and sicken people.
Cutbacks have gutted the staff at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Severe spending limits have made it difficult to purchase ordinary equipment for processing samples, such as filters and containers. Remaining staff plans to launch large data-collecting buoys into the water this week, but it’s late for a field season that typically runs from April to October.
In addition to a delayed launch, problems with personnel, supplies, vessel support and real-time data sharing have created doubts about the team’s ability to operate the buoys, said Gregory Dick, director of the NOAA cooperative institute at the University of Michigan that partners with the lab. Both the lab and institute operate out of a building in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was custom built as NOAA’s hub in the Great Lakes region, and both provide staff to the algal blooms team.
“This has massive impacts on coastal communities,” Dick said.
Multiple people who have worked with the lab also told ProPublica that there are serious gaps in this year’s monitoring of algal blooms, which are often caused by excess nutrient runoff from farms. Data generated by the lab’s boats and buoys, and publicly shared, could be limited or interrupted, they said.
That data has helped to successfully avoid a repeat of a 2014 crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when nearly half a million people were warned to not drink the water or even touch it.
If the streams of information are cut off, “stakeholders will be very unhappy,” said Bret Collier, a branch chief at the lab who oversaw the federal scientists that run the harmful algal bloom program for the Great Lakes. He was fired in the purge of federal probationary workers in February.
The lab has lost about 35% of its 52-member workforce since February, according to the president of the lab’s union, and it was not allowed to fill several open positions. The White House released preliminary budget recommendations last week that would make significant cuts to NOAA. The budget didn’t provide details, but indicated the termination of “a variety of climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs, which are not aligned with Administration policy” of ending “‘Green New Deal’ initiatives.”
An earlier document obtained by ProPublica and reported widely proposed a 74% funding cut to NOAA’s research office, home of the Great Lakes lab.
Vance’s office didn’t respond to questions from ProPublica about how federal cuts have affected Great Lakes research. The White House also didn’t respond to messages.
Municipal water leaders in Cleveland and Toledo have written public letters of support on behalf of the lab, advocating for the continuation of its work because of how important its tools and resources are for drinking water management.
In a statement to ProPublica, staffers from Toledo’s water system credited the Great Lakes lab and NOAA for alerting it to potential blooms near its intake days ahead of time. This has saved the system significant costs, they said, and helped it avoid feeding excess chemicals into the water.
“The likelihood of another 2014 ‘don’t drink the water’ advisory has been minimized to almost nothing by additional vigilance” from both the lab and local officials, they said.
Remaining staff have had to contend with not only a lack of capacity but also tight limits on spending and travel.
Several people who have worked in or with the lab said that the staff was hampered by strict credit card limits imposed on government employees as part of the effort to reduce spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheaded by presidential adviser Elon Musk.
“The basic scientific supplies that we use to provide the local communities with information on algal bloom toxicity — our purchasing of them is being restricted based on the limitations currently being put in by the administration,” Collier said.
NOAA and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, didn’t respond to messages from ProPublica. Neither did a DOGE official. Eight U.S. senators, including the minority leader, sent a letter in March to a top NOAA leader inquiring about many of the changes, but they never received a response.
The department described its approach to some of its cuts when it eliminated nearly $4 million in funding for the NOAA cooperative institute at Princeton University and emphasized the importance of avoiding wasteful government spending. ProPublica has reported on how the loss of research grants at Princeton and the more significant defunding of the NOAA lab it works with would be a serious setback for weather and climate preparedness.
A number of the staffing losses at the Great Lakes lab came when employees accepted offers of early retirement or voluntary separation; others were fired probationary workers targeted by DOGE across the government. That includes Collier, who had 24 years of professional experience, largely as a research professor, before he was hired last year into a position that, according to the lab’s former director, had been difficult to fill.
A scientist specializing in the toxic algal blooms was also fired. She worked on the team for 14 years through the cooperative institute before accepting a federal position last year, which made her probationary, too.
A computer scientist who got real-time data onto the lab’s website — and the only person who knew how to push out the weekly sampling data on harmful algal blooms — was also fired. She was probationary because she too was hired for a federal position after working with the institute.
And because of a planned retirement, no one holds the permanent position of lab director, though there is an acting director. The lab isn’t allowed to fill any positions due to a federal hiring freeze.
At the same time, expected funds for the lab’s cooperative institute are delayed, which means, Dick said, it may soon lay off staff, including people on the algal blooms team.
In March, Cleveland’s water commissioner wrote a letter calling for continued support for the Great Lakes lab and other NOAA-funded operations in the region, saying that access to real-time forecasts for Lake Erie are “critically important in making water treatment decisions” for more than 1.3 million citizens.
In 2006, there was a major outbreak of hypoxia, an issue worsened by algal blooms where oxygen-depleted water can become corrosive, discolored and full of excess manganese, which is a neurotoxin at high levels. Cleveland Water collaborated with the lab on developing a “groundbreaking” hypoxia forecast model, said Scott Moegling, who worked for both the Cleveland utility and Ohio’s drinking water regulatory agency.
“I knew which plants were going to get hit,” Moegling said. “I knew about when, and I knew what the treatment we would need would be, and we could staff accordingly.”
The American Meteorological Society, in partnership with the National Weather Association, spotlighted this warning system in its statement in support of NOAA research, saying that it helps “keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.”
Collier, the former branch chief, said that quality data may be lacking this year, not just for drinking water suppliers, but also the U.S. Coast Guard, fisheries, shipping companies, recreational businesses and shoreline communities that rely on it to navigate risk. In response to a recent survey of stakeholders, the president of a trade organization serving Great Lakes cargo vessels said that access to NOAA’s real-time data “is critically important to the commercial shipping fleet when making navigation decisions.”
Because federal law requires NOAA to monitor harmful algal blooms, the cuts may run against legal obligations, several current and former workers told ProPublica. The blooms program was “federally mandated to be active every single day, without exception,” Collier said.
The 2024 bloom in Lake Erie was the earliest on record. At its peak, it covered 550 square miles. Warming temperatures worsen the size and frequency of algal blooms. While the field season was historically only about 90 days, Collier said, last year the team was deployed for 211 days.
As the shallowest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is typically first to show signs of problems. But it’s also an emblem of environmental stewardship, thanks to its striking recovery from unchecked industrial pollution. The lake was once popularly declared “dead.” A highly publicized fire inflamed a river that feeds into it. Even Dr. Seuss knocked it in the 1971 version of “The Lorax.” The book described fish leaving a polluted pond “in search of some water that isn’t so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.”
But the rise of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, and labs like the one protecting the Great Lakes, along with legislation that protected water from pollution, led to noticeable changes. By 1986, two Ohio graduate students had succeeded in persuading Theodor Geisel, the author behind Dr. Seuss, to revise future editions of his classic book.
“I should no longer be saying bad things about a body of water that is now, due to great civic and scientific effort, the happy home of smiling fish,” Geisel wrote to them.
Early this year, headlines out of the Midwest suggested that “Vance could be a game-changing Great Lakes advocate” and that he might “save the Great Lakes from Trump.”
A 2023 report to Congress about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular funding mechanism for projects that protect the lakes, including the research lab’s, described the lab’s work on harmful algal blooms as one of its “success stories.” Last year, with Vance as a co-sponsor, an act to extend support for the funding program passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Another bipartisan effort to reauthorize it launched in January.
Project 2025, the plan produced by the Heritage Foundation for Trump’s second term, recommended that the president consider whether NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.”
NOAA is “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” the plan said, and this industry’s mission “seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”
“That is not to say NOAA is useless,” it added, “but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”
When asked at his confirmation hearing in January if he agreed with Project 2025’s recommendation of dismantling NOAA, Howard Lutnick, head of the commerce department, said no.
One month later, the Great Lakes lab’s probationary staff got termination notices. That includes Nicole Rice, who spent a decade with NOAA. A promotion made her communications job vulnerable to the widespread firings of federal probationary workers.
In recent testimony to a Michigan Senate committee, Rice expressed deep concern about the future of the Great Lakes.
“It has taken over a century of bipartisan cooperation, investment and science to bring the Great Lakes back from the brink of ecological collapse,” Rice said. “But these reckless cuts could undo the progress in just a few short years, endangering the largest surface freshwater system in the world.”

(Photo by Gage Skidmore | CC BY-SA 2.0)It’s too bad President Trump’s Vietnam-era bone spurs prevented him from first-hand participation in a military parade.
Generations of soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen will attest that it ain’t all that much fun. I know that from my 30-plus years in Army service as a private in the ranks, an NCO, and an officer – doesn’t matter whether you’re in the back or at the front of the formation. They’d rather have the day off.
Especially if it’s your birthday.
And particularly if the true purpose is an homage to the “base commander.” 
Trump has wanted a pass-in-review of his very own since he witnessed a July 14 Bastille Day parade in 2017 as guest of French President Emmanuel Macron. 
“We’re going to have to try and top it,” he promised.
Now comes together the “perfect storm” of birthday observances:

On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress authorized formation of the nation’s Army. (As a point of information, the National Guard was formed on Dec. 13, 1636, making it 389 years old.)
On June 14, Fred and Mary Anne Trump became parents of their fourth child, Donald, in Queens, New York. Fred was the son of German immigrants and Mary Anne herself immigrated from Scotland. (Interestingly, Donald’s grandfather, Friedrich, emigrated from Germany to escape the military draft.)

Initial planning for observance of the Army’s 250th birthday did not include a parade.  The Army birthday festival, in the planning stages for about two years, was to include an array of activities and displays on the National Mall, including Army Stryker armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.  As recently as April, the White House in a statement said that “no military parade has been scheduled.”
Shortly thereafter, though, creative minds in the White House saw opportunity and determined the Army’s Semiquincentennial, as 250th anniversaries are called, was the perfect cover to link the President’s 80th birthday and “to get this parade that President Trump has been wanting” said a staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Trump’s hopes for a military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2019 during his first term, à la the Bastille Day extravaganza, were deflated by costs estimated near $92 million. 
We now find ourselves in a time when the chief executive is ordering sums slashed – the likes of which we’ve never seen before – from the federal budget and thousands of jobs eliminated without congressional involvement, all in the name of economy.
Cost estimates of Trump’s grandiose 2025 birthday parade are yet to be made public but if the 2019 event was $92 million …. Let’s see, a six-year inflation factor …. 
But then again, we need remember who this guy thinks he is:
“… I run the country and the world,” he recently told The Atlantic magazine.
And now he showed us that he thinks he’s pretty good Pope material.
Columnist Peter D. Fox lives in Big Timber, and reports he was in more military parades than he cares to remember while on active duty and in Army National Guard service. Other veterans may agree that a big part of forming up was the “hurry up and wait” until dignitaries in the reviewing stand arrived and got settled. Fox was a journalist at The Billings Gazette, taught journalism and was the executive director of the Wisconsin Newspaper Association.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/54235304396_22e30448eb_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-08 07:02:21.321360

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner) Wisconsin’s special education reimbursement rate has been a concern for public school advocates for many years, but with districts’ reliance on school referendum requests increasing and federal support in doubt, the state’s reimbursement rate is quickly becoming one of the top issues this budget cycle.
Public school districts currently get about 30% of their special education costs reimbursed by the state. Advocates have called to increase that to at least 60% and as much as 90%, which is the amount that private and charter schools participating in the state’s voucher programs already get.
Tiffany Schanno, a Sheboygan parent, and Melissa Custer, a Grafton parent, have been showing up at state budget hearings and meeting in the Capitol to bring awareness to the experience of families seeking special education services in schools.
“We both have kids with disabilities who are trying to access special education, and we both experienced a lot of obstacles just trying to get our children accessible education, and the thing that we discovered is that it all comes down to funding,” Schanno said in an interview with the Examiner. “There’s only so much as far as resources to go around, so a lot of times families are competing against each other for services.” 
The pair put together a display — titled “Learn in My Shoes” — that included letters from families about their children’s experience receiving services and financial strains on schools. They placed the letters in a pair of children’s shoes. Custer said they thought having a visual representation and sharing stories would give lawmakers a “small taste” of the reality.

One letter described how educators and paraprofessionals have helped 12-year-old James “communicate with peers, become more confident and able to share more of who he is in meaningful ways.” James received important supports thanks to a “persistent” parent who said not all parents understand the process or know how to advocate for what their children need.  
“Because public school budgets are stretched to the point of hundreds of referendums over the past few years, families don’t ask for what they need because they don’t want to be thought of as burdensome,” the parent wrote. “Our family can find workarounds to an extent, but many others cannot. All children deserve an equal opportunity to a sound public education, and funding that keeps up with cost increases.”
Another parent said her son, who has Prader-Willi Syndrome, requires specialized support to navigate school safely and help with emotional regulation, transitions and physical safety. 
“Due to funding shortages, services are stretched thin… ” the parent wrote. “My children — and thousands of others across Wisconsin — deserve a chance to succeed, to feel safe, and to receive the support they need to reach their potential. Please make this a priority.” 
Schanno and Custer delivered the shoes and letters to lawmakers.
Schanno said some lawmakers expressed skepticism that additional state money would actually be used for special education. She said that isn’t a “valid argument” since federally mandated special education costs are carefully tracked.
“It’s not like you’re just giving a district a whole bunch of money and trusting them to use it for the right thing,” she said.
“Ultimately, what I took away from our visits… is that we have a long way to go with people understanding more about disability in general … and about the value in educating people who are different than they are,” Schanno said.
Proposals in discussion
Gov. Tony Evers proposed in his state budget that the reimbursement rate be raised to 60%. Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), have acknowledged education funding as a top concern for  the public, and some, including Rep. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston), have said they want to put more money into  special education, but it is unclear what Republican lawmakers will support. 
As Republican lawmakers seek a deal on tax cuts, WisPolitics reports that spokesperson Britt Cudaback said Evers “expects Republicans to come to the table on investing in education at every level, among other critical priorities, in order to move forward.”
During the last budget cycle, lawmakers increased the special ed reimbursement rate, though Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) notes it was a sum-certain rate, meaning there is a finite amount of money available, so the rate of reimbursement is not guaranteed as funds run low. The current reimbursement rate is hovering around 30%.
“School funding is complex” and special education funding is the “baseline that we absolutely should be doing,” Larson said. Special education funding in Wisconsin peaked at 70% in 1973 and at one point was as low as about 24.5% in 2018-19.
Larson supports increasing the rate to 90%. He said he thinks Evers’ 60% proposal is looking at it “from a political standpoint of what he perceives as what he wants to start the negotiations at in the budget with Republicans instead of what’s needed” and also taking into consideration other budget priorities. 
“That’s helpful and that would be significant and still double the percentage of what schools are currently getting, and I appreciate that…” Larson said. “I would hope that the governor would say 60% or veto.”
Larson also noted Evers’ budget would change special education reimbursement from sum certain to sum sufficient — so reimbursements at the set rate would be guaranteed.
Larson said he hopes his Republican colleagues support boosting the rate. 
“It still baffles me that some people think this is a partisan thing. Schools all over the state need help. The districts that are going to referendum are rural, they’re urban and they’re suburban. There’s nobody who’s special who is dodging this. Everybody is getting screwed over by the state,” Larson said. “I hope that the folks, the Republicans, who hold the narrow majority in the Assembly and in the Senate, would listen to their constituents who are saying, ‘Stop throwing this on us to cover your gap.’”
Special ed reimbursement could relieve referendum pressure
The discussion about school funding, especially for special education, comes as school districts have increasingly come to rely on referendum requests. Public school leaders, advocates and Democratic lawmakers have said increasing the special education reimbursement to at least 60% could help relieve some of that pressure.
Anne Chapman, research director for the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials Association, said that increasing special education funding by a significant amount would allow school districts to not have to pull as much money from their general funds for the mandated services.
“You would see way fewer referendums, and you would see kids surge with better programs,” Chapman said. 
According to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, just this year there were 94 referendum requests across February and April elections with about a third of those representing “retry” efforts. As schools continue to rely on referendum requests to meet costs, Republican and Democratic lawmakers are seeking ways to change the dynamic, though the latter are focused on providing additional state funding, while the former are focused on implementing new restrictions. 
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) said a memo from the Legislative Reference Bureau that compares recent referendum requests to the amount of unreimbursed special education costs illustrates the correlation. He said he asked for the memo after noticing a detail about the finances of the Eau Claire School District. 
“Eau Claire’s unreimbursed special education dollar amount was equivalent to the amount of money that they were asking for in their referendum just to not go too far into the red in their budget,” Phelps said, adding that he wondered “how widespread is this pattern?”
The 128 school districts that sought operating referendums in 2024, a record-breaking year, had over $488 million in unreimbursed special education costs for the 2022-23 school year, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. The bureau’s memo also found that about one-fifth of the referendum requests in 2024 were equal to or exceeded special education costs that were unreimbursed by the state in 2022-23.
Some examples include: 

Bangor School District had a recurring referendum request for $900,000 that failed in 2024. Its unreimbursed special education costs were $973,299 in 2022-23. 
Edgerton School District had a $3,500,000 recurring request that passed. Its unreimbursed special education costs were $3,520,303. 
Eau Claire School District had a successful $18,000,000 request. Its unreimbursed special education costs were $17,933,991. 

In some cases, a referendum request was for more than the unreimbursed costs, but even those were still close. Hamilton School District passed a $7,600,000 recurring referendum in 2024. The total of its unreimbursed special education costs was $6,128,870. 
“Funding special ed fully lifts all boats,” Phelps said. “When we have an underfunded special ed system, we are creating discrimination and disparity against students with disabilities. The services are mandated, so we’re paying for them one way or the other.” He added that right now, property taxpayers are making up for the state’s low reimbursement rate, and school districts are depleting their general funds. 
“Who loses when we’re stretching funds like that? Literally, every kid,” Phelps said, adding that funding special education through referendum isn’t effective because it’s also unpredictable. 
“When referendums happen, they either pass or fail, so now this district is better off than that district for no reason other than the fact that they both had to ask their voters for a referendum, and so we have disparities… when there is literally a pile of billions of dollars sitting around,” Phelps said, referencing the state’s $4 billion budget surplus. 
“It’s a gold mine in state budgeting to find something that you could do that just so clearly lifts all boats,” Phelps added. 
While Phelps said 60% is a compromise, he said the request from Evers is significant.
“It was not that long ago, public ed advocates were literally getting laughed out of rooms when they would ask for 60%,” Phelps said. “Now, the pressure is just too big, and you’re not getting laughed at for asking for 60[%] anymore.”
Derek Gottlieb, an associate professor at the University of Northern Colorado and senior research director for School Perceptions, an education research firm, also said the state could pick up more of the cost of special ed than Evers’ proposed 60%. 
“Even if the state didn’t touch revenue limits, even if the state continued to fail to raise just revenue limits upward to keep pace with inflation, we would see many, many, many fewer operating referendums if the state just paid 100% of special education expenditures…” Gottlieb said. “It is shameful, frankly, that the state has done less.”
Federal upheaval shadows special ed funding debate 
During a virtual public forum in April, Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction leaders said the discussion about federal and state special education funding are connected.
State Superintendent Jill Underly said as reimbursement rates remain low, local communities will continue to take on the cost of the federal- and state-mandated services. 
The special education reimbursement rate “is rather low — it’s 29% now, based on last year’s numbers — but the federal government also has a reimbursement rate, and it’s even lower,” Underly said during the session. “What this would indicate is that our schools are still going to provide the services, because that’s what our schools do. It’s just that they’re not going to be reimbursed fully for them, so the burden is going to shift more to the local school districts to compensate the costs.”
The comments come as the future of the federal government’s role in special education is in flux. The Trump administration has pushed to close the U.S. Department of Education, slashing its workforce and seeking to move “special needs” programs to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
During the forum, Deputy State Superintendent Thomas McCarthy noted that when it comes to federal funding “special education is one of the things that, by and large, everyone has said, we’re not going to reduce the states now.” 
“That is what I know today, ask me next week, it could be on the chopping block,” McCarthy said. Trump’s recent “skinny budget” proposal seeks to cut 15% from the education budget, but says it isn’t cutting funding for special education, though it does propose consolidating several Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grant programs into one. 
As the upheaval creates uncertainty, DPI leaders encouraged Wisconsinites to take the  opportunity to advocate for more funding. 
When the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act became law in 1975, the federal government said it would fund 40% of special education costs, Underly noted. The federal contribution now hovers around 10%.
“When they are arguing that they’re going to make things more efficient at the U.S. Department of Ed or in the federal government… What are they going to do with those savings? This would be a great example. Well, let’s authorize Congress to reimburse up to 40% of special education costs,” Underly said.
“Not only do we need the current level of funding, we need more funding… so be having that conversation with your federal elected officials [and] also be having it with your state elected officials,” Assistant Deputy State Superintendent Sara Knueve said. “We’re in the heat of that conversation about what’s the state’s reimbursement rate and they’re connected.”

“Quite honestly, we don't know what our organization is going to look like,” a U.S. Forest Service staffer said during a recent panel, underscoring continued uncertainty.  
The post DOGE-depleted public land agencies expect to lean more on private partners appeared first on WyoFile .","Even before President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency carved away at land management agencies’ budgets, they struggled to meet mounting demands in Wyoming and elsewhere. That problem will only grow more acute, according to a regional U.S. Forest Service director, underscoring the need for partner organizations.
“Everything we do in the Forest Service, we are reliant on partners, particularly in recreation spaces,” Tyler Ashcroft, the deputy director of recreation for the U.S. Forest Service’s Intermountain Region, told the audience during an Outdoor Recreation Summit panel in Laramie last week. “And so, quite literally, partners have filled a gap that we could not fill ourselves.” 
Partners — such as counties, state government agencies and nonprofit organizations — are already bracing to step up efforts to buttress agencies that have shed thousands of federal jobs and seen other expenses frozen. 
Friends of the Bridger-Teton, a nonprofit that helps the Bridger-Teton National Forest manage growing crowds with everything from donated fire rings to volunteer ambassadors, is hiring a five-person “Forest Corps” this summer for the first time. The team will consist of former USFS employees who will help the agency on trail projects, Executive Director Scott Kosiba told WyoFile.  
“We’ve gotten requests from all six districts on the forest for projects that they need support with,” Kosiba said. 
He is glad his organization can fill growing needs, he said, but emphasized that his Friends group offers support to regional agencies at a level few nonprofits can provide.
“We really grappled with how we could help the forest without playing into this narrative that these services can be done by the private sector or nonprofits,” Kosiba said. “We could never replace these civil servants.”
In a state where nearly half of the land is public and outdoor recreation is on the rise, federal agencies in Wyoming and their partners are expected to be stretched thin this summer as they work to do more with less. Amid a federal downsizing process that’s been defined by uncertainty, it’s still too early to fully understand the impacts on agencies, Ashcroft told the audience gathered for a panel titled “Supporting Public Land Management Agencies through Partnerships.”

“I think everyone in the room recognizes we’re going through a period of change,” Ashcroft said. “Quite honestly, we don’t know what our organization is going to look like.” 
Right now, he noted, federal employees still have an opportunity to accept or reject a deferred resignation program offered. “So when I say we don’t fully have a picture as to what the impacts are, we truly do not at this point in time,” he said. 
With sentiments like this, Ashcroft and his fellow panelists offered a rare glimpse into the angst federal employees are experiencing amid the tumult created by DOGE efforts to slash federal spending. 
Less with more
Doing more with less is not a new theme for the Forest Service, said Ashcroft, who is stationed in Utah but oversees a region that includes Wyoming. The agency oversees more than 9 million acres in Wyoming, making it a major land manager here. 
“Yes, we’re facing new challenges right now as an agency, but capacity has been an issue that we’ve been dealing with for a long time,” Ashcroft said. He used firefighting as an example. 
In 1985, the Forest Service’s fire suppression costs were $111 million, Ashcroft said. In 1994, that amount jumped to $757 million — the first time it exceeded half a million dollars. It topped $1 billion in 2000, went over $2 billion in 2017 and zoomed across the $3 billion mark in 2021. 
“So the costs of fire have taken a greater portion of the agency’s budget, and as we’ve had to build our fire workforce, it’s resulted in cuts to our non-fire workforce,” Ashcroft said. “Simultaneously with that, we’ve seen an elevation in recreation use all across the West, all across national-forest-system lands. So we’re dealing with two challenges: a significant rise in the increase of people that want to use public lands, and then a decrease in the amount of resources that we have to manage those resources.”

The panel was part of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Summit, which gathered businesses, agencies and recreationists in Laramie to talk about issues like access and economic opportunities. Though Ashcroft and his fellow panelists discussed longstanding challenges, participants were keen to hear about recent DOGE impacts on Interior Department agencies like the U.S. Forest Service, Park Service and Bureau of Land Management. 
“Is there going to be a hair-on-fire moment when the bathrooms aren’t getting cleaned and maybe the campgrounds are getting closed?” asked Wyoming Office of Outdoor Recreation Manager Mark Tesoro, who moderated the panel. 
“One forest may have lost their entire special uses program, which impacts guiding and outfitters, where another forest may be whole in that region,” Ashcroft said. “So it truly is varying by district to district, forest to forest, that you’re going to see impacts.” 
Regardless, he said, “the agency’s priority is to keep sites open, and so we are going to prioritize that to the extent possible.” Sites may, however, not be open at the same level of service that users have enjoyed in the past. 
“There could be sites that historically had running water, that may not have running water,” he said. “There could be sites that had trash collection that may not have trash collection this year.”
Trail maintenance will be a big challenge, Ashcroft added, so users could encounter more debris or downed trees.
Agency leadership wants to keep decision-making as local as possible, Ashcroft said, and has identified safety, fire, timber and recreation as priorities. “I see us trying to focus what we have on those priorities, recreation being one of those priorities.” 
Prioritizing recreation  
Deputy Director of Recreation for the U.S. Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Region Chris Ham has attended several events like the outdoor conference in recent months, he told the audience. 
“The first question [I hear] is, ‘How are you doing?’ and the second question is, ‘How can I help?” he said. “Everybody wants to help.”
He stressed patience as the agencies suss out how the changes will ripple down. “We’re gonna definitely need a little more help maybe than we did in the past,” he said. 
Wyoming Pathways, a nonprofit that works with local and federal partners to develop trails from Togwotee Pass near Dubois to Pole Mountain near Laramie, is one of the traditional entities that partners with agencies.

Unlike Friends of the Bridger-Teton, however, Wyoming Pathways relies mainly on federal funds to plan and deploy its recreation projects, Executive Director Mike Kusiek said. So, its work could also be delayed. 
Most of its 2025 projects, which were funded in 2024, are moving forward, Kusiek said. Beyond that, it’s unclear. But hearing from the agencies and Wyoming officials that recreation is a priority was heartening, he said. 
“Overall, we were encouraged,” Kusiek said. “We’ve had a lot of county commissioners, a lot of legislators saying, ‘this is important.’”
Outdoor recreation isn’t going to slow down, he said. Amenities like trails “don’t prepare themselves, they don’t clear themselves, and that will be important for all sides of our economy and our well-being.”
Jennifer Fleuret McConchie, Wyoming BLM deputy state director and the third panelist, doesn’t think the federal challenges will prevent the BLM from getting its work done this season, she told the crowd. 
Wyoming BLM staff, key to Trump’s “energy dominance” strategy, have been largely spared by DOGE. 
“I don’t think any of the challenges coming to face us this year are going to stretch our ability to meet those challenges and work with our partners to get the work done where it needs to be done,” Fleuret McConchie said.

An open letter to Wyoming’s congressional delegation.
The post Wyoming faith leaders: No Medicaid cuts appeared first on WyoFile .","As Wyoming faith leaders, we are deeply concerned by potential cuts to federal funding for Medicaid. The program provides health care coverage to tens of thousands of our low-income Wyoming neighbors who are disabled, children, pregnant, seniors or otherwise unable to access medical services. This program is essential.

Opinion

We call on our congressional delegation representing us in Washington, D.C., to remember the Christian gospel message from Matthew 25:36 as they consider these cuts: “I was sick, and you took care of me.” Jesus identifies care for the sick as an act of faithfulness. Ensuring access to health care is not just policy, but a way of living out Christ’s call to love and serve.
The U.S. House and Senate have both recently passed a budget resolution that could require taking away Medicaid health coverage from millions of Americans, including our Wyoming neighbors. Unfortunately, all three of our delegation’s members — Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and Rep. Hageman — voted for the budget framework. 
Lawmakers must weigh the harm and benefits when making decisions like this and understand their true and real impacts on the lives of God’s children.
Medicaid specifically helps those who need it most: Wyoming has some of the strictest requirements in the nation for enrolling in our Medicaid health insurance program. A person must not only be poor to qualify. They must also have some other condition, such as blindness or a disability, or be pregnant, a child or a senior citizen. There are no “able-bodied adults” receiving Wyoming Medicaid, aside perhaps from the low-income new mothers who can qualify for a single year of coverage after giving birth. This is a program that serves people who truly need assistance and who have no other option for accessing health care.
Still, more than 60,000 Wyoming residents depend on Medicaid for their access to health care. The program covers more than 70% of nursing home stays for our elderly residents, and a third of Wyoming births. It covers care for people with severe disabilities and new mothers who face postpartum health complications and depression. Waiver services, for example, provide essential services, such as group homes and adult caregivers, to adults with severe intellectual and/or physical disabilities who cannot live independently. Withdrawal of community-based services would require nursing home placement, a much more costly option.
Medicaid helps keep our most vulnerable people healthy in Wyoming, but Congress is poised to dramatically cut its funding this month to pay for tax breaks that will primarily benefit the richest people and corporations in America. This would put our neighbors, our communities and even our hospitals in Wyoming at serious risk.
We, faith leaders in Wyoming, call upon our members of Congress — Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman — to vote against current proposals to dramatically cut funding for Medicaid. Doing so would cause serious harm to people in our state, whose only ability to access health care they desperately need comes from the health insurance program.
We’re reminded in 1 Corinthians 12:12 that “For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.” 
Wyoming is one body and our lawmakers must do what they can to keep that body well.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)As a lead screening clinic was being set up inside Milwaukee’s North Division High School Wednesday, a coalition of parents, teachers and locals gathered outside to voice their frustrations about the response to lead contamination in Milwaukee Public School’s (MPS). The group had gathered to “demand that lead contamination in our schools, our city and our state, be urgently and effectively addressed in a manner consistent with health science data,” said Kristen Payne, a member of Lead Safe Schools MKE, during a press conference outside the high school. 
The press conference brought together several groups including Lead Safe Schools MKE, Freshwater for Life Action Coalition, Get the Lead Out and Metcalfe Park Community Bridges. Inside North Division, the  Milwaukee Health Department set up a clinic in the cafeteria and prepared to screen up to 300 children. Concern over lead in MPS buildings has grown since January, after a student was reportedly poisoned. Just under 400 MPS students have been tested and several schools temporarily closed due to lead hazards so far this year.

“Testing our kids for lead poisoning is important, and it’s also not nearly enough,” Payne said. “Until the district, city and state work proactively to address root causes of lead exposure, these testing clinics will do little to prevent exposure of a harmful toxin.” Every year, more than 1,200 children in the city of Milwaukee test positive for lead poisoning, with an average age of 3 years old. With over 70,000 MPS students among the tens of thousands of children in the city, ensuring that enough children are getting tested can be challenging.
Katie Doss is the grandmother of one of those children who tested positive. “She was hospitalized,” said Doss, and  received a blood transfusion. The experience led  Doss to work with the Coalition on Lead Emergency (COLE) and city officials to help get as many children tested as possible. She eventually became a lead program coordinator. “Since then, I’ve got over 400 children tested,” said Doss.
Doss wasn’t alone. “I believe that my grandchildren have the right to go to school without the threat of exposure to lead,” said Maria Beltran, a local resident, grandmother and member of Freshwater for Life Action Coalition. “Lead exposure in children, like my entire family and myself — I have seven kids, seven grandchildren, and married — lead exposure in children can damage the brain and nervous system, cause developmental delays, learning challenges, behavioral issues, [and] hearing loss. Also in adults, lead exposure and lead poisoning can cause high blood pressure, kidney damage, brain damage, miscarriage, and infertility that I have experienced in my entire family as well.”

The group of parents and residents that joined Payne expressed their feeling  that MPS and the Health Department have been more reactive than protective when it comes to addressing lead contamination. Some questioned why only elementary schools, and not middle and high schools, are the focus of current testing and remediation efforts. Others felt that they’d been left in the dark as to how lead poisoning affected their loved ones, or felt that school officials were sending out last-minute warnings to parents about lead hazards. Such notifications often came as emails, sent in the evening hours or  near weekend days, parents at the press conference said. 
The coalition demanded that MPS test all buildings for lead in dust, paint, water and soil. Additionally, the group called on the school district to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for lead-in-water readings <1.0 (parts per billion), and for better lines of communication to be established between school officials and parents. The group further demanded that the MPS Board of Directors pass a recently introduced lead-safety resolution, that city departments implement more proactive measures and that Gov. Tony Evers and the Legislature help remediate lead in schools statewide. 
Melody McCurtis, deputy director and lead organizer of Metcalfe Park Community Bridges, said that city officials are concerned with “growing the city without repairing the past harm that the current residents in this city is facing, especially in terms of lead.” McCurtis added,  “This city is prioritizing policing in our schools, prioritizing more than half of our city budget going to the police, but not going to prevention of crises like the lead crisis. It is going to take more than the Milwaukee Public School, the Health Department, and the city elected officials to come together to not just treat the issue, but to prevent it from happening.”

Inside the high school’s cafeteria, Health Department Commissioner Mike Totoraitis and Deputy Commissioner of Environmental Health Tyler Weber were helping oversee the final preparations for the screening clinic. They said  lead dust and paint are a target and the city’s youngest children are being prioritized for lead testing. “That’s not to minimize that there are other hazards here at the schools and potentially in the homes,” said Totoraitis. 
Although older children and adults will need to be included in testing eventually, it’s unclear how long that might take. The city is still re-grouping after plans to send specialized lead teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to Milwaukee were cancelled by the Trump Administration. The teams would have helped with blood screening analysis to detect trends and gather more information. Totoraitis said that the health department has monitored citywide data for screenings, and has not noticed any new trends. Milwaukee is  also working with partners in other states including Ohio and Michigan. More parents have been taking their children to pediatricians to get tested, which is encouraging, Totoratis said. “That is the best way for parents to know if their child has been poisoned,” he said.
MPS assumes that lead paint exists in any building built before 1978, and the school district has 54 schools built before 1950. Addressing the full scale of the problem will take creativity, dedicated effort and time, health officials say. Weber said that although it’s good that positive tests since January have been relatively low, many more children still need to be evaluated.

“Oftentimes, the children that we see tested aren’t always the children that need to be,” said Tyler, noting that although more than 1,200 children test positive annually, only 40-50% of children are tested who need to be.
Doss told Wisconsin Examiner that it can be difficult to convince parents to get their children tested. “It’s extremely challenging,” said Doss. “There are a lot of parents that’s lost hope and faith in the community as far as getting the children tested. They want to know what’s going to happen on the reaction. If they get their child tested, will they be actually judged if the child comes back with lead and they don’t know where the lead is coming from?” 
Doss said some parents fear that a positive lead test will lead to their homes being visited by authorities, or even that their children could be taken away. “So that’s why it’s very important to let the parents know that it’s nothing that they did. It’s in our environment, it’s in our water, it’s in the paint…The only way that you can help your child is to get your child tested to know if your child has it. And you need to get your child tested once a year. It’s very important.”

The scale of the problem, and a lack of capacity within the health department, creates stubborn obstacles. “And our old housing stock, the red-lining that’s happened over time, the disinvestment in communities, and so it’s a lot for a single department to get to the point where we get ahead of this,” Weber said.  “‘Cause it is devastating to have to see every day the results that come in from different children, and respond to those.” 
Weber added that ideally lead levels in soil, homes, water and human bodies would be zero. “We’re an old city with a lot of deeply rooted challenges, and there’s a lot of work that we have to do collectively.”

(Giles Clasen for Colorado Newsline)Gary Jackson’s most recent spell of homelessness happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. After being released from a more than 12-year prison sentence, his son died. He then lived unsheltered for a couple of years before his heart began to fail, which Jackson says is a direct result of his homelessness. 
These challenges made Jackson a perfect candidate for the federal Emergency Housing Voucher program.
EHVs were created by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to provide housing for the chronically homeless; people fleeing domestic violence, human trafficking or sexual assault; and families facing housing instability. About 70,000 EHVs were distributed to public housing authorities across the nation. 
Jackson’s EHV helped him get a room at the La Quinta hotel at Interstate 25 and Park Avenue in Denver while he received medical treatments for his heart condition. The EHV gave him enough stability to receive a Section 8 voucher that he’s used to rent an apartment of his own for more than a year.
“I got the Holy Grail of housing vouchers, apparently,” Jackson said.

Jackson is one of a handful of EHV holders who have successfully transitioned to more stable housing. However, there are hundreds more EHV holders in Colorado facing the possibility of being sent back to the streets. 
In March, the Colorado Division of Housing received a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development saying that the EHV program is expected to run out of money by the end of 2026, four years earlier than originally expected. 
Part of the reason for the lack of funding for the program is the national spike in rent costs. Median rents across the U.S. stood at $1,781 per month at the end of 2021, according to Realtor.com. Those rents peaked in July 2022 at around $1,850 per month, though they have steadily fallen to $1,694 as of March 2025. 










Should the funding for this program end, many participants will go back to the dangerous living situations they were in.


– Shannon Gray, spokesperson for the Colorado Division of Housing


At the same time, the Trump administration has made it clear that it does not intend to continue funding the program.
“While these EHV funds are being obligated to your PHA, you should manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming,” the letter DOH received says. 
Colorado received 996 EHVs, which it then distributed to 12 public housing agencies across the state. Those public housing agencies were primarily located in Front Range counties like Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, and Adams. Cities like Fort Collins, Aurora, Colorado Springs and Littleton also received vouchers. Altogether, nearly 1,200 households benefitted from EHVs, according to federal data. There are 892 EHV units still leased, DOH spokesperson Shannon Gray told Colorado Newsline in an email. 
“We are concerned about the implications of non-renewal of the funding for all (EHV) participants in Colorado,” Gray said. “Should the funding for this program end, many participants will go back to the dangerous living situations they were in.”

No other options
For public housing officials, the anticipated end of the EHV program has become a significant cause for concern. Peter LiFari, CEO of Maiker Housing Partners in Adams County, told Colorado Newsline that there is a “mad frenzy” of communication and collaboration among public housing authorities in Colorado to figure out contingency plans for the remaining EHV holders. 
Those contingency plans are complicated as Colorado leaders have already had to navigate a $1.2 billion state budget shortfall, and federal support remains uncertain. Meanwhile, advocates at the National Low Income Housing Coalition expect the Trump administration to significantly overhaul the Housing Choice Voucher program and reduce the number of available vouchers by around 200,000 in the fiscal year 2026 budget. Housing Choice Vouchers, also known as Section 8 vouchers, are the most common voucher available to people experiencing homelessness.
One change LiFari expects the Trump administration to push for is adding work requirements to the HCV program. HUD Secretary Scott Turner said after his confirmation that the agency should work to “increase self-sufficiency and empower Americans to climb the economic ladder toward a brighter future.” A 2022 federal review of work requirement policies found that they can increase part-time employment, but the impact of the policies to “reach a level that enables self-sufficiency remains unclear.” 
“This is an appetizer from the administration to move the Overton window on work,” LiFari said. 
Cathy Alderman, spokesperson for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, told Colorado Newsline that many of the EHV holders don’t have other housing options.
“They can’t just find another affordable place,” Alderman said. “It’s not likely that they have a great deal of resources saved up to move them into a market-rate unit that doesn’t accept vouchers, which is going to ultimately put a lot of people into the cycle of homelessness at a time when homelessness is already on the rise.” 
Over the last year, homelessness in Colorado increased by more than 29% to more than 18,700 people, according to federal data. Subpopulations like families with children saw an even more significant increase in homelessness, rising 134% compared to 2023.
Moving people from an EHV to a more permanent housing voucher is also a complicated process, Alderman added. About 20% of the people who qualify for a housing voucher receive one for various reasons. The number of available vouchers fluctuates every year. There are also waitlists for people to apply for housing vouchers. The program also relies on landlords who accept housing vouchers, which can be inconsistent. 
The Coalition has units it owns that can be used to provide housing for people who lose their EHV, but Alderman said there are not enough housing units to help the nearly 900 people who could be impacted. 
“There’s no affordable housing for people to move into,” Alderman said. “It’s why we have the homeless crisis that we have.”

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)While state lawmakers spent the 2025 session debating who can use which bathroom and read what books, North Dakotans were saying something very different: they want affordable child care, paid family leave, and the freedom to live their lives in peace.
But the Legislature didn’t deliver any of that. In fact, they did the exact opposite — doubling down on divisive political fights that don’t reflect the real needs or values of North Dakotans. 
Gender Justice has been working alongside North Dakotans for several years, listening, learning, and standing with community members directly impacted by harmful laws. We’ve challenged two of the most extreme: one that bans nearly all abortions and threatens doctors with criminal charges, and another that criminalizes medical providers who offer proven, often life-saving health care to transgender youth.
We brought these lawsuits because these laws violate the state constitution, inflict real harm, and set a dangerous precedent — one where the government inserts itself into the most personal aspects of our lives and overrides decisions that belong to families, patients, and medical professionals.
Still, we knew we had to go beyond the courtroom. So last fall, we commissioned a statewide poll to hear directly from North Dakotans — across the political spectrum — about what they want their elected leaders to focus on, and how they view their transgender and nonbinary neighbors, coworkers and loved ones.
What we found was clear: North Dakotans are compassionate, fair-minded people who want real solutions — not fear mongering fueled by multi-million dollar campaigns designed to divide us. 
The vast majority of North Dakotans support policies like making child care more affordable (84%), expanding access to affordable housing (80%), paid family and medical leave (76%), and increasing funding for public schools (76%). But this session, lawmakers did not do enough to meaningfully address those needs. Instead, they pushed more bills targeting trans youth, tried to undermine marriage equality and blocked widely supported initiatives, like free school meals for kids.
When it comes to transgender and nonbinary North Dakotans, our poll confirms what we’ve long known: most people want everyone to be treated with dignity and respect. 
An overwhelming 91% of North Dakotans agree the government should stay out of transgender people’s private business. Eighty-four percent believe everyone should have the same rights and freedoms, regardless of gender expression. Three in four say trans people should be allowed to be who they are, and 71% support parents’ ability to access health care and counseling for their transgender and nonbinary children. 
These are not the views of a fringe minority. These are the beliefs of everyday North Dakotans.
So why is the Legislature so out of step with the people it’s supposed to represent?
Because division is a distraction. When politicians stoke fear about transgender people, they’re not responding to any real crisis — they’re creating one. It’s easier to score political points by fear mongering about bathrooms and book bans than to do the real work of helping families care for sick loved ones, lower the cost of child care, or ensure every kid has a safe, stable place to learn. 
When politicians use LGBTQ+ people — especially trans youth — as political scapegoats, it’s real families who pay the price. We know this because we’re representing them in court. Our clients are parents doing everything they can to support their kids in a state that has made that care a criminal issue. They’ve told us what it’s like to fear for their children’s safety, to carry the weight of stigma, and to feel abandoned by elected leaders who should have their backs.  
But they’ve also shared something else: in towns large and small, from every corner of this state, they’ve experienced support from neighbors, friends, coaches, and teachers. That’s what makes these laws even more painful. Most North Dakotans want to live and let live. It’s politicians creating division, not our communities.  
That’s why we’re here — and why we’re proud to be working alongside the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition and community partners to host The People’s Session on May 16. This community-led event is a space for North Dakotans to come together, share stories, talk about their priorities, and begin shaping a people-centered vision for the state’s future.
It’s an opportunity to refocus the conversation on what really matters: supporting working families, protecting personal freedoms, and building a state where everyone is treated fairly — no matter who they are. We know that future is possible — not because we’re guessing, but because North Dakotans told us what they want.
Now it’s time for the Legislature to listen.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ND-Leg-Day73-139-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-08 07:02:21.321360

(Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)This week, the State Board of Education voted to ban 10 more books from all South Carolina public schools, including my National Book Award-winning young adult novel “Last Night at the Telegraph Club.”
That means South Carolina has now banned 21 books statewide, making it the national leader in state-sanctioned book bans, a dubious distinction.
  “Last Night at the Telegraph Club,” by Malinda Lo, was among 10 books the State Board of Education decided Tuesday, May 6, 2025, must be removed from K-12 school libraries. (Provided by Malinda Lo)
“Last Night at the Telegraph Club” is a historical coming-of-age novel about a 17-year-old Chinese American girl discovering her identity as a lesbian in 1950s San Francisco.
In addition to the National Book Award, it won the Stonewall Book Award, the Asian Pacific American Literature Award, a Printz Honor, a Walter Dean Myers Honor, and dozens more accolades.
And yet South Carolina’s Board of Education has reduced it to a few paragraphs about sex. This is a fundamental misreading of the novel and a gross misunderstanding of the purpose of fiction.
In its decision to ban my novel, the board is following Regulation 43-170, which prohibits any books in schools that include “descriptions or visual depictions of ‘sexual conduct,'” as defined by the state criminal code.
This regulation deliberately sidesteps literary merit and the work as a whole in favor of focusing only on “sexual conduct.”
So, let’s talk about sex. Why is it so bad — so “inappropriate,” in the words of the regulation — for a book to include descriptions of “sexual conduct”?
The main character in “Telegraph Club” is a teen named Lily who is coming to understand her sexual identity during the 1950s, a time in which sexuality was highly repressed.
The scenes in the novel that focus on sexuality are about Lily testing her own freedoms — both emotional and physical. They are about Lily claiming the freedom to be who she is.
Sexuality is a natural part of being human. As a writer, writing about sex and sexuality enables me to engage with questions about what makes us the people we become. It is an essential tool in a writer’s creative toolbox, and it’s one of the best ways we can get up and close and personal with a character and their emotions, desires, and fears.
Reading about sex and sexuality is just about the safest way possible for a young adult to gain insight into what sex means. It is such a complex and important part of life. We cannot become who we are without the freedom to explore our choices in the privacy of our own minds.
That is what reading gives us: the freedom to imagine different possibilities.
I believe it’s that freedom to imagine that is so frightening to those who seek to ban books. Banning books that include descriptions of “sexual conduct” is an attempt to curtail individual freedom in our own bodies and minds.
The 21 books that have been banned in South Carolina all approach sexuality from different perspectives.
Some of them explore sexual freedom and pleasure; others explore more difficult issues such as sexual assault and misogyny. Some, like “Telegraph Club,” are about identity and its connection with sexuality.
None of them are right for every reader, but that doesn’t mean they should be banned from all schools, from kindergarten through high school.
There are plenty of legal arguments for why this regulation is unconstitutional. There are plenty of reasons South Carolina parents should be angry that one parent has been behind most of these book bans.
Why does that one parent get to speak for all of you?
But I’m not a South Carolinian, and I’m not a lawyer. I’m a writer.
I believe these book bans are wrong because they attempt to limit our freedom to imagine different possibilities. We can’t be fully human without that freedom.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-08 06:03:58.268303

U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and U.S. Reps. Russ Fulcher and Mike Simpson will be part of a decision-making process that will play a huge role in the overall life quality of more than 300,000 Idahoans who rely on Medicaid for access to lifesaving health care that helps them be part of a strong Idaho economy that Gov. Brad Little often touts as a “model for the nation.”
There’s a lot of truth to that. Idaho is doing well. 
The success of Idaho can best be seen in the pragmatic nature and deep kindness of our people. Idahoans clearly care about each other. They show up to help family, friends and neighbors deal with whatever may come. 
We clearly saw that in 2018 when voters initiated and then approved a ballot measure to establish Medicaid expansion. The vote extended health care coverage to the many in our state who work hard yet still cannot afford to purchase private insurance. That program – as put in place by voters – surely plays a large role in the success Little trumpets.
As these federal cuts are considered, let’s hope our congressional delegation does what some of our state legislators have so far failed to do: Listen. 
Three-quarters of Americans oppose Medicaid cuts, poll shows

The voices of voters are clear and compelling on these issues. Every time Medicaid has been on the state chopping block – it has happened in most every session since voters approved it, thanks to out-of-state lobbying firms – Idahoans have showed up in significant numbers.
Their voices are undeniable, yet seemingly unheard by many of our state lawmakers or at least drowned out by those from outside our state. The result of the 2025 Idaho Legislature was a version of Medicaid expansion that looks nothing like voters envisioned and approved. 
The alterations made were termed by those who drove them as “compromise.”  But Idahoans know the truth. “Compromise” suggests the deal included something for everybody. There was certainly plenty for the out-of-state policy center staffers who journeyed to our state to repeal the will of Idaho voters with the help of Idaho lawmakers. They will surely be back for what’s left of the program next session.
The program could now be damaged more deeply should Congress decide to enact the federal cuts at the expense of those who can least afford to shoulder that burden. Medicaid is health insurance for low-income children and parents, pregnant women, seniors in nursing homes, veterans and people with disabilities. With families struggling to afford the basics, cutting health care for the most vulnerable among us will only make things worse for people who are already struggling day to day.
The savings will be extracted from the quality of life of the people least able to take those hits and those we should least expect to do so. These folks often make our federal minimum wage of $7.25 hourly and cuts will make that struggle worse. In a state where less than 50% of employers offer health benefits as part of compensation, having to choose between paying for a doctor’s visit or new shoes for a child is a grim reality for many. 
They’ll still get sick. They’ll still need care, and now they’re more likely to let such an illness linger until it becomes much worse. One in 10 Idahoans diagnosed with cancer are on Medicaid and, as nearly 12,000 Idahoans will hear “you have cancer” this year, the number of people who get that terrible news won’t decrease by taking care from people who might already struggle to keep up with recommended screenings and doctor’s visits. This is why so many health-based organizations oppose the state-level legislation and deeply fear the federal cuts. 
These groups have nothing to gain. The state changes and proposed federal cuts are simply bad for people’s health.
There is always room for real reforms and every program needs improvement, but changes should be made in good faith and to better serve the needs of people and will of the voters.
That didn’t happen during this past Idaho Legislative session.
If our federal lawmakers take a moment to hear their voters, they’ll know the discussion going on in D.C. only has one correct conclusion: Protecting Medicaid is crucial for Idaho’s future.

Alex Valdez on the House floor during the last day of the 2025 legislative session on May 7, 2025 at the Colorado Capitol. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The 2025 regular lawmaking term in Colorado wrapped up Wednesday evening after 120 days of policy proposals.
Lawmakers grappled with a year of financial strain — an extraordinarily tight budget situation prevented new programs or many new spending attempts — and an ever-changing federal landscape as President Donald Trump began his second term in office, two themes that colored much of the session.
Democrats controlled both chambers of the Colorado Legislature with a 43-22 majority in the House and a 23-12 majority in the Senate. Those margins, combined with Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, allowed Democrats to pass most of their priority bills, though not all. A bill supported by Polis that would allow churches to build affordable housing on their land could not pass the Senate, and a resolution to direct the Legislature to sue over the constitutionality of the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights did not get a debate.
Here are five of the biggest bills to pass this year.

Training standards for some gun purchases 
Senate Bill 25-3 was introduced as a ban on the sale of semiautomatic firearms that accept detachable magazines, a description that includes a huge portion of guns sold in the state. The idea was to bolster enforcement of the state’s large-capacity magazine law, passed in 2013, by allowing in gun sales only fixed magazines that accept no more than 15 rounds.
But pushback from the governor’s office resulted in a major change in the Senate — the addition of a permit-to-purchase program to access the otherwise-banned firearms. The bill passed the Legislature with entirely Democratic support, and Polis signed it into law on April 10.
Starting in August 2026, anyone who wants to buy most semiautomatic guns with a detachable magazine will need to complete either a four- or 12-hour safety training, depending on whether the person already has a hunting license. Course completion will result in a five-year purchasing ability. Colorado joins a handful of states with similar training requirements.
Supporters see the law as a way to reduce accidents and injury, because people who buy the powerful weapons will have education about how to use them safely. Opponents say it is an additional hurdle in Colorado to exercise Second Amendment rights and worry about a lengthy wait time to get into a necessary safety course.
A coalition of Republican lawmakers and gun rights advocates recently asked the U.S. attorney general to review the constitutionality of the new law. It is also possible opponents will attempt a legal challenge in court.
Union election requirements
Though it was announced last year and became one of the first bills introduced this year, Senate Bill 25-5 didn’t pass until the penultimate day of the session, after months of negotiations between labor and business groups broke down. The bill now heads to a likely veto from Polis.
The bill would repeal a second election that’s required for union formation in Colorado. The first election, governed by federal law, requires a majority vote to form a union. Colorado’s unique second election requires a 75% vote for a union to negotiate union security, the term for compelling all workers to pay into the representation a union provides, regardless of membership.
Bill supporters say the second election creates an opportunity for employers to intimidate workers and represents a barrier to forming strong unions.
Supporters immediately faced a call from Polis to rework the bill around a compromise that both labor and business advocates could agree to. That deal never came to fruition, and an unamended version of the bill passed through the Legislature on party-line votes, with Democrats in favor of the measure.
Protections for transgender people
House Bill 25-1312, dubbed the Kelly Loving Act after a transgender woman killed in the Club Q shooting, adds more legal protections for transgender Coloradans. It would make it discriminatory for a person to intentionally not refer to a transgender person by their chosen name in places of public accommodation.
It would also make it easier for a person to change their gender marker on a driver’s license and other government documents. It would require schools to be more flexible in chosen-name policies and dress code requirements.
Some of the bill’s most controversial original provisions were amended out, including a section that would have made courts consider a parent’s treatment of their child’s transgender identity during custody decisions. Another removed section would have enacted a shield provision against other state’s custody laws. The original bill would have also added legal definitions for “misgendering” and “deadnaming” into the state’s anti-discrimination act.
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
Protections for immigrants
As the Trump administration began ramped-up deportation efforts, Democrats moved to protect the civil rights of Colorado’s immigrants. Senate Bill 25-276 would prohibit public employees, like those in local governments, from sharing data about immigration status with federal immigration enforcement authorities. It would also repeal affidavit requirements for immigrants without legal status seeking in-state tuition and driver’s licenses.
The bill would also limit where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can access within schools, hospitals, libraries and child care facilities without a signed warrant. It would clarify and strengthen existing law that prevents local law enforcement from holding someone in jail on behalf of immigration authorities after their release time.
Republicans opposed the bill and argued that it could jeopardize federal funding to the state. As it passed, the Department of Justice sued Denver and the state over so-called “sanctuary policies,” which the bill is seen as expanding.
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
Vacancy selection process
The start of the legislative session was packed with vacancy committees after three state senators resigned shortly following the 2024 election. That prompted calls for reform on how vacancies are filled in the Legislature, as the current system permits a small number of party insiders to decide on new lawmakers.
The bipartisan House Bill 25-1315 would change the vacancy process by adding elections for the seat in question into an already-planned November election. A vacancy committee would pick a replacement, but that person would need to run in the newly created vacancy election, where voters of the same party and unaffiliated voters could participate.
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)When the news broke on Jan. 31 that a New York physician had been indicted for shipping abortion medications to a woman in Louisiana, it stoked fear across the network of doctors and medical clinics who engage in similar work.
“It’s scary. It’s frustrating,” said Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, a clinic near Boston that mails mifepristone and misoprostol pills to patients in states with abortion bans. But, Foster added, “it’s not entirely surprising.”
Ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion providers like her had been expecting prosecution or another kind of legal challenge from states with abortion bans, she said.
“It was unclear when those tests would come, and would it be against an individual provider or a practice or organization?” she said. “Would it be a criminal indictment, or would it be a civil lawsuit,” or even an attack on licensure? she wondered. “All of that was kind of unknown, and we’re starting to see some of this play out.”
The indictment also sparked worry among abortion providers like Kohar Der Simonian, medical director for Maine Family Planning. The clinic doesn’t mail pills into states with bans, but it does treat patients who travel from those states to Maine for abortion care.
“It just hit home that this is real, like this could happen to anybody, at any time now, which is scary,” Der Simonian said.
Der Simonian and Foster both know the indicted doctor, Margaret Carpenter.
“I feel for her. I very much support her,” Foster said. “I feel very sad for her that she has to go through all of this.”
On Jan. 31, Carpenter became the first U.S. doctor criminally charged for providing abortion pills across state lines — a medical practice that grew after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision on June 24, 2022, which overturned Roe.
Since Dobbs, 12 states have enacted near-total abortion bans, and an additional 10 have outlawed the procedure after a certain point in pregnancy, but before a fetus is viable.
Louisiana officials lament loss of USDA money to help schools, food banks buy from local farmers

Carpenter was indicted alongside a Louisiana mother who allegedly received the mailed package and gave the pills prescribed by Carpenter to her minor daughter.
The teen wanted to keep the pregnancy and called 911 after taking the pills, according to an NPR and KFF Health News interview with Tony Clayton, the Louisiana local district attorney prosecuting the case. When police responded, they learned about the medication, which carried the prescribing doctor’s name, Clayton said.
On Feb. 11, Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry, signed an extradition warrant for Carpenter. He later posted a video arguing she “must face extradition to Louisiana, where she can stand trial and justice will be served.”
New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, countered by releasing her own video, confirming she was refusing to extradite Carpenter. The charges carry a possible five-year prison sentence.
“Louisiana has changed their laws, but that has no bearing on the laws here in the state of New York,” Hochul said.
Eight states — New York, Maine, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington — have passed laws since 2022 to protect doctors who mail abortion pills out of state, and thereby block or “shield” them from extradition in such cases. But this is the first criminal test of these relatively new “shield laws.”
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

The telemedicine practice of consulting with remote patients and prescribing them medication abortion via the mail has grown in recent years — and is now playing a critical role in keeping abortion somewhat accessible in states with strict abortion laws, according to research from the Society of Family Planning, a group that supports abortion access.
Doctors who prescribe abortion pills across state lines describe facing a new reality in which the criminal risk is no longer hypothetical. The doctors say that if they stop, tens of thousands of patients would no longer be able to end early pregnancies safely at home, under the care of a U.S. physician. But the doctors could end up in the crosshairs of a legal clash over the interstate practice of medicine when two states disagree on whether people have a right to end a pregnancy.
Doctors on alert but remain defiant
Maine Family Planning, a network of clinics across 19 locations, offers abortions, birth control, gender-affirming care, and other services. One patient recently drove over 17 hours from South Carolina, a state with a six-week abortion ban, Der Simonian said.
For Der Simonian, that case illustrates how desperate some of the practice’s patients are for abortion access. It’s why she supported Maine’s 2024 shield law, she said.
Maine Family Planning has discussed whether to start mailing abortion medication to patients in states with bans, but it has decided against it for now, according to Kat Mavengere, a clinic spokesperson.
Reflecting on Carpenter’s indictment, Der Simonian said it underscored the stakes for herself — and her clinic — of providing any abortion care to out-of-state patients. Shield laws were written to protect against the possibility that a state with an abortion ban charges and tries to extradite a doctor who performed a legal, in-person procedure on someone who had traveled there from another state, according to a review of shield laws by the Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy at the UCLA School of Law.
“It is a fearful time to do this line of work in the United States right now,” Der Simonian said. “There will be a next case.” And even though Maine’s shield law protects abortion providers, she said, “you just don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Data shows that in states with total or six-week abortion bans, an average of 7,700 people a month were prescribed and took mifepristone and misoprostol to end their pregnancies by out-of-state doctors practicing in states with shield laws. The data, covering the second quarter of 2024, is part of a #WeCount report estimating the volume and types of abortions in the U.S., conducted by the Society of Family Planning.
Among Louisiana residents, nearly 60% of abortions took place via telemedicine in the second half of 2023 (the most recent period for which estimates are available), giving Louisiana the highest rate of telemedicine abortions among states that passed strict bans after Dobbs, according to the #WeCount survey.
Louisiana considers ‘homelessness courts’ as housing advocates stress lack of resources

Organizations like the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, known as the MAP, are responding to the demand for remote care. The MAP was launched after the Dobbs ruling, with the mission of writing prescriptions for patients in other states.
During 2024, the MAP says, it was mailing abortion medications to about 500 patients a month. In the new year, the monthly average has grown to 3,000 prescriptions a month, said Foster, the group’s co-founder.
The majority of the MAP’s patients — 80% — live in Texas or states in the Southeast, a region blanketed with near-total abortion restrictions, Foster said.
But the recent indictment from Louisiana will not change the MAP’s plans, Foster said. The MAP currently has four staff doctors and is hiring one more.
“I think there will be some providers who will step out of the space, and some new providers will step in. But it has not changed our practice,” Foster said. “It has not changed our intention to continue to practice.”
The MAP’s organizational structure was designed to spread potential liability, Foster said.
“The person who orders the pills is different than the person who prescribes the pills, is different from the person who ships the pills, is different from the person who does the payments,” she explained.
In 22 states and Washington, D.C., Democratic leaders helped establish shield laws or similarly protective executive orders, according to the UCLA School of Law review of shield laws.
The review found that in eight states, the shield law applies to in-person and telemedicine abortions. In the other 14 states plus Washington, D.C., the protections do not explicitly extend to abortion via telemedicine.
Most of the shield laws also apply to civil lawsuits against doctors. Over a month before Louisiana indicted Carpenter, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a civil suit against her. A Texas judge ruled against Carpenter on Feb. 13, imposing penalties of more than $100,000.
By definition, state shield laws cannot protect doctors when they leave the state. If they move or even travel elsewhere, they lose the first state’s protection and risk arrest in the destination state, and maybe extradition to a third state.

Physicians doing this type of work accept there are parts of the U.S. where they should no longer go, said Julie F. Kay, a human rights lawyer who helps doctors set up telemedicine practices.
“There’s really a commitment not to visit those banned and restricted states,” said Kay, who worked with Carpenter to help start the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine.
“We didn’t have anybody going to the Super Bowl or Mardi Gras or anything like that,” Kay said of the doctors who practice abortion telemedicine across state lines.
She said she has talked to other interested doctors who decided against doing it “because they have an elderly parent in Florida, or a college student somewhere, or family in the South.” Any visits, even for a relative’s illness or death, would be too risky.
“I don’t use the word ‘hero’ lightly or toss it around, but it’s a pretty heroic level of providing care,” Kay said.
Governors clash over doctor’s fate
Carpenter’s case remains unresolved. New York’s rebuff of Louisiana’s extradition request shows the state’s shield law is working as designed, according to David Cohen and Rachel Rebouché, law professors with expertise in abortion laws.
Louisiana officials, for their part, have pushed back in social media posts and media interviews.
“It is not any different than if she had sent fentanyl here. It’s really not,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told Fox 8 News in New Orleans. “She sent drugs that are illegal to send into our state.”
Louisiana’s next step would be challenging New York in federal courts, according to legal experts across the political spectrum.
NPR and KFF Health News asked Clayton, the Louisiana prosecutor who charged Carpenter, whether Louisiana has plans to do that. Clayton declined to answer.
Case highlights fraught new legal frontier
A major problem with the new shield laws is that they challenge the basic fabric of U.S. law, which relies on reciprocity between states, including in criminal cases, said Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow with the Heritage Foundation, which supports a national abortion ban.
“This actually tries to undermine another state’s ability to enforce its own laws, and that’s a very grave challenge to this tradition in our country,” Jipping said. “It’s unclear what legal issues, or potentially constitutional issues, it may raise.”
But other legal scholars disagree with Jipping’s interpretation. The U.S. Constitution requires extradition only for those who commit crimes in one state and then flee to another state, said Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University’s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.
Telemedicine abortion providers aren’t located in states with abortion bans and have not fled from those states — therefore they aren’t required to be extradited back to those states, Cohen said. If Louisiana tries to take its case to federal court, he said, “they’re going to lose because the Constitution is clear on this.”
“The shield laws certainly do undermine the notion of interstate cooperation, and comity, and respect for the policy choices of each state,” Cohen said, “but that has long been a part of American law and history.”
Louisiana senators face wrongful death lawsuit against nursing home they co-own

When states make different policy choices, sometimes they’re willing to give up those policy choices to cooperate with another state, and sometimes they’re not, he said.
The conflicting legal theories will be put to the test if this case goes to federal court, other legal scholars said.
“It probably puts New York and Louisiana in real conflict, potentially a conflict that the Supreme Court is going to have to decide,” said Rebouché, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law.
Rebouché, Cohen, and law professor Greer Donley worked together to draft a proposal for how state shield laws might work. Connecticut passed the first law — though it did not include protections specifically for telemedicine. It was signed by the state’s governor in May 2022, over a month before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, in anticipation of potential future clashes between states over abortion rights.
In some shield-law states, there’s a call to add more protections in response to Carpenter’s indictment.
New York state officials have. On Feb. 3, Hochul signed a law that allows physicians to name their clinic as the prescriber — instead of using their own names — on abortion medications they mail out of state. The intent is to make it more difficult to indict individual doctors. Der Simonian is pushing for a similar law in Maine.
Samantha Glass, a family medicine physician in New York, has written such prescriptions in a previous job, and plans to find a clinic where she could offer that again. Once a month, she travels to a clinic in Kansas to perform in-person abortions.
Carpenter’s indictment could cause some doctors to stop sending pills to states with bans, Glass said. But she believes abortion should be as accessible as any other health care.
“Someone has to do it. So why wouldn’t it be me?” Glass said. “I just think access to this care is such a lifesaving thing for so many people that I just couldn’t turn my back on it.”

(Photo courtesy of National Park Service)Arkansas lawmakers passed a handful of bills during the 2025 legislative session to address environmental concerns, such as the application of industrial biosolids to farmland and a moratorium on medium and large swine farms in the Buffalo River watershed.
Rep. Brad Hall, R-Van Buren, rallied legislators to pass Act 1009 overwhelmingly in both chambers, after months of complaints by Crawford Country residents of noxious odors from a waste lagoon and fields where Denali Water Solutions, a waste disposal company, stores and applies waste from chicken processing plants to farmland as fertilizer.
The bill requires the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality to levy the maximum penalty allowed under state law when those permitted to apply industrial biosolids either over-apply or apply industrial biosolids near a rain event.
It also authorizes DEQ to write rules specifically “to authorize no-discharge land application permits of industrial waste.” 
Hall said he made it clear to company representatives that the odor from its operations, which he described as smelling “like death,” was unacceptable to him.
“I’m tired of people living like that,” Hall said. “It’s ridiculous. I mean, it’s obscene. They [Denali] don’t have to live like that where they live, so they shouldn’t expect everybody else to live like that.”
Hall’s bill went through numerous substantive amendments. Its final form, he said, was prompted because Denali promised it would shut down the open-air waste lagoon in Crawford County by Jan. 1, 2026.
A Denali spokesperson said they “have not committed” to a specific shutdown timeline.
“The Crawford County storage facility remains a critical storage asset, particularly during periods of inclement weather when land application is restricted,” Denali spokesperson Nancy St. Pierre wrote in an email. “Denali will continue to use the site through the remainder of 2025 as we work to continue developing alternative storage capacity and long-term infrastructure solutions throughout the region.”
St. Pierre said obtaining permits and permit modifications from DEQ were “critical” in order to shut down the lagoon.
Hall said “you better have your popcorn ready” if Denali doesn’t abide by the agreement he said they made and the situation has to be addressed again during the 2027 legislative session.
DEQ fined Denali $19,800 earlier this year after numerous incidents where the company was documented applying waste to farmland within 24 hours of a rain event — defined as when there is a 50% chance or greater of precipitation. 
Such application practices are prohibited in the company’s permits. A letter last year from Denali to state regulators stating its intent to violate its permits to apply during those periods while self-imposing requirements on itself earned a sharp rebuke from the head of DEQ’s Office of Water Quality, Stassie Wassel, who wrote that Denali had “a duty to comply” with the requirements “explicitly set forth” in its permits.
“DEQ does not recognize the legitimacy of ‘self-imposed requirements’ and will not rely upon any assertions from the May 8 letter as mitigating factors for future enforcement actions relating to non-compliance on behalf of Denali,” Wassel wrote in a letter dated May 2024. 
  Buffalo River permit moratorium 

Perhaps the most visible piece of environmental legislation that made it into law this year was Senate Bill 290, now Act 921.
SB 290 in its original form would have stripped away a decade-old moratorium that prevented medium and large concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, from obtaining certain water permits necessary to operate within the Buffalo River watershed, while setting new hoops for agencies to jump through if one wanted to institute a watershed-based permit moratorium in the future.
Aided in their cause by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Buffalo River advocates expressed relief that the final form of Act 921 ultimately preserved the moratorium for the Buffalo watershed in its current form.
They also said that it never should have reached the 11th hour the way it had.
“We were pretty crestfallen after the three heads of three state agencies got in there and had their say, and in spite of that, the committee still voted to support SB 290 before it was amended,” said Gordon Watkins, president of the Buffalo River Watershed Alliance. “And then we were, needless to say, we were happy to find out that the governor subsequently stepped in and twisted some arms and amended it to a more acceptable level.”
Even with the protections for the existing moratorium, Watkins said his organization is still opposed to the legislation as a whole. He said he felt “sorry for the rest of the state that’s going to be under these onerous requirements” if other watersheds end up needing a similar moratorium in the future.
Thompson also emphasized that his organization was “extremely grateful” to Sanders for her role in preserving the existing swine farm moratorium.
“It was a tough position for her to take,” Thompson said. “Still though, the fact that the agencies will have to jump through additional hoops down the road is unfortunate, but we did get a big part of what we wanted, so we were pleased. We owe it to the governor.”
  Other environmental laws 


Senate Bill 427 / Act 945 of 2025: Sponsored by Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, and Hall, the act creates the Arkansas Wind Energy Development Act, “to minimize any adverse effect upon the environment” or upon Arkansans’ quality of life as a result of wind turbine construction, operation and decommissioning. It creates a requirement that the construction, operation or redevelopment of a wind turbine be permitted by the Arkansas Public Service Commission and local governments if there are specific local regulations regarding wind turbines.
House Bill 1681 / Act 812 of 2025: Sponsored by Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, and Sen. Joshua Bryant, R-Rogers, the act creates a matching grant program for water and sewage utilities for use in infrastructure and improvement projects. Vaught has been vocal about the deterioration of utility infrastructure, especially in rural areas of the state.
Senate Bill 421 / Act 578 of 2025: Sponsored by Hester and Rep. Howard Beaty, Jr., R-Crossett, the act reauthorizes the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission to borrow money via general obligation bonds “for the development of water, waste disposal, and pollution abatement projects.” The measure will require approval by voters either during the 2026 general election or via a special election called by the governor before bonds can be issued.

Despite public consternation about what critics described as a roundup, Tennessee’s Republican leaders are backing the enforcement action in which dozens of traffic stops were made in south Nashville.
A statement from the Tennessee House Republican Caucus said, “Tennessee will have zero tolerance for those who prove to be a threat to public safety, whether here legally or illegally.”
050625-caucus statement on ICE arrests
“Republicans in the General Assembly in 2024 proudly provided law enforcement agencies at every level across this state with the authority to work with the appropriate federal authorities when they encounter someone who is determined to be in this country illegally.”  
Lawmakers approved creation of a Centralized Immigration Enforcement Bureau during a special session this year at a cost of about $6 million. Six to seven people are to work in the bureau, and grants are to be made to local law enforcement agencies to hire officers and work with the federal government on immigration enforcement.
Davidson County’s legislative delegation and Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell are asking federal officials for more information about the weekend arrests, which followed what some lawmakers have termed a “dragnet” in a South Nashville area that is home to many immigrants. 
According to reports, Tennessee Highway Patrol officers stopped about 150 drivers early Sunday morning for alleged traffic infractions. The highway patrol described the action as a “public safety operation that targeted areas of suspected gang activity with a history of serious traffic crashes” — an allegation disputed by Davidson County lawmakers, who in a letter, accuse the state law enforcement agency of “ethnically and racially profiling” drivers.

Elizabeth Lane Johnson, Gov. Bill Lee’s press secretary said, “Tennessee has a long track record of stepping up to secure our nation’s borders and strengthen public safety. President Trump made it clear that states would play a major role in enforcing immigration laws and removing the most violent offenders, and Americans overwhelmingly elected him to do so.”
Johnson also noted Lee’s establishment of the Centralized Immigration Enforcement Division, headed by immigration czar Ryan Hubbard. Lee named Hubbard, a former U.S. Border Patrol agent, to the post on April 17. 
During a Monday press conference, O’Connell said he had spoken with Lee and “flagged that this seems like a moment of significant tension increase between local and state.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican who sponsored the bill creating the new bureau, said the legislature’s intent was clear: “To support the enforcement of federal immigration law in coordination with our federal partners.” Previously, state and local authorities have shied away from enforcing immigration law.
Johnson said entering or remaining in the country illegally is a violation of federal law, and he added that the enforcement action is “entirely consistent” with the legislature’s plan for “upholding the rule of law and ensuring our state is a strong partner in the enforcement of immigration policy.”

Life, for many Tennesseans, can change in an instant. A medical catastrophe, a car that breaks down, a death, can send families into financial emergency. 
In my case, it came in 2016 when my husband amputated two fingers while using a table saw he’d used hundreds of times. 
I was 45 minutes away at the time of the accident and when I arrived at the hospital, the first thing he asked was, “Do we have insurance?”
We did, thank God. Both of us had started our own businesses and our insurance through the Affordable Care Act had kicked in just days prior, cutting what would have been a $30,000 out-of-pocket expense for the surgery necessary to reattach his fingers to $10,000. 
I consider myself to be fortunate, even privileged. Growing up, I never had to worry about having a place to live or how my family would eat. We were middle class, and throughout my life, I’ve stayed in the middle class. 
But middle class didn’t mean that we had $10,000 lying around. We cobbled together most of it but were left stripped bare of funds to pay household bills and buy groceries. After exhausting every other option — including a trip to the pawn shop — we ended up, as so many other Tennesseans do, taking out a short-term loan from Advance Financial.
This lender said its loans would help Tennesseans. It has sued more than 110,000 of them.

Our story has a happy ending, because we were able to pay back the loan in full, in a mercifully brief period — merciful because even a quick payback comes with a 279.5% interest rate, which Advance couches as a “customary fee.”  Even so, Advance didn’t make the payback process simple: there were only certain ways the company would accept payment and other hoops to jump through.
As the Lookout’s Adam Friedman reports through a partnership with ProPublica, many other Tennesseans find themselves in uncertain or even desperate financial situations, and like I did, turn to Advance Financial to tide them over. 
But at least 110,000 of them — more people than can fit into the University of Tennessee’s Neyland Stadium — had worse outcomes. 
For more than six months, Friedman has been investigating Advance Financial’s business model and talking to people across the state who have been sued by the company. 
Not only does the company charge exorbitantly high interest rates on a product called the Flex Loan, the Nashville-based business aggressively sues people who can’t keep up with payments on the escalating loan amounts.
Among the people Friedman talked to was Tonya Davis, a Nashville woman who was the victim of identity theft. In 2018, Advance told Davis she owed on a loan. When she pointed out the Social Security number on the alleged loan didn’t match hers, a company representative told her they would investigate it. 
She heard nothing else until 2024, when Advance sued her for $4,800. The company won a default judgment, and Davis must pay Advance $175 per month.





Have you taken out a flex loan and struggled to pay it back? Have you been sued by Advance Financial, Harpeth Financial or another flex loan lender?
Reporters at the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica want to hear from you as they investigate flex loan lenders, who have sued more than 110,000 Tennesseans.

In East Tennessee, Rosita Hansen took out a loan in 2021 when her grandchildren moved in. Even with a full-time job, the extra expenses of clothing, food and school activities added up, and soon, she got behind on her mortgage. 
Over 10 months, Hansen borrowed $4,385. She paid Advance $6,660 but the company said she still owed, and sued her. Her total costs, with the original loan, interest and legal fees, came to $8,272 — almost twice the amount she borrowed. Hansen declared bankruptcy, lost her house, and Advance continues to garnish her wages. 
But this isn’t just about Advance Financial. The Tennessee Legislature, which has authority to approve interest rates, in 2015 approved the Flex Loan. The bill creating the new type of loan was carried by House Speaker Cameron Sexton, then a state representative from Crossville. 
Advance sought out lawmakers to create a measure that would skirt regulations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which had already called out Tennessee payday lenders for offering loans to those who couldn’t afford them.
Advance is also one of the biggest donors to Tennessee legislators, spending over $6 million on campaign contributions and lobbying since 2009. 
Our mission at the Tennessee Lookout is to provide accountability journalism and Friedman’s work is a prime example: He shows how business and politics can meet to create laws that damage Tennessee families. For what good is a loan, held out as a means to get by, if it doubles or triples in cost? How does it benefit a desperate borrower in the short term if the long-term consequences follow them for years?
This won’t be Friedman’s last story on payday lenders. You can look for a series continuing over the next few months.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)An increasingly warming climate intensified the deluge of rain that fell on Kentucky and other states in early April, according to a new report from a multinational academic group that studies climate change’s connections to extreme weather events. 
Torrential downpours inundated communities across Kentucky in early April, with some parts of Western Kentucky receiving more than a foot of rain in just four days. Some waterways including the Kentucky River in Frankfort crested at near-record highs as Kentuckians were forced to evacuate low-lying homes and businesses. Dozens of counties declared states of emergency, hundreds of roadways were closed and Gov. Andy Beshear said the storms were responsible for the deaths of seven Kentuckians. 
A report from World Weather Attribution found, based on climate modeling, that the extreme rainfall across Kentucky and seven other states was about 9% more intense because of warming, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, that already has occurred.
Climate change increased the likelihood of the extreme rainfall — which pulled its moisture from a significantly hotter Gulf of Mexico — by about 40% compared to a cooler climate according to the report. The likelihood of such a rainfall event is still relatively rare, the report authors found, at about a 1 in 100-year event. 
Bernadette Woods-Placky, a chief meteorologist at the New Jersey-based nonprofit research organization Climate Central, said in a Wednesday briefing that it’s hard to discern how climate change impacted flooding in specific waterways and communities without studying the hydrology of each area. 
But she said an increase in flooding intensity, even if marginal, can be significant when talking about a “tipping point” of whether a river crests a bank or barrier that’s holding it back. 
“If you hit that tipping point, then it floods over to everything. And so the littlest bit in certain areas can make a huge impact,” Woods-Placky said. “A warmer atmosphere forces more evaporation, so our atmosphere in general has more water to come down whenever there’s a trigger, wherever there’s a trigger. So that’s why we’re seeing, overall, an increase in heavy rain events.”

Friederike Otto, an author of the report and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said while the methods used in the report have been peer reviewed, the study on the April rainfall has not yet been peer reviewed.
Based on modeling, the report predicts that if current climate policies across the globe remain consistent, the climate will warm by approximately 2.6 degrees Celsius by 2100; in that case, extreme rainfall events “are expected to approximately double in likelihood again” and further increase in intensity by another 7%. Earth recorded its hottest year on record in 2024, crossing a warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius that the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 aimed to avoid exceeding.  
Otto, the report author at Imperial College London, said significant increases in the likelihood of such weather events from climate change could also compound the costs of recovery in communities hit repeatedly by flooding. If recovery from an extreme weather event costs billions of dollars, having it happen again could transform “what extreme weather can mean for a community.” 
Those speaking Wednesday also commended the National Weather Service’s preparedness and early warnings of the incoming weather last month across multiple states, saying it was vital in protecting people and property. 
Woods-Placky advocated for the  national agency in light of reporting that multiple NWS offices across the country, including three offices covering almost the entirety of Kentucky, were without a chief meteorologist to lead teams of forecasters and other staff. 
“They did some tremendous work, and they did save lives,” Woods-Placky said.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.

“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.

A bill in Rhode Island would require hotel employees and short-term rental property operators to annually receive human trafficking awareness training. Similarly, a bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
 Funding to help victims recover

Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.

In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
 Underreported to police

Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.

Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

(Courtesy photo)A search is underway for a new secretary for the Maryland Department of Veterans and Military Families to replace Anthony C. “Tony” Woods, who is leaving May 11 to take a job with a private sector technology startup.
Woods was one of Gov. Wes Moore’s earliest Cabinet appointments. Moore, an Army veteran, opened Wednesday’s Board of Public Works meeting by recognizing Woods, whom he said he first heard of when he returned from a tour in Afghanistan and “I kept on hearing this voice who was one of the strongest voices I’ve heard … advocating for me, my brothers and sisters and the people we serve.”
“When I became the governor-elect, and I was thinking about … this position, I was like, I know there’s no way I’m going to get Tony Woods. So let me at least call him to see if he has ideas about people who will take this role,” Moore said. “And I was so over the moon when I realized that the person I was calling, he’s a public servant through and through, and our administration has been better because of you. Our state is better because of you.”
Moore credited Woods with streamlining emergency assistance for veterans and helping rename the department to include families.
Woods’ early days as secretary included handling the failing Charlotte Hall Veteran’s Home, which was the subject of repeated citations for abuse of residents.
Prior to joining the Moore administration, Woods was executive director of the Quad Fellowship, a program he founded for 100 American, Japanese, Australian and Indian students pursuing advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics to study at American universities. The fellowship part of the philanthropic Schmidt Futures — now called Schmidt Sciences — where he was director and head of talent.
Before that, Woods worked at Cisco Systems, The Boston Consulting Group and Capital One. A graduate of West Point, Woods spent more than a decade in the U.S. Army in military intelligence and achieved the rank of major.
In a statement from the governor’s office, Woods called his time as secretary “one of the greatest honors of my professional life,” and thanked the workers at the department for their service.

Among the higher profile measures approved were bills that would allow carrying concealed firearms in private schools, protect parents who do not affirm their child’s trans identity, and provide financial support to farmers. 
The Senate also passed a pair of measures responding to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene, targeting the theft of mobile homes during states of emergency and relaxing requirements for flood repairs. And it approved a bill granting the Catawba Nation many of the same state-level rights afforded to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
These measures head to the House for further consideration. The Senate will return Thursday for a non-voting session as the House finishes its crossover business. Note: NC Newsline will publish a comprehensive rundown of House and Senate crossover week action on Friday.
Private School Security Act
Lawmakers passed a proposal to authorize employees and volunteers at nonpublic K-12 schools to carry concealed firearms on educational property.
Senate Bill 280, titled the “Private School Security Act,” would allow school administrators to give consent to employees and volunteers to possess handguns and stun guns on school grounds, with written notice to parents. The individuals would need to acquire a concealed carry permit and complete additional training. 
The bill would also allow anyone with a permit to concealed carry firearms at religious ceremonies held on the grounds of private schools, including weddings, funerals, and worship services. It’s one of many measures related to gun safety this session, a number of which seek to okay the possession of weapons and other self-defense implements in schools. 
“The Private School Security Act is a voluntary solution to protect North Carolina’s private school students in a world where threats demand actions,” said sponsor Sen. Steve Jarvis (R-Davidson).
The chamber voted to pass a technical amendment to the bill and blocked four amendments proposed by Democratic senators, among them proposals to restrict the bill to veterans and current and former law enforcement officers and a provision that would prevent schools from making concealed carry permits mandatory for employment. 
Senators also rejected an amendment offered by Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) that would have screened employees against a state “Responsible Individuals List” that tracks adults found responsible for abuse and severe neglect, a proposal that had received a positive reception from the bill sponsors in committee.
“There are individuals who, if given the ability to have a gun, would then use that in very inappropriate ways,” said Batch, a child welfare attorney. She cited the case of a girl in middle school who she represented in court who was sexually abused by her teacher. “If he had a gun, how much more dangerous would that have been?”
Sen. Buck Newton (R-Greene, Wayne, Wilson), a lead sponsor of the bill, said the proposal was “just not workable” because schools do not currently have access to the list. Batch responded that her proposed amendment would have granted schools access to the list.
“I think a number of the colleagues at least in my caucus would have supported passing this bill, because we care about the children that are in all of our schools, private or public,” she said.
Parents Protection Act
The Senate enacted a bill preventing parents and guardians who deny their trans child’s gender identity from facing abuse or neglect designations.
Senate Bill 442, dubbed the “Parents Protection Act,” alters statutes concerning child abuse and neglect to specifically exclude conduct described as raising a child “consistent with the juvenile’s biological sex” and prevents adoptive parents from being screened based on whether they would deny their child gender-affirming care.
“It protects parents who care for their children without the threat of losing supervision over that child because the parent refuses to affirm the gender identity of a child who is experiencing gender dysphoria,” said Sen. Amy Galey (R-Alamance), the bill’s lead sponsor. “Second, the bill shields parents who refuse to affirm gender transitioning from prosecution.”
Senators deleted a section of the bill that would have barred state agencies from considering whether prospective foster parents would affirm a trans child’s identity, however, after the proposal proved controversial in committee.
“There were concerns raised about including children in the foster care situation in this bill. We acknowledge that the foster children are some of the most vulnerable people in the state, and we do not want to do anything that might make it difficult to place them,” Galey said. “We may revisit this provision in the future.”
The chamber rejected a pair of proposals by Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) that would have extended the same protections to parents who validate their trans child’s identity and banned gender conversion therapy, respectively. She cited Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s call for abuse investigations into parents who provide their children gender-affirming care as cause grounds for safeguarding their rights in North Carolina.
“The fact of being LGBTQ is just merely a fact, and it’s inherently part of the human experience,” Grafstein said. “Things that become abuse or neglect of their LGBTQ children or foster children, that must not be tolerated.”
Farmers Protection Act
The chamber voted to approve a bill aiming to prevent what its sponsors characterize as discrimination in lending to farmers.
Senate Bill 554 or the “Farmers Protection Act” would bar banks and credit unions from denying loans to agriculture producers based on their lack of a commitment to ESG — environmental, social, and governance factors.
Though sponsors provided no examples of North Carolina farmers who have been impacted by such practices, they argued that some lenders might condition loans based on whether a recipient is taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fertilizer or fossil fuel powered machinery.
The bill faced significant vetting in the Senate Judiciary and Agriculture Committees, according to primary sponsor Sen. Buck Newton.

The 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) removed many barriers that residents and businesses installing solar panels under the state’s net metering law had faced, but it also called for the State Corporation Commission to reevaluate the program, beginning right about now. 
 Not surprisingly, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power are seizing this opportunity to push for changes that would undermine the economic calculus supporting customer-owned solar.  
Since at least 2007, Virginia law has required that customers of Dominion and APCo who have solar panels on their property be credited for surplus electricity they supply to the grid at the same retail rate they pay for electricity. The credit is applied against the cost of the electricity the customer draws from the grid at times when the panels aren’t generating, reducing what they owe on their electric bill. 
But now that they have the chance, both utilities have filed proposals to end net metering. Both essentially propose to charge new solar customers the full retail rate for the electricity they draw from the grid (with Dominion using a more complicated half-hour “netting”), but compensate them for electricity fed to the grid only at the utility’s “avoided cost,” or what it pays to buy electricity from other generators. By law, existing customers and new low-income customers with solar would be unaffected.
Appalachian Power Company requests reduction to pay rate for net-metering solar customers

APCo calculates avoided cost as the wholesale cost of energy and capacity, plus transmission and ancillary services, for a total of less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Thus, a homeowner with solar panels would now pay the full retail rate of about 17 cents/kWh for electricity drawn from the grid, while being credited at less than one-third that amount for electricity put back on the grid. 
Dominion’s approach instead pegs avoided cost to what it pays for solar generation and associated renewable energy certificates (RECs) bought from certain small producers under power purchase agreements, an average of about 9.5 cents/kWh. Dominion’s residential rate currently averages about 14 cents/kWh, but would go up to more than 16 cents if its latest rate increase request is granted.
The VCEA gave APCo the first swing at the piñata. APCo filed its proposal in September, and the SCC will hold an evidentiary hearing on May 20. Dominion only filed its petition last week, and no hearing date has been set yet. 
Not surprisingly, APCo’s proposal generated fierce opposition from advocates and solar installers. They point out that it’s hard enough to make the economics of home solar work with net metering at the retail rate; slashing the compensation for electricity returned to the grid by more than one-third, as Dominion proposes, or two-thirds, as APCo wants, would make solar a losing proposition for most homeowners. Maybe economies of scale and other factors would allow the market for commercial solar to survive under Dominion’s program, though Dominion’s insistence on confiscating customers’ RECs won’t make anyone happy.
If solar owners definitely lose under APCo’s plan, advocates say other ratepayers don’t necessarily win. A homeowner’s surplus generation travels only the short distance to the nearest neighbor, lessening the need for the utility to generate and transmit power to meet the neighbor’s demand. Since the utility charges that neighbor the regular retail rate for the electricity, without having to bring it from somewhere else, the utility saves on transmission costs. On top of that, the surplus solar comes in during the day, when demand is typically higher than at night and electricity is more costly, making solar more valuable to the utility. Plus, it is clean and renewable, and the customer bears all the cost and risk of the investment.
Utilities do not share this rosy view. By their way of thinking, solar customers use the grid as free energy storage and backup power, without paying their fair share of grid costs. Not only does this deprive the utility of revenue, but those grid costs now have to be spread out among the remaining customers. This, they say, creates a cost shift from solar owners to everyone else. 
More than a decade ago, Virginia took tentative steps towards resolving the dispute, with the Department of Environmental Quality setting up a stakeholder group to work towards a “value of solar” analysis. The process was never completed — the utilities walked away from the table when it appeared the results weren’t going to be what they wanted, and the group’s work product did not include numeric values or policy recommendations. 
Virginia is hardly alone in navigating these clashing narratives. 
Other states and regulators have arrived at very different conclusions as to the “correct” value of distributed solar to utilities, ratepayers, and society as a whole. States like Maryland kept net metering after a value of solar analysis concluded the benefits outweighed the costs. On the other hand, California famously ended its net metering program in 2022 when solar comprised almost 20% of electricity generated in the state and created a mid-day surplus without enough storage to absorb it; at the time, 45% of that solar was distributed. That same year, however, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed an unpopular bill that would have phased out net metering in the state.
The experience of other states, combined with an abundance of research and analysis conducted over the years, gives the SCC a lot to work with as it considers the fate of net metering for APCo’s customers this year, and later for Dominion’s.
Will Virginia’s residential solar market survive the coming year?

Countering the arguments of the utility’s hired witnesses, solar industry and environmental organizations have weighed in on the APCo docket with testimony from experts with nationwide experience. The experts pointed out a range of errors and omissions in the utility’s work product. They also presented their own benefit-cost analyses demonstrating a value for distributed solar in excess of the retail price of electricity, using tests often applied to energy efficiency and demand-response programs.
Perhaps even more significantly, SCC staff also filed an analysis that found many of the same problems with APCo’s proposal, including failures to comply with statutory requirements. The staff report did not include a quantitative analysis, but it urged the importance of considering benefits that APCo had ignored. Like the intervenors, staff recommended the commission reject APCo’s plan and retain its net metering program as it is, at least for now.  
Although the staff report would seem likely to carry weight with the commissioners, it’s never easy to predict what the SCC will do in any case before it. But in Virginia, unlike California, distributed solar makes up vanishingly little of total electric generation. Even taking the utilities’ arguments at face value, it seems foolish to upend this small but important market to remedy a perceived harm that is, at least for now, more theoretical than real.

The May 5th event was one of many held in Wisconsin and around the nation to highlight the crises plaguing Native American communities.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Tribal members face violence, both domestic and outside their families, at a higher rate than the general population. Several factors contribute to the MMIWR phenomenon including the fact that missing people belong to a vulnerable population that has suffered historical trauma and is disproportionately affected by poverty and substance abuse; exploitation associated with itinerant workers in mining and oil camps near reservations; and an inconsistent track record of law enforcement committing resources to solve murders or finding missing person.
“On this day, we remember our stolen relatives and honor those who are still missing,” the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition said in a statement. “May 5 also serves as a call to action at the national level, for intervention at both the state and federal levels to the epidemic of our missing & murdered relatives.”
Tribal members, including many holding posters of missing or murdered people, represented family and friends.
Ian Martin is the nephew of Peter Martin, a Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa tribal member  who went missing from the Minnesota reservation in March 2024. Ian noted that May 5 was Peter’s 33rd birthday.
“After this week, we’re going to be starting up our search parties again,” said Ian. “That consists of looking through acres of woods, acres of properties. We have set up meetings with the agencies working this case and tips and leads are still being followed up on, and the investigation is still ongoing.”
Ian said there is no solid theory why his uncle went missing. 
“When a relative disappears from us or is taken from us, it creates a lot of unresolved grief, a lot of incomplete relationships,” he said. “Our family wishes day and night that he comes home.”
He continued, “I don’t have a solution to this MMIR issue in Indian Country, but I do have advice. The best advice is that care of one another. There’s only a handful of us, Indian people on this world. Remember to take care of your well-being.”
The mother of Chantel Moose, 25, a Native American murdered April 12, 2024 in Duluth also spoke. 
“This year has been hard,” said Shauna Moose, speaking in a trembling voice. “Hoping and praying for justice for her.”
Rene Ann Goodrich, a MMIWR advocate who organized the event, noted that the trial is set for the man accused of killing Chantel.
“The family has just completed their first memorial,” said Goodrich. “Now is the time that they’re seeking justice, and they need support from the community…and we want the family to know that we’re here with you. We’re here for the duration.”
Tony Mainville, a tribal member from Northern Minnesota and the uncle of Jeremy Jourdan, 16, who went missing on Halloween 2016, spoke of the family’s pain of missing the young man and their determination not to stop looking for him.
Steve Woodworth, a Leech Lake Tribal Member, filled out information at the event about his sister, Melissa Woodworth, who has been missing since December 2020. Steve said during a RV trip that Melissa’s boyfriend said she walked away in a town in Iowa, a town the boyfriend couldn’t remember, and she has never been heard from again.
Steve said he was the one who had reported his sister missing, and as the only remaining sibling, he had been working with the FBI and the Minnesota, Murdered, Indigenous. Relative (MMIR) Office.

(via Maine Center for Economic Policy)Heeding the advice from the Maine Legislature’s Democratic leadership, the Labor Committee is not endorsing proposals that would make substantial changes to the state’s new paid family and medical leave program. 
While voting on a series of bills related to the new benefit program Wednesday afternoon, the majority of the committee threw its support behind just two of them. Though a proposal intended to safeguard the future of the program’s trust fund drew bipartisan support, Democrats voted down any new exemptions to the program, as well as an effort to make the benefit voluntary. 
“If we pull at the threads now, we are going to unravel some really hard-earned consensus,” said House co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), noting the years-long process that went into developing the program that was made law by the 131st Legislature.
On several bills, some Republicans on the committee put forth a sizable amendment backed by a minority of lawmakers with a list of 10 recommendations to update the program at-large. It includes clarifications to the undue hardship provision, capping the cost of private plan applications and modifying return-to-work requirements, among other provisions. 
While some members, including some Republicans, were hopeful that LD 1712 brought by Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick) could be a compromise to address issues raised with the program, Democrats ultimately voted it down. 
The paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child. 
At the start of the year, Maine employers began withholding a portion of wages to pay into the program’s fund. Employees are expected to be able to access the benefit starting May 2026. 
The committee voted 8-1 in favor of an amended version of LD 1221, which was introduced by Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford). While the legislation originally proposed a constitutional amendment prohibiting the Legislature from using the program funds for any other purpose, the amendment supported by most members instead directed the Department of Labor to determine ways to further protect the money and report back to the committee early next year.
Luke Monahan, director of the paid family and medical leave program for the Department of Labor, told the committee that there is $75 million in the fund as of Wednesday. Additionally, he said more than 900 applications for employers to use private plans have been approved so far.
The committee also backed the legislation brought by Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland), on behalf of the department. LD 894 wants to make a series of amendments to the current law to create certain enforcement mechanisms and penalties, as well as clarify intermittent leave. 
Though Daughtry urged her fellow lawmakers to give the program time to be fully implemented before making substantial reforms, she said the changes in her bill are coming from the people who have been working to implement this program that identified specific refinements to the policy. 
During the public hearing, Daughtry opposed every other bill except her own, but told the committee that if she were to support one, it would be LD 1221.
Some of the bills before the committee were duplicative, including two seeking to repeal the program entirely. While all members voted to reject LD 539 for streamlining purposes, three Republicans on the committee voted in favor of one of the repeal bills, LD 406. 
Multiple bills were unanimously rejected by the committee, including LD 575, which wanted to remove the undue hardship clause and LD 1249, which sought to delay the payment of benefits.
However, the committee voted along partisan lines on proposals to make the program voluntary (LD 1273), exempt agricultural workers from the program (LD 952), certain public school district employees (LD 1400), along with two measures seeking to issue refunds to employers who had approved private plans (LD 1169) and (LD 1307).

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on Monday. It seeks to block the administration’s attempt to dismantle the program without congressional authorization.

“Our action is after receiving notice of the termination of our grant award and coming to the conclusion that it was incredibly important for us as a statewide coalition, as an organization who throughout our history, has kept in mind where the gaps are and how we can step into those gaps to serve communities across North Carolina,” said Samuel Gunter, the housing coalition’s executive director.
The Housing Coalition received termination letters late last month for two AmeriCorps VISTA members it had assigned to local housing counseling agencies across the state. The nonprofit estimates that 351 AmeriCorps members at 13 sites across the state were also terminated. Nationally, just under $400 million in AmeriCorps grants were cancelled, ending the services of more than 32,000 members, it reported.
According to AmeriCorps, last year, more than 3,300 AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers and other participants worked to “meet local needs, strengthen communities, and expand opportunity through national service in North Carolina.” AmeriCorps invested more than $27 million in federal funding into the state, the organization said.
AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers served at more than 700 locations across North Carolina, including schools, food banks, homeless shelters, health clinics, youth centers, veterans’ facilities, and other nonprofit and faith-based organizations, AmeriCorps said.
Gunter, a Peace Corps and VISTA alumnus, said the service programs are transformative for communities and individuals who serve.
“We felt it was important to step up into that gap, not just on AmeriCorps but as we are seeing this trend for a number of federal resources,” Gunter said.
The lawsuit against the Trump administration was brought by community organizations from across the nation, individual youth plaintiffs who participate in AmeriCorps and the AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027.
It alleges that the Trump administration does not have unilateral power to cut or end the AmeriCorps grants and service programs, and that doing so would unlawfully deprive communities of critical services and opportunities provided through AmeriCorps, including education access, housing support, and youth mentorship.
“We are filing this lawsuit today to stand up to this illegal assault on the essential work we do,” Kelly Daly, AmeriCorps Employees Union AFSCME Local 2027 president, said in a news release. “From providing mentors and educational support to students to rebuilding communities after disasters, AmeriCorps participants and other AmeriCorps grantees’ programs form the backbone of public service, and our union members are proud to make that service possible.”
As a result of the Trump administration’s actions, Daly said families will “go without homes. Kids will lose aftercare programming. Seniors will lose companion care, and our communities will suffer.”
Over the last 30 years, the complaint explained, AmeriCorps has served hundreds of communities in all 50 states and U.S. territories.
“It has conserved lands for use by farmers, hunters, and hikers, provided after-school care to help students from all backgrounds succeed in school, and afforded medical care to seniors and others who might otherwise not have had treatment. All of this progress now hangs in the balance as Defendants work to dismantle the Agency,” the lawsuit said.
Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, called the Trump administration’s gutting of AmeriCorps “unlawful and haphazard.”
“In their latest attempt to undermine the public service values that are core to our democracy, the Trump administration has gutted Americorps, which has a proven track record of supporting and improving communities across our nation — more than we can say about the policies of this administration,” Perryman said.
The Housing Coalition also took note of the recent demobilization of AmeriCorps’ National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) — a development that Gov. Josh Stein decried last month, which resulted in the loss of 52 NCCC members assisting with post-Helene cleanup.
On April 23, Stein shared his frustration with the move in a post on X, writing: “Since Hurricane Helene hit, Americorps NCCC teams have been on the ground in western NC delivering resources to victims, repairing homes, and leading volunteer efforts. The federal government is making a mistake taking them off the job. The people of NC need them to complete their mission.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/north-carolina-2025-national-service-report-graphic-original-file-1024x576.webp,,,2025-05-08 05:03:07.976459

Keith Murphy, a Manchester Republican, after a Ways and Means Committee hearing, May 7, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the Legislature crafts the next two-year budget, one question has driven a wedge between House Republicans and Gov. Kelly Ayotte: How much revenue will the state raise in taxes? 
This week, Senate Republicans drew the governor’s criticism, too. 
The parties have dueling projections. In February, Ayotte presented an optimistic portrait, one that assumed state businesses would overcome a recent slump in earnings and rebound over the next two fiscal years. In April, the House took a less rosy approach, estimating far fewer business tax collections and passing a budget that slashed Ayotte’s spending proposals by $643 million. 
Now, as the budget moves to the Senate, the Senate Ways and Means Committee has recommended a middle ground. On Wednesday, the committee endorsed a series of revenue projections that would put estimated revenues somewhere between the governor’s and the House’s assumptions for the next two years.
Ayotte is not satisfied.
“I disagree with that vote,” she said at a press conference Wednesday, reacting to the Senate’s projections. “And I also will tell you this: I don’t understand why Republicans are joining with Democrats who want to put us in a position to raise taxes instead of adopting, I think, what would be a more accurate revenue picture for the state.” 
The Senate committee’s overall revenue estimate for the next budget biennium is about $6.1 billion — $228.1 million higher than the House Ways and Means estimate, but $172.1 million lower than Ayotte’s budget, according to numbers from the Legislative Budget Assistant. Much of that difference is driven by disagreements over business taxes. 
The calculations could allow the Senate Finance Committee to restore some, though not all, of the budget cuts imposed by the House. But as businesses nationwide fret about the effects of President Donald Trump’s evolving tariffs, some state Democrats are questioning whether the Senate’s new projections are themselves too optimistic. 
Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican and the chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged that New Hampshire businesses could be affected by the tariffs and other economic headwinds. But he said he believes those hurdles will merely dampen growth, not stop it, and that businesses will begin a path to recovery by the new year. 
“When you look at what we heard from the industries across the board was that there’s not a recession happening. No one’s lowering their number,” Lang said in an interview Wednesday. He argued that because inflation has dropped, and interest rates are lower, companies and consumers are in decent financial shape. 
Lang also said he is not worried about the tariffs long term. “The general consensus of the committee was that’ll play itself out by the end of this year. So it’ll affect the first half of the first year (of the two year budget), but after that, we’ll see the growth.” 
But Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, is doubtful.
“Consumer confidence is down, GDP shrunk in the first quarter,” Rosenwald said in an interview. “I’m not hearing businesses saying ‘we’re doing a great job.’ April (state) revenues were off, pretty substantially.”
Speaking to reporters in her office at a regularly scheduled press availability, Ayotte did not hide her frustration with the projected numbers. She said the rosier numbers in her budget are still realistic, and urged the Senate to use those.
Ayotte’s revenues were set in February, before Trump imposed an aggressive series of tariffs on China, which in some cases exceed 100%. But Ayotte said she met with Commissioner Lindsey Stepp of the Department of Revenue Administration and economist Brian Gottlob just after the House passed its budget, on April 25, and that they had said her revenue projections were still sound, even with the tariffs.
“They assured me they’re still comfortable with my revenue estimates, and they believe that in the next biennium, we will see a rebound on our business revenue,” she said.
The Senate Ways and Means Committee’s revenue recommendations will now guide the chamber’s budget writing process. The Finance Committee, which heard nine hours of public testimony Tuesday, must make its recommended changes to the budget in time for the chamber to vote for the budget on June 5. 
Members of Ways and Means set predictions for each category of state revenue Wednesday. In most cases, they predicted slightly more revenue than their House counterparts did in March.
Senators set the meals and rooms tax estimate higher than the House’s, with Lang saying representatives of the hospitality industry said they are not seeing a decline in bookings. 
They also quibbled over alcohol sales. Lang argued to the committee that liquor revenues would be higher than the House had predicted, in part due to increasing interest in mocktails. 
“We see the (New Hampshire Liquor Commission) moving more towards providing those things in the store for people that are coming in and buying both alcohol for one part of the family, and the other thing,” he said. 
Sen. Keith Murphy, a Manchester Republican who owns the bar Murphy’s Taproom, disagreed, noting that liquor sales have dipped recently as fewer Americans drink.
“I have seen in the younger generation, it’s just a catastrophic drop off,” Murphy said. “It’s hard to be upset with people for not drinking as much, right? It’s good from a health perspective, but I am very concerned the revenues the state derives from alcohol consumption is going to not recover any time soon.”
The revenue projections could force the Senate Finance Committee to make tough decisions over which programs in Ayotte’s budget they restore, and which they allow to be reduced or cut.
On Wednesday, Ayotte named a number of programs she hopes will stay.
“I can tell you one that’s on the top of my list, which is restoring the 3% cut to providers of Medicaid,” Ayotte said. “… (For) the providers across the board, that’s a very important core issue when we think about serving our most vulnerable population.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5073615-Tim-Lang-1024x779.jpg,,,2025-05-08 05:03:07.976459

(Courtesy of Tillamook County Transportation District)Compared with major American cities, the ridership on public buses in Minot, North Dakota, can seem relatively minuscule.
But the 82,000 rides taken each year allow people without cars to get to work, help those with disabilities get around and connect patients with crucial health care.
“The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system,” said Brian Horinka, the city’s transit superintendent.
Like in many cities — from sprawling metropolitan areas to smaller and rural communities — the financial future of public transit is questionable in Minot, population 48,000. While increasing, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. Federal funding and state budgets remain uncertain, while inflation is pinching transit services.
For example, Horinka said he’s looking to buy a new 30-foot heavy-duty bus. He expects it will cost up to $700,000 because of inflation. Just five years ago, a similar model could be had for about $400,000, he said.
“We’re in dire straits, from a financial standpoint,” he said.
North Dakota’s four largest cities, including Minot, asked lawmakers for millions in extra grant dollars this year to keep transit buses rolling. The state enacted a new law awarding $2 million in grants — a welcome reprieve, but far less than the $15 million initially requested.











The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system.


– Brian Horinka, transit superintendent in Minot, N.D.



Republican state Rep. Dan Ruby, a sponsor of the legislation, said cities will likely need to increase local funding for bus systems.
“I don’t think it’s enough,” he said. “I think it is going to just be somewhat of a stopgap for some of them to be able to function.”
The law also calls for a study to develop a proposed funding formula for fixed-route bus systems. Ruby said he would prefer a permanent funding model that doesn’t require cities to continually rely on legislative grants.
“We also want to make sure that they’re not sitting on funds or running inefficiently just because they have the funding,” he said. “That’s the key to get support from most of the legislators, to show that they really do have a need and there’s no way to find any more cuts in their operations without affecting the people that need the rides.”
It’s indicative of discussions occurring in state capitals across the country as public transit faces existential funding challenges.
Public transit systems in major cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco face the potential of deep service cuts without more funding. But the problems also extend to smaller systems that connect people in rural America and smaller cities.
Partisan debates over transit funding
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the transit financial crisis affects residents in all 67 of the commonwealth’s counties.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said at a news conference in April.
Transit funding has been stuck in a partisan battle in Harrisburg.
States warn of ‘Band-Aids and duct tape’ for road maintenance

In November, to stave off cuts, Shapiro ordered the transfer of more than $150 million in federal highway funds to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, which serves the greater Philadelphia area with bus and regional rail lines. He’s also backed legislation to increase transit funding, which has found support in the Democratic-controlled state House but so far has not advanced in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
Late last month, House Republican Leader Jesse Topper proposed partially privatizing the Philadelphia-area transit agency rather than increasing funding, which he said in a statement would “only serve to patch over the problems of a system chronically in crisis.”
“The same old, same old is clearly not working,” he said, according to a report by public radio station WESA.
The transit agency has said it already operates one of the most efficient systems in the nation. On a special website it created to call attention to its $213 million budget deficit, SEPTA said there’s “nothing left to cut from the budget but service.”
The authority has said it may be forced to cut services by 45% and raise fares by 20% without help from the state.
Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents a portion of North Philadelphia, said that would be “catastrophic” for the region.
“It makes this not only a less appealing place to live for people who are considering moving here,” he said, “but it also makes it difficult to live for folks who call this area home.”
Kenyatta, who dismissed the idea of privatization, said the state has a moral and economic obligation to ensure sustainable funding for public transportation.
“We’ve done patches here and there,” he said. “And that patchwork approach is not one that inspires the type of confidence and allows our transit agencies to do the type of long-term planning that they need to do.”
Transit’s pandemic ‘death spiral’
Mass transit saw some of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 as people worked from home and avoided public spaces.
The federal government provided nearly $70 billion in pandemic aid to transit programs, which saw revenues drop sharply because of reduced fare collections.
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

But with the rise of remote and hybrid work, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels even as costs for labor and equipment skyrocket. A recent Bloomberg News analysis estimates the nation’s largest transit systems are facing a $6 billion shortfall — only heightening fears of a so-called death spiral in which a combination of service cuts and fare increases cause further erosion of riders and revenue.
In Oregon, Democratic lawmakers have proposed increasing the state’s dedicated transit payroll tax. Billed as “a starting point,” the plan would increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.18% — estimated to raise $269 million over each two-year budget cycle.
“That’s appreciated, but it’s nowhere near what it needs to be,” said Brian Vitulli, general manager of the Tillamook County Transportation District in western Oregon. “There could be some service reductions in the near future if we don’t get more funding.”
Aside from rising costs, Vitulli faces major hiring challenges: The district has 19 drivers but could use eight to 10 more. With too few drivers, bus service has been cut to six days a week.
For some riders, the transit services provide a lifeline. After last year’s closure of Tillamook’s only dialysis center, for example, the agency began offering rides to other dialysis clinics well outside its service area.
That has driven up costs and tied up drivers, making services such as the on-demand Dial-A-Ride less available for other residents.
“We’re kind of the only option for these dialysis patients,” he said. “And we’re kind of prioritizing those trips rather than somebody who just wants to go to the Elks Club for lunch or something.”
Vitulli also serves on the board of the Oregon Transit Association, which is lobbying instead for a 0.4% increase in the transit payroll tax phased in over eight years. The association said the current 0.08% proposal could force transit providers across the state to cut services by as much as 25% in the next few years as inflation and decreased fare collections push many into deficits.
Red states create their own DOGE efforts to cut state government

TriMet, which operates rail, bus and paratransit services across 533 square miles of the Portland region, said it would still need to cut services even if the lawmakers’ proposed 0.08% funding increase were approved. The agency faces a deficit of nearly $75 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
Oregon lawmakers are broadly concerned about federal spending cuts, which could turn the state’s modest budget surplus into a gaping deficit, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. Nearly a third of the state’s budget comes from federal money.
Democratic state Rep. Susan McLain said budget uncertainty has heightened scrutiny of all state spending this session. She is one of the authors of the state’s transportation proposal, crafted after nearly two years of meetings across the state. Aside from increasing the transit payroll tax, it calls for boosting the gas tax and hiking vehicle registration costs to help pay for road improvements.
McLain, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Transportation, said budget negotiations are ongoing, with aims of having hearings later this month.
While the state wants to do more to ensure everyone can access medical care, schools and jobs, McLain noted that belt-tightening is imperative for all manner of agencies, including transit.
“We’re really trying to dig in and find ways to do more with less,” she said, “but also to make sure that we’ve got sufficient, adequate types of investment in areas that we value.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-08 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT AmeriCorps programs shut down by Trump administration cuts,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/08/ct-americorps-cuts/,"AmeriCorps members in CT, including 184 working in a preschool program, were informed last month of program closures due to federal cuts.","Until last week, Makayla Field oversaw a team of AmeriCorps members who were working in preschool classrooms in Willimantic. The program, called Jumpstart, was scheduled to wrap up this week when those educators-in-training would say their end of the year goodbyes to students. 
But on the evening of April 30, Field had to reach out to her team with her own goodbye. She informed them that the program had been cut. It was just one of scores of programs on the chopping block as the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dismantles an ever-widening range of programs. 
The Jumpstart team didn’t get to go back to the classroom.
“They told them they were coming back on Thursday and they weren’t,” Field said. “I’m very big on keeping promises to children, so my Corps members were devastated that they made that promise and they didn’t get to see it through.” 
In Connecticut, 184 AmeriCorps members were working on the Jumpstart team. They were part of a national agency that contracts workers and volunteers, a total of 200,000 in 35,000 locations across the country, to serve Americans. Together, they work in communities to help them to recover from natural disaster, work on environmental conservation and education, help seniors stay in their homes, support veterans and more.
On April 25, Connecticut officials learned that the state-administered portions of AmeriCorps had been abruptly cut, along with its programs for senior volunteers and 85% of its federal workforce. On April 29, Attorney General William Tong joined a lawsuit to sue the Trump administration for cutting the program.
“Gutting AmeriCorps is an irrational, cruel and lawless blow to communities across Connecticut and the proud, longstanding tradition of giving back in our country,” Tong said in a press release. “Trump has zero authority to bypass Congress to unilaterally dismantle this important work.”
For many young people, the program is a way to give back to their country, while also learning skills that can prepare them to join the workforce. Some take a gap year between high school and college, others work for AmeriCorps while they are figuring out what to do next. They earn a modest wage ranging from $18,700 to $37,400 over 10 to 12 months, and are eligible to receive an education award that can be used for tuition or to pay back student loans. 
Over time, AmeriCorps has grown to encompass a variety of programs, from the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps for people age 18 and 26, to programs that help seniors volunteer, like Foster Grandparents and RSVP.
During a press conference on Wednesday, state officials highlighted the success of the AmeriCorps programs in Connecticut and the effect of the cuts. In some cases, programs and employees cut by DOGE have been reinstated following court battles.
Gov. Ned Lamont showed support for the AmeriCorps program at the press conference and said he was getting sick of DOGE.
“I thought DOGE was all about waste, fraud and abuse — and sign me up if that’s what it’s about,” Lamont said. “But AmeriCorps has nothing to do with waste, fraud and abuse. AmeriCorps is bringing out the best in folks age 18 to 25, making sure that they have the opportunity to serve in their greater community.”
Lamont said he had wanted to add even more resources to AmeriCorps. In March, Lamont announced that he was awarding more than $38,000 in mini-grants to youth-led initiatives. “I wasn’t doubling down on a lot of things in our budget this last cycle, but I wanted to double down on AmeriCorps,” Lamont said. 
He added that he wanted to give more young people the opportunity to be part of something bigger than themselves, “especially coming out of COVID, especially with some of the stress and mental health issues out there. That’s what we wanted to expand, and that’s what DOGE wants to cut.”
Emma Preuss and Zoe Kendall, members of AmeriCorps who recently learned their work at an educational program in Stonington at the New England Science & Sailing Foundation had been eliminated, talked about how they’d been teaching underserved youth from Bridgeport and New London about marine science. More than half of participants receive financial aid.
“Kids that thought they’d never want to go in the ocean are the kids that, by the end of the day, you can’t get them out of the water,” Preuss said. “They say, ‘I’m gonna be a fisherman now, I’m gonna be a scientist.’ You really see these kids transform in front of your eyes, where the ocean becomes a place that they just saw as part of their city to a place where they can actually interact with and engage with.”
Andrew Oravecz, an alum of AmeriCorps and the program director for a recently cut AmeriCorps program called Health Forward, spoke to the press on Wednesday, repeatedly invoking the pledge that is made by AmeriCorps volunteers. That pledge states, “I will get things done for America – to make our people safer, smarter, and healthier. I will bring Americans together to strengthen our communities. Faced with apathy, I will take action. Faced with conflict, I will seek common ground. Faced with adversity, I will persevere.”
“I’m someone that believes that we have no alternative than to seek common ground, as our oath invokes,” Oravecz said. “The alternative is too catastrophic for any of us to imagine. Now I’m speaking to House and Senate leadership directly: these are my values, informed by an oath that I took in 2016 and have kept since. What do you value? What is your oath? And what are you going to do to uphold it?”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0878-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-08 05:03:07.976459

The victories come as Republican officials at the state and federal level look at cutting library funding.
There were 13 levies on the ballot — eight renewals, two replacements, two new ones and a bond. The least successful of those — for the Delaware County District Library and the Troy-Miami County Public Library — passed with 56% of the vote. 
The most successful, for the Gnadenhutten Public Library, received a whopping 85% of the vote. On average, voters agreed to pay local taxes to support their libraries by a 19-point margin.
“These results reflect the deep connection communities have with their libraries,” Michelle Francis, Executive Director of the Ohio Library Council, said in a written statement. “They’re a testament to the trust voters place in libraries, not only as centers for learning and literacy, but also as hubs for workforce development and digital access.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe results come as the budget proposed by the Republican-controlled Ohio House would spend almost $91 million less on public libraries than the draft proposed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. 
In addition, the House budget would change library funding from a percentage of the state’s general-revenue fund to a fixed line item. The library council has said that would increase the possibility that at some point it could be eliminated altogether.
At the federal level, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has proposed eliminating the Institute of Museum and Library Services. That grant-making agency has a budget of $290 million a year.
Earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily stopped an executive order by President Donald Trump to eliminate the institute after 21 state attorneys general sued to stop the order.
The institute provides funding for the State Library of Ohio, which has a brick-and-mortar location in Columbus. It supports summer learning programs, reading programs for the blind and deaf, and the Ohio Digital Library, which helps local libraries provide audio and e-books.
Polling shows that public libraries are highly popular with a huge, bipartisan swath of Americans. A 2022 poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and North Star Opinion Research on behalf of the American Library Association. It found that 89% of respondents agreed that “local public libraries play an important role in communities across the country including their own.” 
In addition, 75% of Democrats, 70% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they oppose the removal of books from public libraries.
“Public support is loud and clear,” said Francis of the Ohio Library Council. “We hope state leaders recognize how much their constituents rely on library services.”

House Reps. Beth Lear, R-Galena, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Township, recently introduced House Bill 155. This is a companion bill to Ohio Senate Bill 113, which has had two hearings so far in the Senate Education Committee.

Both bills would require every local board of education in the state to adopt a policy that would end any current diversity and inclusion offices or departments and ban any diversity, equity, and inclusion orientation or training. It would also prevent the creation of any new such offices or departments and using DEI in job descriptions. 
Lear and Williams recently gave sponsor testimony on their bill to the Ohio House Education Committee. 
“The increasing incorporation of DEI programs has shifted the focus from educational fundamentals to ideological indoctrination,” Lear said. “These initiatives prioritize identity over ability, promote racial preferences over fairness, and undermine the principle of equal opportunity for all students.”
The pair of Republican lawmakers argued banning DEI would cause less division among students. 
“Through legislation like this, we hope to cultivate an educational environment that promotes unity and harmony among students, focusing on our commonalities rather than differences,” Williams said. “By treating all of our students and staff the same, we can allow our educators to focus on core academic subjects and ensure high-quality outcomes for every student in Ohio.”
Education committee members — on both sides of the aisle — peppered the lawmakers with questions for about 40 minutes. 
“DEI is toxic,” said state Rep. Kevin Ritter, R-Marietta. “The sooner it’s out of our schools, the better. With that in mind, prohibition without consequences is meaningless.”
Lear said they plan on adding enforcement measures to the bill in the coming weeks through an amendment. 
Some of the Democratic lawmakers pointed out how the bill doesn’t define DEI. 
“How is a school supposed to figure out what that means?” state Rep. Phil Robinson, Jr., D-Solon, asked. 
Williams said he wouldn’t give a narrow definition of DEI. 
“The easiest way to answer that is to teach the subjects you are supposed to teach,” Williams said when Robinson pressed him on the question. “You don’t need to infuse DEI into the curriculum.”
State Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, continued to ask for a definition of DEI. 
“If we don’t define what DEI is, how can we expect teachers to not mistakenly break the law?” he asked. 
Williams said it would ultimately be up to the individual school boards to come up with a policy. 
“We’re not trying to make a cookie-cutter system,” he said.
This bill comes as two federal lawsuits by the ACLU and the National Education Association are challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to ban DEI programs in K-12 schools.   
“How do you craft legislation when it’s a little bit unclear right now from the federal government where things stand?” asked state Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio, D-Gahanna. 
Williams, who is a lawyer, said he knows lawsuits can take a while and is “not willing to allow school districts to continue to indoctrinate children for the next four to six years while those lawsuits pend, just because somebody wanted to file a lawsuit.”

It hurts our state’s ability to compete in the 21st century."" (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)After a winter full of guardrail-breaking politics, I arrived at the State House Tuesday on a rainy spring day, ready to protest and testify before the New Hampshire Senate about a budget I believe will shrink our state’s future.
Then came hours of thoughtful, passionate testimony from caregivers, health care workers, state and local officials, nonprofit leaders, and fellow parents. I had to leave before the Finance Committee got to my name on page 14 of the sign-up sheet, but I took solace in how many who came before me said versions of what was on my mind.
Below, though, is the framing I didn’t hear Tuesday that I still can’t shake. As we think about a future that works for everyone in New Hampshire, I hope it reaches a persuadable audience.
The New Hampshire House’s proposed budget does not just hurt programs and the people they serve. It hurts our state’s ability to compete in the 21st century. It doesn’t fund a future. It retreats from it.
We talk a lot in New Hampshire about economic growth and keeping young people here. About attracting workers and building strong communities. But budgets are where rhetoric meets reality. The budget passed by the House — now under review in the Senate — does not make New Hampshire more competitive. It makes it harder to stay, harder to raise a family, and harder to grow. 
Being pro-growth means being anti-poverty. It means investing in the people who make our New Hampshire work — in their housing, their child care, their health care, their education, their job training. But at a time when the U.S. economy just contracted by 0.3% — driven in part by trade imbalances and decreased government investment — this budget pulls back from the very people and services we should be supporting most.
When state leaders offer only cuts, local property taxes jump just to keep the lights on. And with housing, child care, and everyday costs soaring, middle-income families are barely hanging on. Many of our teachers, nurses, and first responders can’t even afford to live where they work.
Across New Hampshire, we’re short over 23,000 housing units. But the House budget eliminates the Housing Appeals Board, making it harder to build, even as 1 in 4 homes on the market now costs over $1 million.
More than 16,000 Granite Staters are out of the workforce because they can’t find child care. But in the proposed budget, there’s no meaningful investment in providers or parents. The budget also eliminates the Family Planning Program. This strips access to affordable reproductive health care, contraception, and cancer screenings, especially for low-income and rural folks.
We’re still 15,000 workers short since the pandemic, but the House budget cuts job training and Medicaid provider rates, pushing caregivers and health care workers further out of reach.
The $50 million cut to the UNH system is particularly shortsighted. Amid these workforce shortages, we’re gutting one of our most vital talent pipelines for tradespeople, nurses, engineers, teachers, social workers, and in-state students who tend to stay and work locally. Many UNH campuses also serve rural and low-income communities already stretched thin.
If we want young people to stay, work, and raise families here, we need to fund the things that make that possible — homes they can afford, schools they trust, child care they can find, and jobs they can build on. Gutting those things tells young people like me that this is not the state we grew up in.
Are we still that state? Where if you work hard, play by the rules, and respect the fact that your neighbor’s path isn’t your own, you can still get ahead?
These cuts don’t tell that story. We’re closing the Office of the Child Advocate as over 1,300 survivors of abuse at the Youth Development Center pursue justice. We’re ending the Commission on Aging as 27% of our population will be 65 or older by 2030. Pulling $10 million from the Renewable Energy Fund while the Seacoast and Upper Valley face repeated flooding. Expanding education freedom accounts — siphoning public dollars into private schools with no accountability as public schools remain underfunded and understaffed. Eliminating the Council on the Arts amid constant assaults on cultural freedom and innovation — in the “Live Free or Die” state.
None of these actions solve problems. They shift burdens, weaken services, and undermine long-term growth.
My wife and I are doing well. We have a safe home, reliable child care, and stable careers that help us pay for it all. But life in 2025 is exorbitantly expensive and a state that relies on high earners like us — while cutting the support that helps others rise — is not building a future. It’s running out the clock, scaring off talent and investment, and pricing out the working people who keep us strong.
There is still time to get this right. The Senate can reject this budget, close loopholes that let out-of-state investors avoid paying their fair share, bolster housing support, reinvest in public education and workforce training, and protect the public services families count on. And citizens across this state can keep demanding a smarter, more honest approach to growth.
Real competition requires real investment. And making good on “Live Free or Die” means funding the freedom to stay and thrive.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/statehouselilacs-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-08 05:03:07.976459

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)President Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency have declared war on the U.S. Department of Education, dismissing it as a “con job” and calling for its dismantling. There’s no doubt that inefficiencies exist in government, but eliminating the department altogether isn’t reform — it’s a reckless gamble with the future of millions of children.
At the heart of this attack is the idea that federal education programs — especially those focused on diversity, equity and inclusion — are unnecessary. But this framing ignores the real issue: federal education funding isn’t about political buzzwords. It’s about ensuring that every child, no matter where they live or how much their parents earn, has a fair shot at a quality education.
For decades, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has helped level the playing field, sending federal dollars to schools in low-income communities that lack local resources. Without this support, children in underfunded districts will be left behind, stuck in overcrowded classrooms with outdated textbooks and too few teachers to give them the attention they deserve.
This issue isn’t about ideology. It’s about fairness.
Other legislation executed by the Department of Education focuses on our most vulnerable children. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, passed in 1975, guarantees that students with disabilities receive the support they need to learn alongside their peers. Federal funding helps schools provide speech therapy, assistive technology and specialized instruction for children who would otherwise be pushed to the margins. Slashing this funding sends a message: that these students don’t matter.
Perhaps the most devastating move is the gutting of the Institute for Education Sciences and its statistical branch, the National Center for Education Statistics — the backbone of education research in this country. These agencies don’t deal in politics; they deal in facts. They provide data on which states have the highest testing scores on our only national test. They fund research on trends in student outcomes, understanding which innovations work with struggling readers and which do not, and how our bilingual students fare after they exit an English learning program.
Without them, education policy will be based on guesswork instead of evidence.
As an example, the elimination of What Works Clearinghouse means that schools will no longer have an unbiased source to evaluate curriculum, textbooks and learning programs. Without WWC, districts will have to rely on flashy marketing brochures rather than independent research. Schools will waste money on ineffective programs, and students will pay the price.
Make no mistake: these cuts will not just hurt bureaucrats in Washington. They will hurt children, families, and teachers in every corner of this country, including those in Kansas. Parents will lose access to vital information about their schools. Teachers will be left without the latest research on how to help struggling students. And students with disabilities will be denied the tools they need to succeed.
Yes, cut the fat. But don’t bring a chainsaw to education. Once these programs are gone, rebuilding them will take decades — while an entire generation of students is left behind.

Getty Images.Ohio Republican leaders say they will follow the wants of local voters who rejected school levies on the May 6 primary ballot.
This comes a month after they proposed a slash of public education’s expected budget by hundreds of millions.
Overall, school levies generally passed across the state. According to a WEWS/OCJ analysis, 70% passed — but most were extremely close calls. Many in Northeast Ohio failed.
But how did we get into the situation where more than 100 levies were on the ballot? That depends on who you ask.
“We are so over-levied because the state does not step up to do its part on many issues, most importantly in the space of public education,” said House Minority Leader Allison Russo.



Russo referenced the school funding debate. In 1997, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the way the schools are funded was unconstitutional, relying too much on property taxes. After decades of work, lawmakers passed the bipartisan Cupp-Patterson Fair School Funding Plan in 2021. The policy was set up with a six-year phase-in that provides support for districts, and four years have already been implemented.
But in this year’s budget, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, decided that the amount of money schools were receiving was “unsustainable,” he said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXTo be fully funded based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need $666 million. The proposed budget only gives them about $226 million.
GOP leaders argue that since they are increasing from the amount of money that the schools got in 2025, this is a good deal — and they are funding education. However, Democrats argue that 2025 is just a singular year, not a two-year budget, and that this is dramatically lower than the FSFP.
Based on 2025 numbers and inflation, the amount of money needed to fund K-12 would be closer to $800 million, new data from public school advocates like former lawmaker and FSFP co-creator John Patterson explained.
Huffman was asked if the state had a responsibility to help out schools that say they have to lay off teachers.
“I think we have a responsibility to fund public schools … But if a levy doesn’t pass because the local voters, the constituents, don’t want it to pass — that’s up for the local jurisdiction to make a decision,” he responded.
He added that the state shouldn’t be held responsible if taxpayers vote no on the levies, especially because residents are already struggling with property taxes.
“The votes of the people who are in the district should mean something,” the speaker continued. “And if the answer is, ‘Well, they voted no, so the state should send more of everybody else’s money to that district,’ — I don’t think that’s the way it should work.”


Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) didn’t address the state’s involvement, but does say he understands why some schools failed.
“I would imagine the taxpayers in those districts are frustrated because their tax bills just went up relatively recently and they should, rightfully, be asking how much of that increase in their tax bills is already going to the school districts,” the president responded.
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio (D-Lakewood) disagreed, adding that another House proposal will make it even worse for public education.
According to the House GOP, schools have carried over $10.5 billion, which should be going back to the residents. The bill would require counties to cut property tax rates, distributing back unspent cash, if school districts save more than 30% of the previous year’s budget.
These reserves are essential for schools, Antonio said. McColley also said he believes that the 30% limit is “too low.”
As the proposed budget makes its way through the Senate hearings, schools are asking to tack on more money. Legislative leaders say that doesn’t seem likely.

A bipartisan pair of state lawmakers argue that arrangement leaves consumers unprotected and opens the door to higher rates or unnecessary fees. They want to see those submetering companies regulated like utilities.
“If you act like a utility, and you look like a utility, and you smell like a utility, and you sound like a utility — you’re a utility,” said state Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma. “And you should therefore, have the same PUCO oversight as any other utility in the state of Ohio.”
What’s submetering?
For large developments like apartment buildings, condominiums and manufactured home parks, setting up a different meter for every unit can be cumbersome. Instead, third party companies offer to set up a single meter for the entire complex and then purchase utilities wholesale. The company then resells the services to residents and bills them directly.
The problem, argued state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, is submetered residents don’t get the benefit of shopping around for their utility provider and the company they’re forced to purchase from isn’t regulated.
“At my core, I’m a free market conservative,” Fischer said. “What I do not believe in is businesses who are selling the same product to customers while playing by a completely different set of rules.”
He argued if the Ohio has built its energy market to provide lower rates through competition, it doesn’t make sense to allow companies to carve out little monopolies for themselves.

“Submetering may appear to be a simple pass-through of utility costs,” Brennan added, “but in practice, these companies operate in a legal gray area.”
Most glaring — there’s no entity determining whether utility rates passed on to consumers are fair. But the sponsors said residents miss out on benefits like low-income energy assistance programs or dispute resolution before state regulators.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBrennan noted lawmakers just approved House Bill 15, which included several provisions strengthening consumer protections — like requiring utilities to justify their rates before state regulators on a regular basis.
He argued those utilities are “subject to consumer protection laws, disconnection procedures, billing transparency requirements and complaint resolution mechanisms.”
“But submetering companies are not bound by any of these same obligations, even though the service they provide is identical from the customer’s point of view,” Brennan said.
Ohio utility regulators’ decision disenfranchised apartment renters, consumer advocate says

Reactions
Brennan and Fischer’s proposal has the backing of Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis. Her office represents consumers in proceedings before the PUCO.
She pointed to residents’ lack of choice and lack of protections, saying it’s “not fair and it’s not transparent.”
“This bill closes that loophole,” Willis said. “It restores the basic principle that no one should profit off reselling essential services without public accountability.”
In addition to Brennan and Fischer’s proposal, a different measure would explicitly exempt submetering companies from utility regulation, while prohibiting them from jacking up rates. Under that proposal, sponsored by state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, and state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, submetering companies could charge no more than the standard consumer rate charged by the local utility.
Nationwide Energy Partners, which provides submetered services in Central Ohio, favors that approach. In a dispute between the company and AEP Ohio, the PUCO sided with NEP. Their decision required AEP to add provisions to its term sheet (known as a tariff) to allow NEP to continue providing service and put residents on similar footing with people who are not submetered.
“NEP has been supportive of consumer protections and specifically supports the consumer protections the PUCO put into tariffs,” an NEP spokesperson said. “We believe that’s the correct approach for legislation. Putting those tariff requirements into statute would give the PUCO clear authority over submetering and embed the current PUCO requirements for bill cap and disconnect into law.”
But while submetering companies argue they’re operating fairly, Fischer said he has “no way of proving their claims one way or another.”
That’s the whole point of a public regulatory process, he said.
“If, in fact, these submeter companies are doing as they say,” Fischer argued, “then they should have no problems continuing under Public Utilities Commission oversight.”

While his predecessors fostered dialogue and tolerance, Francis sought more active engagement with Muslims, particularly in the Middle East.

Francis framed his efforts around the “culture of encounter,” which he explained in a 2016 morning meditation. Drawing inspiration from the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 7, he noted that this approach was about “active engagement” rather than passive observation. He urged individuals to embody Jesus by “not just seeing, but looking; not just hearing, but listening; not just passing people by, but stopping with them.”
In my 2025 book “Beyond Dialogue – Building Bonds Between Christians and Muslims,” I stress the importance of moving beyond mere tolerance to collaboration as a way to engage with religious diversity − something that Francis demonstrated in his interfaith dialogue efforts with Muslim countries.
 Francis in Iraq after IS destruction

In 2021, Francis visited regions in Iraq once held by the Islamic State, or IS. This was the first papal visit to the country. He held masses in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region of Iraq, and he addressed a gathering in the courtyard of the Al-Tahera church, the hub of the Syriac Catholic population in Mosul. The historic 18th-century church was partially destroyed by IS during its occupation of the city from 2014 to 2017. An estimated 5,000 Christians were killed and some 125,000 displaced in Iraq during that time.
At Church Square in Mosul, where there are four churches, Francis prayed for the victims of the conflict and called for harmonious coexistence between Christians and Muslims. He also invited displaced Christians to return to their homes and praised the young Iraqi volunteers – both Christians and Muslims – working side by side to rebuild the churches and mosques destroyed by IS.
In addition, he convened an interreligious gathering in Ur, the birthplace of Abraham, a prophet revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims.
His actions not only brought together Christians and Muslims but also helped break down stereotypes.
 The year of tolerance

In 2019 he visited the United Arab Emirates, marking the first papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula, the birthplace of Islam. The visit coincided with the Emirati government proclaiming 2019 the Year of Tolerance, promoting coexistence, diversity and respect.
During his visit in Abu Dhabi in 2019, Francis celebrated a historic Catholic Mass in Zayed Sports City, drawing 180,000 attendees from over 100 countries, for which the UAE government declared a special holiday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThis unprecedented event challenged negative Western stereotypes about the Arabian Peninsula’s religious intolerance. The UAE Constitution, for example, guarantees religious freedom to all people, albeit with restrictions on proselytization among non-Islamic communities. It also offered a counternarrative of unity between Christians and Muslims in a region often viewed through a lens of religious strife and war.
Francis’ visit to the UAE also culminated in some crucial interfaith initiatives. In Abu Dhabi, Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar University, Ahmed El-Tayeb, cosigned the document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together. The document stresses the need to work together to promote a “culture of reciprocal respect.” While the Emirati president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, did not directly sign the document, he supported the interfaith initiatives that followed Francis’ trip.
This document led to the setting up of the Higher Committee of Human Fraternity, a collaborative project of a diverse groups of academic, cultural and religious leaders and entities from around the world. The committee created the Human Fraternity Education and Leadership for Peace program, a global youth movement. It also worked with the United Nations General Assembly to designate Feb. 4 as the International Day of Human Fraternity.
The Higher Committee of Human Fraternity also guided the construction of the Abrahamic Family House in Abu Dhabi, a shared space for a church, mosque and synagogue that opened in 2023.
I had the opportunity to attend the opening ceremony of the Abrahamic Family House in 2023. It was a memorable experience. A Christian girl, a Muslim boy and Jewish boy each brought a cube representing each house of worship to the center platform of the forum and placed them side by side on the ground. The simple act mirrored the architectural design of the Abrahamic Family House by bringing the abstract concept of interfaith harmony to life in a concrete and relatable way. The Emirati youth provided a glimpse into what a tolerant future could look like.
 History of Catholic-Muslim relations

The closest historical comparison to the Document on Human Fraternity is the Nostra Aetate, a declaration from the Second Vatican Council of 1965, when major reforms were initiated in the Catholic Church.
Nostra Aetate marked a turning point in the Catholic Church’s relations with Islam and all non-Christian traditions. After a history of conflict, limited positive engagement and mutual suspicion, it emphasized harmony, dialogue and respect with Islam.
However, the Document on Human Fraternity went further. For starters, it was a joint declaration with prominent Muslim leaders, signifying a deeper commitment to Christian-Muslim partnership, whereas Nostra Aetate was an internal Catholic document. The document called for grassroot activities, pointing to a more action-oriented approach to Christian and Muslim relations. Given that it was signed by the pope, it held influence within the Vatican leadership and among liberal cardinals. Its core principles are being integrated into pastoral initiatives and interreligious dialogue at the national and international levels.
Francis’ approach to Christian-Muslim dialogue differed notably from his predecessors. While Pope John Paul II focused on intellectual exchange and theological dialogue, Francis emphasized that they were insufficient on their own. In turn, he prioritized direct action and personal engagement with others as a means to a deeper understanding of the other.
Pope Benedict XVI, despite his commitment to dialogue, faced challenges due to remarks that outraged Muslims worldwide. During his Regensburg address in 2006, he mentioned a medieval dialogue attributed to Manuel II Palaiologus, the Byzantine emperor who reigned from 1391 to 1425, a period of growing power of the Ottoman Empire. Manuel II had criticized the concept of jihad in Islam and referred to Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, as “evil” and “inhuman.” While Benedict repeatedly emphasized that he was quoting Manuel II’s views on the relationship between faith and reason and not personally endorsing the emperor’s assessment of Islam, the pope’s comments were perceived as disrespectful toward the Islamic faith and its prophet.
Upon Francis’ death, the president of the UAE – Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan – described him as “a symbol of human fraternity, cultural coexistence and interfaith dialogue,” adding that he inspired “future generations in upholding the values of tolerance and mutual understanding.”
Francis’ gestures of solidarity, personal relationships and frequent visits to Muslim countries, I believe, laid a tangible foundation to move beyond dialogue and toward human fraternity.

After every Saturday morning walk, it’s tradition that the group celebrates each other for finishing the workout and prioritizing their health. (Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Tara Campbell unlocked the front door of the Bricklayers Hall, a no-frills brick building on South Union Street in downtown Montgomery, half a mile from the white-domed Alabama Capitol.
She was dressed in leggings, a T-shirt and bright blue running shoes. It was 8 a.m. on a Saturday, and she exuded the bouncy enthusiasm of a Zumba instructor as she welcomed the handful of Black women who’d just arrived.
Like Campbell, they were dressed for a workout. Three of them wore Wonder Woman socks that boasted tiny capes, which earned some laughs.
The women were ready for a two-mile group walk around Montgomery’s historically Black Centennial Hill neighborhood. But Campbell wanted to give them a quick tour of the building first.
For most, it was their first time inside the new Montgomery outpost of GirlTrek, a national organization dedicated to improving the health of Black women. A veteran of the nonprofit group’s Chicago chapter, Campbell moved south three months ago to open the new office in Montgomery.
GirlTrek chose its location deliberately. The Bricklayers Hall was the nerve center of the 1955-1956 Montgomery bus boycott, which successfully desegregated the city’s public buses and became a model of nonviolent protest. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other boycott leaders strategized inside the hall, where King also kept an office.
That office is now Campbell’s office. GirlTrek’s walking teams are designed to empower Black women to improve their health, but also to encourage civil rights-inspired activism to tackle broader health disparities.
This year marks the milestone anniversaries of several civil rights victories: the 70th anniversary of the bus boycott, the 60th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.
But 2025 also marks the 60th anniversary of Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes.
The creation of Medicaid isn’t typically considered a civil rights victory. But the idea of health care as a human right was very much a part of the Civil Rights Movement, as was the belief that universal coverage could help dismantle racial inequities in health care.
“The connection between Medicare, Medicaid and the Civil Rights Movement was there from the beginning,” said Zachary Schulz, a history lecturer at Auburn University who specializes in public health history and policy. “Desegregation is often discussed in education, but there could be an argument made that it began in health care.”
Many of the Alabama communities that were home to the fiercest civil rights battles of the 20th century still grapple with systemic neglect that’s resulted in poor health outcomes, high uninsured rates and a shortage of medical providers.
In the neighborhoods around the Alabama Capitol, where nearly 50,000 people gathered in March of 1965 to meet the Selma-to-Montgomery marchers and push for voting rights, nearly a quarter of residents don’t have health insurance, according to the latest U.S. census data, for 2023. Around the Bricklayers Hall, the median household income is about $23,615, less than half of what it is statewide.
The neighborhood’s closest hospital filed for bankruptcy in February.
Statewide, 12% of Black residents under age 65 are uninsured, compared with 8.2% of white people and 10.3% for all races, according to the census.














Desegregation is often discussed in education, but there could be an argument made that it began in health care.


– Zachary Schulz, Auburn University history lecturer






Just as civil rights activists marched for voting rights and an end to segregation, the next generation of organizers is demanding something they see as no less essential: the right to accessible, affordable health care in a system that continues to deny it.
The women in the Saturday morning walking group come from different neighborhoods across the city. Most said they have health insurance. But everybody knows somebody who’s struggled to get the health care they need.
Campbell believes unjust policies harm the health of Black women everywhere — and wants to encourage them to continue pushing for change.
One policy change that has long been the focus of rallies, committee hearings and advocacy across the state: Alabama’s refusal to expand Medicaid to more adults under the Affordable Care Act, despite evidence that the state’s health care system is failing huge swaths of Alabamians. Alabama consistently ranks at or near the bottom in health measures, including high rates of heart disease, obesity and maternal deaths.
“We’re trying to save our own lives,” Campbell said. “We’re here in the footsteps of the Civil Rights Movement where, when they walked, things changed.”
 ‘The most shocking and the most inhuman’

Black medical leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, such as Dr. W. Montague Cobb, advocated for the passage of Medicaid and Medicare. Others, including King, spoke of health care as a moral imperative. “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman,” he reportedly said in a 1966 speech to health care workers.
When Medicaid and Medicare launched that year, many Southern hospitals were still segregated. The feds sent teams to thousands of hospitals over the next few years to make sure they were following federal law before they could receive federal Medicare and Medicaid funding.
“Southern states were especially resistant back then to participation because it required compliance with federal regulations, including civil rights laws,” said Schulz, of Auburn University. Alabama didn’t launch its Medicaid program until 1970.
Some see echoes in today’s debate over Medicaid expansion.
Under the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010, states can extend Medicaid coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — currently about $21,000 a year for a single person. The feds currently cover 90% of the costs for those newly eligible enrollees.
Congressional Republicans are now considering whether to reduce the amount the federal government kicks in. But even at the 90% rate, 10 states — most of them in the South — have refused to take the deal. Many Republicans in those states say extending coverage to working-age adults would take away resources from people in greater need.
“Yet again, as in the ’60s, Southern states, including Alabama, were slow or resistant to expansion,” said Schulz. “The parallels are there: States’ rights versus federal mandates are very much the bottom line.”
 ‘Connect and keep moving’

Less than three miles from the Bricklayers Hall, Valtoria Jackson pastors the St. Peter African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her flock is a small but active Black congregation whose mission work often centers on health issues. Situated in a lower-income Montgomery neighborhood that’s recently seen signs of gentrifying, the church has sponsored a community garden, fitness classes and a fund to help neighbors pay their medical bills.
Jackson has also been a nurse for 41 years, most of them in Montgomery, and reckons she’s worked at every hospital in the city.
“I see myself as a connector,” she said. “I don’t like being in front. I just connect and keep moving.”
On a recent weekday morning she was in her car, delivering boxes of food to older people as part of a nutrition program funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She’s also a familiar face in Montgomery’s advocacy circles. She’s spoken at rallies on the steps of the state Capitol, protesting with organizations such as the Poor People’s Campaign against poverty and for universal health care and Medicaid expansion.
“There’s no reason we shouldn’t have Medicaid expansion here in the South,” Jackson said.
Alabama’s skeletal Medicaid program does not cover able-bodied adults without children. Its income eligibility limit for parents — 18% of the federal poverty line — is among the lowest in the nation. A single parent with one child, for example, is ineligible if she makes more than $3,816 per year.
Some of Jackson’s parishioners work low-wage jobs and fall into the so-called coverage gap, earning too much to qualify for Alabama Medicaid, but not enough to afford private health insurance.
About 161,000 uninsured adults in Alabama would gain coverage if the state expanded Medicaid, according to a KFF analysis of federal data. More than half are people of color, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.
 ‘Good Sam’

In 1965, Lula Edwards was a 35-year-old nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital in Selma, Alabama. The hospital, known in the community as “Good Sam,” was the only medical center in six counties that was open to Black people.
On March 7, 1965, its hallways filled with the bleeding and injured after Alabama state troopers attacked civil rights marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what would become known as Bloody Sunday. Edwards was supposed to be off work that day, but was called in to care for the wounded.
Outside of her hospital work, she kept her Montgomery home open to people who needed treatment. For Edwards, community-based care was a human right.
“She treated people in her own home when she wasn’t at the hospital, giving people their shots, giving stitches, giving medicine,” said her grandson, Robert Stewart. “She was right there in the neighborhood and treated them for free.”
Stewart was determined to continue her legacy and that of his other grandparents, who marched in Selma during the Civil Rights Movement and helped register people to vote.
Edwards died in 2022 at age 92, a day after Stewart announced he was running for a seat in the Alabama state Senate. At her funeral, he said, mourners came up to him with campaign donations in her honor.
“My grandmother always told me I would be in politics,” he said. Stewart won his election a few months later. The Selma native now represents an eight-county district in central Alabama that has some of the poorest health outcomes in the state.
As a Democrat in a state with a Republican supermajority, his calls for Medicaid expansion go largely ignored. But he’s proud the legislature expanded Alabama’s postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to a year in 2023 and eliminated Medicaid application delays for pregnant women earlier this year — significant steps for a state where Medicaid covers about half of all births.
But it’s still not enough.
“I represent eight counties, yet only two of them have pediatricians,” he said. “I have people in my district who have opted to stay out of the workforce so they can qualify for Medicaid because that’s the only way they can afford their insulin or their blood pressure medication.”
Two hospitals closed in Alabama just last year, including one in his district. Four Alabama hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units since 2023. The Alabama Hospital Association has long advocated for Medicaid expansion as a way to help financially struggling hospitals, particularly in rural areas.
Stewart and other Democrats have adapted their calls for Medicaid expansion to include the ways it could fit into Republican priorities, such as benefiting the state’s workforce.
“Expanding Medicaid needs to be a number one priority if we’re going to be serious about improving workforce participation as well as improving the overall health of Alabamians,” he said.
In recent years, conservative lawmakers in holdout states such as Alabama and Mississippi have signaled interest in expanding Medicaid. But after President Donald Trump’s reelection put federal Medicaid cuts on the table, expansion seems further away than ever.
Earlier this year, Alabama’s Republican House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter said expansion was no longer a priority this legislative session because Medicaid could see changes at the federal level.
“We are better off seeing what they are going to do,” he told reporters.
 Sacred ground

The front office at the Bricklayers Hall is sparsely furnished. There’s a metal desk, a small filing cabinet, a tripod with a ring light for filming social media videos. Bulletin boards lean against the wall, waiting to be hung.
In the corner, a big blue sign: “Black women, you are welcome here.”
As Campbell shows the women around the space, she tells them the office once belonged to King.
“It’s like we’re walking on sacred ground,” someone says quietly.
In a back room, posters and protest signs decorate the wall:
“When Black women walk, things change”
“We walk for healthier bodies, families & communities”
Mary Mixon, 73, is retired from the Air Force and already walks up to five miles each day. But she comes to the Saturday morning GirlTrek walks, she says, “for the joy.”
She moved to Montgomery decades ago when she was assigned to nearby Maxwell Air Force Base.
“I was literally afraid to come because I’m from the Midwest, and I’d heard of so many ugly things here,” she recalled. “But as the time went on, I learned that injustice — yes, it does happen. But initiatives happen also. You can take the injustice and turn it around to justice.”
After Campbell passed out GirlTrek T-shirts to everyone, the group began its two-mile walk.
They set a speedy pace but waited at red lights for one another — no woman left behind. They chatted about kids and jobs. Some listened to music.
Their walk took them through the same neighborhood streets where, 60 years ago, Black Montgomery residents marched for justice and equal treatment.
But their route didn’t pass the Alabama State House, where lawmakers are winding down another legislative session without expanding Medicaid.

The nation’s last unsettled election contest has finally been decided. On Wednesday, Republican state Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin conceded to incumbent Democratic Justice Allison Riggs.
It was a long overdue act that many observers, including Justice Riggs (who prevailed in two separate recounts), are rightfully celebrating as a victory for democracy.
That said, Griffin’s challenge – which called for trashing thousands of ballots cast by voters according to the rules in effect last November – has done tremendous damage.
Not only did it waste vast sums of money and further undermine the public’s confidence in the judiciary, but one fears that it will inspire copycat losers in future elections who will try to overturn their losses by retroactively altering election rules.
God help us if this were to happen in a presidential election.
The bottom line: a federal judge dismissed Griffin’s shameless challenge as unconstitutional, but several of Griffin’s GOP pals on the state courts were ready to go along with it. And that’s a red flag that should alarm us all.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)Tariff-related cost increases in building materials and lumber market instability this year have been causing great uncertainty in the construction and home improvement markets.
As the head of Millard Lumber, that’s terrifying.
Not just because it raises the cost of operating our family-owned business. That number also represents a trend of higher costs and uncertain times for our customers and further stresses efforts to maintain affordable housing for every Nebraskan.
It’s easy to chalk that up as the price of doing business today, whether it’s the result of tariffs, inflation, or excessive regulations. And while many of these pressures start beyond our state’s borders, there are simple, realistic steps Nebraska’s Legislature can take to improve stability for businesses like mine, so we can continue serving our customers as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Businesses need help
The data helps illustrate how much we need help from lawmakers. Tariffs on Canadian oil could push U.S. gas prices up by as much as 20 to 25 cents per gallon in the months ahead. That would increase transportation costs enormously, and small businesses would be hard-pressed not to pass that on to consumers.
Similarly, tariffs on steel and aluminum can drive up the costs of small items used in large quantities like screws, nails, hardware and locks up by nearly 50 percent. That makes everything from homes and cars to furniture and appliances costlier for Nebraska families.
As Millard Lumber and other Nebraska companies are faced with increasing uncertainties in their costs of doing business, we are also faced with uncertainties in demand for our products and services because of cost pressures and a “freezing” of decision making due to economic uncertainty.
Federally, it isn’t all bad news. President Donald Trump issued an executive order earlier this year that requires federal agencies to slash 10 regulations for every new one they add, a great idea. But the regulatory maze will stay put for a while, and compliance costs will weigh us down in the meantime.
It’s safe to say that federal efforts alone can’t fully address Nebraska’s unique economic needs. That’s why state-level action could prove critical.
Timing is now
This legislative session is a prime chance to improve Nebraska’s business climate. There are already several ideas circulating the Capitol that could offer real relief.
Bills like Legislative Bill 29 (amended into LB660), which would mandate regular reviews of state rules and regulations, would help cut red tape and ease operational burdens on business by encouraging transparent, accountable rule-making by state agencies.
Giving businesses leeway to customize benefits like paid leave lets us meet workforce demands and adhere to voter mandates while avoiding the stifling effect of one-size-fits-all government intervention. For example, LB 415 offers clarity for businesses as new paid sick leave requirements take effect.
On wages, LB 297, signed by Gov. Jim Pillen this session, should provide an immediate reduction in payroll costs by reducing the combined unemployment tax rate in 2025.
These steps and others prioritized by business leaders, including the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, would help us stabilize costs and shield our customers from national volatility.
Way forward
Of course, our congressional delegation deserves credit for pushing pro-business policies, from promoting tax certainty to expanding access to affordable childcare.
Our state is consistently ranked as one of America’s top 10 states for doing business.
Even so, past wins are no guarantee of future success — especially when continued progress is threatened by consumer angst, supply chain interruptions and global trade disruptions.
In the short term, uncertainty will likely slow growth, but Nebraska’s resilience runs deep. We’re lucky to have many legislators in Lincoln who recognize that our state thrives when our businesses thrive.
By lowering the costs of doing business, our lawmakers can help local businesses flourish, not just survive.

,California,2025-05-08 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California’s fourth-ranked economy is also tops in unemployment, poverty and deficits",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/california-fourth-ranked-economy-budget/,"Since Gavin Newsom became governor, state spending has increased an average  9% a year while revenues grew 6%. That's called a “structural deficit.”","California’s economic output has surpassed $4 trillion a year and in doing so slipped past Japan to become, were it a nation,  the globe’s fourth largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China and Germany.
The news was an opportunity for Gov. Gavin Newsom to exercise his penchant for braggadocio.
“California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” Newsom declared. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation.”
It was also an opportunity for Newsom to take another shot at President Donald Trump, saying, “while we celebrate this success, we recognize that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration. California’s economy powers the nation, and it must be protected.”
If California’s economy is booming, as Newsom boasts, one might wonder why the state’s unemployment rate is the third highest in the nation, with more than a million jobless workers, and why its poverty rate is the nation’s highest.
One might also wonder why, if California’s economy is so healthy, the state budget is experiencing chronic multi-billion-dollar deficits.
Newsom must tell the Legislature this month how he would alter the 2025-26 budget he proposed in January, touching off the annual whirlwind of negotiations to produce a more-or-less final version for adoption by June 15.
The January budget proposed at least $11 billion in short-term fixes, including off-the-books borrowing, dips into the state’s budget reserves and accounting gimmicks to close the gap between projected income and the spending dictated by current law.
Tax revenues are running a bit ahead of expectations so far this year, but not nearly enough to close the deficit, which has widened due to spending on Medi-Cal, California’s health care system for the poor that’s far exceeding the level of the 2024-25 budget enacted last June.
Overall, Medi-Cal expenditures are over $6 billion higher than expectations, with a major chunk caused by higher-than-expected enrollment of undocumented immigrants.
Therefore the May revise, as it’s dubbed, is likely to contain even more expedient fixes that may postpone the day of fiscal reckoning until Newsom’s governorship ends two years hence but will continue to plague his successor and the Legislature.
The Medi-Cal situation exemplifies the underlying reason why California’s budget is unhealthy while the state’s economy continues to grow, albeit without producing many new jobs.
The pertinent data is to be found in a recent publication by the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, called “CalFacts 2024.”

Commentary 
California’s economy was already sluggish before Trump’s global tariffs 

by Dan Walters 





It reveals that since Newsom became governor in 2019, state spending has increased, on average, by 9% a year while annual revenues have grown by just 6%. The difference between those two numbers constitutes what budget mavens call a “structural deficit,” meaning that spending baked into law far exceeds what the current revenue system can generate.
The underlying discrepancy between income and outgo is important to remember, because when Newsom unveils his revised budget he’s likely to cite the Los Angeles wildfires and Trump’s tariffs as factors in the budget’s gap.
Both of those events are likely to increase the deficit, but they didn’t cause it. The deficit exists because Newsom and the Legislature have chronically spent more than the revenue system produces, even though Californians have one of the nation’s highest state and local tax burdens, relative to the state’s economy.
Moreover, by tapping into reserves meant to cushion the impact of recessions or other emergency situations, Newsom and legislators have weakened the state’s ability to cope with genuine economic setbacks or disasters, such as the wildfires.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Georgia’s U.S. senators are outraged at the prospect of large job losses for clean energy workers if the Republican Congress implements its proposed cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act.
Georgia Democratic U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are opposing Republican members of Congress supporting President Donald Trump’s administration budget spending plans that could lead to the  repeal of federal manufacturing incentives fueling Georgia’s clean energy projects, including solar energy projects and its growing battery storage and electrified vehicle industries.
Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has championed the state’s emergence as a leader in electric vehicle production, vowing to make the state the country’s EV leader.
Ossoff and Warnock are joined by a number of clean energy groups that claim Congressional tax cuts to the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act could result in the loss of 42,000 jobs in Georgia. Investing in more than 50 clean energy projects worth more than $28 billion has made the state a national leader in clean energy.
In 2022, Congress passed the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act tax credits that supported nationwide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding and loans to various battery manufacturing such as solar and electric vehicle manufacturing.
Georgia’s senators are flagging studies that found that Georgia is at risk of losing 42,000 jobs if Washington Republicans in Congress vote to eliminate tax credits for the inflation act.
Georgia’s clean energy economy has led the nation since former President Joe Biden signed the IRA in 2022.
On Tuesday, Warnock released an analysis of the “clean energy boom in Georgia.
The progressive nonprofit Climate Power released a report this year detailing Georgia’s $31 billion in clean energy investments, only behind New York’s $115 billion job-creating projects.
On April 30, Ossoff and Climate Power said a loss of federal support for clean energy projects will inflict economic pain in Georgia.
“If Republicans repeal these manufacturing incentives, it could be catastrophic for Georgia’s economic development,” Ossoff said. “The manufacturing incentives that we passed into law have driven more private investment into new industrial plants in Georgia than just about any other state in the country.”
Congressional Republicans adopted a budget spending plan in April that lacks $1.5 trillion in savings to offset the new spending.
The budget slashes $21 billion from funding for renewable energy, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and other efforts to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions. The request also targets climate research spending and initiatives meant to promote diversity.
Four Senate Republicans and 21 House Republicans have urged their leadership to preserve the clean energy tax credit.
The president’s budget request is a wish list for Congress, which controls federal spending, to consider. Even with both chambers of Congress controlled by Republicans sympathetic to Trump’s policies, it is just a starting point for negotiations between the administration and Congress.
The Warnock report found that during the last three years of the Inflation Reduction Act, nearly all new investments and jobs in Georgia are outside of the Atlanta region.
The majority of new jobs and investments are in counties with lower bachelor’s degree rates, according to Warnock.
Trump began his presidency by pausing grants and distributions in Biden’s energy legislation, including investments intended to expand renewable energy and clean energy manufacturing. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun the process to reverse federal greenhouse pollution limits for cars.
Warnock says Trump’s taking aim at the electric vehicle industry by pushing for a repeal of a $7,500 tax credit on electric vehicles is counterproductive.
“In a political era defined by gridlock, everyone can agree that we should protect investments that are spurring good-paying manufacturing jobs,” Warnock said.
“There is bipartisan support for protecting the clean energy investments which support Georgia jobs, Georgia manufacturing, and Georgia innovation,” Warnock said. “These investments are bringing real change to communities and families across the state, but those good-paying clean energy jobs are under threat.
Pooler Republican U.S. Congressman Buddy Carter has steadfastly promoted Trump’s environmental regulations rollbacks of the Biden administration’s clean energy policies. Carter’s coastal Georgia district is home to Hyundai’s $7.6 billion EV plant near Savannah.
Georgia is leading the nation in new clean energy jobs and private investment, including a projected 43,000 new jobs created since August 2022, according to a Jan. 16 report from environmental watchdog Climate Power.
Georgia is a major reason why the Southeast is the national leader for EV and battery-related jobs and private sector investments, according to a 2024 report from the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Georgia earned the group’s top spots in the region for its projected 27,394 new jobs and investments exceeding $24 billion.

Tax incentives offered by the state with the strong backing of Kemp were used to secure commitments from Hyundai and Rivian to build electric powered vehicles at massive new plants projected to employ thousands of people
Stan Cross, electric transportation director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said that current political instability could undermine progress made by state leaders who promoted investments in workforce new electric vehicle manufacturing sites like Hyundai.
Cross said it’s tough to predict what Congress will or won’t do to support electric vehicles in Georgia. But there’s no doubt a transition to EVs will certainly reduce tailpipe emissions, Cross said.
“Georgia is No. 1 in the private sector for EV and battery manufacturing investments and jobs, making Georgia the  number one in having the most to lose iIf the financial incentive rug gets pulled off from under the state,” Cross said .

It must be reflected in action, policy, and measurable outcomes.","When someone raises their hand to defend our nation, they do so knowing the risks — and trusting that their sacrifice will be honored when their service ends. That trust is a promise — not just from the federal government, but from every level of government, including our state. 
In Connecticut, we take that promise seriously.
This year, Republicans and Democrats from both chambers of the General Assembly have come together around a shared mission: to better serve Connecticut’s veterans and their families. The HERO Act (HB 6442) is the result of that bipartisan, bicameral effort — a comprehensive package of legislation that reflects months of collaboration, listening, and a deep, collective respect for those who have worn the uniform.
Every component of the HERO Act passed the Veterans’ and Military Affairs Committee with unanimous support, demonstrating the strength of our shared commitment. It includes ideas from lawmakers across the political spectrum and the state, unified by one goal: to ensure Connecticut’s veterans receive the recognition, support, and services they deserve.
This legislation strengthens how Connecticut honors its veterans. By designating November as Veterans’ Month, we expand the opportunity to reflect on and celebrate their service. The HERO Act waives fees for the Purple Heart license plate, ensuring accessibility for those who have earned one of our nation’s highest military honors. Separately, it creates two new commemorative plates — one honoring women veterans and another recognizing the Borinqueneers — providing lasting public recognition of their historic contributions.
The HERO Act is more than symbolic. It addresses the real, everyday challenges veterans and their families face. It accelerates nursing home placement for service-connected veterans and improves school transitions for military families with children requiring special education services. These are practical solutions to real problems — shaped by listening to those who live them.
The bill also modernizes how we honor active military service. It empowers the Adjutant General to award state military honors more efficiently. It invests in the future by directing the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs to explore improvements in dental care.
 At the heart of the HERO Act is a simple but powerful belief: “Thank you for your service” must be more than words. It must be reflected in action, policy, and measurable outcomes. With the HERO Act, we’re showing that our support for veterans transcends politics – it’s a shared value. We urge our colleagues and neighbors alike to support this meaningful legislation.
Let’s stand united to fulfill our promise to those who have served: that they are seen, they are valued, and they will never be forgotten – not just on Veterans Day, but every day.

Tweed New Haven Airport, which operates with local, state, and federal support, is no exception.
During public comment at the latest meeting of the Tweed New Haven Airport Authority, urgent concern was expressed: Avelo Airlines, the primary carrier operating at Tweed, has reportedly signed a contract to begin conducting deportation flights out of Mesa, Arizona starting this May. These deportations risk violating due process protections for immigrants.
This is not just an Arizona issue. It is a question of what Tweed New Haven —and by extension, the people of Connecticut —will be complicit in. Allowing a publicly subsidized airline to profit from a system that often detains and deports vulnerable individuals without adequate legal protections betrays our community’s values and tarnishes our airport’s reputation.
We are in an era where extreme capitalism allows corporations to chase profit at any moral and ethical cost, often backed by public infrastructure, tax breaks, and subsidies. Avelo Airlines, currently benefiting from state subsidies and favorable leasing conditions, cannot be allowed to quietly profit from the suffering of vulnerable individuals. To do so not only compromises common sense ethics —it risks the revenues to Tweed.
Nearly 35,000 people have already signed a petition pledging to boycott Avelo if these flights move forward. The financial and reputational damage could be substantial —not just for the airline, but for Tweed and the surrounding community.
The Tweed New Haven Airport Authority must act immediately to protect the integrity of our public infrastructure:

Demand a formal and public commitment from Avelo Airlines that it will not profit from or conduct deportation flights that violate human rights.
Include human rights compliance clauses in all future leases and operating agreements with Avelo.
Withhold support for any state subsidies to Avelo unless it can demonstrate it will not engage in deportation flights involving due process concerns.
Ensure full transparency and engage the public openly in all future negotiations involving Avelo’s operations at Tweed.

Public trust is earned through courageous leadership, not silence. Tweed must show that it will not be a silent partner to injustice. If Avelo wants to continue operating from a publicly supported airport, it must align its practices with Connecticut’s values.
The Tweed New Haven Airport Authority has an opportunity —and a responsibility— to lead. Let’s make it clear: our public infrastructure must not be used to advance unjust deportations.

“It’s great news,” said Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, sponsor of the legislation on Wednesday following the vote. “This is a critically needed bill. It can generate some much needed revenue for education funding, and it is not going to result in any new taxes on Alaskans.”
Senate Bill 113 would clarify that businesses that do at least 50% of sales of goods or services online, in Alaska or delivered to Alaska customers, must pay a state tax. Currently, businesses can argue a sale is taking place out-of-state at a company server farm or warehouse, not subject to Alaska taxation. But companies are still subject to taxes in those states where they’re located, so supporters of the bill argue the update to “market-based sourcing” will bring that tax revenue to Alaska. 
Wielechowski argued it’s an issue of fairness for Alaskans. “When a sale is made over the internet, they often use our state-funded broadband. When a product is shipped, it comes into our state-funded airports or Port of Alaska. It’s trucked over our state-funded roads, and across our state-funded bridges,” he told the House Finance Committee on Friday. 
“And who pays for all this? The people of Alaska,” he said. “While the out of state corporation pays very little, or likely nothing in the case of highly digitized businesses, … this bill fixes this inequity.”
The bill also garnered support from some more conservative Republican legislators, including Sen. Rob Yundt, R-Wasilla, who penned an op-ed published in the Anchorage Daily News. “Today, highly digitized businesses can rake in hundreds of millions of dollars from Alaskans without ever setting foot in our state. They compete directly with our local retailers, undercutting prices and displacing local jobs,” he wrote. 
“Because double taxation is illegal, if Alaska exercises its rightful authority to tax companies like Amazon on the income they earn here, they will not be taxed on that income again. This means the tax is already included in the company’s budgets, and prices will not be changed for the seller or consumer.”

	Under federal tax law, businesses are taxed based on apportionment, or a formula based on revenue from a company’s property, payroll and sales. Under the legislation, only the sales in Alaska would be factored in for companies that are deemed “highly digitized,” which means more than 50% of their business is done online.
The legislation does not change Alaska’s corporate income tax rates or brackets. 
Other Republicans, like Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, opposed the tax, raising concerns businesses would shift the cost of the tax and raise prices on consumers. “I think it’s going to impact people greatly,” she said in the House Finance Committee meeting on Friday. “I feel like this is a hidden cost to Alaskans.”
Wielechowski said prices are usually set nationally, and pointed to at least 36 states that already have some form of this locally based corporate income tax. “So the extent that we think our implementing this is going to somehow outweigh the impacts of California doing it and New York doing it — and North Carolina doing it, and Ohio doing it, and Oregon doing it, and all those other states — I know we like to think very highly of ourselves,” he said, to laughs from the committee, “but I just don’t think we have that sort of market impact.”
By updating the law to capture these corporate sales, the bill could generate $25 million to $65 million each year at full implementation, according to a state estimate. It would cost more than $250,000 to administer, the state Department of Revenue said.
Lawmakers have tied the revenue to pay for part of House Bill 57, an education funding bill for next year, which is waiting for a decision from Dunleavy. 
Legislators passed the bill in late April, with an estimated $22 million earmarked for reading improvement grants, and $10 million for career and technical education programs — both policy items sought by Dunleavy. But lawmakers made that contingent on Senate Bill 113 also passing.
House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said the legislation would generate much needed revenue for the state. 
“I don’t think it’s lost on a lot of members in the Legislature that we’re now entering an era where we’re going to have to look at other revenue measures. And you can interpret this as a first step in that direction,” he said, “whether the governor approves it or not. But overall, I think for other legislators it’s kind of considered low-hanging fruit.”
The last time the Legislature approved a significant revenue measure was in 2015, when lawmakers voted to add a 0.95-cent-per-gallon surcharge to the state’s fuel tax in order to fund spill response and prevention.
The education funding bill is now with Dunleavy, who has until May 17 to sign it, veto it or let it become law without his signature. If he vetoes it, majority leaders say they believe they have the votes to override it. 
In the days leading up to the House vote on SB 113, lawmakers complained that Dunleavy’s staff with the Department of Revenue declined to answer questions about the legislation. 
“When you have a whole department that’s just saying we’re not going to help you with a piece of legislation, I’ve never experienced that in my time here,” Wielechowski said on Tuesday, ahead of the vote. 
SB 113 now goes back to the Senate chamber and then will be transmitted to the governor’s office.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/D5631BED-F01D-4BB1-9800-9DB40239CF74_1_201_a-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-07 23:59:01.846747

Roughly half of the country’s attorneys general participated, according to the Associated Press. Their schedule called for four hours of business meetings and more than two days of ceremonies and sightseeing, including guided tours of World War II battlegrounds and a centuries-old abbey.
Taylor ultimately did report that trip in an unpublished financial disclosure he filed in March that’s only released from state regulators upon request.
The disclosure also reported a 2023 trip to South Africa, where attorneys general were scheduled to take an “educational tour” of wine estates and a daylong trip to a game reserve that offers viewing of lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalo. Participants were accompanied by corporate officials from firms like Uber, TikTok and Albertsons, the parent company of the Safeway grocery store chain, according to reporting by CNN.
Taylor’s participation underscores watchdogs’ growing concerns about the group that paid for the trips, the Attorney General Alliance, or AGA, which has raised millions of dollars from corporations — including some that have had legal disputes with states.
Taylor recently assumed the alliance’s chairmanship, his department announced earlier this year, and he is holding a cybersecurity-focused meeting for the group in Alaska in August.
The alliance, created in 2019, has come under increasing criticism, including from the former head of the century-old National Association of Attorneys General, who said in his retirement letter that the alliance, a competing group, is “overwhelmingly dependent on corporate and lobbyist money” and creates pathways for attorneys general to have their travel paid by entities they are “investigating or suing.”
“The simple fact is they are a lobbyist access group with some programming to cover for it,” said Tom Jones, head of the American Accountability Foundation, a conservative group that’s used public records requests to expose some of the alliance’s corporate links and sponsored trips.
Taylor’s office describes the alliance as a nonpartisan forum where attorneys general “work in cooperation to share ideas, educate on emerging issues, build relationships and foster enforcement through meetings, panels, working groups, and social activities.”
In an interview at his downtown Anchorage office, Taylor said he took vacation time for his trips to South Africa and France, on which he flew business class.
And he vehemently defended AGA’s value. In addition to trips, he said, it also provides trainings for state attorneys on subjects like organized retail crime, online gaming and artificial intelligence.
Taylor said that AGA-sponsored trips contain substantive panels and discussions — such as, in South Africa, sessions on intellectual property rights and cybersecurity. 
And he added that the relationships he’s developed with experts and corporate officials on trips have helped him and other attorneys general resolve problems without the need for “long, nasty and expensive” litigation. 
But he also rejected the idea that those relationships make it more difficult for attorneys general to hold corporations accountable: He noted that states have sued and litigated against major sponsors of AGA like Amazon and Pfizer.
“The only benefit they have is that I do know who they are. And they do know who I am, and they can reach out,” he said. “But that doesn’t stop us from doing our jobs as AGs, as we’ve proven over and over again.”
Taylor is a former top attorney for a large, Indigenous-owned oil and gas contracting business, and he began his tenure in state government in 2018 as deputy attorney general in charge of the civil division at the Alaska Department of Law. 
Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed him attorney general in 2021. 
The AGA was created in 2019 by a group of Western attorneys general and has grown to include more than 40 states and territories, according to its website.
Alaska pays some $10,000 in yearly membership fees. But Taylor acknowledged that a “very, very low percentage” of the AGA’s budget comes from those dues and that the rest comes from sponsors. 
CNN reported that the group collected nearly $27 million in sponsorships between 2019 and 2023 — and allows companies, depending upon the size of their contributions, to suggest “speakers, panelists, working groups, white papers and events.” 
Jones, from the conservative advocacy group, said one problem with the corporate participation in the trips to foreign countries is that “the other side of that conversation” is not happening there.
People who would advocate for tougher legal scrutiny of corporations, he said, “don’t have the tens of thousands of dollars a year to pay into associations to buy time in Normandy with the attorneys general.”
Taylor said he understands criticism that traveling internationally for AGA programming isn’t necessary in the Zoom era, which, he added, “is why I take personal time for those trips.” 
He also said that he paid for his six children and one of their spouses to accompany him on the trip to Normandy, which they followed with a weeklong stay at an Airbnb on southern France’s Mediterranean coast to explore the Pyrenees, “since I’m already there.”
Amid a spate of negative press coverage and public records requests about the alliance, though, Taylor acknowledged that the group has room for improvement and will consider potential changes.
“AGA is a worthless organization if AGs can’t take advantage of the things that they offer,” he said. “And if they can’t take advantage of the things that they offer because of the types of trips that are occurring, then we need to change those types of trips.”
Detailed documentation of Taylor’s alliance-paid trips — including travel confirmations and receipts for plane tickets — is not public because expenses covered by a third party do not need to be recorded, said Alan Birnbaum, a state attorney and public records specialist who handled a Northern Journal request to the Department of Law.
[Read the Department of Law’s response to Northern Journal’s records request]
Birnbaum cited a state administrative manual that says that if travel is “immaterial” to an agency travel budget, related transactions don’t need to be “recorded as an expenditure and a revenue.”
At Taylor’s direction, Birnbaum later released some general itineraries for the trips, though more detailed documentation was still withheld.
Taylor said he did not know whether he’d deleted the requested records, but, he added: “I cull my email all the time.” He also said that state law aims to define what he described as “the limits of a public record.”
“Any time we start to diminish what a public record is, that’s something that I worry about, because that is a slippery slope: ‘Well, you did it in this case. Why, now, won’t you release the memo that you wrote the governor on this issue? Do you have something to hide?’” Taylor said. “That’s just one of those roads that I’ve just made a policy decision, we’re not going to go around.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Members of the Alaska Senate issued warnings Wednesday as they approved a draft operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year.
Senators’ draft, which includes an estimated $1,000 Permanent Fund dividend for eligible Alaskans and a small year-over-year increase for K-12 education, also cuts services. 
The proposal would cut proposed funding increases for early education programs, reduce funding for state prisons, eliminate the state’s office of citizenship assistance, mostly defund the state militia, reduce road maintenance, and deny salary increases except as required by union contracts.
Legislators are trying to address a significant deficit caused by low oil prices, and Wednesday’s 16-4 vote by the Senate keeps the Capitol on schedule for the May 21 end of the regular session.
The Senate’s draft of the budget measure, House Bill 53, is scheduled to return to the House as soon as Friday. If lawmakers there vote down the Senate draft, that action would set up the creation of a conference committee designed to combine the Senate’s draft budget with one passed by the House in April.
The resulting compromise likely would be among the last items completed before lawmakers end their session for the year. The budget bill would then go to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who has the power to veto individual line items.
Members of the bipartisan group that leads the Senate said they wanted to balance the budget without using the state’s savings accounts, because a worsening state fiscal picture will almost certainly require tapping them next year.
“The Senate Finance chairs believe that the state is facing some very strong headwinds in future budgets,” said Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and the lead author of the Senate’s draft budget.
Right now, the Senate’s $5.8 billion budget proposal has a small surplus when combined with all other spending bills and the state’s spring revenue forecast.
But that surplus is almost certainly an illusion, Hoffman said. The federal government is cutting the amount of money it sends to states, oil prices are below what was forecast in March, labor contracts will increase in costs, and this year’s budget uses one-time funding sources that won’t be available next year.

“With all of these budget headwinds, it’s clear to me that the decisions next year will be more difficult than the decisions made today,” Hoffman said.
Where the House proposed spending from savings to boost the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend and increase some spending on services, the Senate prioritized the state’s savings accounts.
“Now is the time to preserve our rainy-day fund for that coming storm,” Hoffman said.
All 14 members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority caucus voted in favor of the budget proposal, as did two Republicans who are members of the Senate’s all-Republican minority caucus and sit on the finance committee.
“This is a conservative budget, no matter how you look at it. It’s very lean,” said Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok and one of those lawmakers.
“Is this perfect? No. It’s going to be a lot worse next year, and I think that people in Alaska need to understand that,” he said.

Sen. Robert Yundt, R-Wasilla, is also a member of the Senate minority and criticized Dunleavy, whose initial budget proposal in December included a $3,900 Permanent Fund dividend and a $1.5 billion deficit.
“I’ve heard and felt frustration from members of all four caucuses,” he said. “It is baffling to me that you can walk in here and say, ‘Here, 60 people — here’s a budget that’s a billion and a half dollars upside-down.’ It shouldn’t be legal.”
The House’s draft budget, which followed the governor’s proposal, had plenty of problems, said Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla. 
The Senate’s finance committee “were handed a bag of lemons and told to make lemonade, and frankly, when you look at what they were able to do … I think they really did,” he said.
But Shower, Yundt and two other members of the Senate minority noted that even with the Senate’s cuts, the budget is unsustainable and that they couldn’t support it.
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, said that Alaskans need to be aware that over the past 10 years, the growth in state spending on services has been below the rate of inflation.
As a result, services have gotten worse because dollars don’t stretch as far as they used to. Construction contracts for road projects aren’t getting out on time, he said.
“The notion that we’re vastly overspending on the services Alaskans want and expect, don’t you believe it for a second,” he said.
Kiehl joined Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, in saying that if Alaskans want a larger Permanent Fund dividend and better services, they need to ask their legislators to vote for revenue bills.
Wielechowski noted that in the coming fiscal year, Alaska will spend more on tax deductions and tax credits for oil companies than it will on the dividend.
“We need to reevaluate how we are doing things in this state,” Wielechowski said. “We are not following our constitutional obligation to get the maximum value for our resources. If you want a full PFD, you want to have a 50-50 PFD, you have to fix oil taxes. You absolutely have to do that.”

Rob Menendez, a Democrat, is one of several federal lawmakers who wants to ban all non-essential helicopter traffic in a 20-mile radius around the Statue of Liberty. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A month after a sightseeing helicopter fell apart in the sky over Jersey City, killing six, three federal lawmakers have introduced a bipartisan bill that would ban all non-essential helicopter traffic within a 20-mile radius of the Statue of Liberty.
Such restrictions are necessary because sightseeing and commuter helicopters clog the airspace sometimes at dangerously low altitudes, create excessive air and noise pollution, and endanger densely populated urban areas on both sides of the Hudson River, said Reps. Rob Menendez (D-08), Jerrold Nadler (D-New York), and Nicole Malliotakis (R-New York).
“Last month’s tragic crash should be a clarion call for every level of government to take action on helicopter safety,” Menendez said in a statement. “Rising congestion of non-essential helicopters, coupled with concerning safety records of air tourism operators, are causing a direct threat to public safety. Along with my colleagues from New Jersey and New York, we’re doing what is necessary to prevent tragedies like this from happening again.”
The National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday released a preliminary investigative report on that April 10 crash. It offered no cause but shed light on the helicopter’s path and fatal fall.
The Bell 206L-4 helicopter carrying a Spanish family of five broke apart in the air about 17 minutes after it took off from the Wall Street Heliport in Manhattan, according to the report. Killed were Agustin Escobar, 49, a Siemens executive; his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, 39; their three children, Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10; and pilot Seankese Johnson, 36.
Investigators determined that Johnson — on his eighth sightseeing flight of the day in that helicopter — first flew by the Statue of Liberty before heading north on the Manhattan side of the Hudson River past the George Washington Bridge. He then made a U-turn and headed south again along the New Jersey side of the river.
As he approached the Holland Tunnel ventilation towers by Jersey City at a height of about 675 feet, witnesses heard several loud bangs and the chopper fell in three pieces into the river, investigators found.

The fuselage, with engine attached, landed in about six feet of water north of the tunnel’s ventilation towers, and investigators found the chopper’s main rotor and tail sections in about 30 feet of water farther north, according to the report. They also found debris on a Hoboken rooftop.
An initial review of the chopper’s maintenance records showed its most recent inspection occurred on Feb. 27, the report says. Johnson, a U.S. Navy veteran, had logged 790 hours of flight experience, the report says.
The aircraft, which was operated by a company called New York Helicopter, had no video or data recording devices onboard, the report says. Photos taken of Johnson before he flew his final flight showed him wearing computer-augmented sunglasses that had video and audio recording capability, but they were not recovered.
The crash was one of about 30 helicopter crashes that killed 31 people in the region since 1983, according to Menendez’s office.
His bill, co-sponsored by Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), also has the support of Stop the Chop NY/NJ.
That grassroots advocacy group says the fatal helicopter crashes, along with a longtime shortage of air traffic controllers, prove the need for the “immediate reform of the current Wild West-like conditions over NYC and surrounding communities.”

Bob Ferguson said Wednesday he trusts those arrested for the occupation of a building at the University of Washington “will be held accountable for the harm they caused.”
Ferguson’s comments to reporters after a bill-signing were his first public remarks on the pro-Palestinian protest that ended with about 30 arrests and has drawn national attention.
GOP state lawmakers and other Republicans have described the demonstration at the university’s new Interdisciplinary Engineering Building as an act of “domestic terrorism.” The Democratic first-term governor stopped short of using that phrase.
“I don’t know exactly what that definition is, but this is obviously a serious situation,” said Ferguson, the former three-term state attorney general.
Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return UW, or SUPER UW, occupied the engineering building Monday night to call on the school to cut ties with Boeing over its supplying of weapons systems to Israel. They also looked to rename the building after a 19-year-old Palestinian man killed last year in the Israeli bombing of a hospital in the Gaza Strip.
They set dumpsters on fire and blocked nearby streets to prevent firefighters’ access and vandalized equipment inside, according to the university. Damage to equipment in one room was estimated at $1 million, university spokesperson Victor Balta said.
In total, police arrested 31 demonstrators on suspicion of criminal trespassing, a gross misdemeanor, said Casey McNerthney, a spokesperson for the King County prosecutor’s office. All have since been released, either after posting bond or based on a judge’s order. No felony cases from the incident have been referred to the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, McNerthney said.
Balta said Wednesday that the university had suspended 21 students who were arrested and banned them from campus facilities. Non-students who participated in the protest will also be banned from UW campuses.
“This was no peaceful protest in support of Palestinian rights or against the war in Gaza,” university President Ana Mari Cauce wrote in a statement. “I condemn this dangerous, violent and illegal building occupation and related vandalism.”
Ferguson said he thought Cauce’s statement was appropriate.
In a blog post explaining the occupation, SUPER UW called the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel a “heroic victory.” The attack left about 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, dead, and around 250 people were taken hostage. Since then, Israel has battled Hamas in the Gaza Strip, with tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in the fighting.
Ferguson called the group’s rhetoric about the Oct. 7 attack “outrageous” and said a response to it was “hard to put into words.”
The governor also said he appreciated the “quick” and “decisive” response from law enforcement Monday night, so no one got hurt. 
In a statement, Ferguson’s successor as attorney general, Nick Brown, said his office was closely monitoring the “disturbing events.”
“I am thankful that those responsible were arrested and, if found guilty, should be held accountable,” he continued. “I fully and always support people’s right to protest and to express their views. Indeed, it is foundational to our democracy. But everyone has a right to be safe on campus and UW must enforce the law.”
Late Tuesday, the Trump administration opened an investigation into antisemitism at the UW because of the protest. Federal officials called on university leaders to do more to protect Jewish students and prevent future events like this. 
“No institution that tolerates violence, harassment, or the open intimidation of Jewish students should expect to receive billions in taxpayer support,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement. “This isn’t about politics — it’s about whether a federally funded university is upholding the law, protecting civil rights, and fostering a safe environment for all students.”
Columbia and Harvard universities have faced similar probes. In March, the UW and dozens of other colleges across the country received letters from the Trump administration warning of “potential enforcement actions” based on alleged antisemitic harassment on campus. This followed a national wave of university protests last year over Israel’s conduct in the war in Gaza, including an encampment on the University of Washington’s Seattle campus.
Ferguson said he hadn’t heard about the latest inquiry but wasn’t surprised.
“Look, the federal government is investigating just about everybody these days,” he said. “So it’s not especially unusual.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/university-of-washington-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 22:02:25.709008

(Pool photo by Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune)After nearly 40 years on death row, a judge will soon determine whether Ralph Menzies’ dementia is advanced enough to spare him from being executed by firing squad. 
Lawyers for the 67-year-old convicted murderer say his brain is so damaged he can’t form a “rational understanding” of why the state is pursuing the death penalty — prosecutors for the Utah Attorney General’s Office say while Menzies might be impaired, he is still “clearly competent.”  
Attorneys for both sides met at the 3rd District Courthouse in West Jordan on Wednesday to make their final oral arguments before Judge Matthew Bates, who will issue a ruling sometime in the next 60 days. It marked what is likely one of the final hearings to determine whether Menzies is competent enough to face execution, the end of a monthslong process that included testimony from numerous medical experts and the victim’s family.  
The competency hearing began in November, but due to scheduling and logistical conflicts, final oral arguments were pushed to May 7.

Menzies was brought into the West Jordan courtroom at about 2 p.m. Wednesday. The death row inmate sat in a wheelchair with oxygen tubes running up his nose during the hearing, sporting a scruffy, somewhat unkempt white beard and short, receding brownish-grey hair. He would occasionally lean over to speak with members of his legal team, but otherwise sat in silence during the roughly hour-long hearing. 
Menzies was sentenced to death in 1988 after he kidnapped and murdered Maurine Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk. Menzies took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon, where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
In recent years, Menzies’ health has deteriorated, his attorneys say. After falling several times in prison, he was diagnosed with vascular dementia, where the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function. An MRI exam showed Menzies’ brain tissue is deteriorating, and his balance is fraught, causing him to fall several times each month.
Utah’s medical experts say Ralph Menzies is competent to be executed. His attorneys disagree

According to his attorneys, Menzies is so impaired by his dementia that he does not have a “rational understanding” of why he is facing execution, meaning he can’t make the link between his crime and the punishment. That means society’s goal of retribution and deterrence — the foundational goals of the death penalty — aren’t being fulfilled, they say. 
Per Utah code, and U.S. Supreme Court case law, that means he should be deemed too incompetent to face an execution, his lawyers say.
On Wednesday, Menzies’ attorney Lindsey Layer pointed to MRI results that showed the death row inmate had “the highest level” of brain damage, with parts of it atrophied and filled with fluid. 
There are also the physical signs, backed by the medical experts hired by Menzies’ attorneys who found him to be incompetent. He struggles with basic activities, Layer said, like forgetting to bathe, flush the toilet or renew medication, and often has issues with his personal finances and the prison commissary (a store for inmates).  
“His inability to engage in what is a fairly simple process of renewing his medication,” said Layer, “demonstrates his inability to engage in that analytical thought that is necessary to have a rational understanding of the state’s reasoning for his execution.” 
That rational understanding was at the heart of Layer’s argument, and she repeatedly underscored the difference between awareness and understanding. 
“Mr. Menzies can understand the concrete things,” Layer said. “He can understand, ‘I was sentenced to death and the state is going to kill me.’ But what he can’t understand is the how or why.” 
Daniel Boyer with the Utah Attorney General’s Office pushed back on the standard of competency outlined by Layer, telling the judge Menzies simply needs to understand why the state is pursuing his execution. 
If the court agrees with that standard, Boyer said, “he’s clearly competent.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Boyer encouraged Bates to listen to recordings of Menzies’ recent phone conversations, which show “his ability to converse, to problem solve” — and Menzies’ use of his prison-issued tablet. 
“I think the tablet is a good indicator of his competency,” Boyer said, noting that he can buy items from the commissary, check his finances, and access prison rules and policies. “This showed an extraordinarily high level of functioning.” 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, gave his first statement to the court since the competency hearing began last year. In the decades since his mother’s murder, he’s attended hearing after hearing, read countless rulings and court orders, and advocated nonstop for Menzies’ execution. 
It’s the end of the road for Hunsaker. If Bates finds Menzies incompetent to be executed, he won’t protest the ruling. 
“I don’t envy you for the decision you have to make,” Hunsaker told Bates. “I just want to put it out there — this man took my mom from a gas station where she was trying to support her family.” 
Speaking to reporters outside of the courtroom, Hunsaker repeated a familiar sentiment — he’s tired of this. 
“It’s taken a toll on the whole family. There is some closure possibly ahead, but 39 years, two months, nine days, that’s a long time,” he said. “I’ve got a grandbaby now, it’s time to shift the focus of wasting time on this, and bring a new little girl into the family.” 
Hunsaker didn’t want to speculate on how Bates will rule, telling Utah News Dispatch “there’s good arguments on both sides.” 
“My personal opinion is he’s competent. He knows what he did. It’s time to stop with the games. He needs to be executed. And again, I believe this is just a delay tactic,” he said. 
Second South Carolina death row inmate chooses to die by firing squad

Bates, while asking several questions during both Menzies’ and the state’s arguments, offered no indication of how he would rule. He concluded Wednesday’s hearing telling attorneys that he’ll issue a ruling in the next 60 days. 
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection and firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.
Firing squads are rare in the U.S. But earlier this year, South Carolina executed two inmates by firing squad — Brad Sigmon and Mikal Mahdi — making it the first state other than Utah to utilize the method in the last several decades. According to the Associated Press, at least 144 civilian prisoners have been executed by firing squad in the U.S. since 1608, almost all of them in Utah.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IPCPHZOUYVBRHE6QPFGMSDN2LU-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 21:03:19.422805

About a dozen law enforcement officials joined against the legislation as it awaits full legislative debate. May 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers escalated his opposition to legislative efforts to help implement medical cannabis Wednesday, parading out more than a dozen law enforcement officers who support his stance.
At a Wednesday news conference, Hilgers blasted Legislative Bill 677, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, asserting that the effort to build a regulatory framework around voter-approved medical cannabis is nothing more than a path to recreational marijuana that he argued would “supercharge the black market.” 
As he has already said this year, he urged lawmakers to wait until at least January, as he continues challenging in court the laws that voters approved last fall.
“This is not about the will of the people,” Hilgers, joined by various sheriffs, said of LB 677. “This is going to make Nebraska less safe, more dangerous. It’s going to handcuff the good men and women here that are in front of you and all their colleagues around the state.”


Coming Friday
Families, advocates speak out on pending medical cannabis regulations.

Hansen, other lawmakers and supporters of the 2024 ballot measures have already indicated that they have no intention to wait. They argue that without LB 677, the voter-approved laws could become the “wild west” or prevent Nebraskans who need cannabis the most from accessing it.
The voter-approved laws allow up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a physician’s recommendation. In effect since December, the laws passed in November with 71% voter approval.
A new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission is set to write new regulations around the laws, part of a companion ballot measure that passed with about 68% approval.
‘Our fight remains’
Hansen told reporters after Hilgers’ news conference that LB 677 being recreational “couldn’t be farther from the truth” and that “turning a blind eye” to the ballot measure would hurt voters.
“That would be like saying we’re providing recreational opiates or recreational fentanyl,” Hansen said. “We don’t do any of that.”

Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said there was “no greater hypocrisy” than Hilgers’ telling the Legislature to respect the will of the voters “after actively working to undermine it at the ballot box, in the courts and within the Legislature itself.”
Eggers, who led the 2024 ballot measure, the third campaign for the group, said Hilgers’ actions were primary reasons why medicinal cannabis continue to be out of reach for many.
“Our fight remains as it always has: as a voice for Nebraska patients — real people in our communities who are suffering,” Eggers said in a statement. “As long as patients like Will, Brooke, Jayen, Kyler, Colton, and countless others are suffering, you have our unwavering commitment: We will never stop fighting.”
Regulations remain in limbo
Hansen and State Sens. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and John Cavanaugh of Omaha, chair and vice chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, hosted three town halls this weekend, in La Vista, Omaha and Lincoln, receiving feedback on LB 677 and a new amendment.
It was that new amendment, AM 1251, that got LB 677 out of committee in a 5-3 vote last week after earlier stalling in committee.
The 124-page amendment makes various changes to the laws but is intended to put in place various regulations and safeguards around the new Medical Cannabis Commission. An attorney for the commission has said in court filings that, without the follow-up legislation, commissioners have “no ability to carry out any duties” set forth in the new laws.
As of late March, no meetings. No deliberations. No votes. No employees. No regulations.

LB 677, with the amendment, would move the process forward, giving the commission more time to act, through Oct. 1 rather than July 1, but also more guardrails.
As it stands, the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission within the executive branch and its five governor-appointed members would get full rein over regulations, which could set up a system more restrictive than LB 677 or its amendment.
Hilgers, whose office is defending other state officials in that same lower-court case against the voter-approved laws, said of the commission’s position: “We think they’re wrong.”
“If they’re taking that position, then they’re contrary to the law and to the will of the people,” Hilgers said.
However, those comments came as Hilgers and his staff await the commission’s regulations and the eventual licensure of medical dispensaries. When that happens, Hilgers’ office has threatened to bring a new lawsuit.
Core criticisms
Among Hilgers’ main concerns is that LB 677 would restrict the sale of cannabis flower, up to 2 ounces, a “gigantic loophole” he said would open the door to smoking. While LB 677 prohibits smoking, he said allowing flower “is like saying you can buy the beer, you can bring the beer home, you can put the beer in your refrigerator, but whatever you do, just don’t drink the beer.”
The ballot measure legalized 5 ounces of cannabis “for all parts” of the cannabis plant, including flower, which can be ground into joints or blunts. It can also be processed to be used in vaporizers, edibles, tinctures, creams and more, which would be allowed under LB 677.

Hilgers also criticized that in a list of 15 qualifying conditions in LB 677’s amendment, the proposal would allow medical cannabis for certain serious medical conditions or chronic pain, which he said would blow the list “wide open.” The list was created a few years ago with the Nebraska Medical Association. The list does not currently include post-traumatic stress disorder.
The ballot measure legalized cannabis for all conditions with a practitioner’s recommendation.
Also on the list of criticisms is that LB 677’s amendment would not allow anyone to go after medical practitioners for recommending cannabis, and there would be little process to take away a patient or caregiver’s practitioner-approved card, also a new system in LB 677.
Hilgers said his office plays an “enormously critical role” in ensuring health professionals follow their license. However, he said if a health care practitioner recommends cannabis to a pregnant woman, whose pregnancy ends in miscarriage or fetal development disability, or someone with a history of mental health challenges commits suicide or murder, the state needs leeway to act.
Asked by a reporter whether disciplinary action would be on a case-by-case basis, Hilgers said sometimes yes, but he acknowledged that all physicians who recommend cannabis could be at risk, which comes as the state continues to face health care staffing shortages.
He said it’s an “ethical violation” to encourage patients to break federal law.
“All health licensure is at risk of revocation, except in this case, if this bill were passed,” Hilgers said.
Hilgers, while telling reporters he didn’t want to speculate, talked about hypothetical scenarios in which patients or caregivers could start to accumulate “pounds” of cannabis and sell it to friends or neighbors. No matter LB 677 or the ballot measure, that would be illegal.

Hilgers rejected a reporter’s question that he was “punishing” anyone or using supposed bad actors to argue against medicinal cannabis generally.
Hansen and Cavanaugh have said that preventing the “black market” starts with reasonable regulations. That includes seed-to-sale tracking and using the state’s prescription drug monitoring program, used for drugs such as opiates or fentanyl, Hansen said.
Opposition largely with ballot measure
LB 677 and its amendment would be able to identify issues in Nebraska’s program within “about two seconds,” Hansen said, while providing new resources and guidance to law enforcement.
Cavanaugh, a lawyer, noted that nearly all of Hilgers’ criticisms were of the ballot measure, not LB 677.
More than 300 people attended the weekend events, Cavanaugh estimated, and 97 speakers (some repeats across the three events) spoke to a bipartisan group of 13 senators. 
Cavanaugh said it is “disingenuous” to organize opposition at this “late hour” but not work with Hansen or the General Affairs Committee beforehand. Now, Cavanaugh said Hilgers’ goal is to stop the legislation from passing at all.
“He’s losing in the courts and trying to win in the Legislature,” Cavanaugh said.
Hilgers also sent a letter to Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who could schedule LB 677 for debate later this month after the state budget passes. Hilgers served as speaker before becoming attorney general two years ago.

Arch confirmed he had read the letter and said it would have no effect on scheduling LB 677 for debate.
At the news conference, Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner said LB 677 was “purely” recreational marijuana “masked” as medicinal. Sarpy County Sheriff Greg London said it was a “red herring to get into full-fledged recreational marijuana.”
Joining the letter were Sheriffs Neil Miller (Buffalo), Colin Caudill (Otoe), Robert Sorenson (Cass), Dwaine Ladwig (Polk), Shawn Messerlie (Colfax), London (Sarpy), Tom Decker (Dixon), Mark Overman (Scotts Bluff), Aaron Hanson (Douglas), Mike Vance (Seward), Lynn Lyon (Johnson), Mike Robinson (Washington), Wagner (Lancaster), Paul Vrbka (York) and Brent Lottman (Nemaha).
Vrbka also signed on behalf of the Nebraska Sheriffs Association as president, as did Police Chief Kenny Denny on behalf of the Police Chief Association of Nebraska.
Gov. Jim Pillen, speaking with the Nebraska Examiner last week, declined to comment on LB 677 other than to say cannabis wouldn’t be approved in a form that could become recreational.
“My advocacy for it is that if you have a medical condition [and] you need it, you’ll get it, but it’s going to taste like crap,” Pillen said. “It’s going to be a bitter pill to swallow.”
‘Think with the heart’
If lawmakers do not act, Hansen has said Hilgers’ actions could inadvertently lead to recreational marijuana in a different ballot measure.
At the public forums this weekend, Hansen discussed that lawmakers might not be able to get at the “full apple” but would work to get 75%, 80%, and expand legislation in the future. He asked those in attendance Sunday if they would support recreational marijuana on the ballot if LB 677 failed and medicinal marijuana remained out of reach.
Of dozens of people in attendance, nearly every single one raised their hands.
Hansen has asked Nebraskans to share their stories, particularly with his Republican colleagues, to help LB 677. He estimated it could be scheduled for debate shortly after the state budget is passed, which must be done by May 15. The Legislature is set to adjourn June 9.
“We’re so kind of caught up sometimes in the minutia of this bill and the taxing and the regulation, which is good, but we sometimes forget about the people actually going to use this,” Hansen told reporters. “We need to think with the heart a little bit here as well as our head.”



Nebraska Attorney General Hilgers discusses future, stance on medicinal cannabis
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, in a one-on-one interview with the Nebraska Examiner on Wednesday, said he recognizes that voters are angry with him over his continued opposition to medical cannabis, including in the courts and at the Legislature.
Hilgers said he recognizes separation of powers between the branches of government but views himself as the state’s voice for law enforcement officers and said it’s his duty to speak up.
“I’m a big boy. It doesn’t bother me,” Hilgers said of opponents. “I’ve gone through the wars. What people way to say they want to say.”
While some view his actions as “just political,” Hilgers said, if that’s true, “it’s not a very good political decision” because 70% of voters legalized medical cannabis. He said most politicians base “political decisions” on the winning side of 70-30 issues, but “that is not what I ran on.”
“I could not go to my grave looking backward at the work that I did, whether it’s in the Legislature or here, and having that kind of a consideration for me not to do the right thing,” said Hilgers, a former six-year member of the Legislature. “And in this case, I think it’s the right thing.”

Dozens of other states have legalized medical cannabis, which Hilgers said is part of the reason voters are frustrated. He said it’s an “abject failure” of the feds to not follow the law they created.
“I think two plus two is four even if everyone else says two plus two is five,” Hilgers said.
Hilgers said his “heart goes out” to anyone in pain who feels they can’t access something that they feel could alleviate the hurt. 
But he also asked “what about” those whose lives have been “ravaged” by drug use or Nebraskans harmed by marijuana-like products, including a wife who had to call law enforcement on her husband who “lost his mind” and a man in a southwest Omaha neighborhood this week who ran around without any clothes saying he was going to kill people.
Hilgers said he is also working to uphold the “integrity” of the ballot measure process with his work, referencing his office’s efforts to decertify the medical cannabis ballot measures last year alleging widespread fraud.
Those legal arguments were rejected in Lancaster County District Court last, and Hilgers is appealing to the Nebraska Supreme Court. Of four targeted campaign notaries in that case, Hilgers confirmed none have been charged or convicted. Campaign officials have denied wrongdoing.
“People might be upset today. They might be upset in 10 years,” Hilgers said. “But at the end of the day, it’s a principle that matters for all of us, and that’s what I’m defending.”

On Sunday, a 47-year-old Cape Coral, Florida, man sustained minor injuries that required treatment from emergency medical personnel.
Yellowstone National Park officials issued a press release Wednesday saying the man was gored after he got too close to a bison in the Lake Village area of Yellowstone National Park.
Park officials did not release the man’s name, and said the situation remains under investigation as of Wednesday.
“Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal,” Yellowstone National Park officials wrote in the press release. “They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.”
Under Yellowstone National Park rules, visitors are required to stay more than 25 yards away from all large animals, including bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose and coyotes. For bears and wolves specifically, people must stay at least 100 yards away, park officials wrote.
“Wildlife in Yellowstone are wild and can be dangerous,” Yellowstone officials wrote. “Wild animals can be aggressive if people don’t respect their space.”
Sunday’s goring was the first bison-related injury of 2025, Yellowstone officials wrote.
Yellowstone National Park officials have published a series of online safety tips related to safely viewing wildlife from a distance in the park.

Grand Teton National Park, bear watchers still call on drivers to slow down and be vigilant for wildlife along roads. 
The post Speed unknown factor in death of Grizzly 1058, one of 399’s offspring appeared first on WyoFile .","A grizzly death attributed to a fatal vehicle strike has triggered an outpouring of rage on social media about people driving too fast, but law enforcement could not determine whether speed was a factor in the collision. 
The bear that died, Grizzly 1058, is one of the famous “quads” of their even more famous mom, Grizzly 399, who died last year after being fatally struck by a vehicle on a highway south of Jackson. 
In the death of Grizzly 399, authorities ruled that the driver was not speeding. 
As for Grizzly 1058, “law enforcement rangers were not able to determine if speed was a factor” in the collision, Grand Teton National Park spokeswoman Emily Davis said in an email Wednesday.
Nonetheless, park officials asked people to slow down and be vigilant for wildlife in a Tuesday news release confirming the bear’s death. 
While reducing speeds can help protect wildlife along Wyoming highways, it’s not the only factor setting the stage for fatal collisions. 
“It’s terribly unfortunate that this happened,” said Brian DeBolt, large carnivore conflict coordinator with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “But it’s becoming all too common with these bears that spend so much time roadside.”
The more time bears hang out near roads, the higher the probability that they’re going to be struck and killed by a vehicle, DeBolt said. Game and Fish is finding that younger bears, like the 5-year-old subadult found Tuesday, are being forced to make a living in more marginal habitat along roadsides because more prime habitat is already occupied. 
What park officials have confirmed so far is that Grizzly 1058 had been spotted in the park since he and his three siblings split from their mom in 2022. But there were no confirmed sightings of him this spring, the park release said. 
Park law enforcement found the bear’s remains Tuesday in a patch of willows about 125 yards from the highway, within park boundaries east of the Buffalo Fork River. The Jackson Hole News&Guide reported that a law enforcement ranger found the dead bear after spotting ravens and eagles scavenging along the highway and stopping to investigate. The park bear biologist told the News&Guide the animal had likely been there for several days.
The park relied on ear tags and a “PIT” tag to identify the 5-year-old bear, which the park release said “appeared to be in good condition for his age and the time of year.”
More to it than speed
The outer park highway sees more diverse traffic — including commuters and semis — and higher speed limits than the inner park road. Just up the highway on Togwotee Pass, where vehicles have struck roadside grizzlies, wildlife managers and law enforcement have struggled to manage traffic jams created by bear watchers. 
As more bears live roadside, and get habituated to people, the more risk of collisions, DeBolt said Wednesday. “We don’t want bears to be so comfortable roadside,” he added.

The speed limit on Togwotee Pass is 55 miles per hour, but once drivers cross into Grand Teton National Park, there is a nighttime speed limit of 45 mph on that same highway. Safety concerns along that highway, where it crosses through the Bridger-Teton National Forest, prompted one retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent to propose a “grizzly speed limit,” using variable speed limits similar to how the state handles blizzards on the interstate.  
“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know, when the bears are around the highway,” said Steve Stoinski, a retired Fish and Wildlife Service agent who spent a summer managing bear traffic jams on Togwotee Pass. 
But that speed limit would only work with regular enforcement, Stoinski told WyoFile. 
DeBolt said he’d be open to reducing speed limits if it would reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and was reasonable and logistically possible. But setting speed limits is not Game and Fish’s call to make. DeBolt also sees larger factors at play. 
“Although it seems like maybe a simple fix,” DeBolt said. “It’s not that simple.” 
Inside Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks where reduced speed limits are enforced, wildlife still die in vehicle strikes, DeBolt said.

Grizzly 399 offspring eschewed good habitat before being killed 



“We need to look at what we can do to promote the safety of bears long-term,” DeBolt said. “From an agency standpoint, we’re trying to discourage them from even living roadside.”
That’s one reason Game and Fish has joined forces with multiple federal, state and local partners to proactively manage bear jams on Togwotee Pass, he said. 
Park law enforcement and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are investigating this latest death. Grizzlies are federally protected as a threatened species.

Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia) speaks at a news conference Wednesday, May 7, 2025, after the state House passed the recreational cannabis legalization bill he and Health Committee Chairperson Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny) cosponsored. (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)Democrats in the state House voted Wednesday to legalize recreational use of marijuana by adults, with sales through state-owned stores. That sends the question of whether Pennsylvania will follow its neighbors’ leads on cannabis to the Republican-led state Senate. 
The bill passed the House on a 102-101 party-line vote after 2½ hours of debate.
Supporters of House Bill 1200, sponsored by Rep. Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia), said it would create a market for safe, tested and regulated cannabis products for consumers who are currently buying them legally in neighboring states, from street dealers and “quasi-legal” vape shops.
“Prohibition of marijuana has not worked … The status quo is unacceptable,” House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) said.
Republicans said they oppose the expansion of access to a drug that can have serious health and life consequences for young people when the commonwealth is already grappling with an addiction and overdose crisis. 
Rep. Craig Williams (R-Delaware) gave an emotional account of his younger brother’s struggle with addiction that began when he started smoking pot in high school, led to his use of harder drugs and ended with his death of an overdose in his early 30s.
Some were also critical of the bill’s restorative justice aspects, saying government sales would limit opportunities for those most harmed by a century of criminalization. Rep. Tim Bonner (R-Mercer) suggested the bill’s requirement for courts to vacate and expunge marijuana convictions is unconstitutional. 
Though in a press conference following the bill’s passage, Rep. Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny), who penned the bill with Krajewski, said they had consulted with lawyers who previously worked on the state’s clean slate initiative, and none raised issues about the constitutionality of their expungement policy.
Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said the bill was rushed through the legislative process.
“A lot of the debate has centered around the idea of legalizing marijuana, the concept, but in this chamber, on this floor, we don’t vote on ideas. We don’t vote on concepts. We vote on bills to become law,” Topper said, adding that the depth of the debate shows the bill is not ready to become law.
The 173-page bill was introduced on Sunday, put through committee on Monday, and received its final vote Wednesday.
Frankel, however, said the bill was the product of months of open discussions, including five meetings of a bipartisan House subcommittee on cannabis that explored issues related to legalization.
Frankel and Krajewski also made it known they were working on a recreational cannabis bill that would involve sale at state stores last December. And Frankel said Wednesday that, when writing the bill, they tried to incorporate concerns raised by Republicans in committee.
“This has not been in secret,” he said. “This has been a collaborative process.”
Pennsylvania first made it legal for residents to buy and consume cannabis for medical use in 2016. Marijuana can be prescribed for 24 medical conditions and in 2024 more than 300,000 people had been approved to use it for anxiety disorders alone, according to the state Department of Health. 
Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has included a plan to legalize and tax the sale and use of recreational marijuana in his last two budget proposals. His current proposal estimates that a 20% tax on the wholesale price of recreational marijuana products would generate $15.6 million plus an additional $11.4 million in sales tax revenue for the 2025-26 budget. 
HB 1200 proposes a 12% tax on cannabis products plus 6% sales tax. A fiscal note prepared with the bill estimates tax, license fees and profits under the system would provide more than $1.1 billion in 2026-2027. It would allow people 21 and older to purchase and consume a personal amount of marijuana, allow people who pay for a permit to grow up to four plants and provides for fines for underage use.
The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which regulates alcoholic beverages and operates state wine and spirits stores, would be responsible for purchasing cannabis products and operating cannabis stores. 
Bonner, an attorney, said the bill’s requirement to forgive and erase criminal convictions and records for marijuana offenses would run afoul of a 1977 state Supreme Court decision. It found the General Assembly had violated the state constitution’s separation of powers clause by ordering the resentencing of people convicted of a felony marijuana offense when the legislature reduced it to a misdemeanor. 
“As legislators, we are highly critical of the courts any time they exercise legislative powers, and I can tell you that the courts will be highly critical of House Bill 1200,” Bonner said. He moved unsuccessfully to find the bill unconstitutional.
Krajewski,  who oversaw the cannabis subcommittee hearings, said he believes the bill creates a balanced, responsible, framework.
“We have the opportunity to rein in a market that is completely deregulated in terms of potency, content, labeling or advertising,” he said. “We can promote public health while also bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars that can be directed to communities hit the hardest by past criminalization.” 
And while Pennsylvania is behind neighboring Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Ohio, it also has the benefit of learning from their mistakes. That, Krajewski said, is why the bill proposes a state-run dispensary system rather than an expansion of the medical marijuana industry. 
Massive multi-state cannabis companies have leveraged footholds in the medical marijuana business to control emerging recreational use markets, blocking opportunities for small entrepreneurs to compete, he said.
“Without proper controls in place, we risk turning Pennsylvania into the new playground for corporate cannabis,” Krajewski said.
But Rep. Abby Major (R-Armstrong) argued that establishing a state-run cannabis system would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in upfront costs before a dollar of revenue is generated.
“Rather than leveraging the infrastructure we’ve already built in the medical market — nearly 30,000 jobs, over 450,000 active patients, and nearly $2 billion in annual sales — we’re choosing to start from scratch, to erase the progress of the past eight years,” Major said.
‘Dead on arrival’
At a press conference following the bill’s passage, House Democrats celebrated their victory. But they also made clear the ball was now in Senate Republicans’ court, and that the bill may have to undergo substantial changes in order to garner the necessary support to pass the GOP-controlled chamber.
“If the Senate is serious about cannabis legislation, we now have the vehicle which we can have negotiations about,” Krajewski said.  “We want to have legalized cannabis in Pennsylvania. We’ve gotten a bill out of the House that we believe in and that we believe represents our Democratic values. We know this is a process between getting through the House, the Senate and the governor.”
Frankel added, at this point, there have not been many conversations with Senate Republicans.
And some Senate Republicans were quick to throw cold water on the idea that a state store model could pass the chamber they control with a 27-23 majority.
“Placing the sale of marijuana within our existing state liquor store system takes a step back and props up an antiquated system,” said Sen. Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana). “It’s hard to believe the House spent so much time this week on a serious issue and ultimately sent us an unserious bill. With House Democrats’ failure to obtain bi-partisan support for the bill in their chamber, it’s clear advancing marijuana legalization in this manner was a performative exercise.”
Pittman has historically been hesitant to offer full-throated support or opposition for any legislation legalizing recreational cannabis, and it’s unclear if any could garner support from Senate Republicans.
But even the most vocal proponent of legalization within the caucus, Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie), referred to Krajewski and Frankel’s bill as ‘dead on arrival.’
“I have repeatedly made it clear there is zero chance that the state store model will make it through the Senate,” Laughlin said on social media following the House vote. “That idea is DOA.”
Laughlin has previously introduced legalization bills with Philadelphia Democrat, Sen. Sharif Street, who commended the House for passing their bill, but also expressed skepticism it could pass the upper chamber in its current form.
“I remain strongly opposed to selling cannabis through state-run stores or placing it under the Liquor Control Board,” Street wrote in a Facebook Post Wednesday evening. “But this vote is a significant step forward. I applaud House members who worked hard to advance the conversation and move us closer to justice, equity and economic opportunity.”
The cannabis lobby has also opposed the state store model since it was discussed in committee meetings last year. 
“A bill passing out of the House today is an important first step to set the stage for more meaningful, bipartisan discussions — bringing in the Senate and the Governor as part of ongoing budget negotiations,” the Responsible PA coalition said in a statement following the vote. “We must fix this bill as we know a majority of Pennsylvanians oppose a state-run cannabis retail model. Voters want a practical solution — not a bill that is going to face legal challenges and cost thousands of jobs for everyday, hardworking Pennsylvanians.”
Responsible PA’s coalition includes both local businesses like medical dispensaries, and some of the nation’s largest multi-state cannabis companies. Since Frankel and Krajewski began seriously advocating for a state store model as early as last legislative session, Responsible PA has opposed it. 
The group has conducted polling, which found that, while a majority of Pennsylvanians support legal cannabis, most oppose a state store model. And the Pennsylvania Cannabis Coalition, a trade group comprising both existing Pennsylvania medical dispensaries and national cannabis companies, hired a law firm to examine the legality of asking state store employees to sell cannabis, which is still illegal under federal law.
The firm, Kleinbard LLC, found that a bill like Krajewski and Frankel’s, would likely be illegal.
But proponents of the state store model, including Frankel and Krajewski, say that it can keep more revenue with the state, allow tighter control of the market, and be used to combat industry influence and monopolistic practices.
“In Pennsylvania, 10 out-of-state corporations with a combined valuation of more than $6 billion control more than 70% of our current medical dispensaries,” Krajewski said at a press conference. 
Krajewski pointed to a trend in states with equity-based cannabis laws where dispensary licenses intended for disadvantaged small business owners wind up controlled by large companies. He added that a state-owned store could also ensure shelf space for locally-made products, instead of ones produced by vertically integrated companies that both manufacture and sell them. 
He also pushed back on the idea that a state-store model would bar entrepreneurs from entering the industry.

Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia) speaks at a news conference Wednesday, May 7, 2025, after the state House passed the recreational cannabis legalization bill he and Health Committee Chairperson Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny) cosponsored.Democrats in the state House voted Wednesday to legalize recreational use of marijuana by adults, with sales through state-owned stores. That sends the question of whether Pennsylvania will follow its neighbors’ leads on cannabis to the Republican-led state Senate. 
The bill passed the House on a 102-101 party-line vote after 2½ hours of debate.
Supporters of House Bill 1200, sponsored by Rep. Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia), said it would create a market for safe, tested and regulated cannabis products for consumers who are currently buying them legally in neighboring states, from street dealers and “quasi-legal” vape shops.
“Prohibition of marijuana has not worked … The status quo is unacceptable,” House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) said.
Republicans said they oppose the expansion of access to a drug that can have serious health and life consequences for young people when the commonwealth is already grappling with an addiction and overdose crisis. 
Rep. Craig Williams (R-Delaware) gave an emotional account of his younger brother’s struggle with addiction that began when he started smoking pot in high school, led to his use of harder drugs and ended with his death of an overdose in his early 30s.
Some were also critical of the bill’s restorative justice aspects, saying government sales would limit opportunities for those most harmed by a century of criminalization. Rep. Tim Bonner (R-Mercer) suggested the bill’s requirement for courts to vacate and expunge marijuana convictions is unconstitutional. 
Though in a press conference following the bill’s passage, Rep. Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny), who penned the bill with Krajewski, said they had consulted with lawyers who previously worked on the state’s clean slate initiative, and none raised issues about the constitutionality of their expungement policy.
Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said the bill was rushed through the legislative process.
“A lot of the debate has centered around the idea of legalizing marijuana, the concept, but in this chamber, on this floor, we don’t vote on ideas. We don’t vote on concepts. We vote on bills to become law,” Topper said, adding that the depth of the debate shows the bill is not ready to become law.
The 173-page bill was introduced on Sunday, put through committee on Monday, and received its final vote Wednesday.
Frankel, however, said the bill was the product of months of open discussions, including five meetings of a bipartisan House subcommittee on cannabis that explored issues related to legalization.
Frankel and Krajewski also made it known they were working on a recreational cannabis bill that would involve sale at state stores last December. And Frankel said Wednesday that, when writing the bill, they tried to incorporate concerns raised by Republicans in committee.
“This has not been in secret,” he said. “This has been a collaborative process.”
Pennsylvania first made it legal for residents to buy and consume cannabis for medical use in 2016. Marijuana can be prescribed for 24 medical conditions and in 2024 more than 300,000 people had been approved to use it for anxiety disorders alone, according to the state Department of Health. 
Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has included a plan to legalize and tax the sale and use of recreational marijuana in his last two budget proposals. His current proposal estimates that a 20% tax on the wholesale price of recreational marijuana products would generate $15.6 million plus an additional $11.4 million in sales tax revenue for the 2025-26 budget. 
HB 1200 proposes a 12% tax on cannabis products plus 6% sales tax. A fiscal note prepared with the bill estimates tax, license fees and profits under the system would provide more than $1.1 billion in 2026-2027. It would allow people 21 and older to purchase and consume a personal amount of marijuana, allow people who pay for a permit to grow up to four plants and provides for fines for underage use.
The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which regulates alcoholic beverages and operates state wine and spirits stores, would be responsible for purchasing cannabis products and operating cannabis stores. 
Bonner, an attorney, said the bill’s requirement to forgive and erase criminal convictions and records for marijuana offenses would run afoul of a 1977 state Supreme Court decision. It found the General Assembly had violated the state constitution’s separation of powers clause by ordering the resentencing of people convicted of a felony marijuana offense when the legislature reduced it to a misdemeanor. 
“As legislators, we are highly critical of the courts any time they exercise legislative powers, and I can tell you that the courts will be highly critical of House Bill 1200,” Bonner said. He moved unsuccessfully to find the bill unconstitutional.
Krajewski,  who oversaw the cannabis subcommittee hearings, said he believes the bill creates a balanced, responsible, framework.
“We have the opportunity to rein in a market that is completely deregulated in terms of potency, content, labeling or advertising,” he said. “We can promote public health while also bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars that can be directed to communities hit the hardest by past criminalization.” 
And while Pennsylvania is behind neighboring Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Ohio, it also has the benefit of learning from their mistakes. That, Krajewski said, is why the bill proposes a state-run dispensary system rather than an expansion of the medical marijuana industry. 
Massive multi-state cannabis companies have leveraged footholds in the medical marijuana business to control emerging recreational use markets, blocking opportunities for small entrepreneurs to compete, he said.
“Without proper controls in place, we risk turning Pennsylvania into the new playground for corporate cannabis,” Krajewski said.
But Rep. Abby Major (R-Armstrong) argued that establishing a state-run cannabis system would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in upfront costs before a dollar of revenue is generated.
“Rather than leveraging the infrastructure we’ve already built in the medical market — nearly 30,000 jobs, over 450,000 active patients, and nearly $2 billion in annual sales — we’re choosing to start from scratch, to erase the progress of the past eight years,” Major said.
‘Dead on arrival’
At a press conference following the bill’s passage, House Democrats celebrated their victory. But they also made clear the ball was now in Senate Republicans’ court, and that the bill may have to undergo substantial changes in order to garner the necessary support to pass the GOP-controlled chamber.
“If the Senate is serious about cannabis legislation, we now have the vehicle which we can have negotiations about,” Krajewski said.  “We want to have legalized cannabis in Pennsylvania. We’ve gotten a bill out of the House that we believe in and that we believe represents our Democratic values. We know this is a process between getting through the House, the Senate and the governor.”
Frankel added, at this point, there have not been many conversations with Senate Republicans.
And some Senate Republicans were quick to throw cold water on the idea that a state store model could pass the chamber they control with a 27-23 majority.
“Placing the sale of marijuana within our existing state liquor store system takes a step back and props up an antiquated system,” said Sen. Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana). “It’s hard to believe the House spent so much time this week on a serious issue and ultimately sent us an unserious bill. With House Democrats’ failure to obtain bi-partisan support for the bill in their chamber, it’s clear advancing marijuana legalization in this manner was a performative exercise.”
Pittman has historically been hesitant to offer full-throated support or opposition for any legislation legalizing recreational cannabis, and it’s unclear if any could garner support from Senate Republicans.
But even the most vocal proponent of legalization within the caucus, Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie), referred to Krajewski and Frankel’s bill as ‘dead on arrival.’
“I have repeatedly made it clear there is zero chance that the state store model will make it through the Senate,” Laughlin said on social media following the House vote. “That idea is DOA.”
Laughlin has previously introduced legalization bills with Philadelphia Democrat, Sen. Sharif Street, who commended the House for passing their bill, but also expressed skepticism it could pass the upper chamber in its current form.
“I remain strongly opposed to selling cannabis through state-run stores or placing it under the Liquor Control Board,” Street wrote in a Facebook Post Wednesday evening. “But this vote is a significant step forward. I applaud House members who worked hard to advance the conversation and move us closer to justice, equity and economic opportunity.”
The cannabis lobby has also opposed the state store model since it was discussed in committee meetings last year. 
“A bill passing out of the House today is an important first step to set the stage for more meaningful, bipartisan discussions — bringing in the Senate and the Governor as part of ongoing budget negotiations,” the Responsible PA coalition said in a statement following the vote. “We must fix this bill as we know a majority of Pennsylvanians oppose a state-run cannabis retail model. Voters want a practical solution — not a bill that is going to face legal challenges and cost thousands of jobs for everyday, hardworking Pennsylvanians.”
Responsible PA’s coalition includes both local businesses like medical dispensaries, and some of the nation’s largest multi-state cannabis companies. Since Frankel and Krajewski began seriously advocating for a state store model as early as last legislative session, Responsible PA has opposed it. 
The group has conducted polling, which found that, while a majority of Pennsylvanians support legal cannabis, most oppose a state store model. And the Pennsylvania Cannabis Coalition, a trade group comprising both existing Pennsylvania medical dispensaries and national cannabis companies, hired a law firm to examine the legality of asking state store employees to sell cannabis, which is still illegal under federal law.
The firm, Kleinbard LLC, found that a bill like Krajewski and Frankel’s, would likely be illegal.
But proponents of the state store model, including Frankel and Krajewski, say that it can keep more revenue with the state, allow tighter control of the market, and be used to combat industry influence and monopolistic practices.
“In Pennsylvania, 10 out-of-state corporations with a combined valuation of more than $6 billion control more than 70% of our current medical dispensaries,” Krajewski said at a press conference. 
Krajewski pointed to a trend in states with equity-based cannabis laws where dispensary licenses intended for disadvantaged small business owners wind up controlled by large companies. He added that a state-owned store could also ensure shelf space for locally-made products, instead of ones produced by vertically integrated companies that both manufacture and sell them. 
He also pushed back on the idea that a state-store model would bar entrepreneurs from entering the industry. The bill would still allow small business owners to obtain licenses to grow cannabis, manufacture THC products, or operate establishments where people can use cannabis in a social setting.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4539-scaled-e1746664284988-1024x613.jpg,,,2025-05-07 21:03:19.422805

He was out of the office Wednesday and unavailable for comment. A press release from the Trust said that he had been “offered” a job in Washington, D.C., and further information would be released later.
Lottery proceeds 
The Trust awards about $20 million a year in grants from state lottery proceeds to local and state environmental groups for things like recycling programs, renovating silted-in lakes and restoring natural prairies and wildlife habitat.
The agency has come under fire in recent years for rejecting too many grants as “ineligible,” which has led to a decline in applications for funds and fewer grants. The preliminary state budget calls for diverting some of the Trust’s excess funds — $15 million — for state surface water, groundwater and soil conservation projects.
Elmshaeuser was the legislative liaison with the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy prior to taking the Trust job.
He had previously served as head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program in Nebraska, and as a member of the Ogallala City Council. Elmshaeuser ran unsuccessfully for the Nebraska Legislature in 2016.
Time of turmoil
He took over the Trust at a time of turmoil, and led a “process improvement” effort spawned by two performance audits.
The Trust stirred controversy in February 2020 when the board voted to defund a handful of grants for conservation, habitat and wetland projects and instead give those funds to install ethanol blender pumps at service stations.
The swap prompted a lawsuit and the formation of a watchdog group called Friends of the Environmental Trust. Both efforts maintained that the Trust was straying from its original mission of helping projects that hadn’t previously found funding, and instead was financing work that should be paid for with state tax funds.
The request for the ethanol pump grant, which had drawn the support of Gov. Pete Ricketts, a staunch supporter of the corn-based fuel, was later withdrawn.
The Trust, in a press release, said that a national search will be conducted to replace Elmshaeuser, who was paid $120,852-a-year as of 2023.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The “inflammatory tactics” by an anti-abortion group demanding a near-total ban in South Carolina prompted most members of the Legislature’s Family Caucus to leave the group and rebuke its GOP leader.
A resignation letter Wednesday to Rep. John McCravy, the caucus’ leader, was co-signed by 29 of its 48 House members.
The mass departure came soon after McCravy, whose official caucus title is moderator, stood at the Statehouse with members of the activist group whose tactics included going to the churches of GOP leaders and putting fliers on windshields asking churchgoers to tell their fellow congregant “Act NOW. Don’t Let Any More Preborn Babies Die!”
At a news conference Wednesday, the next-to-last day of the 2025 legislation session, members of Students for Life Action showed reporters the two plastic spines they planned to deliver to House Speaker Murrell Smith and Judiciary Chairman Weston Newton, telling them to “grow a spine” and bring up McCravy’s bill for a vote.
The proposal, similar to previous bills McCravy has introduced that failed in the Senate, would ban nearly all abortions from the onset of pregnancy, with no exceptions for victims of rape or fatal fetal anomalies.
“Chief among our concerns is your continued refusal to condemn the deeply troubling behavior of out-of-state, third-party groups that have descended upon South Carolina churches to provoke and disrupt worship services,” reads the resignation letter to McCravy, provided to reporters. (Students for Life Action is a Virginia-based group with members in South Carolina.)
It comes a week after Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, confirmed he left the group he co-founded in 2017 with McCravy. Beyond differences in opinion over how to proceed with the abortion ban, Hiott accused McCravy of making homophobic and antisemitic comments about fellow legislators, which the Greenwood Republican vehemently denied.
Wednesday’s letter made no mention of those comments.

The Family Caucus, which McCravy called “the conscience of the Republican Party,” functions as a support group of sorts for socially conservative Christians interested in promoting issues that support children and families, Rep. Richie Yow, R-Chesterfield, told reporters.
That used to include members of the agenda-setting House Republican Caucus and the hardline Freedom Caucus, as well as a single Democrat. The archconservative Freedom Caucus didn’t join the mass resignation, instead jumping to McCravy’s defense.
McCravy has not left the majority Republican Caucus, and the Freedom Caucus has not asked him to join them, he told reporters Wednesday.
Abortion
Yow, a Baptist pastor, said what the activists did is not OK, no matter what the issue.
“Their harassment of churchgoers — on Palm Sunday, no less — crosses a moral line,” read the letter to McCravy. “Your silence as the moderator of this caucus, along with your continued support and engagement with the groups that employ those tactics, is unacceptable.”
Their fliers claimed Smith and Newton were holding up McCravy’s near-total abortion ban. The activist group also sent text messages and bought advertisements targeting the legislative leaders, a spokeswoman said.
If the group’s tactics were aggressive, they were justified to push for what they see as right, said Kristan Hawkins, the organization’s president.
“I think educating citizens in a House member’s district about what he’s really doing in Columbia is actually our job,” Hawkins told the SC Daily Gazette. “That’s our job as human rights activists.”
Members of House leadership, including Hiott, repeatedly asked McCravy to step in and ask the group to stop. McCravy refused, he said.
“I don’t think that’s appropriate,” McCravy told the Gazette. “I think that’s unethical.”
He declined to say whether he thought visiting representatives’ churches crossed a line.
“College students are going to be more enthusiastic than probably older people like me,” McCravy said. “I don’t want to dampen that enthusiasm.”
House leaders said they aren’t opposed to McCravy’s bill, which received three hours of testimony but no vote during a subcommittee meeting earlier this year. Smith and Hiott are co-sponsors with McCravy. Newton is not.
GOP leader calls on SC representatives to wait on near-total abortion ban

Previous attempts by the House to pass near-total abortion bans have failed repeatedly in the Senate, so leaders decided to avoid the lengthy debate until the legislation has a better chance in the upper chamber, Newton told the Gazette.
Plus, there are still lawsuits pending on South Carolina’s existing six-week ban, including a challenge before the state Supreme Court on whether the language in the law — which does not actually give a number of weeks — means the ban should start at nine weeks instead.
Amid the March 4 hearing on McCravy’s bill, Hiott put out a statement urging fellow representatives to press pause until the state Supreme Court rules.
But McCravy believes the House should have passed the bill anyway.
“If you give up just because you hear a rumor that somebody might not do something, you’re never going to win,” McCravy said Wednesday. “So, we don’t give up.”
The group’s tactics aren’t new, though they’re newly against House Republicans.
In 2023, members of Students For Life Action delivered smaller spines to the five female senators who helped defeat McCravy’s proposals of a near-total ban following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.
That delivery backfired, as the women took the Senate podium to proudly display proof of having a backbone and refused to back down. What ultimately became law in 2023, over the objections of the women who dubbed themselves Sister Senators, was a ban at six weeks, with exceptions for victims of rape or incest and fatal fetal anomalies. The three GOP female senators lost their re-election bids last year.
Hawkins, head of the activist group, said the larger spines for Smith and Newton were to help them “grow up a little bit.”
“These spineless, feckless attacks against John McCravy, against pro-life students in South Carolina — it’s beyond the pale,” Hawkins said Wednesday.

But Newton said the group hasn’t affected him one way or the other. The lobbying clearly didn’t cause him to bring up the bill in the session’s waning days. Nor has it made him less inclined to start the debate, he said. He told the Gazette he considers it more of a distraction from legislating.
Comments about other legislators
Hiott told The Post and Courier he resigned his membership partly over McCravy’s offensive comments about two fellow legislators. Hiott declined to comment further to the Gazette.
The alleged comments date back to last session, when Hiott claimed McCravy complained to him and other House leaders that Newton, a Bluffton Republican, appointed a “gay” and a “Jew” to serve as subcommittee chairs on the House Judiciary Committee. The comments could only be referring to then-Rep. Jason Elliott, the Legislature’s first — and still only — openly gay member of the Legislature and now a state senator; and Rep. Beth Bernstein, the state’s only Jewish legislator.
Newton told the Gazette that McCravy repeated his comments about Elliott directly to him, telling the chairman he “didn’t want to serve on a subcommittee with that gay.”
Elliott, R-Greenville, did not respond to requests for comment from the Gazette. Bernstein, D-Columbia, said she heard about the remarks secondhand several times.
McCravy said he has good relationships with both Bernstein and Elliott and wouldn’t disparage them in any way.
“I would never refuse to serve on a committee because of someone’s characteristics or preferences,” McCravy told the Gazette.
He did have private conversations questioning Newton’s decision to make Elliott and Bernstein subcommittee chairs because of disagreements over policy issues, he said.
“I don’t have anything against either of those people personally in any way,” McCravy said.
SC legislator loses leadership role, asks to be reassigned, in another GOP spat

Friction on the Judiciary Committee dates back to the end of last year, when McCravy asked to be removed from the powerful committee that vets many of the bills on the Family Caucus’ priority list. He denied that his request had anything to do with his fellow committee members, instead citing disagreements with Newton over policy.
The two have publicly butted heads over proposals about betting and alcohol sales. McCravy is a staunch gambling opponent who doesn’t imbibe.
Newton, on the other hand, is a co-sponsor this year of legislation legalizing a casino off Interstate 95 in Orangeburg County. The bill advanced through his committee to the House floor last week. On Wednesday, the House voted to “continue” the bill, meaning it can’t be taken up again until 2026.
Other measures the two have publicly disagreed about include bills to create a legal way to bet on horse races, allow people to drink cocktails anywhere in an airport terminal, and enable people order alcohol for delivery to their homes.
But Newton said it was McCravy’s claims that the chairman was funded by alcohol lobbyists, followed by the comments about Elliot, that “led to this unraveling.”
Wednesday’s letter, however, cited none of that.
Instead, it said the caucus has become the antithesis of what it’s supposed to be while bringing the unwanted divisions of Washington, D.C., to the South Carolina Statehouse.
“We believe this is both unwise and spiritually corrosive,” it read.

(Photo by Amanda Mustard for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star).A bill that would require automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to be present at school and school sporting events passed the House Education Committee with bipartisan support Wednesday.
State Rep. Tim Brennan (D-Bucks), who sponsored House Bill 191, said the legislature owes it to our kids “to be prepared to save their lives when something happens on their playing fields.”
“This serves a purpose,” Brennan said. “This is a valuable life saving tool that we should have in our schools.”
Brennan said that over 20 states already have similar laws in place and said statistics prove the effectiveness of AEDs in the event of a cardiac arrest. He said 90% of cardiac arrests are fatal when they occur outside of a hospital, but if an AED is used within a minute, survival rate can jump up to 90%.
This proposal amending the school code also requires one individual certified in CPR present, as well.
Brennan also referenced the cardiac arrest of then-24 year old Damar Hamlin, an Allegheny County native and player for the Buffalo Bills, in 2023 who was saved by CPR and the use of an AED on the field during an NFL game on Monday Night Football.
State Rep. Tarah Probst (D-Monroe), cited the death of Greg Moyer, a high school student who died in 2000 from sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 15, during a basketball game at East Stroudsburg North High School. She said it can take a long time for an ambulance to arrive in rural areas. Moyer’s family has been advocating for AEDs in schools and school sporting events.
AEDs were also at the center of another bill earlier this week. House Bill 193, which will require AEDs in every state building, passed the full House on Monday. 
Cursive mandate passes unanimously
The committee also unanimously voted to advance a proposal to require cursive handwriting to be taught in schools, at the appropriate grade level.
“In our digital world, cursive has fallen by the wayside, but there are many reasons for students to, at least, get the basic grasp of cursive writing,” State Rep. Dane Watro (R-Schuylkill), sponsor of House Bill 17 said Wednesday. “In addition, students need cursive to read historical documents. A growing cursive illiteracy poses a threat to accessing and comprehending key historical sources, such as the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.”
A co-sponsorship memo mentions that at least 24 states have laws on the books requiring cursive to be taught.
Both chairs of the committee also offered words of support before the vote was held.
“Obviously there are both cognitive and developmental skills I think that are learned through cursive but more importantly, I think it’s important that we understand the foundations of our historical and our founding documents, which this bill would obviously do,” House Education Minority Chairperson Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster) said.
State Rep. Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh), who is the chairperson of the committee, referenced knowing cursive from his 12 years of Catholic school education and said he looked at it from a slightly different perspective, while detailing a personal experience before voting to approve the bill.
“I have an 18-year-old who, a couple years ago, got her first bank account, and watching her try to endorse her first paycheck was quite the interesting experience on a human level,” Schweyer said. “I just think that a part of education is actually teaching human skills, not knowledge for the sake of knowledge, but actually preparing people for real life. And this is perfectly reasonable and a smart way to go about it.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230307_PABudgetAddress_019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 20:03:22.684117

Days after the Detroit News first reported the existence of the project in September 2022, three local government boards in the big rapids area approved unanimous resolutions to exempt the plant from property taxes. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced funding support for the Big Rapids-area facility in October 2022, with the Legislature later approving $175 million economic development funding to support the $2.3 billion facility, which was projected to bring 2,350 jobs to the area. 
However, the project served as a magnet for controversy, as conservative politicians and local activists raised concerns on the project’s environmental impact and its parent company’s Chinese ties. While Gotion Inc. is based in California and was established in 2014, its parent company, Guoxuan High-tech Co., was founded in 2006 in China.

The company’s Vice President, Chuck Thelen, has repeatedly pushed back against these arguments previously stating “Despite what any current politicians might say, there is no communist plot within Gotion.” Asian American leaders within the state have also raised concerns that the anti-China rhetoric aimed at the facility could place Asian Michiganders in increased danger of hate crimes and discrimination. 
In Green Charter Township, five members of the township board, including Township Supervisor Jim Chapman were recalled for their support of the project, with another two members of the seven-person board resigning ahead of the recall election. In nearby Big Rapids Township, Supervisor Bill Stanek was also recalled for his support of the Gotion Plant. 
Committee Chair Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) told his fellow committee members that Chapman had initially agreed to testify before the committee, but had decided against it following threats of property damage. 
Carra said the committee would not condone those threats but that it would have been nice to hear his testimony “because I know he does have a lot of information around this issue.”
Chapman did not respond to a request for comment.
Over the nearly hour-and-a-half long committee meeting, members heard testimony from three of the project’s opponents: Lori Brock, whose horse farm would be adjacent to the development; Jason Kruse, the current Green Charter Township supervisor; and Ormand Hook, a strategist with the group No Gotion. 
Brock, who would later help lead the recall against Chapman, detailed her experiences learning about the project and advocating against it, repeatedly pushing back against claims that the project had strong support within the community.

Brock repeatedly said Chapman refused to conduct a survey to gauge the community’s support for the Gotion plant, telling the committee that a survey that she and a few hundred other community members conducted by going door-to-door showed nearly 88% of residents opposed the project. 
She further questioned why the area was chosen.

“Our community is a rural area. We’re recreational. We are not an industrial zone. Why they would come there is beyond my belief, because there’s Flint, there’s Detroit. There’s other areas that want the jobs, that need the jobs,” Brock said. 
On March 15, 2024 Gotion filed a lawsuit against Green Charter Township, arguing it had violated terms of a development agreement Chapman signed while serving as supervisor, with the township arguing the agreement is invalid because the previous board never approved the finalized document in a meeting open to the public.
While the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan issued a preliminary injunction requiring the township to abide by the terms of the agreement, it has since appealed the case to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and will argue its case before the court on Thursday. 
Brock said she would like to see the state reimburse the township for legal fees, calling the decision to back the project “a huge mistake.”
When asked if she had any concerns about the company’s $1 million donation to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Brock said they’d reached out to ask if the president would consider donating that money back to the community, noting Trump’s opposition to the project. 
Kruse said the company’s decision to take legal action against one of its host communities “doesn’t make sense.”
While the charter township has since created its own zoning commission to hold greater oversight over projects like this one, the company has not submitted any application for necessary zoning changes on the site of the project, Kruse said, slamming the company for taking legal action against the township and noting that the legal fees have made it difficult to engage in some community projects. 
Kruse also accused Ferris State University in Big Rapids, which has supported the project, of pressuring him to take academic leave from his position as a tenured professor in the college’s automotive program.

“Two years before Gotion was even mentioned to the public, the college’s newly elected Dean, or hired Dean, rather, announced that, at a staff meeting, that the Automotive Department would have to discard our 69-year-old automotive service program and completely change to an electric vehicle battery and propulsion program. When the automotive staff asked for the reasoning and rationale for the change, we were answered in the meeting, ‘Oh, you will see,’” Kruse said. 
Kruse told the committee that later in the month, the dean was the moderator for a Zoom meeting pertaining to Gotion and said that the university would later pursue a grant through the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to “train students to work at the Gotion” facility.
In response to a question from Carra, Kruse said it seems the university had advance notice of the project before it was announced to the public. 
Upon reviewing Kruse’s remark, David Murray, the university’s vice president of marketing and communications said Kruse had “mischaracterized Ferris State University students and inaccurately portrayed events” in his testimony.
“[Kruse] is a Ferris State assistant professor who requested to be placed on political leave, and this was granted in December 2023. That political leave was extended twice at his request. At no point was he pressured into this decision,” Murray said.
“Ferris State has one of the largest and best Automotive Technology programs in the state. Our mission is to work with industry partners to prepare students for rewarding careers. The university continues to train students to work with internal combustion engines as well as emerging sustainable transportation vehicle technology. Anything to the contrary is simply not true,” Murray said. 
Hook raised further concerns on Gotion’s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, noting that its parent company’s articles of association require it to “carry out Party activities in accordance with the Constitution of the Communist Party of China.”
Gotion did not respond to a request for comment. 
He also challenged the state’s practice of providing corporations with subsidies. 
“This is rhetorical, but why are there no corporate handouts to protect us from the government,” Hook asked. 
In closing out the committee, the Minority Vice Chair, Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), asked Hook whether the same project of the same size and the same level of investment would earn the community’s support if it was coming from a company tied to another country.  
“Not that size and not sitting on a wetland that runs down into the river,” Hook said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Democratic-Farmer-Labor-controlled Minnesota Senate passed a two-year human services budget Wednesday, featuring extensive cuts as the state grapples with looming deficits. 
The House, which is tied 67-67, passed its Department of Human Services budget bill on Monday with bipartisan support. The two bills achieve around $300 million in cuts, but they achieve the savings in different ways. The differences must be hashed out by members of both chambers in a conference committee.
DHS programs account for nearly one-third of state spending, and are expected to get more expensive in the coming years due to the aging population and increasing health care costs. Most of the spending is on Medical Assistance, Minnesota’s Medicaid program, which allocates more money per participant than nearly any other state. 
Because DHS is such a large portion of the budget — rivaled only by education — state leaders have targeted the agency for cuts in the coming years to balance the books.
The floor debate over the bill highlighted an emerging sticking point in negotiations between Republicans and Democrats: public health insurance for undocumented Minnesota residents. Republican senators put forward amendments that would have repealed a 2023 law that opened up eligibility for MinnesotaCare — the state’s health insurance program for the working poor — to undocumented people. 
Those amendments were tossed out by Democrats for being unrelated to the bill, but they portend what could be a difficult 12 days remaining in the legislative session, with both sides standing their ground on a contentious culture war issue. 
The Senate bill would reduce payments to nursing homes. In the House, lawmakers instead targeted “rate exceptions,” which pay extra to caregivers of people with extraordinary needs, and pushed part of the cost of that program onto county governments. 
The Senate budget sets similar limits on what services count towards that “rate exception,” but wouldn’t require counties to pay a share of the cost.
It would reduce payments to nursing homes in several ways: by capping the inflation adjustment for operational expenses to 4% per year; reducing reimbursement rates for low-quality nursing facilities; and changing the calculus so that fewer facilities get a bonus for high quality services.
The budget also includes proposals from Gov. Tim Walz to limit spending on certain services for people with disabilities: setting an 8-hour daily limit on in-home skill development support and training; reducing how much providers are paid to account for unexpected absences from day programs; and paying caretakers less while they are sleeping on night supervision shifts. 
The Senate bill does push some other costs onto counties, requiring them to pay for 2% of the cost of residential services for people on Medical Assistance. It would cut some funding to counties for substance use disorder assessments, and cancel grants for some harm reduction measures passed by the Legislature in 2023.
Both the House and the Senate bills pay for raises for nursing home workers, as determined by the Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board; and for oversight of autism services providers, some of which have come under investigation for suspected fraud.

The new chancellor of Montana Technological University will be Johnny MacLean, provost, or chief academic officer, at the University of Montana Western, university officials announced Wednesday.
The appointment starts June 1 and is pending approval by the Montana Board of Regents.
“The depth of experience Dr. MacLean brings to Montana Tech as both an accomplished scientist and as a student-centered administrator will be of immense value to the university as he leads it into the next era of growth and expansion,” said Commissioner of Higher Education Clayton Christian in a statement. “His passion and vision for Tech’s STEM-focused mission makes him an excellent choice to continue Tech on its positive trajectory.”
MacLean joined Montana Western in 2022 and is provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs. He previously worked in the Office of the Provost at Southern Utah University since 2016 including as associate provost.
MacLean was one of two finalists announced for the chancellor job in March 2025.
In April, the Montana University System announced it had tapped the other finalist, Karen Marrongelle, with the U.S. National Science Foundation, as the new Montana Tech chancellor.
However, a couple of weeks later, Marrongelle withdrew, citing circumstances “beyond my control” in “unprecedented times.” She did not elaborate.
In the news release Wednesday, MacLean said he is enthusiastic about taking the helm of the Butte university.
“Montana Tech’s unique purpose is clear,” MacLean said in a statement. “This institution serves students who want to change the world through STEM disciplines, and it is the honor of my career to support them in pursuing their goals. I am excited to be joining the vibrant city of Butte and look forward to building on Tech’s strong tradition of partnership with the community.”
In fall 2024, Montana Tech had a headcount of roughly 2,400 including at its Highlands College, and Montana Western counted 1,228, according to the Montana University System. 
The news release said MacLean completed a bachelor’s  in geology at Furman University in 2001, a master’s. in Earth Science at Syracuse University in 2004, and a doctorate in Geosciences at the University of Montana in 2007.
Upon completion of his academic studies, MacLean worked in the oil and gas industry in Texas as a geologist and in the environmental consulting industry in Montana, the news release said. 
“As a tenured faculty member of geology at Southern Utah University, Dr. MacLean combined his passion for the outdoors and belief in teaching authentically by taking his students outside to learn from nature and to see scientific concepts come to life,” the news release said.

Additionally, three more measles cases emerged in Lea County, bringing New Mexico’s case total to 71.
Health officials have now diagnosed measles in five counties: Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy and Lea.
“Seeing measles in a new county underscores the need to remain vigilant and get vaccinated,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “It also serves as a reminder the measles outbreak in New Mexico isn’t over. We urge New Mexicans to make sure their vaccination records are up to date.”
Between Feb.1 and May 3, 23,706 New Mexicans received a vaccine, nearly double the 2024 rate of 12,985 during the same time frame. Two doses of the vaccine can provide 97% protection against measles infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus spread through contact with droplets from an infected person talking, coughs or sneezes. Symptoms can take one to three weeks to appear, and people can spread measles before showing a fever, red eyes, cough, headache or the spotty red rash.
Health officials said people at the following locations may be exposed to measles:

April 30, from 10:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., at the WIC Agency, 1216 Cameo St. in Clovis.
April 30, from 11:30 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. at Walmart, 3728 N. Prince Street in Clovis.
May 4, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Firehouse Subs, 3734 N. Grimes Street., Suite. A in Hobbs.
May 4 from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. at Bob’s Thriftway, 904 Avenue D in Lovington.

The current United States measles outbreak is the worst in 30 years, with cases reported in 30 of the 50 states and in Canada and Mexico.
Across New Mexico, school nurses say they remain on alert for measles cases, while working to build trust with parents about vaccinations.
After the outbreak first began in mid-February, one of the first things Desiree Smith, a school nurse in Portales for the past 15 years, did was reach out to parents of unvaccinated children.
“We wanted to let them know the process if their child was exposed, or has the measles,” Smith said, noting that the latest guidance from NMDOH is for unvaccinated children to not attend school for 21 days from the last exposure. She said depending on the district, plans would need to be in place for remote learning during that period.
“We did have a couple of parents who had their children vaccinated after I explained the dangers of measles, obviously, the exposure time and time away from the classroom,” she said.
School nurses in New Mexico are responsible for reviewing students’ vaccine records, which are required by state law to be up to date. New Mexico, unlike other states, does not allow for “personal or philosophical exemptions,” but does allow for religious or medical exemptions, which must be updated every year.
Smith, who is also the director of the New Mexico School Nurse Association, said educational health providers are both potential first responders to an outbreak and play a crucial role in addressing the falling vaccine rates furthering spread.
“Since COVID we have had we have seen a lot more vaccine hesitancy,” Smith said.
According to NMDOH data, New Mexico exemption rates are rising. Taos County has the highest exemption percentage at 3.35%, followed by De Baca County at 2.96% of students and Harding County in third at 2.70%.

Smith said she and other school nurses received guidance from the state health department in February to reach out to parents with exemptions, and alert them about the measles outbreak. Smith, who also sits on the board of the National Association of School Nurses, said the larger goal is to keep kids healthy enough for school.
“As school nurses, we just want what is best for the children, we’re trying to make sure they are safe, healthy and ready to learn and that time out of the classroom is minimized as much as possible,” she said. “Vaccination is one of the best ways to do that.”

A compromise combining elements of bills proposed by Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature’s Labor and Public Employees Committee would require greater transparency from employers about quotas and digital monitoring.
If House Bill 6907 passes the Senate as expected, Connecticut would follow California, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington with laws intended to provide greater protections for workers in warehouses and fulfillment centers.
The measure passed on a 97-46 vote over the unanimous opposition of the Republican minority and two Democrats, Rep. Raghib Allie-Brennan of Bethel and Rep. Jill Barry of Glastonbury.
Rep. Manny Sanchez, D-New Britain, co-chair of the labor committee, said the bill’s intent was to require transparency about quotas and ensure they “do not interfere with employees’ legally mandated meal and bathroom breaks.”
Republicans assailed the legislation as a government overreach and an effort by unions to achieve in legislation would they could in organizing and collective bargaining.
”Why does the legislature, why does the executive branch, why does the governor seem to be punitive towards business when we have companies who we are trying to attract to come here?” said Rep. Steve Weir, R-Hebron.
Lamont, a former business owner who has made economic growth a priority, has broken with labor on some issues, most notably a bill that would provide jobless benefits to strikers. But he proposed his own version of a warehouse bill after taking no position on one proposed two years ago.
The National Employment Law Project reported last year that the rate of warehouse worker injury is twice the average of other private industries, which NELP blamed in part on the tactics that some companies, notably Amazon, employ to speed the pace of workers in a business that promises prompt deliveries.
Amazon did not submit any testimony on the bill this year or the version proposed in 2023, but Weir defended the company.
“Why are we trying to send the message that we don’t appreciate the jobs and the opportunity and the ingenuity and the efficiency that they bring to make sure that all those packages show up on our doorstep when we order them?” said Weir, the ranking Republican on labor. “So this is a terrible message to send. Make no mistake, this is all about the messaging.”
Rep. Dave Rutigliano, R-Trumbull, said he was confident Amazon could comply, but he worried about other companies and the general message sent to business.
“We have this penchant to sort of go after these big companies, the boogeyman, like Amazon,” Rutigliano said. “Well, I gotta tell you, I’m not here to defend Amazon. I guarantee you, Amazon doesn’t have a big problem with this bill, because they’re already meeting every aspect of this bill.”
The bill applies to companies that employee at least 100 workers in one warehouse or an aggregate of 1,000 in the state.
Other Republicans said the bill interfered with the labor-management relationship. The bill is an element of a campaign to lobby blue-state legislatures to set standards in law for a retail distribution giant that has proved difficult to organize and bring to collective bargaining.
While the Connecticut AFL-CIO supports the bill, the campaign for passage in Connecticut has been led by the Teamsters.
Their international arm is trying to organize Amazon workers, and two locals in Connecticut are fearful that if Amazon’s standards are allowed to persist, other warehouse workers could feel similar pressures.
Unions have had at least one failure on the issue in a blue state.
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential Democratic candidate for president in 2028, vetoed a similar warehouse bill in March. His message focused on process, less than the desirability of states imposing standards.
“While I share the goal of protecting warehouse workers from dangerous and unfair working conditions, this bill was passed hastily at the end of the Lame Duck session without engagement with relevant state agencies or my office and presents both legal and operational issues that undermine its effect,” Pritzker wrote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20220420_AmazonFulfillmentCenter_Windsor_YK_194.jpg,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915

The decision comes after leaders with Capital Preparatory Schools, a charter school organization with campuses in New York and Connecticut, filed a petition asking the department to clarify several aspects of the approval and funding process. Capital Prep, which received initial approval in 2023 to open a new campus in Middletown, has yet to receive state funding to begin operating at that location. 
In their petition, school leaders alleged that “the failure to fund Capital Preparatory Middletown Charter School was the result of violation of state laws (and a breach of the duties of the State Board of Education and/or State Department of Education under such laws),” and they asked the state Board of Education to “remedy the situation.”
On Wednesday, the board gave the green light to the state Department of Education to rule on Capital Prep’s petition — determining whether charter schools in Connecticut are being properly funded according to state law or whether the state legislature is overstepping its role.
Charter school advocates have questioned whether the state Board of Education is required to rank approved charter school applicants to determine which will be funded first — and whether that ranking is binding to both the board and state Department of Education when approving and funding schools. 
“This is an important issue that’s capable of repetition,” said Mike McKeon, the education department’s legal director, told members of the board Wednesday.
McKeon said a declaratory ruling on the issue would clarify the funding process and define “the proper funding mechanism” for charter schools under state statute.
Capital Prep Middletown received initial approval in 2023 from the state Board of Education and scored the highest out of seven charter school applications that were being considered that year, but was ultimately left out of the state budget and has not been able to open since.
Prior to 2015, a charter school could begin recruiting students and building its campus as soon as it received approval from the state Board of Education. That year, however, a bill changed the process into a two-tier approval system, where the state Board of Education grants “initial” approval and a charter school can only open in Connecticut after receiving funding approved by lawmakers.
Capital Prep Founder and CEO Steve Perry, along with other charter school advocates, argued that the state legislature is only responsible for allocating funds to charter schools in general. The state Board of Education, they say, is the institution that should be distributing the monies depending on the score its application receives from the department, which includes an analysis of the school’s curriculum, model and community need.
“[State] statute … says the board of education shall select the schools who will be funded, Perry told state Board of Education members at a meeting Wednesday. “It says that the General Assembly provides the money, and then, just like every other [request] you fund based upon the score.
“That hasn’t happened, that continues not to happen,” Perry said.
Anita Ford Saunders, the president of the Middlesex County NAACP, added during a public comment period at the board meeting Wednesday that state agencies were “weaponizing” the law to “keep marginalized communities and children from thriving.”
“The law says the [state Department of Education] is supposed to choose what charter school is to receive funding based on its scores. You skipped over the school that received the highest scores to grant the money to the school who came in second and subsequently never opened,” Saunders said.
Both Perry and Saunders were referring to language in Connecticut law which says “if in any fiscal year, more than one new state or local charter school is approved … and is awaiting funding … the State Board of Education shall determine which school is funded first based on a consideration of the following factors in order of importance as follows: (1) The quality of the proposed program as measured against the criteria required in the charter school application process …  (2) whether the applicant has a demonstrated record of academic success by students, (3) whether the school is located in a school district with a demonstrated need for student improvement, and (4) whether the applicant has plans concerning the preparedness of facilities, staffing and outreach to students.”
However, in a letter to Capital Prep leaders in late January, Natalie Braswell, an attorney for Gov. Ned Lamont’s Office, said the interpretation was wrong. She said allegations that the state was acting unlawfully were “baseless and concerning as it misrepresents the [state Department of Education’s] legal authority and the legislative process that governs charter school funding.”
Ltr to Cap Prep MiddletownDownload
Braswell added that the legislation Perry and other advocates were referring to was missing previous language that clarified each governing body’s responsibilities.
“Capital Preparatory Charter School Middletown is now claiming that the legislature only has the right to allocate funds, not to determine to which charter schools those funds will be allocated and that the State Board of Education can do so, even if the legislature has said otherwise,” Braswell wrote. “This is not supported by law or fact. … The legislature has clearly spoken as the where funds were to be allocated.”
The opening of Capital Prep in Middletown has been controversial since its first approval in March 2023 when the Department of Education had recommended the state board defer its decision after receiving an influx of letters in opposition to the school the night before the meeting where a decision was expected. 
The board ended up overruling the department’s recommendation and granted the school its initial approval. 
Months later, the charter school was removed from the final state budget, despite receiving approval in an earlier version of the budget signed off by the Appropriations Committee during the 2023 legislative session.
Capital Prep’s petition has garnered interest from other charter school advocates across the state, including leaders in Danbury whose charter school was approved by the state Board of Education in 2018 but has yet to be funded.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Memphis lawmakers expressed their “devastation” Wednesday at an out-of-town jury’s verdict finding three former Memphis police officers not guilty in the death of Tyre Nichols.
Nichols, 29, died in 2023 after police beat him during a traffic stop. 
The jury found three former officers — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith — not guilty of all charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. They deliberated for about nine hours following a 10-day trial.
In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, Tennessee House Democratic Leader Karen Camper said the verdict leaves a “deep wound in our community and renewed calls for justice and accountability.”
“It is particularly troubling that an all-white jury from Hamilton County was brought into Shelby County to hear this case — a decision that distanced the proceedings from the very community most impacted by this tragedy,” Camper said. “That move has understandably raised concerns about fairness and trust in the legal process.”
Department of Justice opens civil rights probe of Memphis after Tyre Nichols death case

Nichols had run from the scene of the traffic stop after being pepper-sprayed. Police body cameras and surveillance footage captured police striking and kicking Nichols, restraining him and taking him into custody.
Nichols died three days later due to blunt force trauma to the head, according to his autopsy. Investigators at the West Tennessee Regional Forensic Center ruled Nichols’ death a homicide.
In total, five officers were fired from the Memphis Police Department for their roles in Nichols’ death. Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations in 2024, and reportedly intend to plead guilty to state charges as well. 
Bean, Haley and Smith were convicted in federal court of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Haley was also found guilty of violating Nichols’ civil rights. They have yet to be sentenced.
Shelby County Legislative Delegation Chairman Rep. Torrey Harris said Wednesday that “‘liberty and justice for all’ proved to be empty words on a paper.”
“Today’s verdict does not change the fact all are facing considerable time in prison,” Harris said. “For those who watched the video and were sickened by the savage beating of Mr. Nichols, we all must remember that our faith — or lack thereof — in the system has been justified. Justice is still being served federally and today’s verdict does nothing to change that.”
Rep. Antonio Parkinson, a Memphis Democrat, wrote, “all I can think about is the family of Tyre Nichols and how incredibly heartbreaking this must be for them. A truly unfathomable pain.”
State Sens. Raumesh Akbari and London Lamar, both Memphis Democrats, issued statements conveying their heartbreak and anger.
“My heart is with Tyre’s family and everyone in our community carrying the weight of this painful outcome,” Lamar stated. “More than ever, Memphis — and communities across our state — need police officers who protect and serve, not intimidate and harm.” 
Attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, who have represented Nichols’ parents, called the verdicts “a devastating miscarriage of justice.”
“The world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve. That brutal, inhumane assault was captured on video, yet the officers responsible were acquitted,” Crump and Romanucci stated.

The bill now gets a chance to be debated in the state House of Representatives.,"A carbon dioxide (CO2) injection well drilled by the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy) at the Cranfield CO2 test site in Mississippi. (USGS)A bill to prevent the takeover of private property for carbon capture and sequestration pipelines in Louisiana was resurrected Wednesday after a tie vote in committee last week. The bill now gets a chance to be debated in the state House of Representatives.  
Originally sidelined after a tie 8-8 vote last week, House Bill 601 by Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, was brought back before the House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment eight days later and was approved with a 11-4 vote. 
“To get it out today, I’m very grateful,” Geymann said in an interview. He noted his bill follows comparable legislation in states such as South Dakota, which recently approved similar legislation.
“It’s got a long road ahead of it, but getting it out of committee is a big step,” he added. “I think it’s an issue people will rally around.”
The bill would prevent companies building CO2 pipelines from claiming eminent domain to move their projects forward. The principle allows development on private property if the project is deemed to have a positive public impact that trumps the landowner’s rights not to sell.  
Geymann’s bill is one of the select few carbon capture regulation bills to make it out of committee so far in the legislative session that ends June 14.  Other proposals that would require local approval for drilling wells used to inject carbon dioxide underground haven’t made much headway, despite an abundance of support for them.
Geymann attributes some success to the bill’s wider appeal to personal rights.
“It is about private property rights,” he said. “Some of the bills are attempts to kill carbon capture. This one is not.”
Also central to his case for the bill’s passage is the idea that CCS is not connected with direct benefit to the public good. 
“We have eminent domain for pipelines for public use, water, oil, gas,” he said. “But for CO2 … where you’re taking a product and injecting it underground permanently, my opinion is it is not for public use, therefore you shouldn’t be able to take someone’s property without their consent.”
Oil and industry representatives maintained their staunch opposition to Geymann’s bill. 
“We are trying to create the best opportunity for carbon capture projects to move forward in Louisiana,” Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, said during the committee. “We believe this bill makes that much harder and, in some cases, almost impossible.”
Allan Parish Police Jury chairman Roland Hollins argued the opposite in committee, in his support for the bill. Multiple carbon storage projects are proposed in and near Allen Parish, and Hollins leads the Louisiana CO2 Alliance, a coalition of parish leaders who want more scrutiny and local say over carbon storage infrastructure. 
“This bill does not shut down CO2 pipelines. It does not shut down CCS,” he said. “It simply affords landowners of this great state the ability to make a very important and fair decision about their land.” 
The eminent domain restrictions in Geymann’s bill would only apply to transport pipelines for CO2 sequestration. Carbon capture and storage facility operators would still be able to use eminent domain to build their facilities or construct power lines needed to operate them, as long as they have approval from the state conservation commissioner.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-07-at-5.39.01-PM-1024x670.png,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915

(Photo by Alex Peña/Getty Images)A 1798 law is the foundation of the Trump’s administration’s recent deportations of Venezuelan nationals suspected of gang membership.
But on Wednesday afternoon, it was over a 21st-century technology that a federal judge decided to lengthen the timespan needed for the feds to notify a Central Falls man if he’s to be transferred out of Rhode Island, such as to the maximum security prison CECOT in El Salvador. 
“I do want to preserve the status quo with respect to this petitioner, so I am going to extend my order to a 72-hour notice provision,” U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose said during the roughly 25-minute remote hearing, held over Zoom and broadcast live on YouTube.
But DuBose did not fulfill the wishes of the plaintiff’s counsel, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), whose attorneys filed a request for a temporary restraining order Monday to stop the man, identified in court documents as G.M.G., from being deported on suspicions of membership in Tren de Aragua, an international cartel based in Venezuela.
The man is a Venezuelan asylum-seeker who, fearing political persecution in his native country, came to the U.S. in 2023 with his fianceé and her son. He was arrested while at work at his job as a barber on March 26 and has been held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls since.
ACLU seeks to halt Rhode Island barber’s deportation under 18th century law

The ACLU contends he is being held as a suspected member of Tren de Aragua, based on his tattoos. Members of the gang are named in Trump’s March 15 executive order, as eligible for rapid removal from the country under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) — a wartime statute previously invoked only during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.
On Monday, DuBose ordered that the court receive 48 hours’ notice before any transfer of G.M.G. outside Rhode Island. But Wednesday she expanded that to 72 hours to give counsel time to respond if the removal process is triggered. 
“The harm to him is certainly great if he were confined in a prison in El Salvador,” said My Khanh Ngo, a Senior Staff Attorney at the SACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project in its San Francisco office, during the hearing.
DuBose agreed to keep the ACLU’s motion for a restraining order pending, and it can be reactivated if the federal government initiates a formal removal process under the Alien Enemies Act DuBose based her decision partially on the uncertainty on the federal side of the equation — including who will be responsible for handling the case going forward. 
“We are in kind of a weird, kind of gray area here,” DuBose said during the hearing.
Sara Miron Bloom, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Rhode Island, filled in to represent federal arguments Wednesday, and could not confirm if her office or someone at the U.S. Department of Justice would serve as the feds’ attorney of record on the case. 
Bloom said she was also unaware of any application of the Alien Enemies Act or proceedings involving G.M.G. She said he is engaged in immigration proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 
“It is therefore quite possible that he will continue to be under immigration proceedings under the INA, and so if that is to happen, then there is no need for this court to rule,” Bloom said.
But Bloom could also not confirm whether the Alien Enemies Act would not be applied to G.M.G. in the near future — a major concern for his attorneys, who argued it could happen with little warning. 
“I understand that 48 hours notice ahead of transfer in an ordinary case may be sufficient, but we’re talking about removals in the AEA context,” Ngo said. “If the government were to give notice right after his hearing and say he’s going to be moved Friday evening, it will take us some time to locate him…He could be on a plane or already at the prison in El Salvador come Monday.”
Ngo said this line of argument led to successful acquisition of temporary restraining orders in other states’ courthouses, but Bloom noted those cases were class-actions. “This individual petitioner is protected against sudden removal or transfer by your current order,” she said to DuBose.










The harm to him is certainly great if he were confined in a prison in El Salvador. 


– My Khanh Ngo, senior staff attorney, SACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project in its San Francisco office


The judge acknowledged that she can’t “extend the scope of my reach outside of the four corners of the petition that’s before me.” 
But DuBose’s interest was also piqued by the fact that “there hasn’t been this filing of the removal order or a petition under the AEA,” she said. “I’m also troubled or concerned that…protocol has not been consistently established.”
While the ACLU did not secure a restraining order immediately, Ngo argued that the extended notice period would suffice for the moment: “It would be fine if the order were amended to provide for 72 hours notice of any transfers out of this district.”
“I don’t really have a concern with the 72 hours versus 48 hours,” Bloom agreed. “My understanding is under this order that the court has already entered, what counsel is describing would not occur.”
“And Attorney Bloom,” DuBose added at the end of the hearing, addressing the acting U.S. attorney who joined the District of Rhode Island in January 2022. “I’m hoping at some point we’ll get clarity… as to who’s going to be representing the respondent.”
“I hope so too,” Bloom replied with a laugh.

How we’re tracking Vermont’s lawsuits against the Trump administration

Clark points to Trump’s record as a businessman, in which he declared bankruptcy six times. “I think some people would feel embarrassed if they had a business model that was going to have a lot of failures,” she said. “And he just doesn’t. He’s not oriented that way. He doesn’t necessarily see a failure as a loss. I think he sees these as tools to understand what his power is and to stretch his power by intimidation.”“He’s using these extreme cases to test the boundaries of his power and also to gain power for himself,” she added.Clark said she is especially concerned about Trump’s attacks on poor people, such as slashing the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and Head Start, the early education program for low-income people, both of which benefit thousands of Vermonters. “It isn’t for the administration, the executive branch, to decide how to spend the taxpayers’ money,” Clark said. She insisted that Congress “created these programs, and they have funded these programs, and Donald Trump needs to deliver the money to the programs.”What if Trump ignores the courts, as he seems to selectively be doing? Clark has a warning for Trump’s lawyers who defy court orders. “There are consequences: It’s disbarment. It’s being in contempt,” she said. “At some point, lawyers who disobey will be punished.” Numerous Trump attorneys have been disbarred in recent years. The attorney general said her biggest concerns are apathy and the erosion of the media, which are interconnected problems. “There’s apathy because people actually don’t understand what’s going on from a non-biased source.”Many people “are getting their news not from journalists, but from entertainers,” she said.Clark advises Vermonters to “hang in there.” “Our country is strong (and) was literally designed to protect itself from someone who wanted to be king,” she said.The attorney general said people must “do our part as citizens: voting, participating in democracy, protesting, speaking up. That’s my message to Vermonters.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Conversation: Attorney General Charity Clark sues Donald Trump and warns ‘there are consequences’ for defying courts.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mojo-9-20231205-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-07 22:36:05+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson State President Marcus Thompson resigns,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/07/jackson-state-president-marcus-thompson-resigns/,JSU President Marcus Thompson resigned Wednesday after nearly two years leading the historically Black university.,"After nearly two years, Jackson State University President Marcus Thompson has resigned.  
No reason was given.
The news came after the Institutions of Higher Learning Board, Mississippi’s governing body that oversees the state’s public universities, met Wednesday to discuss a “personnel matter” regarding an employee at Jackson State University. 
The board met for two hours in a closed door executive meeting to discuss a matter “regarding the job performance of a person holding a specific position at Jackson State University and related potential litigation,” a spokesperson for IHL said. Board officials told reporters there was nothing to report at the end of the meeting.  IHL later released a statement saying Thompson had resigned.
This is the second time in three weeks the board had met to discuss a personnel matter related to the historically Black university. 
In April, the board met for a nearly two-hour executive meeting. The board released a statement that no “personnel action” has been taken regarding JSU president, Marcus Thompson.
IHL hired Thompson in late 2023 after his predecessor, Thomas Hudson, resigned after serving three years in that position The board had placed Hudson on administrative leave, but to date has not shared with the public the nature of the personnel issue that motivated its decision. He ultimately resigned.
IHL conducted a national search, interviewing 79 applicants, but Thompson was the epitome of an internal hire, having worked at IHL since 2009. He had never before led a university. 
The day the IHL board appointed Thompson president, Jackson-area attorney Lisa Ross, who is also a Jackson State alumnus, filed a lawsuit accusing the board of gender discrimination for overlooking her client, Debra Mays-Jackson, who had been senior administrator at the university. The lawsuit alleges that when IHL makes internal hires at its three historically Black universities, men tend to benefit. 
It’s not the only way women are harmed by the system of internal hires, the lawsuit alleges Ross said that while Hudson was serving as interim president, he sent “unwanted and unwelcome” sexually explicit photographs to a female employee. 
Thompson was permitted to investigate the photographs, but he allegedly closed the investigation without questioning the female employee. 
IHL has not responded to those allegations in its repeated motions to dismiss the case. 
Thompson’s resignation marks the third time in five years the JSU presidency has been vacated by board action or resignation. Hudson’s predecessor, William Bynum, appointed in 2017, was ousted following his arrest in 2020 on a charge of “procuring the services of prostitute, false statement of identity and possession of marijuana.”
The board has named Denise Jones Gregory, provost and vice president of academic affairs at JSU, as interim president.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico’s top adult mental health services official on Wednesday laid out a timeline for rebuilding the state’s systems for addressing mental health challenges, including substance use disorder.
At a public health conference in Albuquerque, Health Care Authority Behavioral Health Services Division Director Nick Boukas detailed how mental health treatment will change as a result of New Mexico enacting Senate Bill 3, known as the Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act.
Boukas said his division will work with the Administrative Office of the Courts to divide the state into behavioral health regions and “investment zones,” each of which will identify five behavioral health priorities over the next four years.
The priorities will come from feedback from local communities, including local public health councils, local behavioral health collaboratives and advocates, Boukas said.
“We want you at that table so that we can make it better,” Boukas told the crowd gathered at the conference. “We know that one size does not fit all.”
Boukas’ comments came during the Community Collaborative Forum hosted by the New Mexico Alliance of Health Councils, at which hundreds of people — including state agency heads, state lawmakers and public health researchers — met in person and online to debrief this year’s legislative session and prepare for potential federal funding cuts.
In the recent legislative session, New Mexico allocated $4 million for health councils in the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Lt. Gov. Howie Morales gave the event’s keynote address during which he said the funds mark the biggest ever investment of state funds in health councils.
Health councils’ advocates have struggled in recent years to receive funding from state lawmakers. Morales said when he was still a state senator, he remembers “not all health councils were able to survive” funding cuts the Legislature enacted.
“I believe in preventative measures,” Morales said. “We can talk about all of the back-end issues that we deal with — crime, homelessness, substance abuse — but if we continue to invest like we just did, this $4 million, you work on it on the front end, the investment pays off in multiple ways.”

According to a timeline Boukas presented at the forum, last week AOC began providing HCA with monthly updates on the regional plans.
On Monday, HCA hired Kristie Brooks, a former federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration official, as the state’s director of behavioral health transformation and innovation. Boukas said she will help him implement SB3.
“She understands rural communities, tribal communities, behavioral health and how we make all that work together,” he said.
By June 1, the Behavioral Health Services Division will provide AOC with behavioral health standards and service evaluation guidelines, according to the timeline, and by the end of this year, the state’s Medicaid program will establish a group of licensing boards to help streamline mental health providers’ credentialing.
Planning meetings will be public
SB3 repealed the old Behavioral Health Collaborative, which will be replaced with the new Behavioral Health Executive Committee, who will be responsible for implementing the new law, Boukas said.
The executive committee will include the Health Care Authority cabinet secretary, the Behavioral Health Services Division director, the Medicaid program director, the AOC and the Legislative Finance Committee, he said, noting that AOC is vetting three behavioral health experts to also work on the committee, and their appointments will be announced soon.
The committee will hold meetings open to the public in Santa Fe and online every quarter, and report back to the LFC, Boukas said. 
The Behavioral Health Trust Fund created in Senate Bill 1 will start paying out in July 2026.
The money must be equitably shared between each region’s priorities; may be used for projects up to four years in length; may be used to cover people without health insurance; and up to 5% of it can be for emergencies like mental health services during disasters like wildfires, Boukas said.
By June 30, 2027, the executive committee will find a responsible government entity in each region to write progress reports on gaps in care and services provided, and hand them over to LFC, according to Boukas’ timeline.
“This isn’t just a blank check that’s going to go out the door,” he said. “We want to make sure we’re turning these into measurable outcomes.”
Also on June 30, 2027, the state’s Medicaid program is expected to establish a universal behavioral health provider enrollment and credentialing process for Medicaid, according to the timeline.
Then on July 1, 2027, HCA will analyze gaps in behavioral health care to inform the regional plans, and then repeat the analysis every two years thereafter, the timeline states.
Boukas said he expects many regions to have the same top three priorities already found in health councils’ community health improvement plans: access to care, behavioral health and substance use disorder.
When Boukas asked the crowd if he was missing anything, someone shouted out, “Housing!”
“That’s in here too,” he responded. “But we want you to tell us where we need that housing, and what type of housing. So we need you at this table, we want you at this table.”

In a statement Monday, House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, described it as “one of the most significant policies enacted for renters in the last four years.”
Sponsored by Rep. Kelly Kortum, D-Bozeman, House Bill 311 requires property managers to return rental application fees when they aren’t used to run the application.
Kortum brought the bill forward to address “predatory business practices” he saw in Bozeman, according to a news release from House Democrats.
Co-sponsors included Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate.
The news release said property managers can “harvest” hundreds of dollars in application fees from prospective renters without intending to award a unit to any of them.
“Every day, Montanans pay rental application fees but don’t get the apartment,” Kortum said at a hearing in support of the bill. “Why are they paying for a service they never receive?”
An estimated 31% of Montana households are renters, or 137,485, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Of those, it said 22% earn at or below the area median income.
But renters can end up paying hundreds, “if not thousands,” of dollars in application fees in a de facto “housing lottery,” as they look for a place to live, the news release said.
In a story last month, Realtor.com estimated the cost of application fees at $35 to $75 per person in the nation, although it said amounts range depending on location.
House Democrats described HB 311 as a priority bill that will make “finding a home much cheaper.”
In a statement, Sullivan, a co-sponsor, said the bill shows Democrats are delivering to make housing more affordable in Montana.
“Getting a roof over your head should not be a raffle or a lottery,” Sullivan said. “HB 311 would end the housing lottery and stop landlords from harvesting exploitative fees from hardworking Montanans.”
The bill passed the legislature with bipartisan support, 68-29 in the House and 34-14 in the Senate.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1347257020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915

That same year, we consumed 661 pounds per person of dairy products in general, matching the all-time record we set in 2021 (look at us go!).Those are some of the more eye-popping statistics included in Vermont Dairy Delivers, a report released last month documenting the evolution of Vermont’s dairy industry over the past decade.“In that time, dairy has become more than just a tradition in Vermont,” Anson Tebetts, Vermont’s secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets, said Wednesday while presenting the report to members of the House Committee on Agriculture. “It’s a modern economic engine. It’s rooted in our rural communities, in all of our 14 counties, and growing stronger every year.”In all, the state’s dairy industry accounts for $5.4 billion in economic activity annually, the report says, almost 12% of the state’s approximately $45.7 billion gross domestic product. That’s up from $2.6 billion when a similar report was last compiled a decade ago. During that same time period, the number of dairy processors — meaning makers of things like cheese or butter  — in the state jumped from 95 to 158. According to the report, Vermont produces 2.15 billion pounds of cow, goat and sheep milk annually — or about 250 million gallons — which accounts for about 63% of all milk produced in New England (take that, Maine). Milk made in Vermont goes toward producing a spate of dairy products, from butter and heavy cream to award-winning cheeses and goat milk gelato.But even as overall dairy production remains strong in Vermont, the number of individual dairy farms in the state has actually plummeted in the past century, a trend that has intensified in recent years as the industry has undergone rapid consolidation.According to the report, Vermont had about 480 dairy farms operating in 2024 — a little over half as many as there were in 2013. In 1950, for reference, the state had more than 10,000 dairies in operation. Meanwhile, the number of dairy cows per farm has increased by roughly 80% to 254 in the last decade. “We have seen consolidation of dairy, just like just about every other industry in the United States,” Tebbetts said.The numbers may finally be leveling off, though. Agriculture officials told lawmakers that only three dairies closed in Vermont since the report was compiled earlier this year. But five more have opened: three dairies with sheep, one with goats and one with cows.“It’s really trending in a positive direction,” said Laura Ginsburg, dairy strategy and innovation manager for Vermont’s agriculture department. — Habib SabetIn the knowOver the past several months, Vermont lawmakers and state officials have been preoccupied with the fate of the state’s largest health insurance company. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is the only health insurance company based in Vermont. The nonprofit covers roughly a third of the state’s population across all its plans, and is facing a financial crisis with little recent precedent due to a multiyear surge in insurance claims.In 2019, the insurer had $133.5 million in the bank. At the end of 2024, Blue Cross Blue Shield had just $58 million — and pays out an average of $35 million a week in claims. Last year, credit rating agency A.M. Best downgraded Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rating twice, bringing its score from B++ to C++. That’s moved the insurer’s rating from “good” to “marginal” in a matter of less than six months.“I’ve lived and worked in Vermont for 45 years,” Don George, the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield, told lawmakers in the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare last month. “And I’ve just never seen anything remotely close to what we’re going through now.” Read more about the roots of the insurer’s financial crisis and how lawmakers are responding here. — Peter D’AuriaOn the moveAfter an influx of support in both chambers, the House passed a bipartisan tax credit package on Wednesday featuring a long-debated expansion of the state’s military pension tax exemption. The proposal, S.51, includes several ideas pitched by Republican Gov. Phil Scott and celebrated by Democratic legislative leaders as progressive tax policy. The suite of tax credits and exemptions are expected to reduce state tax revenue by more than $13 million annually.Rep. Bill Canfield, R-Fair Haven, serves as vice chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, which drafted the bill. He told his colleagues he’d submitted similar legislation for two decades without success. “I appreciate your leadership, cooperation and compromise,” he told Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, the committee’s chair. S.51, as passed by the House, exempts military pensions and survivor’s benefits for people with adjusted gross income under $125,000, and creates a partial exemption for those making less than $175,000. The bill also creates a $250 refundable tax credit for low-income veterans — not just those with military pensions — who make less than $25,000, with a partial credit available for those making less than $30,000.While the veteran-related credits have drawn the most political attention, they make up less than a third of the cost of the overall package. Read about the rest of the tax credits and exemptions in the bill here. — Ethan WeinsteinVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Federal forests Amid a wave of directives from the administration of President Donald Trump authorizing increased logging on the nation’s forests, Vermonters are assessing what impacts these actions could have. On March 1, the Trump administration issued an executive order to expand timber harvesting. As part of the order, administration officials were tasked with examining existing laws to identify ways to streamline environmental review processes to implement expanded timber production. In a map included in the secretary’s announcement, the federal land available for logging under the emergency declaration includes a sizable portion of the Green Mountain National Forest, which are woodlands that stretch through the southeastern and central region of the state.According to an analysis by the National Resources Defense Council, slightly more than 200,000 acres in Vermont are affected by the memorandum, which comprises 24% of Vermont’s federally owned land. Read more about the new federal timber harvesting directives and how Vermonters are reacting here. — Greta SolsaaRead the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Lawmakers learn the ins and outs of Vermont’s $5.4 billion dairy industry .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/farmworker-housing-6-20220907.jpg,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915

In a hearing Wednesday, attorneys for the coal miners argued that the shutdown of the CWHSP — which operates within the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health — means the government is not meeting its legal obligation to coal miners or others as the work the agency is statutorily required to do is no longer being performed.
Attorneys for the federal government argued that the closure of the CWHSP — as well as other departments within NIOSH — is temporary.
Workers were notified that they were to be on administrative leave on April 1. Last week, some were told to return to work. But this week they were once again moved back to leave and permanent terminations are slated to take place come June.
NIOSH as well as the services performed in it, attorneys for the government said, will eventually return in a reorganized form under the federal Department of Health and Human Services. As such, they contended that the lawsuit on behalf of coal miners was premature.
Those testifying during Wednesday’s hearing in front of U.S. District Judge Irene Berger included coal miners, epidemiologists from the CWHSP and supervisors from within NIOSH.
No one, including the attorneys representing the federal government, provided details or a timeline for when the agency would resume the duties it is required by law to perform.
Laura Reynolds, a supervisor over the CWHSP, was asked if she was aware of any plans or discussions happening to transfer the agency’s services to DHHS.
Her response was one word: “No.”
Scott Laney, who worked as an epidemiologist at NIOSH, said the community of researchers and providers qualified to do the work done by those at the CWHSP is quite small. He hasn’t heard of anyone being asked to do it and has not been included in any plans to train others.
“There is nobody who does the surveillance and breadth of what we do at NIOSH [for black lung],” Laney said.
Without plan to resume services, coal miners left exposed to dangerous dust
Meanwhile, coal miners who have been diagnosed with black lung — including Harry Wiley, a coal miner in Raleigh County who is the lead plaintiff on the class action suit — are in a dangerous position.
NIOSH plays a critical role in the Part 90 program, which allows workers diagnosed with black lung to transfer to a less dusty part of a mine without facing retribution or negative repercussions from a mine operator. Miners transferred under the rule have their pay, benefits and hours protected while being able to work in an area that is less likely to advance their black lung disease.
In order to qualify for Part 90, miners anywhere must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved.
But now there are no NIOSH workers. Laney said labs certified to test miners for black lung were instructed to stop in April since there was no one at the CWHSP to evaluate the results.
This leaves Wiley, who was diagnosed with black lung in November and who applied for a transfer under Part 90, without any options to protect himself from the dangerous disease advancing.
And the disease will advance, said Noemi Hall, another NIOSH epidemiologist.
The best protection to stop the progression of black lung — which has no cure and few treatment options — is prevention and reducing any exposure to coal mine dust, Laney said.
“We know that this intervention [of transferring workers to less dusty areas] works from the science,” Laney said. “[It’s] very clear in the scientific research.”
Debbie Johnson, the black lung program director at Bluestone Health in Princeton, told the court she knows of at least four coal miners from her clinic who are depending on the CWHSP to resume services.
Two have already entered their applications for a Part 90 transfer and two others need their results evaluated and certified.
None have heard from NIOSH.
Anita Wolfe, who retired from NIOSH in 2020 but still worked for the agency on a contract basis, said the CWHSP could see more than 5,000 x-rays a year that need to be evaluated. That’s 5,000 workers who could be at risk of developing a complicated and severe form of black lung disease without intervention.
Freeze on CWHSP occurs while silica dust rule under threat
While the federal government says its sorting out what a “reorganization” of NIOSH and the CWHSP will look like, it has also delayed the implementation of a federal labor rule that would have limited miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever.
That rule was meant to go into effect in April. It’s been delayed until August, however, partially due to the shakeups at NIOSH and the critical role workers there would have played in its implementation.
Sam Petsonk, a labor attorney representing the miners in their lawsuit against the federal government, said in an interview after Wednesday’s hearing that without the silica rule and without Part 90 transfers, miners are left with little to nothing to protect themselves.
“West Virginia coal miners fought to create these programs because workers here walked off the job, picketed and demanded protections for themselves and miners throughout the world,” Petsonk said. “This whole program was created to protect our miners. And now the government isn’t doing its part.”
Meanwhile, more than just the response actions NIOSH is mandated to perform are going undone. The agency was also responsible for critical research to aid in identifying and preventing black lung in miners.
That’s especially important today in central Appalachia, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of the region’s coal miners are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
“We’re seeing a lot of younger miners who are at that point [of needing a Part 90 transfer],” Johnson told the court Wednesday.
Before being told not to come to work in April, Hall was researching cases of black lung where individuals did not show symptoms but were developing the disease. Hall hoped that research could go toward working with miners to get tested early and frequently throughout their careers in order to stop symptoms from onsetting.
Now, she said, that work has been dropped and she doesn’t expect it to pick back up again.
While on the stand Wednesday, both Hall and Laney were asked two questions by Mike Becher, an attorney from Appalachian Mountain Advocates who is representing the coal miners.
“Do you feel through your work you’ve made a difference in the lives of coal miners?” Becher asked.
“I know that to be the case because of the scientific evidence,” Laney responded.
“Yes,” said Hall.
“Do you feel you’ve saved miners’ lives?” Becher asked.
“I do,” Laney said.
“Yes,” responded Hall.
The class action lawsuit against the federal government was filed on behalf of miners by Appalachian Mountain Advocates, Mountain State Justice and Petsonk PLLC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of West Virginia on April 21, 2025.
On Wednesday, Judge Berger said she would have a response to the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction to order NIOSH to resume its work “soon.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NIOSH-mobile-unit.jpeg,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915

After the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents detained eight migrant farmworkers, ICE officials deported three in early May “without due process,” according to their attorney.

Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerThe federal government deported three migrant farmworkers to Mexico this week, out of eight detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents last month on a dairy in northern Vermont.The deported workers include Luis Enrique Gomez-Aguiliar, 28; Urillas Sargento, 32; and Dani Alvarez-Perez, 22. A fourth worker, Juan Javier Rodriguez-Gomez, 41, has been detained in Louisiana, where he faces a high likelihood of imminent deportation, according to his attorney Brett Stokes.The workers were deported “without due process, in clear violation of their rights,” said Stokes, the lead attorney for all eight detainees and director of the Center for Justice Reform of Vermont Law and Graduate School, in a statement Wednesday. None of the three had been previously deported, he said.READ MORE
Both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Stokes said federal immigration officials were likely relying on an unprecedented expansion of an authority called “expedited removal.”The authority used to be applicable if a person was seeking entry or was found crossing the border into the United States. But since January, President Donald Trump’s administration has used that authority to arrest people who currently live in the United States and don’t fall under the traditional scope of this deportation process, according to Stokes.Stokes said the arrests were a “foreseeable result of the current enforcement landscape in this country” but that expedited removals are almost impossible to challenge.“I can’t appeal these decisions unfortunately,” Stokes said of the deportations. Instead he planned to connect with other folks in the country who’ve seen similar issues to take on the expansion of expedited authority. “I’m not sure there are any remedies for these three but the door, maybe, remains open,” he said Wednesday.The farmworkers were detained at Pleasant Valley Farms, the state’s largest dairy, less than 3 miles from the Canadian border in Berkshire after Border Patrol agents responded to a report alleging that two men wearing backpacks had crossed through the woods and onto the farm property.In April, Ryan Brisette, a spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, said in a written statement that agents apprehended one of those individuals while the second fled. “During the ensuing search of the area, agents located and apprehended additional individuals determined to be illegally present in the United States,” Brisette said.But Stokes said he did not believe any of the eight individuals arrested matched the identities of the two whom federal agents were initially investigating.“It’s remarkable because what we have here is the reported suspicious behavior of one, maybe two individuals, which results in the warrantless arrest of eight individuals, and based on my accounting of their stories, which I believe, none of them were the individuals being investigated,” Stokes said.The detentions happened on farm property, with most farmworkers detained while in a trailer where they fled after seeing immigration officials. They were arrested around 6 p.m. April 21, and they were booked into the Northwest State Correctional Facility between 4 and 6 a.m. the following day, according to Vermont’s jail tracker system.On May 1, three of the men were transferred to Louisiana, according to Stokes. They were held in the Alexandria Staging Facility, a 400-bed transfer center near an airport that holds detainees for about 72 hours before ICE removes them from the country. Rodriguez-Gomez was shown to be held at the facility on May 7, after he was temporarily transferred to a detention facility in New Hampshire, according to ICE’s online locator system.The other four remain at the Vermont correctional facility. At least one was seeking asylum before the arrest, according to Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based advocacy group for migrant workers.All eight workers have family in Vermont, said Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice, and some of those family members continue to work at the dairy.Vermont’s farming community has been nervous about the impact of the Trump administration’s ramp-up of deportations for those who don’t have authorization to work in the United States since Trump was elected last year.“There’s migrant farm labor on probably every farm in the state,” Stokes said. “But detentions like this were not common in Vermont until a couple of months ago.” Migrant workers are hired by almost every farm in Vermont, according to a 2025 report published by the state Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. Up to 850 migrant farmworkers are employed year-round by Vermont farms, mostly on dairies. About 500 more farmworkers, largely from Jamaica, are also hired seasonally through the H2A visa program, which supports agricultural workers who are in the U.S. temporarily.Nationally, migrants make up more than half of dairy laborers, according to the report, and  losing this workforce could nearly double retail milk prices and cost the U.S. economy more than $32 billion.“Farmers in Vermont tell us they are concerned about their workers and are doing their best to take care of them during a difficult time,” state agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts said in an emailed statement Wednesday, noting that immigration issues had created anxiety for farmworkers and farmers. “It’s time for Washington to address the issue,” Tebbetts said. “Reforming our visa and immigration laws would provide the nation with a legal and reliable workforce while maintaining our food supply, and the invaluable contributions of our migrant farm workers.”The co-owner of Pleasant Valley Farms, Amanda St. Pierre, said in an email that she didn’t have an update to share on the workers, and she did not respond to specific questions. Following the arrests in April, the company released a public statement on its Facebook that their “employees were hired following the federal and state employment requirements.”“What I can tell you is that we’re continuing to support them and all our employees,” St. Pierre wrote in the Wednesday email. “We hope this is resolved soon.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  3 migrant farmworkers deported to Mexico following detainment on state’s largest dairy.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-Day-2025-28-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915

Vasquez's office)Amidst upheavals in public land management, budget proposals to cut millions in funding from conservation and an amendment by House Republicans approving the sale of federal lands in two states, U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday announced a new bipartisan public lands caucus, co-chaired by U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Republican from Montana, to oppose the sale of public lands.
“Public lands are where I learned to fish, hunt, and connect with my family and culture — and those experiences shaped who I am,” Vasquez said in a statement. “These lands don’t belong to one party or one group of people; they belong to all of us. The Public Lands Caucus is about protecting that birthright — bringing Democrats and Republicans together to preserve access, defend conservation, and invest in the outdoor economy that powers rural communities like mine in southern New Mexico. This is personal for me, and I’m proud to lead this bipartisan effort to keep our public lands in public hands.”
NM delegation: Three national monuments could be reduced, eliminated

In addition to Vasquez and Zinke, the caucus includes 12 additional members, equally divided from both major parties.
“I follow the Theodore Roosevelt motto that public lands are ‘for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,’ and that means making sure we both conserve and manage those lands to ensure public access for the next generation,” Zinke said in a statement. “Public lands aren’t red or blue issues, it’s red white and blue. The bipartisan Public Lands Caucus brings together lawmakers who don’t agree on much, but we agree on and are ready to work together to promote policies that advance conservation and public access. I look forward to working with Co-Chair Vasquez, the vice chairs, and all the members of this caucus so future generations can enjoy the same opportunities to hunt, hike, fish, make a living and enjoy our uniquely American heritage.”
The initiative earned quick praise from the national Outdoor Recreation Roundtable nonprofit, whose Senior Vice President Whitney Potter Schwartz described the new caucus in a statement as “a significant and welcome step forward in protecting and expanding access to our public lands and waters that power America’s $1.2 trillion outdoor recreation economy and enrich the lives of millions of Americans. Keeping public lands public is a business imperative. There couldn’t be a more important time to stand up for America’s best return on investment and keep public land selloff out of reconciliation.”
Also in public lands congressional news, Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on Wednesday sent a scolding letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum over the advancement of authority to former DOGE staffer Tyler Hassen, accompanied by a list of questions regarding Hassen’s employment. The Interior Department, Heinrich notes in the letter, “plays a vital role in managing public lands, safeguarding cultural resources, and engaging in responsible energy development. Delegating sweeping authorities and responsibilities to a non-Senate confirmed person in violation of the Vacancies Reform Act is baffling and extremely troubling.”

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)About 180 Williston-area students are isolating at home after three schools were notified by public health officials of measles exposure on their campuses.
Unvaccinated students at Missouri Ridge Elementary, Williston Middle School and Williston High School were told they need to isolate for 21 days to ensure they were not infected, said Paula Lankford, spokesperson for Williston Basin School District 7. The precaution is to prevent students from unknowingly spreading the virus to others.
Health officials on Tuesday confirmed nine cases of measles in Williams County in northwest North Dakota. Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, said the measles cases are considered part of an outbreak because health officials believe community spread is occurring without direct contact with known carriers of the illness.
Four people diagnosed with measles were in Williston schools while infectious, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said.
The entire campuses of the affected schools were considered exposed, Lankford said. 
The quarantine requirement affects some unvaccinated fourth grade students who were touring Williston Middle School on the day of the exposure, Lankford said. It also affects a few other students who don’t attend the affected schools but shared a bus ride with an exposed student, she said.
“Each of the schools is going to work with those families that are excluded to ensure that they have educational opportunities for their kids and connections with teachers through digital means,” Lankford said.
The Williston school district has a total enrollment of about 5,300 students. 
Lankford encouraged parents, students or community members to contact their school or health care provider if they have questions.
“What’s obviously on our side is that there is not that much school left,” Lankford said. “We are done here on May 23rd.”
If Williston High School seniors under quarantine do not show any symptoms after their 21-day isolation, they will be allowed to participate in graduation commencement at the end of May, she said.
Of the confirmed cases, two are children under 10; five are between ages 10 and 19; one is between 30 and 39 and one is between 40 and 49, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The first case reported Friday was a Williams County child who is believed to have contracted measles from an out-of-state visitor.
The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rate for Williams County kindergarten students is 81% for the 2024-25 school year, down from 87% two years ago, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services. The rate is 95% for seventh graders and 97% for 11th graders. Public health officials say 95% is needed to prevent community spread. 
The Upper Missouri District Health Unit, which serves Williams County as well as Divide, McKenzie and Mountrail counties, is holding walk-in vaccination clinics at 110 W. Broadway, Williston, from 1-7 p.m. Thursday and 8:30 to 6 p.m. Friday.
Vaccination clinics planned in northwest North Dakota as measles cases rise to 9

“I feel like we maybe will be busy,” Clark said. “We’re fielding some phone calls today with people with questions, but you never know what that’ll look like when it actually becomes time.”
Clark said anyone experiencing cold symptoms or anyone who has been in contact with a carrier of the illness should not attend the vaccination clinic. Clark said those people should quarantine themselves for 21 days to prevent further spread of the disease.
“I think the biggest thing is, if they are a case contact or they are sick, don’t come to the clinic,” she said.
The vaccinations are not free of charge, she said, so clinic attendees will want to bring their private health insurance cards with them. Depending on their ages, those without health insurance could be eligible for reduced pricing through a state-funded vaccination program.
“I think there’s a lot of concern and I just recommend people go to trusted sites to get their information,” Clark said of community members who may be vaccine hesitant. She added the North Dakota Health and Human Services website is a good source for those looking for more information on the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.
Those planning on attending the walk-in MMR vaccine clinic in Williston can fill out the organization’s immunization consent form ahead of time to speed up the process once they arrive. The form can be found on the Upper Missouri District Health Unit website.
CHI St. Alexius Health medical center in Williston also urged people with symptoms to stay home and call a health care provider prior to coming to the clinic. CHI needed to temporarily close its Williston walk-in clinic on Wednesday after a possible measles exposure was reported, according to a social media post by the health care provider. 
Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. For information about measles, vaccines or local clinic availability, contact the HHS Immunization Unit at 701-328-2378 or visit hhs.nd.gov/measles.
Health officials also urged anyone who visited the Williston Walmart between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on April 29 to monitor for symptoms and contact a health care provider if symptoms develop.

The legislation faced more pushback in the Senate on Wednesday, a week after the House removed — with little discussion — measures meant to safeguard consumers and landowners. The bill ultimately passed, however, after senators spent roughly four hours venting their frustrations over the changes.

By a 35-11 vote, the Senate agreed to let the legislation go forward without provisions requiring energy-intensive data centers to cover their share of costs for new power plants built to power them or disclose how much water they plan to use.
The vote means data centers also will continue receiving sales tax credits for the computer equipment they purchase.
Utilities’ efficiency programs won’t be held to a set standard in terms of energy savings.
And power companies won’t be required to give landowners an earlier notice when construction of power plants, power lines, substations and pipelines impact their property.
The vote was not along party lines. The “no” votes came from three Democrats and eight Republicans.
“I just want everybody to understand what the consequence is going to be of not having some of those things in there,” said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, who authored the data center provisions in the version the Senate passed last month.
“Your constituents are going to be paying more for energy. They’re going to be paying more for energy because of the cost of generation, and that generation requirement is born largely because of data centers.”
“I’m going to tell you this: You’re going to regret this,” the Edgefield Republican added.
At the heart of the bill, sponsored by GOP House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter, is permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility Santee Cooper to partner on a possible 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant on the site of a former coal-fired power plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
Furthermore, utility executives told legislators they needed guarantees that state regulators would review power-related permits in a timely manner as they seek to make updates to the state’s power grid.
They asked for measures to prevent years-long delays of new pipelines and power plants in the court system. And they sought a section to make it easier to raise power bills on an annual basis, arguing smaller but more frequent increases would be easier for those on a fixed income to adjust to.
“South Carolina is growing, and with that growth comes additional demand for accessible, affordable and reliable energy. We thank the General Assembly for recognizing this and passing critical energy reform legislation,” the South Carolina Manufacturers Association wrote in support of the bill passed after two years of hearings and debate.
Dominion Energy, in a statement, also applauded passage of the bill it said would result in “the ability to provide critically needed electricity and natural gas to power homes and businesses in the Palmetto State efficiently and cost effectively.”
Massey said he’s not opposed to a new natural gas plant-fired power plant.

“What I’m opposed to is making people pay for more than they should have to pay for, and we’re sanctioning it,” he said. “There is nothing in this bill that the utilities don’t like. They’re getting everything they want.”
In its original form, the legislation saw significant pushback on its sweeping regulatory changes and rollback of consumer protections passed in the wake of South Carolina’s failed nuclear expansion. The final legislation ultimately left those existing protections in place.
Sen. Tom Davis, the author of efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce power use in the state, lamented the removal of the other Senate-added safeguards.
“But what I have to weigh is taking what I think is a substantial step forward and accepting it or rejecting it,” the Beaufort Republican said in explaining his “yes” vote. “The bottom line for me is I don’t want to take that risk.”
Davis also reminded legislators that artificial intelligence, powered by data centers, is on track to impact all aspects of the global economy, from energy to health care.
“That’s the way industry is moving. The good jobs, the high paying jobs, the jobs we want in the future, are going to be added to those components,” he said. “It would be a very big mistake, in my opinion, to send a message that we don’t want data centers.”
On the other hand, Davis expressed confidence that data center developers and utility companies now understand their deals are going to be more heavily scrutinized.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/electricity-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915
,DC,2025-05-07 22:17:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. House panel debates FEMA’s role, as Trump administration eyes 'top-down reform'",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-panel-debates-femas-role-trump-administration-eyes-top-down-reform,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House lawmakers on Wednesday began debating when the Federal Emergency Management Agency should provide state and local communities with help addressing natural disasters and when aid should be handled by others.The Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee’s hearing on FEMA’s budget for the upcoming fiscal year came just days after the Trump administration sent its spending proposal to Capitol Hill.That “skinny” request, however, didn’t include an actual spending level for FEMA, only suggesting that Congress cut $646 million for various non-disaster grant programs, including Targeting Violence and Terrorism Prevention, and the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium.Chairman Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, urged the FEMA official at the hearing to get the full budget request to the committee sooner rather than later.“If we don't have the information, it's going to be a problem,” he said. “And I'm not threatening. You don't need threatening. We don't work that way.”Amodei also told Cam Hamilton, senior official performing the duties of the administrator at FEMA, that the agency needs to communicate with lawmakers better, especially those on the panel that provides its funding.“I'm not trying to horn in on your guys' discretion of running your program,” Amodei said. “But what I am definitely trying to horn in on is, not being faced with a situation where the bell’s already been rung. Now I’ve got to un-ring the bell.”Amodei was referencing FEMA halting funding for Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, grants, including for three projects within a few miles of his front porch that he didn’t know existed until recently.Hamilton said that Trump administration officials “found a lot of inefficiencies with the design of the program itself, which caused us to have serious concern over whether it was the appropriate use of taxpayer funds for many projects that were funded that we believe were very wasteful.”“But there are also projects that were fully funded that we intend to move forward to completion,” Hamilton added. “We're unpacking and analyzing that. Every grant recipient, under BRIC, should receive some form of notification” soon from FEMA regional offices. No budget numbersThe 90-minute hearing, which would typically have centered around the numbers in FEMA’s budget request, was instead a bit of a referendum on the size and scope of the agency, as well as expectations the Trump administration will seek to significantly reduce its mission.Hamilton, asked point-blank if FEMA should continue to exist, testified that he personally did “not believe it is in the best interest of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.”“Having said that, I'm not in a position to make decisions and impact outcomes on whether or not a determination, such as consequential as that should be made,” he said. “That is a conversation that should be had between the president of the United States and this governing body on identifying the exact ways and methodologies, in which, what is prudent for federal investment, and what is not.”Illinois Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood, ranking member on the panel, said she would not support efforts to completely shift FEMA responsibilities onto state and local governments.State emergency management leaders, she said, “are not equipped to handle the roles FEMA currently plays—- marshaling emergency resources for multiple federal agencies, providing flood insurance, conducting damage assessments and distributing billions of dollars in recovery funds.”“Pushing disaster response and recovery fully back to the states is dangerous and unrealistic,” Underwood said.Hamilton said the Trump administration is looking at ways to institute “top-down reform” and “overhaul the grant process entirely” as well as other possible recommendations from the FEMA review council.“FEMA was established to provide focused support in truly catastrophic disasters,” Hamilton said. “Yet at times, we have strayed far from that core mission and evolved into an over-extended federal bureaucracy; attempting to manage every type of emergency, no matter how minor.“Instead of being a last resort, FEMA is all too often used by states and public officials as a financial backstop for routine issues that, frankly, should be handled locally. This misalignment has fostered a culture of dependency, waste, inefficiency, while also delaying crucial aid to Americans who are in genuine need.”Disaster relief deficitOne of the more immediate budgetary issues facing FEMA is that its disaster relief fund is slated to run at least a $9 billion deficit before the end of the year, which several lawmakers raised concerns about during the hearing.The Trump administration, however, does not plan to send Congress a supplemental spending request, asking lawmakers for more money for that account.The disaster relief fund is able to run deficits, unlike the vast majority of federal programs. When the DRF runs out of funding, FEMA uses something called immediate needs funding to keep providing response and recovery to communities with declared disasters.Hamilton said, even with the expected use of immediate needs funding again this year, FEMA was prepared to respond to hurricane season and ongoing wildfires.“There are always challenges that we have to work through,” Hamilton said. “So we are focusing on ways to make us operationally more capable, and also finding ways to be more fiscally practical with our means, so that we don't buttress us up against those kinds of thresholds nearly as quickly as before.”",,,,2025-05-07 19:05:01.066915

(Courtesy of Huron Regional Medical Center)Norma Torres Ortiz quit her full-time job at a Huron nursing home in February 2019 to spend her days studying for the national nurse licensure exam. 
Her first language isn’t English, it’s Spanish. Originally from Puerto Rico, she still considers English a struggle. 
To pass a challenging professional exam in a language she’s still learning, she had to work twice as hard.
It took the 47-year-old two years to pass the test, succeeding in June 2019. Now, she’s a travel nurse contracted with Avera Health and working part time at the Huron Regional Medical Center.
“Every single time I write ‘RN’ by my name, I stop and feel so grateful,” Torres Ortiz said. “I didn’t think I’d ever pass.”
Desperation and renewal: How Huron embraced new Americans and thrived

After moving to South Dakota in 2018 in the years after being displaced by Hurricane Maria, Torres Ortiz learned that many other non-English-speaking U.S. citizens, immigrants and refugees with professional nursing backgrounds live in the Huron area.
But like she was initially, they were standing along meatpacking assembly lines or cleaning houses. Studying for the licensure exam, or NCLEX, would mean they’d have to study English harder, take time off work or quit their jobs entirely, she said.
It’s a missed opportunity, Torres Ortiz said, as health care systems in Huron, elsewhere in South Dakota and across the country suffer a nursing shortage. South Dakota is projected to have one of the highest nursing shortages in the county by 2030. There are 11 nursing vacancies at Huron Regional Medical Center currently.
So Torres Ortiz led an effort to help non-English speaking nurses study for the exam. It turned into the state’s first registered nursing apprenticeship through Huron Regional Medical Center. The program was approved by the state in February.
Apprenticeship serves as alternative to international hiring program
Larger health care systems like Sanford, Avera and Monument are building international nursing programs, recruiting and hiring nurses through work visas. International nurses must also pass the NCLEX to work in the state. 
Avera Health has commitments from more than 170 international nurses, with one starting with the hospital system this year and another six planning to start working before the end of the year. Monument has hired international nurses since 2017. Though the program in western South Dakota has employed about 30 nurses a year, the program has dwindled to less than 10 due to federal visa backlogs. Sanford employs more than 700 internationally trained nurses across its five-state footprint, with plans to hire another 300 in the coming year or two.
Employing international nurses is a “long-term strategy” to stabilize the health care workforce, said Erica DeBoer, system vice president and chief nursing officer with Sanford.
“With an aging workforce and population, there’s truly not enough individuals to help care for all the patients that need our support,” DeBoer said. 
Smaller systems like Huron can’t afford to hire large numbers of international nurses through an agency, said Brooke Sydow, program manager for the health system. The study group and apprenticeship program allows the system to tap into a market beyond its traditional university and technical college pipeline.
And apprenticeship programs aren’t new to the health system. Sydow said the system launched a practical nursing apprenticeship to build its workforce in 2018. A licensed practice nurse provides basic nursing care to patients and works under the supervision of registered nurses.
Reflecting the diversity of the Huron community
Apprentices start the new program by taking a medical language course for English language learners, enrolling in the licensing exam preparation class and training at the Huron hospital alongside a veteran nurse. There are five students in the group, which started in May last year, though Torres Ortiz hopes to see more join.
The classes alone cost the hospital about $1,350 per person. Sydow expects the total cost per apprentice will vary between $25,000 and $50,000, depending on how long they shadow another staff member. Sydow plans to cover all, or nearly all, expenses for apprentices through the hospital or with state funding, to financially support apprentices while they train so they can quit their other jobs and focus on their education. She plans to hire three apprentices in the first round.
It’s worth the cost, Sydow said, because the health care system is investing in Huron’s increasingly diverse community.
Beadle County is 68% white, 15% Hispanic or Latino and 12% Asian, according to 2023 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. The county has the highest percentage of Hispanic or Latino residents in the state.
That diversity is largely due to refugees from the Karen ethnic group, originally from Myanmar (formerly Burma), who moved to Huron starting in 2006, initially to work at a turkey plant. A wave of Hispanic immigrants moved to the county since 2000, also attracted by food processing and manufacturing plants.
“We’re trying to make our workforce reflect our community population,” Sydow said. “So that’s a big piece of it: helping the community feel more connected and at home, so we have practitioners, providers and nurses who are the same as them.”
Torres Ortiz would like to help more Puerto Ricans fill immediate nursing needs in South Dakota. 
Before she moved to Florida in 2017 after being displaced by Hurricane Maria, she earned her bachelor’s degree in nursing in Puerto Rico. But she wasn’t able to find a job because there were too few positions for the number of nurses at that time, she said. Instead, she cleaned houses and businesses. She followed her son to South Dakota after he started working in the area.
“When you post a nursing job in Puerto Rico, you could get 20 applications in an hour,” Torres Ortiz said. “Here in Huron, you wait months to find and hire someone.”

The temporary online processing of duplicate and replacement licenses and ID cards will allow DFA officials to focus on issuing REAL IDs, according to a press release. New, first-time licenses may still be obtained at any State Revenue Office. Renewals will also continue normally for licenses and IDs within 90 days of expiration, as has been the policy for years, according to the release. 
As of Wednesday, REAL IDs, which are signified by a gold star on a driver’s license or state-issued ID card, are required for Americans boarding domestic flights or entering certain federal buildings. 
REAL IDs began with a 2005 law passed by Congress in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the state finance department website.
State officials said DFA has issued record numbers of REAL IDs this week, about 10,000 per day, ahead of Wednesday’s deadline, according to the press release. More than 132,000 were issued between April 1 and early May. 
This week, DFA will focus on ensuring those with immediate travel plans have access to a REAL ID, according to the release. The state agency will continue issuing REAL IDs after Wednesday, and Arkansans may obtain a REAL ID at any of the state’s 134 Revenue Offices. 
More information, including what paperwork is needed to obtain a REAL ID, is available on the state finance department’s website.

,DC,2025-05-07 22:04:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House Republicans berate Haverford College president over campus antisemitism,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republicans-berate-haverford-college-president-over-campus-antisemitism,,"WASHINGTON — A trio of college presidents from across the nation Wednesday took heat from U.S. House lawmakers, as Republicans expand their drive to penalize higher education institutions they say have failed to combat antisemitism.The presidents of Pennsylvania’s Haverford College, DePaul University in Chicago and California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo appeared before the House Committee on Education and Workforce to detail the steps the schools have taken to address antisemitism at their schools.But it was the Haverford president, Wendy Raymond, who drew the most outrage from Republicans, including a tense exchange with Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, when Raymond could not say how many students have been disciplined recently for antisemitic conduct.Stefanik called Raymond’s responses “completely unacceptable.”The hearing in the GOP-controlled House education panel — the first on antisemitism since President Donald Trump took office — came as his administration takes drastic steps to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from several elite institutions across the country over claims that the schools are harboring antisemitism on their campuses.Harvard University has had grant funding yanked by the administration for permitting “intolerable” harassment of Jewish students.Trump officials have also attempted to make elite institutions align more with the administration ideologically.GOP lawmakers have focused on antisemitism in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and college protests that surfaced across the country last year over the war in Gaza. Now they are moving on beyond the Ivy League.Chairman Tim Walberg said “the scourge of antisemitism has taken root far beyond the country’s best-known ivory towers, and it’s our responsibility as a committee to unearth and address antisemitism at these schools, too, and others, especially as antisemitism is at a historic high in the United States.”“Antisemitism is proliferating at colleges across the country, both private and public, in rural, urban and suburban settings,” the Michigan Republican said.Haverford president apologizesRepublicans on the panel expressed particular dissatisfaction with testimony offered from Haverford’s Raymond.The small liberal arts college, founded in 1833, is located in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Raymond acknowledged that in reaction to the war in Gaza, “events have occurred on our campus that are inconsistent with our values” and apologized to Haverford’s Jewish community. She did not elaborate on the incidents.She said the college has taken “significant steps to address these issues and strengthen our policies.”“That includes updating our policies, strengthening campus safety programs, deepening engagement with the Jewish community, launching programs to combat antisemitism and forming our ad hoc committee on free expression.”Asked by Walberg how many students have been expelled or suspended for antisemitic conduct since Hamas’ 2023 attack, Raymond was the only one of the three presidents who could not provide concrete numbers.Raymond said Haverford does not publicize that information but that suspension and expulsion are “normal parts” of their disciplinary process.‘Straightforward questions’Stefanik took aim at Raymond’s refusal to offer more details on any actions taken by the school regarding antisemitism.During a heated exchange between Stefanik and Raymond, the Haverford president said: “Respectfully, representative, I will not be talking about individual cases here.”Stefanik fired back, saying: “Respectfully, president of Haverford, many people have sat in this position who are no longer in the positions as president of universities for their failure to answer straightforward questions.” Stefanik was pointing to multiple university presidents she grilled who appeared before the House education panel for hearings regarding campus antisemitism and later resigned, including leaders at Harvard, Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.Raymond had said that there “have been some” disciplinary actions taken by Haverford related to antisemitism but did not offer details.“For the American people watching: You still don’t get it. Haverford still doesn’t get it. It’s a very different testimony than the other presidents who are here today, who are coming with specifics,” Stefanik said. DePaul’s president, Robert Manuel, detailed a number of steps the university is taking, including implementing a new ID verification and mask policy, placing  new limits on campus protests and suspending the operations of a student group that Walberg claimed is “at the very center” of the school’s “antisemitism problem.”Cal Poly’s president, Jeffrey Armstrong, said “when alleged antisemitism or harassment occurs, we investigate and impose immediate university discipline.”He also said the university is enhancing its mandatory student orientation and biannual employee training to provide greater education and awareness on antisemitism.At the end of her heated exchange with Raymond, Stefanik said “this is completely unacceptable, and it’s why this committee has stepped in, because higher education has failed to address the scourge of antisemitism, putting Jewish students at risk at Haverford and other campuses across the country.”Democrats criticize cuts at Education DepartmentMeanwhile, Democrats on the panel criticized Republicans on the committee for pursuing hearings on antisemitism when the Trump administration has made huge cuts to the U.S. Department of Education, including its Office for Civil Rights that’s tasked with investigating discrimination complaints.Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the panel, said “in its first three months, the Trump administration has closed down seven of 12 OCR regional offices, all of which conduct investigations into discrimination on campus, whether it be based on antisemitism or race, national origin, gender or disability.”The Virginia Democrat also pointed to reports of nearly half of the OCR staff being laid off. “One is left to wonder: how can OCR carry out its important responsibilities with half the staff?” he said.Scott added that the administration’s move to dismantle OCR “raises reasonable doubt about the plans for addressing antisemitism on campus as well as racism, homophobia, sexism, Islamophobia or the needs of students with disabilities.”",,,,2025-05-07 18:07:06.197754

(BlueOval SK photo)A nonprofit faith-based group that seeks to leverage its investing to advance human rights, racial equity and “the common good” is calling on automaker Ford to address claims of anti-union activities at the BlueOval SK battery plant in Kentucky.
The letter from Investor Advocates for Social Justice details the group’s concerns over “strong indications that BlueOval Kentucky is engaging in union avoidance activities,” ranging from disseminating “anti-union flyers and media” to the United Auto Workers (UAW) telling the Washington Post that anti-union consultants have been brought in to persuade workers against unionization. 
The UAW launched a campaign last year to unionize the BlueOval SK battery plant in Hardin County, and workers at the plant in January asked the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election. The BlueOval SK battery plant, one of two planned at Glendale to produce batteries for electric vehicles, is jointly owned by Ford and South Korean company SK Group. 
The investor group is urging Ford to address the concerns in an annual shareholder meeting Thursday. 
“Companies have an obligation to respect human rights, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, and to extend this obligation to their business relationships, which include joint ventures,” the investor group wrote in part. “Failure to uphold these rights can expose investors to material risks, including operational, reputational, regulatory, legal, and financial risks.” 
The letter also noted concerns brought by a community group in Tennessee over a BlueOval SK electric vehicle and battery plant there urging Ford to sign an agreement ensuring the operation doesn’t harm the community environmentally or socioeconomically. 
The letter comes after the New Jersey-based Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace, one of the members of the investor group, tried to offer a proposal to be voted on at Ford’s shareholder meeting that would have requested the company’s board of directors adopt a “noninterference” policy for when workers seek to unionize at joint venture plants. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted Ford’s request to block the proposal from being voted on ahead of the meeting. 
Susan Francois, assistant congregation leader and treasurer of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace, in a statement said their Catholic community believes “it is both good business and the right thing to do to call on companies like Ford to respect human rights.” 
“We urge Ford to effectively and expeditiously address these issues, which are not going away just because the shareholders have been prevented from voting on it,” Francois said. “God expects the economy to support life and the livelihood of all, not the few.” 
A news release about the investors letters notes that taxpayers have spent billions supporting Ford’s joint venture. The federal government announced $9.63 billion in loans in December to the three BlueOveral SK battery plants. Tennessee approved $900 million in incentives while Kentucky is providing $250 million in public subsidies.
Emails sent Wednesday afternoon to Ford and BlueOval SK requesting comment on the letter were not immediately returned.

Doug Wozniak (R-Shelby Twp.) listens to testimony during a meeting of the state House Joint Committee on Administrative Rules on May 7, 2025. | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsMichigan lawmakers heard testimony Wednesday on rules currently being considered that would halt elected officials from working around state prohibitions on accepting gifts from lobbyists.
Michigan law bars elected officials from accepting gifts, like sports tickets or flights if they’re valued above $79, the value set for 2025, but there are concerns that officials have been working around those restrictions by saying they’ve reimbursed back the excess over the legal maximum, in order to appear in compliance. However, there is no guarantee that those elected officials are reimbursing the difference.
The change being considered by the Michigan Office of Administrative Hearings and Rules, or MOAHR, would ban public officials from reimbursing lobbyists in-whole or in-part for the value of a gift that exceeds the maximum allowed value.
An investigation published by the Detroit News last year found that for years lobbyists have been sending lawmakers letters after providing gifts over the allowed value, requesting the excess amount with no way of tracking if the reimbursements ever occur.
Michigan lawmakers have touted plans for government transparency with legislators across the aisle calling for accountability from lawmakers, from making more of Michigan’s government subject to information requests, to limiting the influence of lobbyists on policymakers.
Michigan voters in 2022 voted for requirements for financial disclosure by the Legislature, the governor and lieutenant governor, as well as secretary of state and the attorney general. The new requirements mandate that elected officials, as well as candidates for certain offices have to file annual financial disclosure reports including streams of income and other assets.
Though the partisanly split Legislature has different ideas for how to make government more transparent, Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) said during the Michigan House Joint Committee on Administrative Rules meeting Wednesday, there is a great appetite overall for reform when it comes to establishing trust in Michigan’s government. However, Farhat said rather than create a more transparent process, the pending rules change would ensure that wealthier individuals who enter into office have distinct networking advantages over those with less capital.
“It’s not making it more transparent,” Farhat said. “Everyone that is independently elected comes from a different background of lived experience and a different appreciation for certain abilities to network. These basically just box out those that are coming from different economic backgrounds.”
The process to implement the new rules began last year when Michigan attorney Robert Labrant requested the Department of State to issue an interpretive statement condemning the reimbursement system as a violation of the Michigan Lobby Law.
In July of last year the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office issued a statement saying reimbursing lobbyists or lobbyist agents for the value of a ‘gift’ over $76.00, is prohibited under the Lobby Act.
“Allowing the cost of a gift to be allocated across multiple parties, be they lobbyists or public officials, cannot circumvent the gift ban and in doing so would frustrate the purposes of the Lobby Act,” the statement from the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office said.

The request for a preliminary injunction, a news release from the AG’s office said, would stop the imposition of the tariffs during the litigation process.
A news release announcing the lawsuit last month said its arguments stem from Article 1 of the Constitution, which bestows the power to create tariffs solely upon Congress, excepting, perhaps, in emergency situations as delineated in the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In the case of Trump’s tariffs, the AGs contend: Trump lacks the authority to impose them and no “unusual and extraordinary threat” justifies invocation of the IEEPA.
The Tuesday motion requests the U.S. Court of International Trade to order federal agencies to stop any tariffs the Trump administration has imposed and to pause the president’s plan on July 9 to raise tariffs on imports from more than 50 other trading partners.
“These tariffs are both unlawful and reckless,” Torrez said in a statement. “President Trump does not have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without a legitimate national emergency. These actions bypass Congress, violate the Constitution, and are already hitting American families in their wallets. We need immediate relief to stop further harm to working people.”
The AGs office says the plaintiffs also submitted economic analyses to the court that “shows that state and local governments in the 12 states joining the motion stand to pay at least $3.4 billion per year in additional costs due to the tariffs,” along with a Federal Reserve report that notes businesses expect cost growth from the tariffs and most plan to pass those increased costs on to customers.

During his tenure in the Idaho Legislature, Crabtree supported literary instruction initiatives and pushed to make kindergarten available all day, not just as a half-day class.
During his final legislative session in 2022, Crabtree co-sponsored House Bill 731, a law that spells out requirements to screen Idaho students for dyslexia and provides dyslexia professional development training for educators. House Bill 731 received bipartisan support, passed both chambers of the Idaho Legislature unanimously and was signed into law by Gov. Brad Little on March 23, 2022.
Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield announced Crabtree’s death in social media posts Tuesday night and issued a press release mourning Crabtree on Wednesday.
“Today, I lost one of my dearest friends and Idaho lost a true champion,” Critchfield wrote. “Carl Crabtree was more than a colleague — he was a cowboy at heart, a fierce advocate for education and a man whose integrity shaped everything he touched. Carl’s passion for serving Idaho’s students and families never wavered, even in the face of his personal battle with cancer. From his work championing early literacy and dyslexia resources to his tireless efforts supporting educators, Carl’s legacy will live on in the lives he changed.”
  Former Idaho legislator was a ‘Friend of Education’ award recipient 

The Idaho School Boards Association honored Crabtree in 2022 with its “Friend of Education” award, and in 2023 Lewis-Clark State College honored Crabtree with its “President’s Medallion” award.

After he was defeated in the 2022 Republican primary election, Crabtree worked for the Idaho Department of Education as director of intergovernmental affairs.
Before serving in the Idaho Legislature, Crabtree worked as a rancher, an extension agent for the University of Idaho, oversaw local 4-H programs in his community for decades and was active with several cattle organizations.
Before his recent battle with brain cancer, Crabtree had beaten esophageal cancer following a 2022 diagnosis, officials said
“Carl was one of the most genuine, hardworking and kind-hearted people I’ve ever known,” Critchfield wrote. “He was a cowboy through and through — steadfast, loyal and full of grit. While I mourn the passing of my dear friend, I am deeply grateful for the time we shared.”

Yellowstone National Park officials issued a press release Wednesday saying the man was gored after he got too close to a bison in the Lake Village area of Yellowstone National Park.
Park officials did not release the man’s name, and said the situation remains under investigation as of Wednesday.
“Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal,” Yellowstone National Park officials wrote in the press release. “They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.”
Under Yellowstone National Park rules, visitors are required to stay more than 25 yards away from all large animals, including bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose and coyotes. For bears and wolves specifically, people must stay at least 100 yards away, park officials wrote.
“Wildlife in Yellowstone are wild and can be dangerous,” Yellowstone officials wrote. “Wild animals can be aggressive if people don’t respect their space.”
Sunday’s goring was the first bison-related injury of 2025, Yellowstone officials wrote.
Yellowstone National Park officials have published a series of online safety tips related to safely viewing wildlife from a distance in the park.

According to Sebastian County Circuit Court records, LaDaryl Lankford faces five felony charges: rape, second-degree sexual assault, video voyeurism, possession of digital child pornography and the introduction of a controlled substance into the body of another.
The medical board did not mention Lankford by name at Tuesday’s brief special-called meeting, but chairman Ward Gardner said the “allegations of a most severe nature” constituted “an issue of public health, safety and wellness.”
A public records request to the medical board confirmed Lankford was the subject of the meeting. There was no audible objection from any board member to the motion to suspend Lankford’s license and investigate the allegations.

Lankford criminal info 
Lankford allegedly committed rape and sexual assault against victims who were “incapable of consent because they were physically helpless” and introduced a controlled substance to the body of another “with the purpose to commit any felony sexual offense.” These situations occurred between Jan. 1, 2021 and March 30, 2025, according to court documents.
The charges of video voyeurism, which involves recording someone who “has a reasonable expectation of privacy and has not consented to the observation,” and possession of child pornography occurred between Jan. 1, 2016 and March 30, 2025, according to court documents.
The arrest warrant for Lankford, 46, was issued April 21, and he was arrested April 28, according to court documents. He pleaded not guilty April 30, and he is scheduled to stand trial in September.
Lankford obtained his medical degree from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in 2005 and applied for his license to practice family medicine in 2007, according to medical board documents.
In 2015, Lankford was among several defendants in a medical malpractice lawsuit from the widow of a deceased Mulberry man, allegedly for failing to provide timely medical care to the man’s abdominal issues that led to his death. The case was dismissed in 2017, re-filed in 2018 and dismissed again in 2020.
State Medical Board records show that in 2019, it issued Lankford a warning after he was found to be prescribing opioids to patients before providing the board with proof of registration to the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.
Arkansas Medical Board revokes license of Little Rock gastroenterologist

The board has addressed allegations of sex crimes and improper administration of drugs against multiple physicians in the past year. In August 2024, the board revoked the license of gastroenterologist Alonzo Williams of Little Rock. The board rejected sexual harassment charges against Williams but accepted charges of negligence and malpractice, including improper opioid prescriptions.
In September 2024, the medical board began an investigation into Forrest City physician Sudesh Banaji, who has been charged with rape and sexual assault. A former employee of Banaji’s later accused him of sexual harassment.
The medical board denied Banaji’s request in December to return to practice with some restrictions while the legal action against him is still pending.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved the Healthy Kids Iowa demonstration project in lieu of the federal government’s summer nutrition program for children, Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Wednesday.  
A press release from the governor’s office called the program an alternative to the federal program that will feed children “healthier foods at a lower cost.”
According to the release, Healthy Kids Iowa will leverage partnerships with summer feeding programs and community providers that have more than 500 access points across the state. 
In a video posted to her social media accounts, Reynolds said the program will allow eligible families to select $40 of “fresh, nutritious food” each month from the access points. 
“We’re going to focus on easy to prepare meals for kids, without compromising nutrition,” Reynolds said in the video. 
The distribution sites will offer a selection of foods each month that are “healthy and kid friendly” according to the press release. 
Families with children aged 4 to 18 and with household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty level are eligible for the program. For a household of four, that represents an annual income of around $57,700 or lower.
Access points are determined by Feeding America Food Banks that will identify “areas of need” throughout Iowa. Families will apply for the program with The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, application.
Iowa is one of only 11 states not participating in the federal program, known as SUN Bucks, this summer, according to USDA. The state also opted out of the program in 2024, and instead chose to expand the number of summer meal sites in the state. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins applauded Reynolds for what she called an “historic step.”
“We are encouraging governors across the entire country to explore creative ways to provide food for those in need while also doing right by the American tax payer,” Rollins said in a video statement.
According to Des Moines Area Religious Council, this $900,000 expansion in 2024 still left an estimated 54% of Iowa school districts without a meal site in 2024. 
The SUN Bucks program is also called the Summer EBT, or electronic benefits transfer, program because funds are distributed on EBT cards monthly, allowing recipients to shop at eligible stores. 
The SUN Bucks program provides $120 to families per eligible school-aged child during the summer. Children who qualify for free or reduced school lunches, or families who already participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are eligible for SUN Bucks. 
According to USDA in 2024 when the program launched, it represented a $100 million investment. 
Reynolds has opposed the federal SUN Bucks program for fear that it would lead to unhealthy food purchases and worsen childhood obesity. 
in August 2024, Iowa submitted a waiver request as part of an effort to implement a program similar to Healthy Kids Iowa, which the USDA denied. 
Reynolds said in November she would try again for a waiver, hoping for an outcome in her favor under the Trump administration. Food security advocates then urged the governor to instead apply for the demonstration project in tandem with the federally available program. 
Iowa Hunger Coalition, in a statement Wednesday, said it was concerned about the barriers Healthy Kids Iowa might place on families trying to access it, and on the “feeding organizations who are already experiencing record-breaking levels of need.”
“We continue to believe that the best way to serve Iowa’s low-income kids during the summer is through evidence-based USDA summer meal programs: summer meal sites, grab ‘n go sites, and Summer EBT, or SUN Bucks,” the statement read.
The coalition said the distribution of summer nutrition funds via EBT, per the SUN Bucks program, reaches families who live in rural communities or have working parents who might not be able to make it to a food pantry or feeding center during its operating hours.
“As further details are released about the Healthy Kids Iowa Pilot Program we hope these concerns are addressed to ensure that each and every child who qualifies is served and has their individual nutritional needs met by the program,” the statement read.

A federal judge in New York issued a preliminary order Tuesday blocking the Trump administration from cutting off states’ access to hundreds of millions of dollars in pandemic relief funds for public schools, including more than $77 million for Illinois.

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, of the Southern District of New York, issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of an order that Education Secretary Linda McMahon issued on Friday, March 28. That order reversed earlier decisions to grant the states additional time to spend funds they had been allocated.

The effect of McMahon’s order was to immediately cut off access to funds that states said they had already committed to spend but not yet made the actual expenditures.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined a coalition of 17 states in suing the federal government to block McMahon’s order.

“The Trump administration’s shortsighted and illegal decision to attempt to rescind already-appropriated education funding would hurt vulnerable students the most and could wreak havoc on the budgets of school districts throughout Illinois and the nation,” Raoul said in a statement Tuesday.

The lawsuit over pandemic-related education money is one of more than a dozen multistate suits Raoul has joined, in combination with other Democratic state attorneys general, challenging actions Trump has taken since being sworn in for a second term Jan. 20.

In 2020 and 2021, Congress passed several relief and economic stimulus packages totaling trillions of dollars to help individuals, businesses and state and local governments deal with the financial consequences of the pandemic. For schools, that included costs associated with preparing for the safe return to in-person learning, addressing the learning loss students suffered during the extended period of school closures, and addressing some of the unique needs of homeless children that were exacerbated by the pandemic.

According to the complaint, Illinois was awarded just over $5 billion in “education stabilization” funds under the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, which was enacted in March 2021. Of that, $77.2 million remained obligated but not yet spent as of the end of March 2025.

Those funds had been earmarked for such things as teacher mentoring, statewide instructional coaching, new principal mentoring, trauma response initiatives, the creation of social-emotional learning hubs and contracts for technology infrastructure upgrades, according to the complaint.

Under ARPA, those funds were intended to cover expenses incurred through Sept. 30, 2023. Subsequent legislation gave states an additional year, to Sept. 30, 2024, to “obligate” their funds. And under agency regulations, they had another 120 days beyond that to draw down the funds, although they were also given the option of requesting further extensions.

In January 2025, Illinois requested, and later received, permission to extend its deadline for drawing down the remainder of its funds to March 28, 2026. Other states involved in the lawsuit also received extensions.

But on Friday, March 28, 2025, the Department of Education issued a memo rescinding those extensions, effectively cutting off the states’ access to any unspent funds.

“Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion,” McMahon said in a memo to state education agency heads.

The injunction means the Department of Education cannot enforce the order, at least while the case is still being litigated or until the court issues a different order.

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Among the many federal laws that do not apply to the Wabanaki Nations due to a land settlement act is one that offers federally recognized tribes the right to exclusively regulate and take in revenue from gambling on tribal lands. 
Last month, the majority of the Maine Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted in favor of a bill, LD 1164, that would give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine, though Wabanaki leaders say there is not much appetite from the governor for that change and the privately owned casinos are opposed, which could hamper that bill’s chance of success. 
On Wednesday, the committee heard testimony on another proposal, LD 1851, which, rather than altering the structure of who controls gaming, seeks to provide equality among the Wabanaki Nations in how much revenue they are provided from slot machine income in the state. 
“One of the primary purposes of this bill is parity,” said Zeke Crofton-Macdonald, Tribal Ambassador for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians.
The federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 codified that tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming on their lands, unless the state in which it operates prohibits such gaming under its criminal laws. 
However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act has made it so the Wabanaki Nations are treated more akin to municipalities than independent nations, one way being that the Tribes are unable to benefit from any federal law passed after 1980, unless they are specifically mentioned in the law.
In 2022, the Maine Legislature amended the Settlement Act to permit the Tribes to handle sports betting, so the legislation being considered this session would build off of that earlier expansion. 
Sponsored by Rep. Marc Malon (D-Biddeford) and co-sponsored by Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland), LD 1851 would increase the total net slot machine income to be collected and distributed by a casino from 39% to 46%, which would only impact Hollywood Casino, Hotel and Raceway in Bangor, as Oxford Casino is currently at that percentage. It would then provide 7% of that income to the tribal governments of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Mi’kmaq Nation.
“It is a matter of fairness and brings us a small step closer toward a more just relationship with the sovereign Indigenous nations whose land we live on,” Malon said.
The bill would not change the arrangement that is currently in place between the Oxford Casino and the other two tribes of the Wabanaki Nations — the Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation.
Oxford Casino pays 4% of its slot revenue to those two tribes, which Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis said was a deal struck when the casino first opened as a way for the Tribes to benefit without pursuing competing gaming, an agreement he said has been helpful for economic development. 
“We don’t want to take from the other tribes,” Chief of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians Clarissa Sabattis said, regarding the reasoning as to why the bill doesn’t pull from the same pot of revenue as the other two tribes. 
While the percentages are different, they equate to roughly the same revenue, around $3.5 million. 
The bill would also bring parity among the casinos, as Mi’kmaq Nation Chief Edward Peter Paul put it, because it would raise the slot machine income provided by both casinos to the same percentage. 
However, Chris Jackson, a partner in the lobby firm Mitchell Tardy Jackson in Augusta who spoke on behalf of his client Hollywood Casino, argued that change would be harmful to the casino financially because it would alter its tax rate.  
“As long as our effective tax rate stays the same,” Jackson said, “we are open to suggestions.”
While both bills related to gaming revenue could be passed, Sabattis told Maine Morning Star she anticipates the slot revenue bill will not be as necessary should the Tribes gain control of internet gaming, though she sees that path as the less likely outcome. 
Testimony from the casinos against the online gaming bill also signal that. Steve Silver, chair of the Maine Gambling Control Board, argued that should that bill pass, Oxford Casino should no longer be required to pay slot revenue to the tribes. 
Another bill the committee heard on Wednesday, LD 1838, would authorize electronic wagering terminals to conduct electronic beano by federally recognized tribes, among some other changes, which Sabattis and Francis testified in support of. 
Overall, Wabanaki leaders argue their inability to access the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and other restrictions under the Settlement Act, has caused them to lose out on revenue and therefore hurt their ability to provide services to their citizens. 
This is supported by a 2022 report by a team of researchers from the Harvard Kennedy School that the comparatively lower economic growth the Wabanki Nations have seen compared to other federally recognized tribes and the average Mainer is likely the result of the Settlement Act. 
“All of our tribes have significant unmet needs and underfunded programs,” Sabattis told the committee, noting that her tribe would put revenue provided through this bill toward its wellness court, in turn reducing strain for social services on the state and towns.
The Wabanaki Alliance, a nonprofit created in 2020 to advocate for the recognition of the Wabanaki Nations’ inherent sovereignty, hasn’t taken a position on LD 1851, according to executive director Maulian Bryant.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas on Wednesday decried the attorney general’s rejection of its proposed constitutional amendment under a new law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. 
This is the third time Attorney General Tim Griffin has rejected the nonpartisan organization’s proposal to amend the state’s initiative and referendum process and the first time he has rejected any proposed ballot measure under Act 602, which became law last month.
Sponsored by Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, Act 602 prohibits the attorney general from certifying a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
The law cannot be retroactively applied to proposals that were already certified for circulation before the act’s effective date. ​​The attorney general’s office has already certified three other ballot title proposals that address education, government transparency and taxes on feminine hygiene products for the 2026 election cycle. 
Because Act 602 had an emergency clause, it went into effect when the governor signed it into law on April 14. Legislation generally takes effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns sine die. The 2025 legislative session officially concluded Monday.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas expressed frustration with Griffin’s decision in a statement issued Wednesday.
“Our ballot title has now been rejected three times, and each time we’ve addressed the Attorney General’s concerns,” said Bonnie Miller, president of the League of Women Voters of Arkansas. “This latest hurdle has nothing to do with accuracy or clarity. It is a technicality designed to keep citizens from having a say.”
The organization is preparing a revised version of its proposal and is exploring legal options to challenge Act 602, according to the statement.
“We’re not going anywhere,” Miller said. “We’ve seen this kind of pushback before, and we know what’s at stake. We will keep working to protect the right of Arkansans to bring issues directly to the ballot.”
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas submitted its first proposal in March with the goal of strengthening direct democracy, according to a press release at that time. Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.


Let us know what you think...


 

If approved, the League of Women Voters of Arkansas’ proposed constitutional amendment would prohibit the General Assembly from amending or repealing with a two-thirds majority vote a constitutional amendment approved by voters, which it currently has the authority to do. 
The group’s proposal would also prohibit Article 5, Section 1 — the section of the state constitution that permits citizen-led initiatives and referendums — from being amended by a ballot measure referred to voters by the General Assembly.
State lawmakers can refer up to three proposed constitutional amendments to voters each legislative session. This year legislators referred proposals concerning gun rights, economic development and affirming that only U.S. citizens can vote in Arkansas to the 2026 ballot. 
Additional provisions of the LWVA’s proposed constitutional amendment include requiring a separate vote for an emergency clause to occur at least 24 hours after the passage of a measure, and to allow for the substitution or rejection of ballot measure language by the attorney general to be immediately reviewable by the Arkansas Supreme Court.
In Monday’s opinion, which was prepared by Senior Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside, Griffin said the League of Women Voters of Arkansas resolved issues identified with previous submissions, but he must reject their most recent submission because of Act 602. Griffin said the submitted ballot title “ranks at grade level 12.2,” above the now required eighth-grade reading level, and therefore “requires significant revisions” to comply with the new law. 
Attorney general again rejects proposed ballot measure to amend Arkansas’ direct democracy process 

“Any ballot title I could substitute would amount to a wholesale rewrite, but it is the sponsor’s duty to craft a ballot title that complies with Act 602,” the opinion states. “As a result, my statutory duty is to reject your popular name and ballot title because it does not comply with the requirements of Act 602 and instruct you to redesign the proposed ballot title in a manner that does not violate the requirements of the Act.”
The opinion noted additional problems with the proposal, including grammatical issues and challenges to the measure’s popular name. 
“After the Secretary of State assigns a popular name, certain parties ‘may contest the popular name.’ But your proposed measure does not provide any standards for the popular name or basis upon which it can be challenged,” Griffin wrote. “Thus, the ballot title misleadingly presents the matter as if there is some basis upon which the popular name could be challenged, even though your proposed measure includes no such basis.”
In addition to its proposed constitutional amendment, the League of Women Voters of Arkansas is also addressing the state’s initiative and referendum process through a lawsuit it filed last month that alleges eight new laws governing direct democracy are unconstitutional.
Act 602 is not part of the lawsuit, which challenges another law that would expand the attorney general’s existing authority to reject a proposal if it conflicts with the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes. The suit also challenges laws that affect the petition-gathering process by requiring canvassers to file a “true affidavit” with the secretary of state, to request a photo ID from signers and inform them that petition fraud is a criminal offense, among other things. 
Following the 2023 legislative session, the League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a lawsuit challenging a law that requires ballot initiative groups to gather signatures from 50 counties instead of 15. A final decision in the case is still pending.

(Getty Images)One hurdle to achieving a high school equivalency certificate will be removed next month when the New Mexico Higher Education Department starts providing free tests to qualifying residents.
House Bill 167, sponsored by Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque), requires the state department to waive test costs for New Mexico residents who are at least 16; are not enrolled in secondary school; do not have a high school diploma or equivalency certificate; and who have passed an official practice test showing they are likely to pass the official test.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 7, making New Mexico the fifth state in the country to offer residents free equivalency tests. The bill goes into effect on June 20. 
Auriella Ortiz, spokesperson for the Higher Education Department, told Source NM in a written statement that removing the “financial burden” of tests is expected to increase test participation by 20% or more over the next three years. She added that the state has seen a nearly 50% increase in people taking high school equivalency tests since 2021.
Tests can cost more than $145 dollars per test, including fees for the test itself as well as proctoring. 
“The passage of House Bill 167 will have a huge impact for our residents and allow them a pathway to basic education and potentially a pathway to higher education at New Mexico’s colleges and universities,” Ortiz wrote. “This legislation removes obstacles that will positively impact tens of thousands of New Mexicans.”
Ortiz explained that the department currently has an ad hoc voucher program to provide free tests to New Mexicans, but there are still some barriers present.
She said New Mexicans who earn a high school diploma or equivalent credential earn $6,465 more annually than those without. 
“We should note that, given the average increase in salary just mentioned, the free testing system will pay for itself each year in income tax alone. It’s a win for the state,” Ortiz wrote. “Just as we have invested in tuition-free college and a trained workforce, a program of free high school equivalency tests for all New Mexicans in need is part of our state’s continued push for a strong economy.”
Rio Rancho Public Schools Communications Director Wyndham Kemsley told Source NM in an email that while the district is not directly involved in high school equivalency testing, its officials are pleased that the state is expanding access to credentials. 
“While the main priority of RRPS is to help our students attain high school diplomas through traditional routes, widening access to high school equivalency testing will undoubtedly benefit our state’s workforce,” he wrote.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A Democratic lawmaker, who is battling breast cancer, said Wednesday that she plans to try to override the governor’s veto of a bill designed to improve access to diagnostic screening of the disease.
Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, said Gov. Kevin Stitt’s veto of House Bill 1389 generated a “lot of shock” and felt personal even though she’s well through the diagnostic screening process for her own breast cancer. 
She said that close to 1 in 6 Oklahoma women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, which is above the national average.
The measure sought to add contrast-enhanced mammograms and molecular breast imaging to the list of diagnostic examinations that insurance companies must cover without patient cost-sharing. Supporters said such diagnostic tests are essential to early detection, treatment and improved outcomes.
Provenzano said lawmakers in 2022 passed legislation requiring the coverage of diagnostic mammograms, but she has since discovered that access to the same machines depends on where you live.
“I’ve also fielded call after call from women who say their insurance companies are pushing back on coverage, despite what the law says,” Provenzano said in a statement. “In the simplest of terms, HB 1389 clarifies the language so no matter where you live – be it Guymon, Tulsa or Broken Bow, your access to care is there. This bill seeks to make sure every woman can get care, regardless of her zip code.”
Her bill was one of four vetoed Tuesday by Stitt.
“I am deeply sympathetic to the women across our state who have bravely fought breast cancer,” Stitt wrote in his veto message. “While early detection and access to care are critical priorities, this legislation imposes new and costly insurance mandates on private health plans that will ultimately raise insurance premiums for working families and small businesses.”
He wrote that mammograms are already covered, and doctors are empowered to order further tests that can be covered by insurance.
Sen. Brenda Stanley, R-Midwest City, the Senate author, said she felt “sincere disappointment” over the veto of a measure that she believes is “life-saving.”
“House Bill 1389 aimed to ensure that all Oklahomans, especially those at higher risk or with a family history of breast cancer, had access to affordable and comprehensive breast cancer screenings,” she said in a statement. “This legislation was vetoed due to the belief that the provision of this care could contribute to higher insurance premiums, although the reality is that the costs of providing preventative screenings are minuscule when compared to the costs to treat late-stage disease.”
She pledged to continue to work until every man and woman can access the care without also enduring financial hardship.
Before heading to Stitt’s desk, the measure passed unanimously through the House and by a 34-11 vote in the Senate. It would take a vote of two-thirds of lawmakers in both chambers to override Stitt’s veto.

Ono appeared in Gainesville Tuesday at forums for faculty, students, and administrators, where he said he was “ideologically” in line with Gov. Ron DeSantis and university trustees on diversity policy, Politico reported. 
DeSantis, who has involved himself deeply in earlier university presidential searches, particularly pushing political allies for these jobs, said Wednesday that he does not know Ono, nor was he involved in advancing the Michigan president’s candidacy. 
“There can be no ambiguity; I don’t think anybody is going to be unclear about what the expectations are in the state of Florida with respect to higher education. We reject woke indoctrination,” DeSantis said Wednesday during a roundtable discussion about property taxes in Tampa. 
DeSantis’ recent involvement include trying (unsuccessfully) to install now-U.S. Rep. Randy Fine (then a member of the Legislature) in the president’s office at Florida Atlantic University; his office reaching out to Florida International University to advocate for former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez for interim president there; and, especially topical this week, guiding Sasse to UF, Politico reported. 
He’s also paid particular attention to overhauling New College of Florida and, more recently, the University of West Florida, in favor of more conservative approaches. 
DeSantis has taken pride in placing candidates at universities, saying he was elected in-part for his vision for education. 
“We were the first state in the country to eliminate DE and I from our public universities. We’ve done more than any state to restore the mission of universities to the classical sense of what a university should be,” DeSantis said. “Those expectations are clear, and I don’t think that a candidate would have been selected who was not going to abide by those expectations.”
DeSantis said it would have unthinkable five or 10 years ago that Florida would land the president of the University of Michigan, one of the highest ranked public institutions. 
Some Florida Republicans have expressed concerns over Ono’s history. 
U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a Republican candidate for governor, on Fox Business Tuesday evening said Ono “does not comport with the values of the state of Florida,” reacting to Ono’s past comments about Michigan’s “DEI 2.0” initiative. He said at the time that the university should “strive to nurture thoughtful and understanding citizens” and that “racism is one of America’s original sins.”
It’s “time to go back to the drawing board,” Donalds said, and called for Ono to be blocked and the search to start over. 
Despite Ono’s support for the “DEI 2.0” initiative, the university closed its DEI office under his leadership, Michigan Advance reported. Ono’s tenure saw protests over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and accusations that administrators discriminated against pro-Palestinian activists.
Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist and trustee at New College, said on X that UF trustees should ask Ono “hard questions about his recent support for DEI and climate radicalism.” 
Rufo called Ono “a left-wing administrator” and said “Florida deserves better than a standard-issue college president.” Republican state Rep. Berny Jacques responded to Rufo’s post, saying, “very concerning.”
DeSantis said he would let the search play out, and “I don’t think that anyone would want to come the University of Florida if your goal was to pursue a woke agenda. You’re going to run into a brick wall here in the state of Florida.”

Sasse
Sasse was the sole finalist for the UF presidency in 2023 and his arrival on campus was met with protests. His exit was marred by reporting and, later, state audits concluding that he spent lavishly on parties and paid his former U.S. Senate staffers high salaries in remote UF jobs.
Florida law requires a shortlist of final candidates. Some people, including the co-sponsor of the law, argued UF violated the spirit of the shortlist by making the list as short as one. 
Florida law shields searches from the public. 
Rahul Patel, chair of the presidential search committee and chair of the UF Board of Trustees, advocated for confidentiality in the search. 
Patel, in an opinion column to the Tampa Bay Times Tuesday signed by all the members of the search committee, said proffering two or more finalists “makes sense.” 
“But the regulations also allow flexibility in cases of exceptional circumstances where selecting multiple finalists is infeasible — and this was one of those cases.”
This search “was one of those moments” that allows “for discretion in exceptional cases,” Patel wrote. 
Patel, and opponents of the 2022 law, argue that shielding searches allows for more candidates to feel comfortable applying if their existing institution likely wouldn’t become aware they were looking to leave.
“This search attracted a broad and impressive pool of candidates from across the landscape of higher education — including, notably, multiple sitting presidents of major research universities,” Patel wrote. 
“That alone is a powerful reflection of UF’s rising national stature and the appeal of this opportunity. But every one of those sitting presidents made it clear: they would only participate if the process guaranteed confidentiality and their name would not be released publicly unless they were the sole finalist.”
University presidential search laws are a major topic inside the Florida Capitol

Proposal to bring searches into the sunshine
The Florida Legislature, which concluded the non-budget portion of its regular session last week, did not change presidential search laws despite continued debates about doing so. 
Rep. Michelle Salzman and Sen. Alexis Calatayud introduced bills to bring presidential searches back into the sunshine, although after several amendments and passing the House twice, provisions related to searches never made it to the governor’s desk. DeSantis said he would veto the proposals, anyway. 
Identical when introduced, the House proposal (HB 1321) was eventually amended to prohibit the governor from communicating with search stakeholders while the Senate version (SB 1726) was amended to keep searches in the dark but would’ve required at least three finalists.
The governor, in several press conferences, railed against the proposals, particularly the House’s. House Speaker Daniel Perez pushed back against existing law, calling the secret process a “spoil system.”
Salzman did not respond to Phoenix requests for comment.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The latest version of a property tax bill discussed by a Senate subcommittee Wednesday is still expected to go through changes before a floor vote — but Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, said it’s still a priority to pass legislation on the issue this year.
Restraining property taxes for Iowans has been one of Republicans’ priorities for the 2025 legislative session, with leaders saying it was the top issue GOP lawmakers heard about on the campaign trail in the 2024 election. Dawson and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, the Ways and Means Committee chairs in the Senate and House respectively, introduced their proposal making major changes to Iowa’s property tax system in March as a way to address these concerns.
The largest change proposed in Dawson and Kaufmann’s bill was to change Iowa’s local property tax system from the “rollback” system of calculation to a “revenue-restricted” system. “Rollback” refers to how the state currently limits property tax growth, a system where only a portion of a residential property’s value is subject to property taxes. There is a a 3% growth limit on the aggregate value of residential property in the state used to determine how much of a property’s value can be taxed each year, which is used by the Iowa Department of Revenue sets the rollback rate.

The legislative proposal would remove the rollback, potentially allowing for a higher rate of property value growth that would be taxable. To limit property tax increases, the GOP bill instead proposes capping most property tax levy rates to 2% each year and limiting how much in new tax revenues local governments can collect as a way to stop property taxes from rising.
Senate Study Bill 1227, the property tax bill discussed in a subcommittee meeting Wednesday, includes these changes. However, it was adjusted from the previous bill to allow local governments to exceed the 2% levy rate growth during times of high inflation, allowing for up to 5% increases as determined by increases in the consumer price index (CPI).
While Nate Ristow with the Iowa Taxpayers Association praised the legislation overall, he said he was concerned about allowing higher property tax rates based on CPI. Ristow suggested “that there be some sort of clarification and incentive in there for communities that don’t fully utilize the allowable levy increase.”
Dustin Miller, representing the Iowa Chamber Alliance and some local government entities said localities are “certainly open” to talking about changes to the CPI component of setting levy rate growth limits, but said it was important these changes do not negatively impact communities that are seeing significant growth and investment.
“We want to make sure that new growth language is correct, because I think that’s important from a pro-growth standpoint,”  What we don’t want to do is penalize those communities that are growing, and then certainly we don’t want to impinge any existing deals that are out there.”
More changes will be added through an amendment brought up by Dawson Wednesday — he said the amendment will create a system to phase out the rollback through a “hybrid model” for residential properties over a period of 10 years.
Another major change to the bill will come in the homestead property tax exemption. While previous versions of the bill included a $25,000 and $50,000 exemption, Dawson said the new proposal will have a property tax exemption of 25% of a home’s taxable value, up to $125,000. He said this change will address concerns some local governments brought up about how the flat tax exemptions could cause problems in certain communities based on how property values differ in rural and urban areas of the state.
The homestead property tax exemption based on a percentage of a home’s value will provide relief for Iowa homeowners without “taking a lot of communities’ property tax base and wiping (it) out unintentionally,” he said.
“I think this gets us pretty darn near close to the end of where the whole system reform lies at,” Dawson said.
Other components of the bill include shifting $426 million in K-12 schools from property taxes to the state and a property tax freeze for seniors over age 70 who have incomes at 250% or less than the federal poverty level.
Emily Piper with the Iowa Association of School Boards, said she was concerned about how the bill’s proposal to shift some current school levies to the Secure an Advanced Vision for Education (SAVE) funding stream, in cases where schools have promised to fund certain projects through bond referendums but are not able to secure funding through the state.
“Using SAVE dollars to backfill more of those additional levy rate raises a concern, because it’s open-ended,” Piper said. “We don’t understand how much is going to be going there, and we want to be certain if we’re doing that, that we don’t inadvertently negatively impact current bonds that are out there because the revenue is not as great as had been projected.”
Dawson said many Iowa school districts have cash reserves that could be used to offset lost property tax revenue and move forward with infrastructure projects.
Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said she was also concerned about this shift of education funding from local property taxes to the state in the context of the current state budget that draws on the Taxpayer Relief Fund and other reserves to make up for budget shortfalls.
“We need to proceed with caution when we say the state is going to pick up a portion of the tab (for) our schools,” Petersen said. ” So that’s one area I’m really wanting to make sure that we’re in a decent spot for that, so that our valuable growth and school budgets don’t take a hit on that.”
She said other parts of the bill, like the homestead tax credit, will “moving in the right direction” on addressing high property tax costs,.
“This is more reform than it is relief, but I do believe it does maybe put in place some changes to formula and make it easier for Iowans to understand and predict,” Petersen said.
While many agreed that changes to Iowa’s property tax system were needed, some advocates and legislators have said moving on the bill during the 2025 legislative session may not be feasible. Mike Owen with Common Good Iowa, a progressive advocacy organization, said the group was registered against the bill before the amendment was introduced “mainly because there wasn’t enough time in this session to deal with something so big.”
“There still is not,” Owen said. “… We think it’s good to have a new draft, but it would be best used for hearings that are helped throughout the state, throughout the summer and fall, to get a full range of views impacts of this legislation and deal with it next year.”
Some legislative leaders, including Senate President Amy Sinclair and House Speaker Pat Grassley, have said they would like to move on property taxes this year, but have not committed to sending a bill to the governor in 2025. Sinclair said in April that Senate Republicans “want it done right rather than fast.”
Dawson said passing a property tax bill remains a priority before the session ends for the year. He agreed that the bill made major changes to the current system, but said these were necessary steps in order to provide substantive property tax relief to Iowans — while saying further adjustments will likely be made.
“We are trying to break the system apart and actually make this something that’s more workable for all Iowans,” Dawson said. “… We have a duty to start acting for Iowans and start to reform the system.”

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — Washington landlords can no longer raise rents by more than 10% per year under landmark legislation Gov. Bob Ferguson signed into law Wednesday.
Effective immediately, House Bill 1217 caps residential rent hikes during a 12-month period at 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower. The limit will last 15 years. The bill also restricts manufactured home rent increases to 5% with no expiration date.
Rent increases are also prohibited for the first year of a tenancy under the new law. But when a renter moves in, landlords can set the initial rate however they please.
New construction is not subject to the cap for its first 12 years. Public housing authorities, low-income developments, and duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in which the owner lives in one of the units are also exempt.
Rent hike notices are now required 90 days before they go into effect, up from 60 days under previous law.
If a landlord raises rent above the cap without an exemption, the renter must give the landlord a chance to fix the error or can terminate their lease with 20 days’ notice. A tenant or the state attorney general can bring litigation to enforce compliance with the new law. The attorney general can recover up to $7,500 per violation.
Democrats believe the limit will give renters greater predictability in one of the most expensive states to live in, while Republicans think it will chill development and force landlords to sell their properties because they can’t keep up with maintenance costs and property taxes.
Last month, Rep. Sam Low, R-Lake Stevens, argued the policy is “going to be devastating for our housing providers, and we need housing providers to be a part of the solution in the housing crisis that we have.”
The legislation was part of a suite of bills Ferguson signed Wednesday, aiming to clear obstacles to construction, increase homeownership opportunities, pave the way for redevelopment of commercial property into residential and provide a modicum of tax relief. 
Other bills focused on promoting housing development around transit stops and allowing for more lot splitting remain to be signed.
It was a long road to the governor’s desk for the uber-controversial rent cap proposal.
After clearing the House, the Senate raised the cap from an initial 7% to 10% plus inflation in a dramatic floor vote, to the dismay of progressive Democrats. The two chambers then negotiated to come up with the compromise that eventually passed on the final day of the legislative session, but not before a procedural fiasco delayed the final votes.
The legislation was a top priority for Democrats after a similar bill stalled in the Senate last year.
Behind the scenes, Ferguson’s staff worked with lawmakers for months to get the bill across the finish line. But the governor himself declined to confirm support publicly until last week.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-rent-bill-signing-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-07 17:09:54.648966

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)The new Republican majority on the state Board of Elections in its first meeting voted to replace elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell with Sam Hayes, general counsel to House Speaker Destin Hall. 
This is the first state elections board with members appointed by the state Auditor.
Democrats Jeff Carmon and Siobhan Millen, members of the last board, joined the Republican members state Auditor Dave Boliek announced last week: Francis DeLuca, a former president of the conservative Civitas Institute, former state Sen. Robert Rucho, and lawyer Stacy “Four” Eggers. Eggers is also a returning member. 
DeLuca won the board chairmanship with a 3-2 vote. Democrats wanted Eggers for chairman.
In the past, a majority of the election board’s members were of the same political party as the governor. After Democrat Josh Stein won the governorship last year, the Republican legislative supermajority passed a law stripping governors of their power to appoint members. That lead to the new majority-Republican elections board.
Republicans had been trying to reduce or eliminate the governor’s elections board appointments for years. Those efforts were rejected by the courts and voters.
Brinson Bell was hired as the state’s top elections administrator during former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s tenure. While the state and local boards won national awards for election administration, Brinson Bell was a target of state Republicans’ criticism.  
She took heat from Republican legislators over a lawsuit the board settled concerning absentee ballot deadlines in 2020, even though she told legislators she had nothing to do with the negotiations. 
The state GOP sued the Board over the decision to count absentee ballots that voters put in the wrong envelope, and over 225,000 voter registrations the GOP said were not legal because they lacked a partial Social Security number or a driver’s license number. Republicans also objected to instructions from the state board that local boards should not try to do their own signature matching for absentee ballots. 
The legislature consistently appropriated less money than the Board of Elections requested for staff and technology. 
GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin’s unsuccessful effort to win a seat on the state Supreme Court even though he was behind in the vote count was based on legal arguments that the Board of Elections had misinterpreted state law.
  The new NC Board of Elections, with all members appointed by the state Auditor, are sworn in on May 7, 2025. Left to right, Jeff Carmon, Chairman Francis DeLuca, Stacy “Four” Eggers, Siobhan Millen, and Robert Rucho.
Political divisions over Brinson Bell’s leadership lasted until the end. Republicans on the board voted to adjourn Wednesday’s meeting rather than allow her to read a statement. 
Millen said it was “a shabby way to treat a nationally admired executive director.”
Brinson Bell read her statement after the board adjourned, and Republican board members had left the room. 
She said serving as executive director “I know will forever be the greatest honor of my life.”
She noted the hostile conditions elections officials sometimes face. Elections officials are targets of suspicion and threats. 
Brinson Bell said she hopes for a return to civility. 
“I hope we can get to a place in this country, and especially in this state that I hold so dear, where dedicated, hardworking election workers are supported and rewarded for their work, rather than vilified by those who don’t like the outcome,” she said. “I hope we return to a time when those who lose elections concede defeat rather than trying to tear down the entire election system and erode voter confidence. And I hope we recognize that the conduct of elections is the very core of our democracy and should be properly and consistently funded, regardless of the party or the person in control, so that the voice of the people can be recorded accurately, securely, and fairly.”
Brinson Bell said later she was not referring to Griffin’s effort to throw out votes when she talked about losers conceding. 
Carmon read a list of Brinson Bell’s accomplishments, including an elections plan for Helene-devastated counties that resulted in higher voter turnout there than statewide. 
“That was your leadership,” he told her. 
She ran elections in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and the following year during the COVID-19 pandemic, recruiting thousands of poll workers, Carmon said. 
Republicans on the elections board have tended to dislike Sunday voting during early voting periods.
DeLuca filed a federal lawsuit over same-day registration in 2016 when he was Civitas Institute president.
In a brief interview, DeLuca said it was too soon to say what changes Republicans will make, but he wanted “gradual improvement in everything.”
Hayes, who will start his new job as elections director next week, said “it’s far too early to get into that,” when asked about any changes he is looking to make.
“I think we all have the same goal, which is election integrity,” he said during a brief interview in his office in the Legislative Building. “Make it easy to vote, hard to cheat, and I think we’ve accomplished a lot of that here with legislation that I’ve been a part of that I’ve later had to defend in litigation. 
“We’ve laid out the blueprint, and that is the law,” he said, “and that’s what I intend to stick to, and take the direction of the Board.”

At a news conference in Washington D.C., U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico Ryan Ellison said prosecutors have filed conspiracy, illicit fentanyl distribution, firearms and immigration charges as a result of the bust.
He also said the alleged drug trafficking organization is “one of the largest and most dangerous fentanyl operations in United States history” — spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Utah — and distributes drugs “throughout the western United States.”
“We will not tolerate those who profit from poisoning American citizens,” Ellison said.
Bondi said the organization is affiliated with the Sinaloa Cartel operating out of Mexico, and when authorities arrested its alleged leader, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, they found millions of dollars in cash and vehicles. She said he “insulated himself” from the drugs, which agents found in Albuquerque, Phoenix and Utah.
Asked for specifics on how the defendants were captured, Bondi said the investigation is ongoing and she won’t reveal police sources or methods.

DEA Acting Administrator Robert Murphy noted that the organization’s drug distribution had “probably caused” someone to die.
Overall, authorities seized 11.5 kilograms of fentanyl powder; approximately $4.4 million in cash; approximately 79 pounds of methamphetamine; approximately 7.5 kilograms of cocaine; approximately 4.5 kilograms of heroin; approximately 41 firearms; and approximately 4.1 million fentanyl pills, according to court records.
Ellison said in Albuquerque alone, police found 2.7 million fentanyl pills; 11.5 kilograms of “concentrated fentanyl powder;” seven pounds of methamphetamine; “multiple kilograms of heroin and cocaine;” 41 firearms; more than $600,000 in cash and “numerous luxury vehicles.”
In Layton, Utah, authorities seized approximately $780,000 and a Dodge TRX Mammoth valued at approximately $150,000, according to a news release.
“When we catch you — all of these individuals, if convicted, we will put you behind bars,” Bondi said. “There will be no negotiating, and we will lock you up for as long as humanly possible. We will not negotiate with those who are killing our family members including brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, parents, friends.”
DOJ prosecuting, not deporting, defendants who aren’t citizens
Bondi said six of the people charged are living in the U.S. unlawfully. A detention order for Lopez-Rubio indicates that he will be held until trial, in part, because he lacks legal status in the U.S. and is subject to removal or deportation after any prison sentence.
When asked how she’s deciding whether to prosecute or deport any defendants who lack U.S. citizenship, Bondi said it’s based on their potential prison sentences, if they’re convicted.
“I want them to stay in our prisons as long as possible,” Bondi said. “There’s a very big risk — we all know — releasing someone, especially to Mexico. Sending them back to Mexico, who knows, they could attempt to get through our borders. Not under Donald Trump, I doubt. But they’re also part of a major drug trafficking ring in Mexico, so sending them back to Mexico to continue on with their drug business isn’t going to happen under this administration.”

SPRINGFIELD – Two hours in the state capital was enough for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to criticize Illinois’ immigration laws and its governor while invoking the 2023 murder of a local progressive activist.

Her short Wednesday visit largely served as an opportunity for an official from President Donald Trump’s cabinet to take photos highlighting immigration policies in a Democrat-run state. Noem visited a DHS office where she briefly spoke with two people being processed for deportation and then held a news conference with family members of people murdered by noncitizens.

To illustrate her point, Noem held the news conference on the same block where Springfield progressive activist Emma Shafer was murdered in 2023. Shafer was allegedly stabbed by her partner at their Springfield home.

“She lost her life to an illegal alien that’s still out, at large, probably in this state,” Noem said at a news conference in Springfield. “We can’t confirm that because the local law enforcement and the state law enforcement are barred by state law, with the support of Gov. (JB) Pritzker, from sharing any information.”

The suspect in the case has not been arrested and Springfield police said last year the man, a Mexican national, may have fled the country.

Noem’s remarks appalled one of Shafer’s friends who was protesting near the news conference and said Shafer would be advocating for immigrants.

“Emma Shafer would have never supported Trump’s policies and would have never supported what Kristi Noem had to say,” Francesca Butler told Capitol News Illinois. “Emma would want Kristi to know we should lead with compassion and humility.”

Noem said she was not in contact with Shafer’s family and was unaware they were at another site protesting her visit.

Sen. Steve McClure, R-Springfield, said the Republican lawmakers at the news conference didn’t know Shafer was going to be mentioned, but “you have to mention all the people that have been killed by people that shouldn’t have been here.”

Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists protested Noem’s visit outside the Governor’s Mansion and Capitol Building.

State law does not protect people in Illinois from deportation. Federal officers under Noem’s leadership can still make arrests and deport people in Illinois. Under the 2017 TRUST Act signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, Illinois law enforcement is prohibited from arresting a person based solely on their immigration status and in most cases, cannot assist immigration officials with detaining people based on immigration status, according to the Illinois Attorney General’s office.

“This governor has bragged about Illinois being a firewall against President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda, and it is very clear that he is violating the constitution of the United States because it is a federal law that the federal government set and enforce immigration policies,” Noem said.

Noem claimed Illinois laws make the state less safe, citing a series of crimes committed by people in the U.S. illegally.

“Governors like JB Pritzker don’t care if gang bangers, rapists and pedophiles roam free in this state,” she said. “If they are here illegally, he’s going to protect them.”

Pritzker slammed the visit as a “publicity stunt” and said Illinois complies with federal immigration laws.

“Trump-Noem publicity stunts do not make our communities safer or our immigration system smarter,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Illinois doesn’t need to abuse power or ignore the Constitution to keep our people safe. Like the millions of Americans asking for sensible, humane immigration reform, I encourage the Secretary to spend less time performing for Fox News and more time protecting the Homeland.”

Pritzker has repeatedly said he supports the federal government deporting people who are illegally in the country if they are convicted of violent crimes.

Republicans are continuing to call for the TRUST Act to be repealed – unlikely in the Democrat-controlled legislature.

“These are crimes that the state could have prevented, had the option to prevent them, and decided not to,"" McClure said.

Noem’s first stop in Springfield was a federal field office where Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were processing two men.

Noem spoke with ICE officers and one of the two men who were being held in the room while their fingerprints were being scanned. The ICE officer told her that the men were from Guatemala and would eventually be deported because they were illegally in the U.S.

Noem asked one of the men a series of questions, including whether he was aware he was being detained and would ultimately be deported, and if he had family in Guatemala. He responded yes to both questions. When an ICE officer told Noem that the man had also been charged with battery, she asked him whether he knew what he was being charged for, to which he replied that he did not understand the question.

Noem’s visit also comes a day after Pritzker agreed to testify next month to the U.S. House Oversight Committee about Illinois’ immigration policies. The Republican-led committee plans to probe Pritzker, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz about “policies that shield criminal illegal aliens from immigration enforcement,” according to a news release.

Noem’s visit also comes less than a week after President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice sued Illinois for the second time over state laws aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants.

In February, the U.S. Department of Justice sued over Illinois’ 2017 “sanctuary state” law. Last week, the Trump administration sued Illinois again, this time over Illinois’ new requirement that employers notify workers whose U.S. employment eligibility is flagged when run through the federal E-Verify system, which compares workers’ employment eligibility federal form I-9 with other federal databases.

Illinois law now requires employers to inform workers of their rights to correct their I-9 forms, if flagged by E-Verify as a possible undocumented immigrant, and of impending worksite inspections from ICE. The feds allege the law “disincentivizes” employers from using E-Verify and “encourages unlawful employment of aliens in the United States.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-07 20:39:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Political deal to seat John Fonfara on PURA may prove unworkable,Mark Pazniokas and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/07/john-fonfara-pura-deal/,Converting PURA to a quasi-public agency solely to give Sen. John Fonfara a promised seat is off the table for the 2025 legislative session.,"Reconfiguring the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority as a quasi-public agency, a move considered for the sole purpose of giving a state senator a promised job, is off the table for the remainder of the 2025 legislative session and faces stiff opposition if attempted in 2026.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said in an interview that the legal, fiscal and policy complexities of transforming PURA into a quasi-public agency are too formidable to address before the session ends on June 4, jeopardizing a deal to seat Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, on the authority.
“I don’t think those are going to be resolved before June 4,” Looney said.
Other Democratic senators, who declined to be quoted by name due to the sensitivity of the issue, said Looney faced an insurrection in the Senate Democratic majority if he pressed for the legislation necessary to place Fonfara on the authority before his current Senate term expires in January 2027.
Converting PURA to a quasi-public was a way to consummate a deal struck by Gov. Ned Lamont and legislative leaders to guarantee the confirmation of Marissa P. Gillett to a second four-year term as chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.
No lawmaker can accept a job in another branch of government during their legislative terms, even if they resign from the General Assembly.
The ranking Senate Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee said he was not surprised by Looney’s reluctance to seek passage of a concept that has not been filed as a bill and whose only purpose was to complete what struck lawmakers was an unusually naked piece of transactional politics.
“I can’t imagine it getting done this session or any other session,” said Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich. “It’s too complicated. The implication for consumers and the general public would probably be very negative.”
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, the House energy co-chair, had a blunter assessment: “Everyone I’ve talked to thinks it’s one of the dumbest ideas they’ve ever heard.”
Looney insisted he always thought it might not be resolved until 2026. That was a surprise to Fonfara.
Fonfara said no one has talked with him about taking PURA as quasi-public off the table for 2025, and his focus lies elsewhere, including seeking support for his ideas on lower energy costs.
Lamont agreed to nominate Fonfara to ensure the confirmation of Gillett, a regulator whose aggressive and controversial style had outraged the state’s largest regulated utilities, to a second four-year term as chair of the authority. 
Fonfara and two allies were poised to block Gillett in the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee. The potential defeat created an opportunity to press Lamont to add two members suggested by legislative leaders to what has been a three-member authority.
“This was a legislative initiative, and I really wanted to get Marissa Gillett on there. I thought she had more experience than everybody else, and we’re going through incredibly complicated time,” Lamont said Wednesday, pointing to a shift toward performance-based rate setting. “I thought her regulatory experience was really invaluable, especially now.”
The boards of PURA and its predecessors generally had been populated by former lawmakers. Gillett is a regulatory lawyer from Maryland. The other two members are former lawmakers. A state law passed years ago requires a five-member board, but Lamont never had filled the two additional positions.

“Legislators had — on both sides of the aisle, I might say — had some people they’d like to get on that board,” Lamont said in an interview. “And I said, ‘Let’s figure this out.’ They came forward and said, ‘Maybe we do this as a quasi, we expand to five.’ I said, ‘OK.’”
Lamont agreed to nominate Fonfara and a former Republican state representative, Holly Cheeseman of East Lyme. 
Gillett was ultimately confirmed to a second term by the committee and the full legislature, though not before Senate Republicans staged a walkout in protest of the deal that Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, called a “blatant quid pro quo.”
Looney and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said they still intend to pass legislation that would impose a deadline of Dec. 31 on Lamont to nominate two additional authority members.
“We have a deal to go to five commissioners, and that will happen,” Ritter said. “Ultimately, you know, the governor will have to pick two people based upon the criteria and eligibility at that time.”
Ritter, however, said he has no intention to push a bill converting PURA to a quasi-public. “We’ll take the lead from the Senate on this one,” he said.
Looney and Ritter both said the conversion to a quasi-public ultimately could prove unworkable.
“It’s pretty complicated. I don’t deny that, and I’ve had people tell me they don’t think it’s really feasible,” Ritter said.
“There were a number of issues that have to be dealt with in terms of creating a quasi public in terms of how it’s structured,” Looney said.
Fonfara’s fight over fines
In the meantime, Fonfara has a second obstacle to clear: Resolving a fight with PURA over fines assessed against his defunct energy company, Wattifi Inc. 
The company attempted to offer a flexible hourly-rate structure for customers on Connecticut’s deregulated energy marketplace, competing against the traditional fixed-rate pricing model used by other suppliers.
Shortly before the company closed in 2023, PURA instructed the state’s electric utilities to adopt a billing format that displays information about the competitive supply market. A portion of the cost for that process was to be shared by the third-party suppliers such as Wattifi. 
The assessment on Wattifi was $57,168, but Fonfara never paid, saying his company closed before it ever got a chance to use the new system. PURA later imposed late fees that eventually racked up to more than $1 million, prompting Fonfara to accuse Gillet and the authority of retaliation. 
The maneuvering over PURA has been extraordinary.
Connecticut’s electric rates, as generally is the case for most of New England, tend to be among the highest in the continental U.S., raising the profile of the regulators who have limited oversight over a largely deregulated industry. 
The Senate chair of the energy committee, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, said that he’s been out of the loop on discussions surrounding PURA’s fate as he works on crafting other legislation — Senate Bill 4 — that will attempt to address energy costs and grid reliability. 
That effort has put him into close conversations with Fonfara, a former energy chair who has put forward his own ideas on how to save people money on their electric bill. The two met for over two hours last week, Needleman said, but the subject of turning the authority into a quasi-public did not come up. 
“If it was up to me, I would think that needs to be vetted in a pretty robust way,” Needleman said. 
Claire Coleman, the state’s consumer counsel, wrote a withering assessment in March of the potential complications of shifting rate-setting powers to a quasi-public or “quasi-private,” as she called it.
The model, she wrote, apparently has not been tried anywhere in the U.S.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_0508_SR_LastDaySession_201-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-07 17:09:54.648966

(Photo courtesy of Rocco DeBellis)For the first time in recent memory, Virginia Democrats have candidates running in all 100 House of Delegates districts — a milestone party leaders and grassroots organizers say reflects rising momentum as President Donald Trump’s second term continues to galvanize opposition.
Rocco DeBellis, a 57-year-old chef, Bronx native, and Cape Charles resident, filed this week to run in House District 100, making it the final district to be contested and completing the Democrats’ full slate. DeBellis, who runs a catering business and serves as the private chef to TV personality Judith Sheindlin — better known as Judge Judy — is challenging Del. Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack, in a district that spans the Eastern Shore and parts of Virginia Beach.
“Nobody else had put their hat in the ring, so I said, it can’t go uncontested,” DeBellis said. “This guy has to have at least somebody playing a little defense against him. If nobody else is going to step up and do it, I will gladly.”
The decision by DeBellis — who calls himself a Bernie Sanders-style Democrat and critiques what he sees as the outsized influence of corporate power in politics — is emblematic of a broader push by Democrats to compete statewide, even in ruby-red territory. 
Trump carried District 100 with 52% of the vote in 2024, and Bloxom defeated Democrat Charlena Jones 60-40% in 2023. The last time a Democrat won the district — three years before the Virginia Supreme Court redrew the maps — was in 2018, when U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine defeated Republican Corey Stewart with 53-47% of the vote. 
And this year, some Democratic organizers say they’re refusing to cede any ground.
The full-court press is led in part by Dr. Fergie Reid Jr., a retired physician and longtime political activist who has made it his mission to recruit candidates in every district, especially those overlooked by traditional party infrastructure. 
The son of Dr. William Ferguson Reid, the first Black Virginian elected to the General Assembly since Reconstruction, Reid said this milestone holds special meaning in a year when his father, founder of the 90 for 90 Voter Registration Project, celebrated a milestone birthday.
“Dad turned 100 a few weeks ago. There are 100 districts in the state house,” Reid said. “My goal is not to let what happened in 2021 happen again, especially on Dad’s 100th year when he’s watching. He’s been calling me every night to make sure that we get in 100 districts.”
 “A unique moment in the future of America”

Four years ago, Democrats had initially recruited candidates in all districts but only ended up fielding nominees in 93 after some dropped out. Reid blames the party for failing to retain them.
“This year, we got 100 districts. And the real reason to have this happen … is that Virginia is the first opportunity for really any state in the United States to answer back to what’s going on in Washington right now,” he said. “It’s going to send a big loud message to the rest of the country and to the world that, yeah, not everybody in America is with Trump.”
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, who chairs the House Democrats’ campaign efforts, praised the recruitment effort and called it a reflection of the stakes facing the country in 2025.
“This is a unique moment in the future of America in which those who want to preserve our systems of government, our economy, and our freedoms, know they need to step forward,” Helmer said in a phone interview Wednesday. 
“We are going to win seats this year. We’re going to hold a majority. We’re going to protect Virginians. We’re going to make sure that we are the bulwark in the storm that is the Trump-Musk administration.”
The historic sweep could also pay off strategically, said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.
“This is a big development from the perspective of turnout,” Farnsworth said. “Even in districts where you’re not going to win, you’re going to help pump up the vote for your party, and that can help statewide candidates.”
After news of DeBellis’ candidacy surfaced online, Loudoun County GOP Chairman Scott Pio voiced his frustration on social media — not at Democrats, but at his own party.
“Oh Look! Democrats competing in every single seat in Virginia. Yet, the Republicans are missing 30 seats,” Pio wrote on X, referencing data from the Virginia Public Access Project showing Republicans fielding candidates in only 70 House races.
Taking aim at GOP leadership, including Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, Pio added: “We are headed for disaster in November. It was a campaign promise of mine to contest every single seat in the House. We would have filled every single one of them!!! The RPV does not have their eyes on the prize. Rather just to become famous.”
 Party leaders remain at odds with Reid

Despite his effort in putting Democrats ahead of Republicans, Reid’s role hasn’t been without controversy. This cycle alone, he claims credit for recruiting Democratic candidates in 23 Republican-leaning districts and hasn’t hesitated to call out the Democratic Party of Virginia for what he sees as strategic failures. That has sometimes strained relations with party brass.
In a Feb. 8 email obtained by The Mercury, Tina Winkler, a top DPVA official, warned local party leaders to be cautious when dealing with Reid, accusing him of being “harassing and intrusive” and urging that they were “not obligated to take his calls.” She also expressed concerns that he was encouraging some candidates to skip the required petition process.
Reid, in response, refuted the latter as a “flat-out lie,” and defended his efforts. “They like to call it being pushy. I don’t call it that,” he said. “I might be a thorn in the side of folk, but that’s because this exposes the fact that they’re not doing their homework.”
UMW’s Farnsworth, however, said Democrats should recognize Reid’s value. 
“Fergie Reid is doing a huge favor for the Democratic Party of Virginia, even if they don’t want to recognize it as such,” he said. “Persuading someone to run in a district that is overwhelmingly supportive of the other party takes some serious energy.”
Asked about Reid’s contributions, Helmer was careful with his words but acknowledged the broader team effort.
“I’m grateful for all of the amazing partners we have, and thankful for all the people who have stepped forward to run,” he said. “We, as a House Democratic caucus, have provided support to more candidates than ever in history, and will continue to do that in order to make sure that we deliver for the people.”
As for DeBellis, the chef-turned-candidate said he’s not running with illusions of flipping the seat easily — but with the conviction that every voter deserves a choice. Raised by a single mother with disabilities, he said he saw firsthand how government aid could make the difference between dependency and independence.
“She got government assistance to get a van so she could go to work and not stay home on welfare,” he said of his mom, who is deceased. “She was my idol, she was a fighter — and she was a Trump supporter for one issue — abortion.”
DeBellis said he doesn’t know much about his opponent Bloxom personally but believes it’s fair to ask what he’s delivered for the district.
“He’s been there for over a decade, and I’m curious as to what have the people gotten from it?” he said. “I’m sure he’s a wonderful man, but I’m just curious — what has he been doing?”
Bloxom notched several bipartisan legislative wins this year. 
He sponsored bills to streamline permitting for marine construction projects, shift dredging grant oversight to the Marine Resources Commission, and eliminate redundant state licensing for produce dealers already covered by federal law.
Bloxom also broke with most Republicans in 2024 to support legislation safeguarding same-sex marriage in Virginia. 
In a phone interview Wednesday, Bloxom said having a Democratic challenger this year means he’ll need to kick his campaign into gear and begin fundraising.
While redistricting has altered the boundaries of House District 100, Bloxom said the core character of the district remains unchanged, particularly on the Eastern Shore, where local issues often outweigh party politics.
“My experience has been that some of the people who’ve moved here from off the Shore came to learn that we were always more concerned with the Eastern Shore, and it didn’t really matter if you were a Republican or Democrat,” Bloxom said. 
“(Former delegate) Lynwood Lewis carried the area for 10 years before me, and he was a Democrat, and my father had it before Lyn, and he was Republican. But some of the people that have moved here in recent years are just so die hard. I mean, you can’t even talk to them.”
DeBellis and his wife Lenore now live full-time in Cape Charles, where she owns a café and he sometimes teaches boxing at the local YMCA. As campaign season heats up, DeBellis said he’s ready to lace up the gloves — politically speaking.
“I think corporate America is greedy,” he said. “They have put us in a position now that we’re in with all these oligarchs running around, and Trump is a disaster for any sense of this. He’s a disaster just as a human being, forget the presidency.”

As the Trump administration seeks to carry out mass deportations, it’s sought partnerships with countries to take migrants, such as sending them to CECOT, a notorious prison in El Salvador.The practice has spawned numerous ongoing lawsuits over use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and allegations the administration is ignoring due process for deportees.In a complication, Libya’s prime minister in Tripoli, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, wrote on social media that his country would not accept migrants deported by the Trump administration.“We refuse to be a destination for the deportation of migrants under any pretext, and any understandings made by illegal parties that do not represent the Libyan state, and do not bind us politically or morally, as human dignity and national sovereignty are not a negotiable card,” he wrote.Injunction bars removalsAttorneys say such removals would violate Murphy’s preliminary injunction granted in April.“Class members were being scheduled for removal despite not receiving the required notice and opportunity to apply for (United Nations Convention Against Torture) protection,” according to the filing. “This motion follows class counsel receiving multiple reports that class members and their immigration counsel have not received the required protections provided by this Court’s Preliminary Injunction.”The attorneys are also asking that any class members removed to Libya be returned to U.S. soil.Flights to Saudi ArabiaThere are also concerns that those in the group could be removed to Saudi Arabia.“Class Counsel has also received a report that Defendants and those working with them may be planning flights to Saudi Arabia. At least one detainee—a citizen of Laos—reported that he had been verbally informed he was to be removed imminently to Saudi Arabia on a military flight,” according to the brief.The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.In April, Murphy certified the class to include all immigrants with final orders of removal who were facing deportations to a country that was not their home country.Murphy, who was appointed by former president Joe Biden, issued a nationwide injunction to bar that group’s removal to a third country without first being provided written notice.He also ruled that those who are being removed to such a country must “be given an opportunity to explain why such a deportation will likely result in their persecution, torture, and/or death.”The suit was brought by the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and Human Rights First.“Libya has a long record of extreme human rights violations,” according to the court filing. “Any Class Member who is removed to Libya faces a strong likelihood of imprisonment followed by torture and even disappearance or death.

Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday celebrated signing legislation that ends a narrow exception to the state’s ban on gender affirming care for transgender minors as well as  another bill ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state.","Gov. Patrick Morrisey ceremoniously signed Senate Bill 474 and Senate Bill 299 during an event in Hinton Wednesday. (Photo courtesy Morrisey's office)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday celebrated signing legislation that ends a narrow exception to the state’s ban on gender affirming care for transgender minors as well as  another bill ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state. 
Morrisey held the ceremonial bill signings for Senate Bill 299 and SB 474 at the Summers County Memorial Building in Hinton on Wednesday morning. 
In 2023, state lawmakers passed a strict ban on gender-affirming care for minors, including a ban on gender-affirming surgeries for minors. That law allowed children diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria to receive medical therapy, including hormonal treatment, if they are considered at risk for self-harm or suicide. 
SB 299 ends that exception, banning hormone treatment for children diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria. 
“In 2023 the state passed laws banning these practices for minors but it left open a loophole, something you could drive a truck through,” Morrisey said. “And that was being used by doctors to continue mutilating our kids. So today I will also be ceremoniously signing Senate bill 299 to close that loophole, and officially end the practice of child mutilation in the state of West Virginia.”
Gender-affirming surgeries are not being and have not been practiced on children in West Virginia, according to multiple medical experts and service providers who have testified at the Legislature over the last few years. 
Medical treatments for children with gender dysphoria can include prescribing certain hormones or hormone blockers, which delay the onset of puberty temporarily to stop the development of permanent physical characteristics that don’t match the child’s gender identity. Studies show these medical interventions are highly successful in preventing long term and serious psychological issues — including depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, which are already more common in transgender youth and adults than their cisgender peers.
According to a 2024 survey by the LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit The Trevor Project, 51% of trans and non-binary children in West Virginia considered suicide in the previous year while 16% of them attempted suicide. 
The bill passed with an 86-to-12 vote in the House of Delegates and a 32-to-2 vote in the Senate.
Proponents of the bill argued minors shouldn’t be allowed to make a potentially irreversible decision. As minors, a patient’s parents or guardians would have had to consent to any medical treatments.
The bill was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia, who called gender affirming care “life-saving.”
Roughly 100 youth in the state are currently receiving gender-affirming care, and the measure will halt their medical care in August. The bill has exceptions to permit individuals with sex development issues or someone who has already undergone gender-affirming care surgery to continue receiving hormonal treatment.
Nationwide, states that have implemented bans on gender-affirming care for children have seen a significant increase in suicide attempts by transgender and gender nonconforming teenagers in the years following those bans taking effect. 
Doctors warned West Virginia lawmakers during the session that if SB 299 were to become law, they will likely see an increase in anxiety, depression and suicide among the state’s trans and non-binary children.
 Ending DEI in West Virginia

SB 474, ending DEI initiatives, was a priority for Morrisey. The bill bans the offering of specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex. It applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education.
Morrisey on Wednesday called DEI programs a “huge problem” and said they were “flourishing” in the state.
“Weve had to clean up that mess, and I’m proud to do that, but this really matters and here’s why it matters: I want everyone to understand that every person, every person should be treated with dignity and respect,” Morrisey said. “We should view people equally both under the eyes of God and the rule of law. That’s what this is about …. Don’t let anyone try to convince you that this is something other than that.”
Democrats in the Senate have raised legal concerns about the legislation and “a series of procedural irregularities” when Republicans passed the legislation in the final minutes of the legislative session. The ACLU-WV has threatened to sue if the bill became law.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/morrisey-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 17:09:54.648966
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-07 20:25:32+00:00,CT Mirror,Audubon: The Hartford dropped coverage over advocacy concerns,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/07/audubon-the-hartford-insurance-coverage-environmental-advocacy/,The Hartford said it dropped the Audubon chapter's insurance coverage because it was operating as an 'environmental protection organization.',"One of Connecticut’s oldest and largest insurance firms is facing blowback this week after attempting to drop coverage for an Audubon Society chapter located in upstate New York due to its concerns that the group was engaging in environmental advocacy.
The Southern Adirondack Audubon Society says it received a letter from The Hartford — the company whose namesake is the city where it was founded in 1810 — in early April notifying the group that its business policy would not be renewed once it expires this summer. 
The stated rationale for the decision, according to a copy of the letter shared with The Connecticut Mirror, was that the insurer had learned the Audubon chapter was operating as an “environmental protection organization.”
Rob Snell, the president of the chapter, said he was floored when he saw the letter and the company’s explanation. 
“We don’t do any advocacy work,” Snell said in an interview. “We take people out bird watching … We have weekly programs that cover anything from being a beekeeper to the state of snapping turtles in upstate New York, to, you know, bluebirds. They’re all informational, educational. That’s what we do.”
The group took out the policy last year, Snell said, in order to insure an antenna being installed on the roof of a local college to track bird migrations. The group doesn’t own any other property or buildings and has not made any claims on the policy, he added.
After following up through their broker, Snell said the chapter received a longer written explanation stating that The Hartford is “not a market for associations who look to protect analyze, or monitor the environment against misuse or degradation from human forces.” 
The company also pointed to language on the chapter’s website stating that its “primary goal is to protect the environment by preserving natural habitats and promoting environmental education,” as well as the political advocacy of the National Audubon Society, of which the chapter is a member.
The Hartford did not dispute any part of the chapter’s account but issued a statement through a spokesman on Tuesday stating that “underwriting decisions are based on an assessment of risk and are not informed by political and social viewpoints of any persuasion.”
The spokesman, Matthew Sturdevant, went on to say that environmental-protection organizations and other advocacy groups are “generally ineligible” for small business coverage but that exceptions are sometimes made for groups with a “lower risk profile.”
“We are reviewing the facts and circumstances of this policy and will address it with our customer and their agent directly,” Sturdevant said. “As a company, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to environmental stewardship in our day-to-day operations in a number of ways, such as reducing energy usage, using renewable energy sources, and reducing water usage and waste.”
On its corporate website, the The Hartford boasts of its concern for climate change and commitment to “responsible investing” with a focus on sustainability, natural resources, waste and pollution. In 2022, the company announced a plan to drastically reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions.
News of the chapter’s issues with the insurance company was first reported over the weekend by the Albany Times-Union.
By the next day, the story grabbed the attention of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, which sent a letter to The Hartford chief executive Christopher J. Swift, demanding an explanation of the decision and any policies the company has to base underwriting decisions on the speech of its customers.
Tom Swan, the executive director of CCAG, pointed to a similar report last year of a Washington, D.C.-based community development nonprofit receiving a nonrenewal notice from its insurer, Travelers, which also has a large presence in Hartford. (Travelers told the magazine Shelterforce that the notice had been sent in error).
While Swan said he was not aware of any groups in Connecticut facing such issues, the notices have raised concerns among advocates that they could be targeted for speaking out on certain topics, regardless of whether their advocacy creates risk. 
“I don’t think anyone would think of the Audubon being at the extreme of the environmental or any other movement,” Swan said, adding that he’s yet to receive a respond to CCAG’s letter.
A spokeswoman for the Audubon’s New York and Connecticut regional office, which includes the Southern Adirondack chapter, did not respond to requests for comment this week. 
Swan’s group also sent a copy of its letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and Insurance Commissioner Andrew Mais. In a statement Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Insurance Department confirmed receipt of the letter and said the agency has reached out to the company.
“We understand that The Hartford is reviewing the matter and expect the company to issue a public statement and determination regarding the policy shortly,” said the spokeswoman, Mary Quinn. 
On Tuesday, several days after the story was first published, Snell said he received another notice from The Hartford stating that the company had reversed its decision and would allow the policy to renew. 
While Snell said he’s yet to discuss the matter with his board, he’s hesitant to take the company up on its offer and will likely try to find another provider willing to work with the chapter. In the meantime, he said, the group has filed a complaint with the New York Department of Financial Services, which regulates insurers.
“Because of the way this whole thing evolved, it gives me a pretty strong indication of what their underlying feelings are towards the environment, wildlife in general,” Snell said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0506_SR_TheHartford_010-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 17:09:54.648966

(Photo provided)The Trump administration has nominated North Dakota district court judge Nicholas Chase to be the next U.S. attorney for North Dakota, U.S. Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer announced Wednesday.
Chase is an East Central Judicial District judge with chambers in Fargo. He was appointed to the position in 2022 by then-Gov. Doug Burgum. Previously, Chase served for 20 years in the North Dakota U.S. Attorney’s Office including time as first assistant U.S. attorney and acting U.S. attorney.
Hoeven and Cramer, who recommended Chase for the position, said they will work to advance Chase’s confirmation “as quickly as possible.”
“Nick has dedicated his career to public service and the pursuit of justice in North Dakota and has a proven record of building cooperation among federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies,” the Republicans said in a joint statement.
In a social media post, North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said Chase was an “outstanding” choice by President Donald Trump.
“Judge Chase is a dedicated public servant with deeply held constitutional and patriotic principles,” wrote Wrigley, who twice served as North Dakota’s U.S. attorney.
Chase earned a bachelor’s degree from Minot State University in 1991 and graduated with a juris doctorate from the University of North Dakota in 1995. He also worked in private practice and as a federal judicial law clerk.  
If confirmed, Chase would succeed Mac Schneider, who served as U.S. attorney under the Biden administration. Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl is acting U.S. attorney for North Dakota.

Melissa Schmidt, a Republican from Eldridge (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri House Republicans muscled their biggest tax-cut priority of the year across the finish line on Wednesday, sending a bill exempting capital gains from income tax to Gov. Mike Kehoe.
No Democrats supported the bill, although 10 did vote “present” to show they supported provisions of the legislation other than the exemption on profits from the sale of property or investments held more than a year.
The bill applies to income received this calendar year, so it has a bigger bite into state revenue for the current fiscal year than it does for future years. The fiscal note for the bill estimates the change could reduce state revenue in the first year  just under $430 million. In future years, the bill is estimated to reduce revenues by approximately $340 million annually.
House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins, a Bowling Green Republican, sponsored the bill. In an interview after the vote, he said he was surprised that no Democrats joined Republicans on the 102-41 vote. 
“There were a lot of Senate Democrats who voted for it,” Perkins said.
 
The tax cut vote came as the Friday deadline for passing the state budget approaches. During debate, Democrats said they are concerned that state revenues are stagnant and federal funding for many programs is in jeopardy.
“There are good pieces in this bill, but I fear it might be a pig that we put some lipstick on,” said state Rep. Stephanie Hein, a Springfield Democrat.
Citing estimates from a left-leaning think tank published in The Independent, Democrats also questioned whether the fiscal note truly reflects how much revenue would decline under the bill. 
Federal tax data from returns filed for 2022 shows individual income tax filers from Missouri reported $13.3 billion in capital gains income. Allowing a deduction of that amount would reduce state revenue by more than $600 million if it is all taxed at the top rate of 4.7%
“I’m not sure that our budget can afford that, especially at a time when we’ve chosen not to fully fund our schools,” said state Rep. Kemp Strickler, a Democrat from Lee’s Summit.
Perkins said he also thinks the fiscal note is inaccurate, but for a different reason. The estimate does not account for increased economic activity from new investments made by people who retain the money, he said.
But he also acknowledged that the revenue reduction estimate could be inaccurate.
“The possibility exists that you are right as well,” Perkins said to Strickler.
Under the bill, individuals would receive the capital gains exemption immediately. Corporations would be exempt in the year after the top individual income tax rate declines to 4.5% under a state law lowering the rate when revenue growth hits a trigger amount.
Revenues are unlikely to trigger a one-tenth percentage point cut in the tax rate until 2028, the fiscal note states, making the corporate capital gains exemption unlikely until at least Jan. 1, 2030.
The capital gains exemption for individuals is estimated to reduce revenue by about $110 million annually. Corporations are expected to see their taxes reduced by about $180 million annually when the exemption is triggered.
The bill won votes from five of the 10 Democrats in the state Senate after the delay in the corporate exemption was added along with other tax cut provisions for lower-income Missourians.
They are:

Increased credit amounts and income limits for the refundable property tax credit known as the “circuit breaker” available to people over 65 and people with disabilities. The changes included in the bill would reduce state revenue by about $84 million.
A sales tax exemption for diapers and feminine hygiene products that would eliminate the 4.225% state portion of the tax. Local sales taxes would remain in place. The exemption would reduce state revenue by about $37 million annually.

The circuit breaker tax credit was established in 1973. People over age 65 and those who have a qualifying disability and rent their homes can claim a tax credit to offset property taxes of up to $750 if their income is less than $27,500. The credit for homeowners is up to $1,100 if they own their home if their income is less than $30,000.
The bill would increase the maximum credit for renters to $1,055. For homeowners, the maximum credit would be increased to $1,550. It would also increase the income limits for claiming the credit, to $38,200 for renters and $41,000 for homeowners, with slightly higher amounts allowed for married couples claiming the credit.
For the first time, the credit amount and the income limits would be indexed for inflation.
Most of the benefits from a cut in the capital gains rate for individuals would go to a small slice of taxpayers. The 23,800 federal returns filed for 2022 with incomes greater than $500,000 a year represent 0.8% of all returns but included 65% of the capital gains income.
State revenues are already trending lower for the current fiscal year, down more than 2% through Tuesday. If continued to the end of the fiscal year, revenues would fall about $300 million below estimates made in January.
Republicans who argued for the tax cut said they see no problem if revenues decline. The answer, they said, is to cut spending.
“I’m going to tell you,” said state Rep. Jim Murphy, a St. Louis Republican, “if you keep spending, and you keep spending, and you keep spending, we’re not going to be able to do the things we really need to do in this chamber, and that’s to help the people who deserve it.”
Democrats, however, said increases for the circuit breaker and the sales tax exemptions are attempts to mask a giveaway to the rich.
“No one’s sitting at any marble tables around the 73rd talking about capital gains tax,” said state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson. “They are talking about these eggs. They are talking about how they have to use the emergency room for their primary care physician. They do talk about that.”

(University of Kentucky photo)The Kentucky Kernel, the student newspaper at the University of Kentucky, said the university has provided it with requested public records after a court order. 
In a Wednesday story, the newspaper reported UK provided documents a student editor requested following an alleged rape in one of the campus’ dorms in September. The Kernel sought access to records of all non-student guests who signed into the dorm on Sept. 20 following multiple reports of sexual assault on campus during the fall semester. 
UK initially denied the newspaper’s open records request, arguing the documents were protected by personal privacy exemptions. The Kernel filed a lawsuit against UK in Fayette Circuit Court to gain access to the records. 
Judge Thomas L. Travis ruled last month that UK must provide the records to the Kernel that show when the alleged perpetrator in the September incident signed into and out of the dorm. Other names of students and guests could be redacted from the records, the judge said. 
“​​We complied with the Court’s ruling,” UK spokesperson Jay Blanton said in a statement to the Kentucky Lantern. “We are pleased that the Court recognized the need to redact ‘so as to account for legitimate privacy concerns associated with disclosure of the names of both ‘guests’ and ‘hosts’ alike.’ Throughout this litigation, the university has insisted that it must protect the privacy of student residents and their guests.”
Michael Abate, who frequently represents Kentucky media outlets in open government lawsuits, represented the Kernel in the case. 
“We’re very pleased that the court ruled these records had to be released and we’re glad to finally have them,” Abate told the Kernel. “We don’t understand why the university fought so hard to keep this information from the public, but we do think that it raises some questions as to whether the visitor policy in the dorms is being consistently and strictly enforced.”
Abbey Cutrer, the Kernel’s editor in chief who requested the records from UK, previously told the Lantern that the records could shine light on whether the university was following its protocols for residence hall security.
UK and the Kernel have previously duked it over access to public records. In 2021, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled in favor of the newspaper which sought records from UK regarding a sexual misconduct case involving a former professor. That lawsuit lasted five years.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18083chellgrenhall52-1024x768.webp,,,2025-05-07 17:09:54.648966

So far, Maine has stood apart, successfully safeguarding transgender students’ rights — even prevailing in federal court, where a judge ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week to resume funding it had frozen over the state’s inclusive policies.
The months-long standoff between the state and federal government began after Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) posted a photo of a trans student athlete on her legislative Facebook page. That post went viral and soon thereafter President Donald Trump singled out Maine for its policy allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports, prompting Gov. Janet Mills to tell the president she would see him in court.
Since that exchange, at least three federal agencies opened investigations into Maine, claiming the state’s inclusion of transgender athletes violated Title IX. While on the federal level, Mills has defended Maine’s Human Rights Act, which protects people from discrimination based on gender identity, she has also said the issue is “worthy of debate” on the state level. And internal communications obtained by the Maine Morning Star show staff from the Maine Attorney General’s office flagged two proposed anti-trans bills to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Amid this federal scrutiny, those two bills — along with six others — are scheduled for a public hearing on Thursday.
‘This is about more than sports’: The real stakes for trans athletes

The bills threaten to “roll back civil rights, ban transgender girls from participating on girls’ sports teams, and open the door to harassment, bullying and abuse of all youth,” said Gia Drew, executive director of Equality Maine, in a statement about the legislation.
“Every student should have the freedom to be themselves, to be safe, and to feel respected at school.”
Four bills about trans athletes and school bathrooms
The two bills flagged for the Trump administration, LD 868 and LD 233, were sponsored by Republican Reps. Elizabeth Caruso of Caratunk and Dick Campbell of Orrington.
Campbell’s bill introduces a blanket ban on “allowing a person whose biological sex assigned at birth is male” to participate in a girls athletic program. Caruso’s bill is broader; allowing for a co-ed program, but also restricting access to bathrooms and locker rooms for trans girls.
A third bill, LD 1134 introduced by Sen. Susan Bernard (R-Aroostook), similarly bans transgender girls from accessing girls athletics, school facilities and bathrooms.
During a press conference in March, Caruso, Assistant House Minority Leader Katrina Smith of Palermo and Libby, who posted the photo of the trans athlete, touted the proposals as a women’s rights issue, arguing they are essential to “protect girls” from losing to or being harmed by trans girls.

In addition to cosponsoring Bernard’s bill, Smith also introduced legislation, LD 1704, specifically focused on banning school districts from adopting policies that allow students to use bathrooms aligned with their gender identity (as opposed to sex assigned at birth). Her bill also directs the Maine Department of Education to update its rules to reflect this change. 
Broader bills impacting Maine Human Rights Act
Two bills specifically seek to weaken the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to explicitly protect people from discrimination based on their gender identity. Caruso also introduced LD 1337, which would amend the provisions in the Maine Human Rights Act that govern unlawful educational discrimination “to provide that they may not be construed to affect the rights of a female athlete” under Title IX. Title IX does not mention transgender students, so Caruso’s bill is relying on the Trump administration’s interpretation of the federal law. Caruso’s bill would also exempt privately-run women’s shelters from the human rights law.
In a press conference last month, Rep. Michael Soboleski (R-Phillips) announced his bill, LD 1432, which would remove consideration of gender identity from the human rights act. During that event, Republicans called on Democrats and Mills to pass the bill to avoid the risk of losing federal funding.

“The problem is that the term gender identity and the Human Rights Act is being interpreted way too broadly by the left,” said Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook). “And what it’s saying is there’s no boundary between men’s and women’s spaces.”
Earlier this year, Iowa became the first state in the nation to remove civil rights from a state law when its legislature voted to remove gender identity from its civil rights act.
But Maine has protected trans people from discrimination in court for years before gender identity was added as a protected class, Drew from Equality Maine said. 
“To some people, it may seem like gender identity as a protected class is this new idea or concept, but it really isn’t,” she said. 
“It’s been really part of the conversations since 2005 at least, and it’s been tested multiple times in the courts,” Drew added, pointing to several cases including the landmark 2014 ruling by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, which found that denying a transgender girl access to the girls’ restroom at her school violated her rights under Maine’s Human Rights Act.
Bill to ban students from using affirming pronouns
Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls), a retired teacher and member of the Education Committee, introduced legislation aiming to mandate that educators in public and charter schools refer to a student by the name and gender listed on their birth certificate. 
The only exception schools can make under Lyman’s proposal, LD 1002, would be if upon a student’s enrollment, a parent or guardian provides written permission or documentation showing a legal name change. 
Pronoun bans are also common across the country in Republican-led states, with some extreme versions such as Florida’s law that criminalizes the use of affirming pronouns.
The Maine Department of Education has encouraged districts to develop policies affirming LGBTQ+ students, including honoring their pronouns.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-07 20:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Victim services at risk of cuts as federal funding streams run dry,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/07/ct-victim-services-federal-funding/,Nonprofits that work with survivors of crimes like child abuse and domestic violence are bracing for programming cuts as federal dollars recede.,"Connecticut nonprofits that work with survivors of crime are bracing for programming cuts as sources of federal dollars that support their work recede.  
Dozens of organizations that work with survivors of domestic violence, child abuse, sexual violence and human trafficking are supported financially through the Crime Victims Fund, a federal program that collects and redistributes penalties and fines from federal criminal convictions. 
In recent years, as the balance in that fund has declined, Connecticut supplemented its share with federal COVID-19 relief money. Now those funds are about to run out. 
The amount of money in the Crime Victims Fund — established under the federal Victim of Crimes Act, or VOCA — has steadily declined in recent years, from a peak of $13.1 billion in 2017 to $3.3 billion in 2024. And ongoing lawsuits against two defendants over large penalties has put 60% of the fund’s balance in limbo, according to an October memo from the Connecticut Judicial Branch’s Office of Victim Services, which distributes the federal grant.
Marc Pelka, deputy director of the office, told the Connecticut Mirror in an email that Connecticut’s share of that grant has dropped from $24 million to $9 million in the last five years.
In order to maintain funding at the necessary level, the state legislature allocated $48 million in federal coronavirus relief money to bolster the Crime Victims Fund from 2023 through 2025. But as of next year, when the emergency relief runs out, the amount of available funding for victim service providers in Connecticut is expected to drop by 29%, Pelka said.
Nonprofits who work with victims are already gearing up for the change. 
Gary Steck, the CEO of Wellmore Behavioral Health, which provides mental health services for children and substance abuse programs for adults, told CT Mirror in an email that they currently receive $235,000 from the Office of Victim Services. He said they expect a reduction of 14% in their grant for next year, meaning they will have to reduce the number of children they can serve annually from 400 to 345.
“That’s [a] big hit at once when you consider these are traumatized kids, but it may be worse,” he said. Most of the funding, he said, goes toward treatment for children and teens who are crime victims, and their families.
Josiah Brown, the executive director of Connecticut CASA, told CT Mirror that the agency learned the maximum grant it would receive would be the same annual amount it’s gotten for the past three years: about $142,000. The problem with that, Brown said, is that CASA’s program has grown significantly since 2022. 
CASA, which stands for Court Appointed Special Advocates, assigns volunteers to visiting a single child or set of siblings on a monthly basis for at least a year and a half. The purpose is to provide a consistent adult advocate for children who have experienced abuse and neglect, in a system where the social workers and attorneys assigned to these children are under large caseloads. 
Brown said the first year CASA received VOCA funds, it had three staff members and worked in two courts — Waterbury and New Haven. Since then, it has expanded to five full-time staff and one part-time staff member who work in seven courts around the state. Brown said the organization asked the state for $250,000 this year, but he said it has not yet been included in the state budget. 
“We are serving a growing number of children who have high needs, Brown said. “And while it’s meant to be a public-private partnership with some of our funds coming from foundation grants and private donations and event sponsorships, to expect, over the long term, for the majority of such funds to come from private sources would be an excessive expectation.”
Beth Hamilton of the CT Alliance to End Sexual Violence said her organization receives $5.1 million in VOCA funds each year. That money goes toward the alliance’s nine community-based sexual assault crisis programs, running the agency’s 24/7 hotline, and providing a variety of services, including one-on-one counseling, survivor support groups, assistance with housing and food insecurity and a legal representation team.
Hamilton said she doesn’t yet know if or by how much the alliance’s funding will be cut. She said that Governor Ned Lamont had allocated $1.25 million in his budget proposal for the alliance and she hoped it would be enough to make up for any federal funding the organization might lose. 
For Hamilton, deeper cuts to funding could mean the organization would not be able to continue operating their hotline 24/7, or have enough people to accompany every survivor who goes to the emergency room for a forensic evidence collection. 
She said her organization, which serves between 7,500 and 8,000 people annually, helps mainly low-income people who don’t have a lot of other ways to access services. “My real fear is, the more that word might get out about changing services, the less survivors think that they have outlets to reach out to and get support,” Hamilton said. 
Meghan Scanlon of the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence said her organization was already making plans in anticipation of changes to VOCA funding. CCADV received $8.5 million through VOCA in FY2025 and she expects it will lose about a third of that.
The organization asked the state of Connecticut to allocate $1 million to keep its domestic violence hotline going. Scanlon said they received about 25,000 calls to their hotline last year. 
The remainder of the federal funds that the organization receives go to 18 local domestic violence agencies across the state, where Scanlon said they cover costs of staff who help victims with safety planning and obtaining housing and other services, as well as those who support victims during court proceedings. 
CCADV has asked those 18 organizations each to reduce their budgets by 30% in anticipation of the cuts. 
BHcare, one of the organizations CCADV funds, has been working to reduce its budget by 30%, said Emily Granelli, the organization’s chief business development officer.
That hasn’t been easy, Granelli said. “ The only way we can continue to serve the population that we serve, which is over 6,000 victims and children every year, is to provide them less services,” she said. 
Granelli said ultimately the budget cuts affected the entire support system for victims.  
“ If we’re all short-staffed, we’re all funded by the same funding stream, [incoming phone calls] will just keep rolling around,” she explained. “ So there are people that won’t be able to get the help that they need when they need it, and in domestic violence situations, in the worst case scenario, people could lose their lives.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0118_SR_PeoplesMarch_990-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-07 17:09:54.648966

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Tampa Hula Bay Club on May 7, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis is standing by Attorney General James Uthmeier’s open defiance of a federal court order requiring law enforcement agencies in Florida to halt immigration arrests under a new state immigration law.
Talking with reporters in Tampa, the governor said the episode raises a “larger issue” of who can enact public policy in the United States.
“He’s right on the law,” DeSantis said about Uthmeier’s decision to defy the court. “He has the courage to stand and do what’s right, even knowing that he’s going to get blowback.”
DeSantis made those comments following a roundtable discussion on providing property tax relief at the Hula Bay Club in South Tampa. He said the legal standoff raises the question of whether it’s the public who get to decide policy through popular elections or “unelected lifetime-appointed judges.”
“There’s a role for the judiciary, but it’s to decide a case and a controversy before you,” he said. “It’s not to go outside the bounds of judicial policy or judicial role and try to enact policy.”
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida has suspended enforcement of the law (SB 4-C), passed by the Legislature in a special session in February and signed by the governor on Feb. 13, that gives state officers the power to arrest someone they suspect of entering the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
Uthmeier has since filed an appeal of that decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
In a filing Wednesday, Uthmeier asked the appellate court to allow law enforcement to continue arrests as the litigation continues. The arrest by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper of a U.S. citizen in Tallahassee on April 16 under the law drew national attention and the ire of Williams, who had suspended the law on April 4.
U.S. citizen released from jail after arrest under Florida’s new anti-immigration law

“The district court’s order wrongly binds all of Florida’s law-enforcement officers — who are not parties, not the parties’ agents, and not acting in concert with the parties — flouting longstanding equitable principles entitling every litigant to ‘their day in court,'” the state’s attorneys wrote.
At issue is also a letter Uthmeier wrote to law enforcement agencies in Florida on April 23 after Williams’ original order blocking the law, advising them in part that “no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes [their] agencies from continuing to enforce” the law.
Williams wrote in an order last week that Uthmeier needs to show cause why he should not be held in contempt or sanctioned for violating her order. A hearing on that matter is scheduled for May 29.
Bashing the judicial
The governor and Uthmeier contend that the judge in the case has gone beyond her boundaries in calling on Florida law enforcement agencies to stop making immigration arrests.
“She’s trying to exercise authority that she does not possess. Fine,” DeSantis said. “There’s parties to the case and she’s rendered a decision even though it’s a flawed decision that will be appealed. … You can’t go out and then say some sheriff in the Panhandle is somehow subject to your order — they were not involved in the litigation at all.”
DeSantis’ criticisms echo those of President Donald Trump, who faces more than 200 lawsuits in just the first 100-plus days of his presidency, challenging the legality of his orders, according to Reuters. The president has referred to some of those judges as “radical,” “conflicted,” and “rogue.”
Defiant Uthmeier says he won’t tell cops to stop arrests under suspended immigration law

Background on the suit
The ACLU challenged the law last month, along with Americans for Immigrant Justice on behalf of the Farmworkers Association of Florida, the Florida Immigrant Coalition, and two women lacking permanent legal status.
The law makes it a misdemeanor for adults who came to the U.S. illegally by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers to enter Florida. The groups contend that the law is unconstitutional because only federal authorities have the power to enforce immigration laws.
Since the lawsuit was filed, Judge Williams has issued and extended the restraining order that banned state authorities from enforcing the new law, but Uthmeier says he fundamentally disagrees with her decision.
“She wants the law enforcement officers to stop committing arrests, and the problem is the ACLU didn’t sue any law enforcement officers,” Uthmeier said Tuesday night in an interview broadcast by the Newsmax cable network.
“So if they want to arrest people under the law, if they want to hand them over to ICE, if they want to help the Trump administration carry out detentions and deportations, they have the legal authority to do that, and I’m not going to stand in their way.”

The lawsuit was filed by attorney Todd Flood in Washtenaw County Circuit Court on behalf of 20 women, identified only as “Jane Does”, and accuses the defendants of invasion of privacy, intentional abuse, and violation of rights.
The suit further contends the defendants were informed of the alleged abuses committed against the female prisoners and the psychological consequences.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Defendants were aware of these chronic staffing shortages yet implemented a policy of recording strip searches that they knew or should have known would trigger trauma responses in a population with high rates of sexual abuse history,” the filing stated.
According to the lawsuit, the 20 women were victims of exposure and violation of their privacy, as their intimate areas were recorded while using the toilet and as they showered between January and March 2025.
“Women were forced to bend at the waist, spread their buttocks, and expose their vaginal and anal cavities to live cameras worn by corrections officers, inflicting severe psychological damage and deliberately retraumatizing women with known histories of sexual trauma,” the suit stated, further contending the plaintiffs suffered profound trauma and harm as a result. First Amended Complaint Circuit Court (1)
“Many have experienced severe physical manifestations of psychological distress, including debilitating panic attacks, insomnia, gastrointestinal distress, and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Several have withdrawn from visitation with family members, resigned from prison jobs, and abandoned educational programs,” the lawsuit stated.
Additionally, the complaint highlighted what it said was a disparity in the behavior of officers toward male and female inmates. Although the policy was implemented across all MDOC facilities, it said some officers turned off their cameras during searches of male inmates and did not conduct thorough inspections as they did with female inmates, pointing out a clear difference in attitude based on the sex of the inmates.
Although the implementation of body cameras in the Huron Valley facility began earlier this year, and was partially limited two months later, the lawsuit contends the prison and its officials are not exempt from a history of abuse against female inmates.
“This history of problematic strip search practices at WHV demonstrates a recurring pattern: MDOC implements invasive search procedures that cause significant psychological harm.”
This lawsuit is not the first involving the prison, and accusations of abuse, as well as against the MDOC, including a recent allegation of sexual harassment against the department’s former spokesperson.
The plaintiffs, beyond seeking financial compensation and the destruction of the recordings, also demand the cessation of practices that violate civil rights and for the proper training of MDOC guards.
‘What these women continue to endure is nothing short of horrific. This case exposes a grotesque abuse of power that directly retraumatizes survivors of sexual assault. Despite multiple warnings about the policy’s illegality from advocacy organizations and state legislators, MDOC officials have failed to fully halt these privacy violations,’ said Flood in a press release.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2381-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-07 16:10:25.661020

The Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, both administered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were axed in March as part of the Trump administration’s move to reduce federal government spending. 
Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain said some small and mid-sized farms had already started planting and planning for their crops to be bought by schools or food banks through the defunded initiatives.
“[If they are lost], it would be detrimental for the schools, it would be detrimental for those small farmers because they really rely on this,” Strain said.
Louisiana will lose out on more than  $18 million from the food-buying programs over the next three years, according to federal data. State Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, authored Senate Concurrent Resolution 20 to urge Congress to put the funding back, specifically for schools. 
McMath is championing bills focused on the Make America Healthy Again movement to banish ultra-processed foods from school lunches. He said he believes local purchasing programs can help get healthier food options on children’s lunch trays.
In a state Senate Agriculture Committee hearing Wednesday, Strain mentioned examples of Louisiana businesses taking a hit from the federal program cuts. 
Harris Cattle Co., a Ville Platte business, sells $380,000 worth of meat to nine school districts. Another farm sold $7,000 worth of okra to area schools, the agriculture commissioner said.
“Instead of using processed foods, we want food from scratch. We want fresh okra, we want fresh broccoli, we want fresh corn on the cob. That is what we are looking for,” Strain said.
Strain said he has been in direct contacted with members of Louisiana’s congressional delegation to make them aware of the impacts from the USDA spending reductions. U.S. Rep. Julie Letlow , R-Louisiana, sits on a House Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture that met Wednesday to discuss the proposed federal budget. 
More information about the reorganization of the USDA is anticipated to be released in the coming weeks, which could mean a chance for the funding to return in some capacity, Strain said.
The Local Food for Schools Program began in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden Administration. A USDA spokesperson told Politico the programs “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency.” 
Local Food Purchase Assistance agreements in place prior to 2025 renewals were set to take effect, will remain in place for the remainder of their agreed-upon terms, according to the USDA.
McMath’s resolution does not specifically ask for food bank funding to be returned, but Feeding Louisiana executive director Pat Van Burkleo said he’ll work with a legislator next week to make that request. The latest USDA cuts come at a very inopportune time, as the Trump administration is also slashing the Emergency Food Assistance Program.
“We can’t make up what the federal government cuts for food banks. We can ask for help, but it doesn’t make it up,” Van Burkleo said
Feeding Louisiana represents the state’s five regional food banks, which cover all 64 parishes. The group is spreading a petition to gain the attention of Gov. Jeff Landry to get his support for calling on Congress to restore the funding. Their goal is 500 signatures by next week. As of Wednesday, the count was already over 260.
Van Burkleo said losing this funding not only harms schools trying to serve healthy foods, but also small farmers who often work multiple jobs without avenues to sell their produce on a greater scale.
“It is a great program designed to help the small, underserved minority farmers in rural communities. They have never had this opportunity to get this kind of dollars,” Van Burkleo said.

The package, which will reduce state revenue by about $13 million annually, would benefit low-income families, workers and veterans, as well as retirees and people receiving military pensions. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont House passes tax credit bill after compromise on military pensions.","Rep. Bill Canfield, R-Fair Haven, left, and Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, vice chair and chair respectively of the House Ways and Means Committee, confer during a committee meeting at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Jan. 25, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAfter an influx of support in both chambers, the House passed a bipartisan tax credit package on Wednesday featuring a long-debated expansion of the state’s military pension tax exemption. The proposal, S.51, includes several ideas pitched by Republican Gov. Phil Scott and celebrated by Democratic legislative leaders as progressive tax policy. All but two representatives present backed the bill on the floor Tuesday. The suite of tax credits are expected to reduce state tax revenue by more than $13 million annually.Rep. Bill Canfield, R-Fair Haven, serves as vice chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, which drafted the bill. He told his colleagues he’d submitted similar legislation for two decades without success.“I appreciate your leadership, cooperation and compromise,” he told Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, the committee’s chair.   Vermont is among a minority of states that doesn’t fully exempt military pensions from taxation. Scott — and some lawmakers — have long argued exempting the pensions would help Vermont attract and retain military retirees, who often begin second careers in middle age after decades of service. Skeptics have argued that an exemption would provide the wealthy an unfair tax advantage.But this year, a bipartisan majority of lawmakers in both the House and Senate signed on to legislation exempting military pensions from state income taxes, pressuring legislative leadership to act. Earlier this session, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a tax credit bill that did not include the military pension exemption supported by the bulk of the Legislature. But when that legislation, H.483, arrived on the House floor in March, it was quickly redirected back to committee. After a new tax credit package materialized, the bill drew broad support. S.51, as passed by the House, exempts military pensions and survivor’s benefits for people with adjusted gross income under $125,000, and creates a partial exemption for those making less than $175,000. The bill also creates a $250 refundable tax credit for low-income veterans — not just those with military pensions — making less than $25,000, with a partial credit available for those making less than $30,000. While the veteran-related credits have drawn the most political attention, they make up less than a third of the cost of the overall package. The largest change proposed is expanding Vermont’s child tax credit to include six-year-olds — a $4.5 million loss of revenue, according to the Joint Legislative Fiscal OfficeVermont’s earned income tax credit — linked to the federal initiative of the same name — would also expand under the bill for workers without children. The credit benefits lower-income individuals and households. The bill would also raise the income thresholds at which Social Security is fully or partially tax exempt by $5,000. Vermont is one of just nine states that tax Social Security, according to the Joint Legislative Fiscal Office. Following Tuesday’s preliminary vote, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, celebrated S.51’s advancement. “We’re delivering on our promise to strengthen working families, support Older Vermonters on Social Security, and recognize the dedication and sacrifices made by our veterans,” she said in a written statement. In an email, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, said the governor was “glad to see S.51 includes important tax credits he proposed to the Legislature in January as well as the substantial progress the bill makes on tax exemptions for military retirees.”The House completely amended S.51, which was an unpaid caregiver tax credit when it passed the Senate, so the bill will require further approval by the other chamber. Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, who leads the Senate’s tax writing committee, has said she would support the House’s proposal if it also includes a benefit for unpaid caregivers.   Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont House passes tax credit bill after compromise on military pensions.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/canfield-kornheiser-1-20240125-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-07 16:10:25.661020

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Abbey Cutrer)Most registered Kentucky voters surveyed in June 2024 believe that working families having access to affordable child care is important for the future of the state, according to a report released Wednesday by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. 
 
 Read the report
A Foundation for Action: Shared Solutions to Child Care Challenges in Kentucky


The Foundation for Action report, which includes policy recommendations for lawmakers to consider in 2026, comes as the child care industry is “at an impasse” despite “widespread discussions” and “efforts to address child care challenges” that include high tuition, low wages for workers and a shortage of providers. 
That June 2024 survey showed that 85% of registered voters in the state believe Kentucky families need access to affordable child care. It was a bipartisan consensus: 81% of Republicans, 89% of Democrats and 89% of Independents surveyed agreed.  
A national survey also shared in the Wednesday report showed that 79% of American voters were supportive of “federal policies aimed at providing child care benefits to families with young children.” 
That, too, was bipartisan, with 69% of Republicans, 88% of Democrats and 82% of Independents surveyed holding that stance. 
Helping more people access child care can help improve workforce participation, the report says. Kentucky’s workforce participation is lower than some of its neighbors — about 81%, compared with 86% in Missouri, about 81% in Tennessee and 84% in Ohio. 
In 2024, a survey of 1,357 parents from 88 Kentucky counties showed that some parents had already chosen to exit the workforce because of inaccessible child care. Many families put off having more children, delayed big purchases and sacrificed health care needs because of child care complications, the Lantern previously reported. 
“Access to high-quality child care is critical for working families and improving learning outcomes for kids,” Ashley Novak Butler, the executive director of the Lift a Life Novak Family Foundation in Louisville, said in a statement. “But to build an early learning ecosystem that can truly deliver for Kentucky families and children, we need collaboration and consensus among all stakeholders on the best path forward. That’s exactly what this project aimed to achieve.”
The chamber’s 50-page report is the result of a 40-member group of business leaders, workforce development experts, child care providers, advocates and more who met between August 2024 and April 2025 to come up with a list of policy suggestions to improve the child care landscape in Kentucky. 
“Conversations were not always comfortable, but they were productive,” the report states. “With a focus on the private regulated child care sector, this cross-sector of Kentuckians reached consensus on more than three dozen public policy and programmatic recommendations with specific actionable items for policymakers, business leaders, nonprofits and philanthropy. Collectively, this work creates a foundation for sustainable, long-term child care solutions in Kentucky and underscores what can be achieved when Kentuckians from different walks of life work together to solve big problems.” 
What recommendations came out of the report? 
The report has a slew of recommendations to stabilize the child care industry. They include:

Require more transparency in how the state budgets, braids and spends public dollars on child care, including both federal and state dollars. 
Reform and modernize Kentucky ALL STARS, the state’s quality rating system for early childhood programs, including child care centers.
Develop, publicly display and track more accurate measurements of actual capacity for regulated child care services. 
Create a non-intrusive and voluntary method for tracking and denoting faith-based and employer-sponsored child care services.
Conduct objective third-party studies to determine the return on taxpayer investments in child care on an annual basis.
Use a more precise meaningful measure of child care supply and demand gaps than “child care deserts.
Ensure that low- and middle-income Kentucky families can afford child care by strengthening the Child Care Assistance Program and Employee Child Care Assistance Partnership.
Make the child care business model more sustainable by streamlining regulations, alleviating workforce challenges and creating new business opportunities.
Encourage more engagement from local communities and employers in solving child care challenges through targeted local matching grants and needs-based economic development incentives.
Improve training for child care services to support children with special needs. 
Create accountable economic development incentives for businesses to create onsite or near-site child care services for their employees and communities.
And more. 

Dustin Howard, the superintendent of Clark County Public Schools, is quoted in the report as saying, “When Kentuckians have affordable high quality child care choices, our economy and employers win by growing the next generation of a viable workforce while unleashing our current workforce that will continue our upward growth as a Commonwealth,” Howard said.

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The Legislature on Tuesday rejected two bills related to the state recognition of tribes, a longstanding effort that Wabanki leaders argue would have undermined their continued push for the sovereignty afforded to other federally recognized tribes.
The Wabanaki Nations — the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation — have federal recognition, which, in theory, gives them the right to self-govern and makes them entitled to certain benefits and federal protections.
However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act has left the Wabanaki Nations with footing more akin to municipalities than independent nations. Overhauling that act is the fight for sovereignty Wabanki leaders and a growing number of bipartisan lawmakers have been pushing for years, though so far have only seen success with piecemeal change. 
The Wabanaki Nations do not have state recognition, though that’s not as abnormal. Some states have adopted state recognition processes, affording non-federally recognized tribes a path to official acknowledgement but in a way that doesn’t afford the same sovereignty or access to resources.
Wabanaki leaders say proposed state recognition process could hinder sovereignty fight

That’s the type of process Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) tried to establish in Maine, though lawmakers rejected it, arguing the state recognition process would subvert the federal process, which is also comparatively a more rigorous one. 
Poirier’s bill, LD 813, would have established a commission appointed by the governor to review applications for state recognition. The House voted 82-57 against this measure on Tuesday and the Senate rejected it without a roll call vote or discussion on Wednesday. 
On the floor on Tuesday, Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) pointed to what’s happened with Vermont’s state recognition process as a reason for Maine to not establish its own. 
After a Canadian tribe asserted groups afforded state recognition by Vermont are not Indigenous and are instead appropriating their identity and culture, Vermont is now considering a task force to reconsider past tribal recognition decisions by the state. 
Poirier has said she’d hoped LD 813 would be unnecessary because of another bill she proposed, LD 812, which sought to provide state recognition for a group called the Kineo St. John Tribe. That measure would afford such recognition without the processes detailed by the former bill. 
The House rejected the bill without a roll call vote on Tuesday and the Senate followed suit on Wednesday. 
This group, formerly under the name the Kineo Band of Malecite, another spelling for Maliseet, has pushed for this recognition for more than a decade but legislative attempts have so far failed.

Courtesy of the American Prairie Reserve). Yellowstone National Park officials reported the first bison goring of the year on Wednesday, saying a 47-year old man from Cape Coral, Florida was injured during the weekend at the park.
Park officials reminded visitors to stay 25 yards (23 meters) away from bison, which can be very dangerous, at all times.
“Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal,” a press release from the park said. “They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.”
The Florida man was gored around 3:15 p.m. in the Lake Village area after getting too close to a bison, National Park officials stated in a press release.
The man sustained “minor” injuries and was treated by emergency service personnel. The incident, which is under investigation, was the first reported bison goring of the year. There were two goring incidents last year and one in 2023.
Yellowstone has the largest bison population on public land in the country. The animals are most active during the day and around dusk. They’re often found in the summer in the Hayden and Lamar valley areas of the park.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Legislation imposing restrictions on gathering signatures for initiative petitions moved one step closer to becoming law after House lawmakers approved a revised version Wednesday. 
Proponents of the bill called it “voter empowerment” and “common sense legislation,” while critics said it would limit voices of rural and urban Oklahomans and make it nearly impossible to get a state question on the ballot. 
Senate Bill 1027, authored by House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, would limit the number of signatures that can be collected in each county to 11.5% of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election for a statutory change and 20.8% for a constitutional change. He said this is meant to include rural voters in all parts of the initiative petition process who are usually left out.
“The metros are getting double the say the rest of the state under the current process,” he said. 
The measure would give the secretary of state, who is appointed by the governor, the power to remove the gist, or summary of the ballot measure. The gist is currently reviewed by the Oklahoma attorney general and can be checked by the state Supreme Court. 
Oklahomans who sign a petition would be able to rescind their signatures and file challenges to the gist prior to signature collection, and anyone circulating a petition would need to be a registered Oklahoma voter, disclose any payment and the source of it, and cannot take money from entities outside the state. 
Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, said the bill would not limit rural participation. 
“To say that it silences rural areas is a fantasy, a fabrication, a falsehood and a fallacy,” he said. “Additionally, it’s a delusion, a deception and the source distortion. This bill facilitates the participation of everybody in Oklahoma, of every area in Oklahoma, including the metros, and including, as well, the rural areas.”

Six Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the measure, including Rep. Daniel Pae, R-Lawton. The bill advanced from the House with a vote of 69 to 23. 
Many of Pae’s constituents, as well as people from across the state, reached out to him about itl, Pae said. None of his constituents told him they had problems with a previous vote he cast against a similar measure last session, he said. 
“Fundamentally, I think this state was founded on populist values and our founders wanted power to be decentralized to localities and communities across the state of Oklahoma,” he said. “And we have this initiative petition process for a reason. Is it perfect? No, nothing is perfect in this world. But I think we should respect the spirit of this process and respect the will of our founders. Having any attempts to try to modify it in whatever way, I’ve always been in opposition.”
Oklahoma City Democrats Rep. Andy Fugate and Mickey Dollens both attempted to amend Hilbert’s legislation. Fugate’s amendment would have sent the issue to the ballot for voters to decide on. Dollens’ amendment would have extended the period for collecting signatures from 90 to 180 days. 
Both amendments were tabled. 
This action reveals the true intent of the legislation, Dollens said. He said extending the time signatures are allowed to be gathered would have allowed petitions to be circulated to all corners of the state and more rural areas.
“It just proves that this has nothing to do about getting more rural votes or signatures. This is simply about silencing the people’s constitutional right to petition their government,” he said. “And it should be noted that signatures make no effect on the outcome of a state question on the ballot. All that does is simply gain and question access to the ballot, and then everyone has the opportunity to vote for it in a general election, just like we do statewide elected officials.”
Rep. Suzanne Schreiber, D-Tulsa, said the bill limits direct democracy. She said the point of the bill is to make it “tough, if not impossible” for initiative petitions to be put on the ballot. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Another Oklahoma City Democrat, Rep. Forrest Bennett, said the current initiative petition process has produced life-saving measures like Medicaid expansion. Medical marijuana was also legalized through a state question in 2018 and raising the minimum wage is set to be on the ballot in 2026. 
“I am no stranger to bills not going my way in this room,” he said. “And it has been suggested that perhaps this is being run because some of my colleagues and some folks with power in Oklahoma are upset with what people do with their direct democracy now.” 
Rep. Jay Steagall, R-Yukon, said it is not the job of representatives to “exercise the will of the people,” but to protect their rights. 
“We do not live in a democracy. We don’t,” he said. “It was asserted here yesterday that we live in the greatest democracy in the history of the world. We do not. We live in a republic. As a matter of fact, our entire system is designed around the premise of a representative republic.”
Rep. Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, pointed to Colorado, a “blue” state, as having a similar policy. 
Colorado requires the total number of signatures collected to be 5% of those cast for secretary of state, but requires petitions seeking to amend the state constitution be signed by 2% of the total registered voters in each of the state senate districts.
Because House lawmakers amended the measure in committee, it heads back to the Senate for consideration.

Rhode Island 2025 income tax rates
Rhode Island has relied on the same three-tiered income tax rates since 2010, when lawmakers lowered the top tax rate from 9.9% to 5.99%. Earnings thresholds for each rate are adjusted annually for inflation.
Current rates are:

3.75% for filers who earn up to $79,900
4.75% for filers who earn $79,900 to $181,650
5.99% for filers who earn more than $181,650



But the person who might finally shake loose the long-stalled progressive priority wasn’t even in the room: Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III. The Providence Democrat ascended to the No 2. position in the upper chamber last week under a leadership shuffle prompted by the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
Ruggerio long-opposed raising taxes on wealthy residents, but his successor, Senate President Valarie Lawson, and her right hand, Ciccone, both support the idea, and are  co-sponsors of this year’s Senate legislation.
The companion bills introduced in February by Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat, and Sen. Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat, call for a 3% surtax on the top 1% of earners — those who make more than $625,000 a year, based on 2025, inflation-adjusted numbers. The proposal would affect about 5,700 state income tax filers and generate an extra $190 million in annual revenue for the state, according to the Economic Progress Institute, which backs the legislation.
“The reason why I have supported it is, it was something that should help the state bring more money into the state,” Ciccone said in an interview Wednesday.
Unlike Lawson, who is seen as progressive, Ciccone has garnered a reputation as one of the most conservative Democratic lawmakers in his 22 years on Smith Hill — opposing gun restrictions, protections for reproductive rights, and in 2010, voting down the legalization of gay marriage. 
  Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat, is sponsoring legislation that would increase income taxes on the top 1% of earners. Her bill was heard before the House Committee on Finance on Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (Screenshot)
An unlikely ally
Ahead of the Senate elections, progressive group Indivisible Rhode Island called for senators not to elect Ciccone as majority leader, referring to him as “Trump Lite” in a social media post. But Ciccone has aligned with progressives at times, too. He led the push in the Senate to let undocumented immigrants apply for state driver’s licenses, which was signed into law in 2022, with a July 2023 start date. And, he has long supported a version of a millionaire’s tax.
“His district is one of those districts that would benefit from something like that,” Alzate said of Ciccone. “It makes sense, with schools shutting down, and a large immigration population. I think he sees this as a way to give some relief to his constituents.” 
Put another way: “People are complicated,” said Zack Mezera, Rhode Island political director for the Working Families Party. 
“I am not going to say we expect this to pass by any means, but we’re optimistic, increasingly optimistic, with the new leadership in the Senate,” Mezera said in an interview Wednesday.
Mezera also noted that while door-knocking in Ciccone’s district over the weekend, residents overwhelmingly expressed support for higher taxes on the rich.
Per-person income in Ciccone’s Senate District 7, which covers the western side of the capital city, was $26,859 in 2023 — about 60% of the statewide average of $45,919, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. More than one in five district residents live below the federal poverty line — double the statewide poverty rate. Just 6% of the district’s households earn more than $200,000 a year. 
But will Ciccone leverage his new leadership position to advance the income tax bill in the upper chamber this year?
“It’s something we’re interested in,” he said. “The leadership team has been discussing it. We haven’t come to a total agreement on what it should look like.”
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, was similarly vague on the same question.
“I have long supported adjusting our tax code to ensure that those at the very top of the income spectrum pay their fair share,” Lawson said in an emailed response Wednesday. “However, I firmly believe in the importance of the legislative hearing process, and of hearing from all points of view on this and every matter. I look forward to the committee’s review and to discussing this issue with all of my colleagues in the coming weeks.”
A Senate committee hearing on the legislation had not been scheduled as of Wednesday.

On year six
Across the rotunda, the House Committee on Finance heard impassioned pleas for and against the “tax the rich” bill during its initial, Tuesday night hearing.
“Let’s be clear, this is not about punishing success, it’s about fairness, shared responsibility and building a Rhode Island that works for everyone, not just those at the top,” Alzate told lawmakers.
She’s made the same plea to her colleagues for each of the last five years. Yet the bill, in various forms, has failed to advance out of committee in either chamber. 
To Alzate, the need for new state revenue streams has never been greater than now, as the state stares down a $223 million projected budget deficit for fiscal 2026, while bracing for federal funding cuts.
One after the other, advocates for housing and homelessness services, public transit, and health care urged lawmakers to back the income tax hike as an alternative to stripping funds from critical services, workers and families.
“The Rhode Island health care system has been on edge for years, now we’re at the point where it’s completely unraveling,” said Alex Moore, political director with SEIU 1199, which represents more than 5,000 health care and service workers in Rhode Island. “We’re expecting closure notices, quite frankly, any day now. Our system needs several million dollars just to stop the bleeding.”
Opponents pushed back with equal force, warning of the devastation for the state economy and tax revenue as businesses and wealthy residents leave for tax-friendlier pastures across state lines. To what degree raising taxes on the rich influences migration patterns has been the subject of much debate among policy analysts nationwide and in Rhode Island.

Battle of the policy briefings
The Economic Progress Institute (EPI) in March published a 26-page policy paper to debunk the “tax migration myth” based on the state’s historic population changes and experiences in other states that have implemented some form of a millionaire’s tax.
However, the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) countered with its own, 18-page report in April examining the consequences of the proposed income tax hike. RIPEC in its report warned that the state’s dwindling population will further suffer if it adds to its three-tiered income tax structure, creating “significant risk” for state coffers. The top 1% of earners in Rhode Island paid 35% of the state’s income tax liability in 2022, according to RIPEC’s policy report.
Although neighboring Massachusetts adopted an extra 4% tax on income over $1 million beginning in 2023, more states are shifting away from complex and progressive income taxes. If Rhode Island follows the path of its northern neighbor, its already weak business climate could worsen, said Michael DiBiase, RIPEC president and CEO.
“If we pass this bill, we may make one budget cycle a little easier but we will be back in the same place next year with little to show for it,” DiBiase said during the hearing.
EPI responded in a nine-page brief Wednesday, calling RIPEC’s prior analysis “weak on evidence” and emphasizing that the potential negative consequences, like out of state migration, would be “marginal at most.”
The dueling policy positions each relied on a dizzying sea of statistics. One stat stood out to Alisha Pina, coordinator of Revenue for Rhode Islanders, a grassroots advocacy coalition set up to drum up support for the income tax bill.
Under the existing state income tax structure, the lowest 20% of earners — who make $22,300 or less per year — paid more than 13% of their income to state taxes in 2024 including the 3.75% tax on personal incomes, according to analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners pay 8.6% of their total income in taxes under the existing 5.99% state income tax rate, along with sales, corporate and other taxes.
“That is so absurdly inequitable that I cannot even fathom why we are not passing this in our first year,” Pina told lawmakers. “That alone should scream to you to be with the 99%.”
An extra 3% tax on income above $625,000 would force top earners to pay 9.2% of their income in state taxes overall. If approved, the tax increase would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has remained noncommittal on the income tax bill when previously asked for comment. He did not offer additional comments Wednesday.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A bipartisan Senate panel on Wednesday voted to toss out two rules backed by State Superintendent Ryan Walters that dealt with monitoring student immigration status and that would require teachers to take the U.S. Naturalization Test.
Senate Joint Resolution 22, authored by Sen. Micheal Bergstrom, R-Adair, approved many of the rules, but rejected two of the most controversial.
One disapproved rule would require students to provide proof of U.S. citizenship when enrolling in public school. Under the rule, schools would have to report to the state the number of students who couldn’t verify legal residency or citizenship.
Walters has said the rule would help serve immigrant students by better accounting for the resources needed to accommodate them, but he has also said he would turn over the information collected to federal authorities if asked.
The proposed rule has faced bipartisan opposition, including from Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that every child, regardless of immigration status, has a right to public education.
Sen. Michael Brooks, D-Oklahoma City, said the proposed rule is unconstitutional.
“In addition to that, I’m concerned about the families that would be intimidated and perhaps would choose not to enroll their kids in school based on these requirements,” he said.
Brooks, who is a member of the Senate Rules Committee, said the state does not win when children are discouraged from going to school.
A second rule rejected by the Senate panel on Wednesday would require all public school teachers to pass the U.S. Naturalization test to earn or renew their certification. That rule has faced bipartisan opposition amid fears that it would deter qualified teachers from working in the state.
“It seems to me more political than policy based,” Brooks said. “It seems like something to be able to get a headline, but it doesn’t seem like something that necessarily helps with curriculum or anything else.”
Bergstrom, the resolution’s author, chairs the Senate Rules Committee.
“Over the last few years, we’ve been building a consensus of just how important it is for the Legislature to actually take on the job that we’re tasked with and to reign in agencies that are doing things they shouldn’t be doing or when there are errors made that need to be fixed,” Bergstrom said after the committee hearing.
Administrative rules are supposed to build upon the laws legislators create. 
Because they have the force of law, all rules must be submitted to the Legislature for review. If lawmakers take no action, they go to the governor. If the governor does not act, they automatically take effect.
The governor pledged to block the immigration rule. 
Bergstrom said there was probably no legislative authority for the Oklahoma State Department of Education to craft rules pertaining to citizenship checks and naturalization testing.
The measure goes to the full Senate, where Bergstrom said it could be heard as early as next week. 
If SJR 22 is approved, the measure goes to the House for consideration.
The State Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment as of publication.

Chris Brown, a Kansas City Republican, speaks in the House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Local laws prohibiting landlords from discriminating against tenants who receive public assistance would be unenforceable under legislation sent to the governor’s desk Wednesday.
The bill passed by a final vote of 23 to 10 on Wednesday in the Senate, over the opposition of Democrats. It previously passed the House 103 to 37. 
The legislation takes aim at ordinances passed in several Missouri cities to protect tenants from discrimination based on the source of their income — especially tenants who use federal housing choice vouchers, known as Section 8 vouchers, to pay rent.
The bill was co-sponsored by state Reps. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City, and Ben Keathley, a Republican from Chesterfield. In the Senate, it was carried by state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance. 
“Various municipalities are trying to force landlords to put their homes into Section 8 programs,” Brown said during House debate Monday. “We feel like that is overstepping their authority.”
Schroer on Wednesday called it a “common sense bill that was just limiting what political subdivisions can do when it comes to property rights.”
Kansas City passed a source of income discrimination ban last year, though it was in large part paused by the courts in February. 
Columbia, St. Louis, Webster Groves and Clayton have similar protections on the books. The laws make it illegal for landlords to discriminate based solely on the fact of renters’ lawful sources of income, including Section 8, veterans’ benefits and Social Security.
An amendment previously added by Democrat state Sen. Patty Lewis of Kansas City, would have carved out most of Kansas City from the legislation. But that language was removed in the final bill.
“The amendment that we stripped out would have excluded Kansas City from the bill,” Brown said. “Kansas City was a big reason we originated this bill.”
Schroer said there were also constitutional concerns that carving out Kansas City could get “litigated and thrown out” in court.
“This was the only path forward to make it through both chambers,” Schroer said.
Lewis said she was frustrated not to be consulted during the final negotiations.
“Affordable housing is extremely important to me, and that’s the basis of what they were trying to do with the ordinance,” Lewis said. “And I’m just trying to protect the local control.”
An amendment added by Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber of Columbia was kept in the bill to clarify protections for renters receiving veterans’ benefits. 
The legislation had the support of landlords groups, apartment associations, the realtors’ association and the conservative think tank Show Me Institute. Proponents characterized localities’ source-of-income protections as an overreach into property owners’ rights.
Opponents said the bill infringed on local control and would hurt affordable housing availability, exacerbating homelessness. The city of Kansas City has been opposed along with the anti-poverty nonprofit Empower Missouri and an association of public housing authorities in Missouri.
The legislation will go into effect Aug. 28 if signed into law by the governor.

The first cases reported in the state have been concentrated in eight rural counties in the southwest. (Getty Images)TOPEKA — The Wichita area reported its first case of measles on Wednesday, an announcement that moves this highly contagious disease out of rural southwest Kansas counties and into a major metropolitan area.
Kansas is now reporting 48 cases of measles, up from 46 last week, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment dashboard. However, that dashboard did not include the Sedgwick County case, which was reported online by the county’s health department. 
In a notice posted on the Sedgwick County Health Department website, the agency said a case of measles was confirmed in an unvaccinated child between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. The last measles case in the county was in 2017. 
“We are working swiftly to identify the source of exposure and notify anyone who may have been exposed,” the notice said.
Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System, urged people not to panic if measles cases occur near them.
“It is important to understand that currently our herd immunity for stopping the transmission of the disease is suboptimal,” he said. “It is due to an overall decrease in vaccination rates around our country and locally. However, it is important to remember measles is a disease of the unvaccinated.”
It is likely, given recent history, that there will be more cases in rural and urban communities, Hawkinson said. 
“This will then increase the probability that we will see more hospitalizations and possibly even deaths,” he said.
Of the 48 cases reported by KDHE, 40 individuals weren’t vaccinated and one wasn’t age appropriately vaccinated. In three cases, the vaccination status couldn’t be verified, and four individuals were age appropriately vaccinated.
To achieve herd immunity, 95% of people need to be vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization. Kansas tracks vaccination rates through county-level kindergarten surveys. 
In Sedgwick County, the kindergarten vaccination rate for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was 94% in in the 2022-23 academic school year and dropped to 91% the next year.  The county’s overall vaccination rate, showing vaccines required for kindergarten, was 86% in the 2023-24 school year.
One in five people with measles has a high risk of hospitalization, 1 in 20 will get pneumonia by either the measles virus itself or secondary bacterial pneumonia, and one in 1,000 patients with measles will die, Hawkinson said. Lifelong health impacts are also possible.
“We need to remember that infectious diseases do not adhere to boundaries nor specific demographics,” he said. “Measles is the same. The demographic which it tends to adhere to is the unvaccinated demographic.”
Hawkinson encouraged anyone who can get vaccinated to do so because measles is not a benign disease and there is no treatment.
“There is prevention, and that prevention is a time-tested vaccine which has shown to be safe and effective against measles and its complications,” he said. “We have decades of abundant, very high-level data and evidence to support the extreme safety and effectiveness of the vaccine to protect against measles and its complications for the individual, and also to keep the community safe as a whole.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1334136009-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-07 16:10:25.661020

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as President Donald Trump cancels federal grants for arts organizations across the United States.Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees funding for the Kennedy Center, requested a detailed accounting of the $256.6 million for the center included in the Republican-led budget reconciliation package.The Kennedy Center, a renowned venue in Washington, D.C., had originally requested just $45.73 million for fiscal year 2025. Trump in February took over chairmanship of the center’s board, leading to some artists canceling their performances.ABC News reported Tuesday that Trump will headline a fundraiser for the center next month.In a letter Tuesday to Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell, Pingree asked for a breakdown of how the organization plans to spend over $241.7 million on capital repairs projects, $7.7 million on operations and maintenance, and a further $7.2 million on administrative expenses.The center had only planned on spending $157 million on repairs projects through 2027 as part of a comprehensive building plan, according to its 2025 budget request.“I am committed to the Kennedy Center having the resources necessary to carry out its mission now and for many years to come, and I appreciate President Trump’s shared interest in the Center’s future,” wrote Pingree, who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Arts Caucus.“However, as this Administration seeks to eliminate vital cultural agencies that serve communities across the nation, we must ensure that funds appropriated by Congress are truly benefitting the artists and audiences that make the Kennedy Center great,” Pingree wrote.Pingree slammed the Trump administration’s late Friday notice that grant funding from the National Endowment for Arts would be withdrawn from organizations across the country. Trump’s budget request to Congress Friday recommended slashing the NEA completely.Pingree issued a statement Saturday morning saying her office had already begun hearing from Maine arts organizations who received grant termination emails. “These organizations, like countless others, had already made programming decisions for the upcoming season and were counting on these funds to pay artists and workers,” Pingree said.'This project is essential'A White House official told States Newsroom Wednesday that Trump had worked with Congress to arrive at the Kennedy Center funding figure.“This project is essential to advancing President Trump’s vision of restoring greatness to our Nation’s capital. Halting Anti-American propaganda is critical to protecting our children and fostering patriotism,” according to the official.Separately, an emailed statement attributed to White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that “President Trump cares deeply about American arts and culture, which is why he is revitalizing historic institutions like the Kennedy Center to their former greatness.”The White House did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about the termination of other arts funding.The Kennedy Center did not respond to States Newsroom’s requests for comment about how the funds will be used and whether Grenell had received Pingree’s request.A House Republican document outlining the party’s funding goals for 2024 shows the GOP-led House Committee on Appropriations had planned $44.9 million for the Kennedy Center that year, noting the amount was $454,000 below 2023 funding levels and $3.1 million below former President Joe Biden’s budget request.",,,,2025-05-07 16:10:25.661020

Hanson, also known as George John Hanson, is set to die June 12 by lethal injection at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester.
He was sentenced to death for the 1999 shooting death of Mary Bowles, 77, a retired bank executive whom he and his accomplice, Jerald Thurman, abducted from a Tulsa mall. Bowles was shot four to six times and found at a dirt pit near Owasso. 
A bystander, Jerald Thurman, was also killed.
“Now is the time for him to atone for the pain and suffering he has wrought,” said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “Justice will be delivered when the death penalty is rightly served on June 12.”

Hanson was homeless, developmentally disabled and didn’t get a fair shot at presenting mitigating evidence, said Callie Heller, his attorney.
“As of today, three jurors have come forward with concerns about their death verdict after learning the facts they never heard at trial,” she said.
Hanson has expressed remorse and taken responsibility for his role in the crime, she said.
A more culpable defendant is serving life, she said.
Hanson, who was imprisoned for an unrelated crime in Louisiana, was transferred in March to Oklahoma so his execution could be carried out.
The transfer had previously been blocked by the Democrat Joe Biden’s administration, but Republican Donald Trump’s administration cleared the way for Hanson’s transfer back to Oklahoma.

Details on casting, filming and airtimes have not yet been revealed. (Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current; Logo by NBCUniversal)Get ready for some drama in the Ocean State — Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise is coming to Rhode Island.
The network announced the latest iteration of the long-running reality show Wednesday, teasing on X that the 13th entry in the reality TV franchise will offer a look into the world of a tight-knit circle of Rhode Islanders who “have deep community roots and families that go back generations.”
“With aspirational lives, thriving businesses, and tangled family dynamics, these decade-long friendships prove that in a state this small, there’s no escaping your past…or each other,” the announcement read.
Rumors of possible cast members circulated online over the winter, and WJAR reported in December that the show was likely filming in Rhode Island. 
Rhode Island Film & Television Office Executive Director Steven Feinberg called the speculation “an avalanche of enthusiasm” when confirming production on Facebook Wednesday.
“The Real Housewives of Rhode Island is ready to roll and take the world by storm!” Feinberg said in a statement. “Action!”
Bravo has not said who has been cast on the show, where production will take place, or when the season will air. 
What is clear is that production of Real Housewives will not be eligible for state reimbursement. 
That’s because the 30% credit only applies to “motion pictures,” which Rhode Island General Law defines to include documentaries, videos, television series, commercials made for theatrical or television viewing, television pilots, or productions intended for educational distribution.
Recent productions filmed in Rhode Island include “Ella McCay,” an upcoming film directed by James L. Brooks, and Disney’s “Hocus Pocus 2.” HBO’s “The Gilded Age” has filmed scenes for its two seasons in Newport.
Director M. Night Shyamalan is also preparing production in the Ocean State for “a supernatural romantic thriller” starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor.
Gov. Dan McKee said he welcomed the franchise’s “millions of viewers” and hopes that the show will bring national attention to Rhode Island.
“Our state is home to vibrant communities, amazing food, rich history, and stunning coastal beauty — perfect for the spotlight,” McKee said in a statement. 
“The Real Housewives of Rhode Island” is produced by Evolution Media, according to Bravo’s announcement. Lucilla D’Agostino, Joseph Ferraro, Jen McClure-Metz and Andy Cohen will serve as executive producers.

Seniors living in nursing homes should be able to cover their basic needs that are not provided by Medicaid or their facility, allowing them to age with dignity. 
The post The case for a long overdue ‘raise’ for seniors in nursing homes  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","NURSING AND REST HOME residents on Medicaid give up nearly all their income to support the costs of their care. The pittance that they get to keep each month, known as the personal needs allowance, or PNA, is meant to cover expenses that Medicaid does not, like clothes, shoes, and cell phone bills.  Massachusetts ranks in the top five states for highest cost of living, yet the PNA here hasn’t changed since 2007, leaving nursing and rest home residents less than $2.50 a day to cover their remaining needs. This barely covers a Dunkin coffee, let alone a typical cell phone bill. The PNA varies from state to state and the federal floor of $30 a month hasn’t changed since 1988. Accounting for inflation, the $30 floor would need to be about $80 now to have the same purchasing power. But in Massachusetts, the PNA is only $72.80 a month, so nursing home residents are getting less in value than those at the federal floor were in 1988.  Three bills introduced this legislation session – H1411, sponsored by Rep. Thomas Stanley of Waltham, S887, sponsored by Sen. Joan Lovely of Salem, and S482, filed by Sens. Patricia Jehlen of Somerville and Mark Montigny of New Bedford — propose to increase the PNA from $72.80 to $113.42, a more than 55 percent increase, and build in an annual cost-of-living adjustment. Increasing the PNA lets nursing and rest home residents keep more of their own money, like a mini tax cut for our most vulnerable seniors. Personal expenses, like clothing and cell phone bills, are essential to residents’ quality of life and keeping in touch with family, but the PNA is often insufficient to cover them. As one resident in a nursing home shared, “I have to balance… I have to choose between buying my supplements or buying new underwear. I have to choose between going on a fun outing and getting a haircut.” Meanwhile, some states, like Alaska, have a PNA of $200 a month, the maximum allowed under federal law currently. So you might be wondering why Massachusetts hasn’t already raised its PNA? There hasn’t been organized opposition to raising the PNA; it just hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves. A lack of awareness about issues related to aging and nursing homes are the likely culprit. Sadly, residents are often isolated in nursing homes and largely forgotten. You may not even know the PNA exists unless a loved one is in a nursing or rest home.  Dignity Alliance Massachusetts, a nonprofit focused on advocacy for older adults and those with disabilities, has made raising the PNA their top legislative priority for 2025, working with the sponsors to introduce these bills this year. They formed in 2020 in response to the severe impact of COVID-19 in nursing homes and count many former legislators, agency officials, and nonprofit leaders in aging and nursing home care among their leadership. There are about 33,000 nursing home residents in Massachusetts and about two-thirds of them are on Medicaid. The budget for MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, is projected to be $20 billion this year, with the cost split about half each between the state and federal government. Raising the PNA by $40 a month would only increase that amount by a tiny fraction, approximately $10 to $12 million, or less than a tenth of a percent. In return, seniors in nursing homes would get a much-needed raise and better quality of life.  This is only a cost to MassHealth in the sense that it is allowing seniors to keep more of their own income, still surrendering the vast majority of it to the state in exchange for their long-term care. It could also potentially pay for itself by improving health of nursing home residents, reducing falls, malnutrition, and other health problems that strain nursing home staff and cost Medicaid considerably more in emergency department visits and hospital care. Seniors living in nursing homes should be able to cover their basic needs that are not provided by Medicaid or their facility, allowing them to age with dignity. They are already giving nearly all of their income to the state. Giving them this raise could provide a big boost in their health and happiness—not needing to choose between orthotics and a gift for their grandchild. We could argue that this doesn’t go far enough, but after nearly two decades without adjustment, this is a great place to start. Paul Shafer is an associate professor at the Boston University School of Public Health and co-director of the Boston University Medicaid Policy Lab.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A group of Oklahoma parents, grandparents and teachers represented by a former Republican attorney general have asked a judge to nullify the state’s controversial new academic standards for social studies.
Former Attorney General Mike Hunter filed the group’s lawsuit Wednesday morning in Oklahoma County District Court, alleging the adoption process was so flawed that the standards might not have been legal by the time they came before the state Legislature. Lawmakers have since allowed the standards to take effect.
The plaintiffs allege the Oklahoma State Department of Education failed to follow its own rules for transparency when drafting the social studies standards and when presenting them to the state’s top school board for approval.
“The reason we have rules, particularly in a democratic legislative setting, is that at the end of the day, due process is followed (with) adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard,” Hunter said during a news conference Wednesday. “And I think that what happened failed that test.”
Hunter said he will ask a district judge to temporarily bar the standards from taking effect while the lawsuit is pending.
Academic standards mandate the topics that public schools must teach to students at each grade level. They are reviewed and updated every six years.

State Superintendent Ryan Walters led the process of developing the new version for social studies. After the lawsuit was filed Wednesday, Walters blamed criticism of the social studies standards on teacher unions, none of whom are a party to the case.
He said the new standards are “the most pro-American standards in the nation, rooted in the founding principles that built this country and shaped our state.”
“That’s exactly what Oklahoma parents want their kids to learn,” Walters said in a statement.
The seven plaintiffs — made up of three public school parents, two grandparents and two public school teachers — contend the standards present a “distorted view of social studies that intentionally favors an outdated and blatantly biased perspective.” The new standards also don’t align with best practices, Advanced Placement or college social studies courses, nor with current textbooks, their lawsuit states.
Half of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said they were unaware at the time they approved the standards on Feb. 27 that the final version had significant differences from the original draft posted publicly in December. 
Only the December draft was accessible on the agency’s website at the time of the board vote, and one board member, Mike Tinney, said this was the version he studied before voting on the standards. The Education Department didn’t publicly post the final draft until weeks later.

Email records the agency provided indicate the board members received the updated draft of the standards at 4 p.m. the day before their Feb. 27 meeting began the next morning. Walters said he provided the final version but it was up to the board members to read it.
Walters and his staff didn’t acknowledge during the Feb. 27 meeting that new language had been added, including claims of “discrepancies” in 2020 election results.
Only one board member, Deatherage, voted against the standards, saying he didn’t have enough time to properly review the full document.
Members of the board and Gov. Kevin Stitt encouraged the Legislature to return the standards to the state Board of Education for another vote, but Republican majorities in the House and Senate opted not to take action, allowing the standards to take effect by default.
Hunter said the process that produced the new standards “should be examined from alpha to omega.” He said he intends to have Walters, state Board of Education members and others involved in developing the standards interviewed as witnesses.

The lawsuit notes that the agency hasn’t fully disclosed the names of all the individuals involved in the drafting committees and in focus groups that gave feedback, unlike in past years of standards revisions. Only an executive committee made up of mostly out-of-state conservative media personalities and far-right-wing policy advocates was identified.
“Our goal is to get to the truth of things,” Hunter said.
The lawsuit filed Wednesday might not be the only legal challenge against the standards.
The national law group Americans United for Separation of Church and State also might sue, said Alex Luchenitser, the organization’s associate vice president and associate legal director.
Americans United sees law violations both in the non-transparent way the standards were adopted and in their inclusion of Christian beliefs, Luchenitser said.
The new standards require elementary schools to teach biblical stories and the teachings of Jesus “that influenced the American colonists, founders and culture.” Instruction on Judeo-Christian values would continue in fifth and eighth grade.

“The standards attempt to promote Christianity in the classroom above all other religions,” Luchenitser said. “They attempt to promote Christianity to first and second graders, very young and impressionable children. Parents need to have control about how their children are brought up with respect to religion, and religion should be taught in the home and in the house of worship. It shouldn’t be taught in the classroom.” 
Walters has called church-state separation a myth and repeatedly pushed for the Bible to have more of a presence in public schools. Understanding biblical teachings will give important context to key events and figures in American history, he has said.
Last year, he ordered all Oklahoma school districts to incorporate the Bible into their lesson plans and to keep a copy of it in every classroom — a mandate that Americans United has challenged in court. Walters later purchased over 500 copies of Lee Greenwood’s God Bless the USA Bible, an edition known for having President Donald Trump’s endorsement.
Walters said the new social studies standards will “teach students to be proud of America.”
“We’re proud of these standards, and we’ll keep fighting for an education system that puts students and our country first,” he said.

(Photo by Bright Quashie for Source NM)President Donald Trump’s newly released spending proposal identifies more than $600 million to be cut from “woke” grant programs overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
That budget proposal, which needs Congressional approval, does not specify which programs or grants would be axed but says the cuts would enable FEMA to refocus on “sound emergency management.” It also says the agency previously focused too much on “intersectional” distribution of disaster aid, “diversity and inclusion efforts” and “multicultural training.” 
“The Budget reduces bloat and waste while encouraging States and communities to build resilience and use their unique local knowledge and ample resources in disaster response,” Trump officials wrote in the budget summary about proposed changes at FEMA.  
It’s too soon to say what that could mean for disaster-prone New Mexico, local emergency management officials said. But they noted that the state has relied on hundreds of millions of federal dollars for a variety of programs in recent years, even excluding the roughly $5.5 billion FEMA oversees in a special compensation fund for the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. 
U.S. Rep. Stansbury on New Mexico fire season: ‘We are not prepared’ 

“If you were to tell me tomorrow that the federal government were going to turn off the spigot, I would tell you that we will do everything we possibly can in our power and the governor’s power to take care of the citizens of New Mexico, but we as a state would struggle,” Deputy DHSEM Secretary Ali Rye told Source, noting that the state doesn’t exactly have “ample resources” for disaster response.
DHSEM’s budget is a little more than $5 million and funds a core staff of just two people to handle disaster response. Apart from that, the agency relies almost entirely on federal grants, primarily through FEMA, Rye said, for personnel and programs. The Legislature approved funding for five more positions this session in various capacities, Rye said. 
A FEMA formula, based on the state’s population, calculates that New Mexico can withstand about $4 million in damage from a natural disaster before a federal disaster declaration would be necessary here. 
Once that threshold is reached, state officials apply to FEMA for a Presidential Disaster Declaration, which allows the agency to show up in the state and offer a suite of federally funded programs, such as individual assistance for families affected and reimbursement of 75% of costs incurred by local governments and other public entities. 
FEMA has allocated a little more than $1 billion for public entities following recent fires and floods here, according to numbers DHSEM spokesperson Danielle Silva provided, along with hundreds of millions in assistance for individuals. 




Breakdown of federal disaster grants to New Mexico*:  
FEMA Disaster Case Management  

$25 million ($12M for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, $9M for South Fork/Salt Fires, $4M for Roswell-area flooding)  
This program provides  daily communications and program application advocacy and support for more than more than 2,000 NM households affected by disasters, including nearly 1,000 in Mora and San Miguel, Counties, more than 900 in Lincoln County and Mescalero Apache Reservation and more than 350 in Chaves County).  

FEMA Public Assistance  

$1.011 billion across all active disaster declarations  
Funding supports 890 projects for state, local and nonprofit entities to cover costs for emergency response measures and infrastructure like buildings, utilities, roads and bridges

FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program 

 $148 million 
Funding supports 86 mitigation projects statewide, including purchase of additional generators, hardening of potentially at-risk facilities and efforts to improve future disaster resilience. 

 HUD Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Recovery 

$141 million 
NM Impact: Programs to address unmet needs for housing, infrastructure and economic revitalization in communities impacted by the South Fork Fire and Salt Fire, as well as the Chaves Flood event and Building Resiliency Center to serve Mora and San Miguel Counties for the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire recovery effort.  

*According to NM DHSEM spokesperson Danielle Silva




But whether those thresholds still apply is an open question, Rye said. She noted that Trump denied Republican Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request for FEMA aid following severe rainstorms and tornadoes that killed at least three people. 
“They haven’t been using that formula,” Rye said. “Right now we’re all in a gray zone. We don’t know where that threshold is, and we won’t know until we apply for a federal declaration and we get either approved or denied.”
In addition to the uncertainty and threatened cuts, New Mexico already lost $4 million in expected FEMA funds through the agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which was among billions in promised aid cut across the country.
While that promised funding aimed at reducing hazard risk hadn’t been allocated, a number of worthy recipients applied, Silva said.
They lost everything in New Mexico’s biggest wildfire. Now they’re sounding the alarm for others.

“We received a lot of project ideas, including improvements to low water crossings on bus routes, enhanced drainage systems, and clean drinking-water plans,” she said.
The proposed cuts come as New Mexico continues to deal with the fallout of three major natural disasters in three years, including two that occurred in 2024: the wildfires in New Mexico in 2022, along with the South Fork and Salt Fires in Ruidoso and Roswell-area flooding last year. 
The last time the state experienced two federal disaster declarations in the same year was 2014. Excluding the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the state had a reprieve of nearly a decade without any federal disaster declarations before the 2022 wildfires. 
The acting FEMA secretary is scheduled to testify today before the House Appropriations Committee about her plan for FEMA, which the Department of Homeland Security oversees. Sources told E&E news that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem hopes to get rid of all FEMA preparedness programs. 
Rye estimated that New Mexico has funding from about 15 preparedness grants currently.

If recent disaster declarations serve as any indication, the state would need $150 million to $200 million to adequately respond to natural disasters, Silva said. FEMA would reimburse most of those costs, but others the state would have to shoulder alone, like setting up emergency operations centers and conducting damage assessments. 
New Mexico pays for those disasters via governor’s executive orders coming from the state’s general fund. Those executive orders are capped at $750,000, meaning the governor often has to issue dozens of them at once to cover all the costs. 
Already this year, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has issued more than 130 such orders for the South Fork and Salt Fire and Roswell-area flooding, for example. 
Despite the threat of funding cuts, Rye and Silva said that, no matter what happens, New Mexicans will be spared the cost of natural disasters.

He is currently in-house counsel for City Hall’s treasury department, which handles money, property, and securities acquired by the city. 
The post Wu challenger emerges from inside Boston City Hall appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A DOZEN PEOPLE have expressed interest in taking on Boston Mayor Michelle Wu as she runs for a second term. An attorney who works for her is among them. John F. Houton, who lives in the city’s South End and often walks to work, has been employed as an attorney for Boston City Hall for nearly 20 years. Houton, 58, has served as an assistant corporation counsel, starting under the late Mayor Tom Menino, continuing into the Marty Walsh and Wu administrations, representing the city in various legal matters. He is currently in-house counsel for City Hall’s treasury department, which handles money, property, and securities acquired by the city. He’s running for mayor as a pro-business candidate. “Boston needs new leadership, desperately,” Houton said, calling the business climate concerning and pointing to commercial properties still feeling the stress from the pandemic, which sent vast numbers of employees to work from home. If he gathers enough signatures to get on the ballot, his candidacy increases the likelihood of a nonpartisan preliminary in September, which would narrow the field to two finalists for the November general election. He previously considered running for mayor in 2017 and 2021.Along with Wu, nonprofit executive Josh Kraft and community activist Domingos DaRosa have all declared their candidacies. Others have also indicated interest through filings with the city’s elections department, including Kerry Augustin, a 26-year-old receptionist for a City Hall commission focused on residents who are 55 years and older. Candidates must gather 3,000 voter signatures to qualify for the ballot. The grandson of Irish immigrants from Donegal, Houton was born and raised in Dorchester with five other children in his family. His mother was a nurse, and his father worked for John Collins, who served as mayor of Boston in the 1960s, and Attorney General Robert Quinn. Houton described himself as a Democrat. Publicly available campaign finance records show a handful of donations, most of them to Annissa Essaibi George, a city councilor who lost to Wu in the 2021 mayoral race. But, in an interview with CommonWealth Beacon, he balked at state lawmakers and city officials criticizing President Donald Trump, whose administration has sought to pull federal money from deep-blue Massachusetts and threatened to bring “hell” to Boston. “If we’ve got the target on our back, as it appears with the [Trump] administration, we shouldn’t be provoking the president. We should be working with the president. Even Tip O’Neill in his heyday had a great relationship with Ronald Reagan,” Houton said, referring to the Cambridge Democrat who clashed with President Reagan while he was US House speaker. “We’re going to be losing so much federal support.” Houton also called the city’s Trust Act, signed by Walsh and limiting Boston police cooperation with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) a “mistake.” Wu, in testimony before a hostile Congressional committee earlier this year, defended the measure, while Kraft has said he is a supporter of the act. Houton took a different tack. “You’re asking if ICE comes to the city, if a Houton administration would cooperate with federal authorities? Absolutely,” he said. He said he also opposes “any and all forms” of rent control. “I understand the impulse behind getting a policy out to create affordable housing and control the rents but it’s really counter-productive both to the creation and preservation of available housing stock,” he said. Wu has pushed a rent control proposal, which cleared the City Council in 2023 but stalled at the State House. Kraft has proposed what he calls rent control, an opt-in program that would give tax breaks to landlords who keep rents low. Houton plans to keep his day job if he makes the ballot. Public employees face limits on campaigning and fundraising, which can sometimes hamstring their candidacies. Houton said he doesn’t interact with Wu, his boss, as part of the job. “I don’t have any enmity towards her. I think she was a good city councilor,” he said. “I just disagree with her on the approach.” The post Wu challenger emerges from inside Boston City Hall appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Boston-City-Hall-angled-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-07 15:07:45.477615

(Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)TOPEKA – The Grain Belt Express, an 800-mile electric transmission line to be built through Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, announced $1.7 billion in contractor awards on Wednesday. 
The awards were made to Quanta Services of Houston and Kiewit Energy Group Inc. of Omaha. Grain Belt Express is an Invenergy project expected to add 5,000 megawatts of U.S. energy delivery capacity, according to an Invenergy press release. It’s also expected to provide $52 billion in energy cost savings to Americans over 15 years.
“Quanta Services and Kiewit have strong local presences and expect to source raw materials locally in Kansas and Missouri when possible, including concrete, aggregate, civil materials, conduit, and piping,” the press release said. “Main construction, engineering, and procurement offices for Grain Belt Express Phase 1 will be based out of Overland Park and Lenexa, Kansas.”
Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson said the Grain Belt Express is a multimillion dollar investment that will pay off for Kansans.
“The selection of contractors and suppliers with a local presence is just one of the many sizable economic benefits Grain Belt Express brings, in addition to greater energy cost savings and reliability,” he said.
In April, the Kansas Corporation Commission modified the route for one of two transmission lines that will connect wind and solar farms to the Grain Belt Express that was originally planned to run for 46 miles through parts of Ford, Meade and Gray counties. 
“The new route reduces the length of the line by 12 miles and avoids 24 parcels of land resulting in fewer landowners being impacted,” a KCC press release said. “The 16-mile Bucklin-Dodge City Line remains unchanged.”
A map showing the new route of the Meade-Dodge City line can be viewed here.
The Invenergy press release said 1,500 agreements have been executed with landowners for easement rights. More than $105 million is part of executed easement agreements, including $19 million already paid to landowners and an additional $86 million due at construction, the company said. More than 95% of Grain Belt Express Phase 1 main line land acquisition is complete.
“Kansans working to balance household budgets and run businesses want energy that’s affordable and reliable, and that’s what we are getting with Grain Belt Express, all without ratepayers being forced to pay for it,” said Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/transmission-lines-2048x1536-1-1024x768-1.jpeg,,,2025-05-07 15:07:45.477615

Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre; Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills; Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville; Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, and Sen. David Sessions, R-Grand Bay, voted with Senate Democrats in favor of the bill.
The legislation passed after years of efforts by Black Democrats in the Alabama Legislature, who either saw their proposals rejected or were effectively forced by Republicans to pair Juneteenth with Jefferson Davis’ Birthday, a state holiday honoring the slaveholder and white supremacist who said that Black Americans were “fitted expressly for human servitude.”
Rep. Juanadalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, sponsored a bill last year that would have required state employees to choose Juneteenth or Jefferson Davis’ Birthday as their day off, a choice not required of any other state holiday. 
House Black Democrats said during the debate on the bill last year that they struggled to vote for the legislation because of the Davis requirement. The House approved the bill, but it did not reach the Senate floor for a vote. Rehm’s bill as passed makes Juneteenth a standalone holiday.
The bill goes to Gov. Kay Ivey, who has made Juneteenth a state holiday for the last four years. A message seeking comment was left with Ivey’s office on Wednesday. 
Juneteenth has also been a federally recognized holiday since 2021.

Voters will soon be required to provide proof of residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. 
The post Wyomingites asked to weigh in on new voter registration rules appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming voters will soon be required to provide proof of residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. First, however, the public will have a chance to offer feedback that could help determine some of the finer details of the new process. 
In February, the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications,” before Gov. Mark Gordon let it become law without his signature. 
Sponsored by Gillette Republican and former Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. John Bear, the law is set to go into effect July 1. It requires a person to be a Wyoming resident for at least 30 days before voting in an election, along with a requirement to provide proof of residency and citizenship when registering to vote. 
While the law specifies what documents provide such proof, it also calls on the secretary of state to iron out the technicalities through the rulemaking process, which requires a public comment period. 
“Ensuring that those who register to vote in Wyoming must provide proof of U.S. citizenship and proof of Wyoming residency is pivotal to election integrity and security for Wyoming,” Secretary of State Chuck Gray said in a statement Monday. 
Gray and some Republican lawmakers have been pushing to add election security measures in Wyoming for the past several years. They maintain that proof of residency and citizenship are necessary to ensure that only Wyoming residents vote in Wyoming elections. 
Instances of voter fraud remain statistically rare in Wyoming. There have been four convictions of voter fraud in Wyoming since 2000, according to a database created by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. All four cases involved U.S. citizens. 
In 2024, Gray attempted to make similar changes through the rulemaking process, but Gordon rejected the rules, arguing the regulations exceeded the scope of the secretary’s legal authority. 
“Unless and until the Legislature grants the Secretary of State more explicit authority allowing for rulemaking to add to those statutory requirements at the time of registration, I believe these rules are a breach of the separation of powers with the legislative branch, as indicated by the Management Council’s recommendation,” Gordon wrote in a letter at the time. 
The new law, which was a top priority of Gray’s in the 2025 session, explicitly grants the secretary of state the authority. 
The public comment period is open until June 20. Afterwards, it will once again be up to the governor to approve or reject the proposed rules.

Details
In many instances, a valid Wyoming driver’s license will suffice for proof of identity, residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote as long as it lists a Wyoming address, under Gray’s proposed rules. 
When discussing the proposed rules last year, county clerks raised concerns about residents with P.O. boxes on their driver’s licenses — particularly those in Teton County — being disenfranchised. 
The rules now up for consideration specify P.O. boxes in Wyoming would count as proof of residence, so long as the person lists their residential address on their voter registration application form. 
As is now the case, tribal identification cards issued by either the Eastern Shoshone or the Northern Arapaho tribes, or other federally recognized tribes, will also count as proof of residency if a Wyoming address is listed. 
If the applicant does not have a valid Wyoming driver’s license or a tribal ID card present at the time of application, the law specifies that they provide their driver’s license number and at least one of the following documents: a valid U.S. passport; a driver’s license or ID card issued by the federal government, any U.S. state or occupied territory; a photo identification card issued by the University of Wyoming, a Wyoming community college or a Wyoming public school; a U.S. military card; an ID card issued to a dependent of a member of the U.S. armed forces or a tribal ID card. 
Under the proposed rules, those documents would also need to list a Wyoming address to constitute proof of residency. 
If applicants do not have a driver’s license, they will be asked to provide the last four digits of their Social Security number along with one of the aforementioned documents. 
The proposed rules also lay out a process for other instances, such as if an applicant does not have any of those forms of identification or if they lack both a Wyoming driver’s license and a Social Security number. Those situations will require other forms of documentation, such as a utility bill, bank statement or any other government document showing their name and address. 
As for proof of U.S. citizenship, the rules propose mirroring the documentation already outlined in law, including a Wyoming driver’s license, Wyoming ID card, a valid U.S. passport, a certificate of U.S. citizenship, a certificate of naturalization, a U.S. military draft record or a selective service registration acknowledgement card, a consular report of birth abroad issued by the U.S. department of state or an original or certified copy of a birth certificate in the U.S. bearing an official seal. 
None of those documents, however, will suffice if they indicate the person is not a U.S. citizen.

While the woman reported an armed burglary, police say they found no evidence that someone had broken into the house. 
The post Police: Woman killed in Casper home called 911, then pointed gun at arriving officers appeared first on WyoFile .","The woman killed in her home by Casper police responding to an armed burglar report made the 911 call that drew officers to her door, the department announced Wednesday. 
A caller who identified herself as Jody Cobia called the dispatch center just after midnight on April 28 to report a burglary in progress at her home on South McKinley Street in Casper, according to the new statement. She told the dispatcher an armed and dangerous burglar dressed in all black had broken into her home and was in a back room, and she urged officers to hurry up and enter the house, according to the police account.
She then ended the call. 
When officers arrived at the property, Cobia opened the front door. “Officers were immediately encountered by a large dog and Cobia with a firearm at her side,” the department wrote in a statement. Cobia began shouting — the release does not say what she said — and pointed the gun at officers, who shot her. 
Cobia was taken to Wyoming Medical Center in Casper, where doctors pronounced her dead. 
Police did not find anyone else in the house, and there was no evidence of a forced entry into the home or someone fleeing the property, the department reported in Wednesday’s statement. 
“Although this call came in as a burglary, at this point in the investigation, there is no evidence of a burglar and it appears as if Jody Cobia made the call to elicit a police response,” the statement read. Police did not elaborate on why they believe she drew police to her house deliberately or what Cobia’s intentions were in making the call. 
The three officers involved in the shooting remain on administrative leave as the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation conducts a review. Both the leave and involvement of DCI are routine steps after police shootings. DCI’s investigative work will be provided to the Natrona County District Attorney’s Office for a decision on whether the officers were justified in their use of deadly force. 
The department promised to release a “Critical Incident Briefing Video,” which usually includes excerpts of body-camera footage, along with a police narration of the events ahead of the shooting.
In the press release, the department criticized media coverage of the shooting. “Recent media coverage has led to confusion, the dissemination of inaccurate or incomplete information, and social media speculation,” the department wrote. “Factual information will be released by the investigating agency when it becomes available.”
An initial statement last week announcing the shooting offered limited details, saying only that police had responded to a report of an armed burglary and shot and killed someone. The release did not say that the person killed was a legal resident of the home, nor did it state whether there was a burglary suspect. 
Because of the ambiguity of that initial statement, commenters on social media, as well as some Wyoming news outlets, described the dead person as a criminal suspect killed while attempting a burglary. Reporters from WyoFile and Cowboy State Daily subsequently identified the dead woman as the legal resident of the home using court records and interviews. 
Before publishing a story last week, WyoFile twice sought additional details and further comment from the department, including whether the person killed was the burglary suspect or a resident of the home. Police did not answer those questions at the time.

Free.,Congressional budget agency projects sweeping Medicaid cutbacks in states under GOP plans,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congressional-budget-agency-projects-sweeping-medicaid-cutbacks-states-under-gop-plans,,"WASHINGTON — The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that potential major cuts and changes to Medicaid under consideration by Republicans could mean states would have to spend more of their own money on the program, reduce payments to health care providers, limit optional benefits and reduce enrollment.The end result, under some scenarios, could be millions of Americans would be kicked off Medicaid and possibly left without health insurance, said the nonpartisan agency relied on by Congress for budget estimates.The letter from CBO stemmed from a request by Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and House Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone, D-N.J.Both oppose GOP attempts to slash federal funding for the health care program for lower-income Americans and some people with disabilities. Republicans, who have not settled on an approach, say they are interested in ending waste, fraud and abuse in the program.CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote that possible Medicaid changes would likely lead to several outcomes in the states. The impact on states would occur because the federal government covers at least 50% of the cost of the program, with that share increasing in states with lower per capita incomes and those that expanded eligibility under the Affordable Care Act.Wyden wrote in a statement the CBO letter showed “the Republican plan for health care means benefit cuts and terminated health insurance for millions of Americans who count on Medicaid.”Pallone wrote in a statement of his own that reducing federal funding for the program by hundreds of billions of dollars would lead to “millions of people losing their health care.”“(President Donald) Trump has repeatedly claimed Republicans are not cutting health care, but CBO’s independent analysis confirms the proposals under consideration will result in catastrophic benefit cuts and people losing their health care,” Pallone wrote. “It’s time for Republicans to stop lying to the American people about what they’re plotting behind closed doors in order to give giant tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.”Federal FalloutAs federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference. Read the latest.The Medicaid changes would come as Republicans use the complex budget reconciliation process to move a sweeping legislative package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is tasked with cutting at least $880 billion from the programs it oversees — including Medicaid — during the next decade, has yet to release its bill that if approved by the committee will become part of that package.The panel, led by Kentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, is expected to debut its proposed changes next week before debating the legislation during a yet-to-be-scheduled markup.Republicans plan to use the reconciliation package to permanently extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending.Five scenariosCBO’s analysis looked at five specific Medicaid scenarios including:Congress reducing the federal match rate for the 40 states that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.Lawmakers eliminating a 6% threshold that exists for states that collect higher taxes from health care providers and then return that additional money in the form of higher Medicaid payments. CBO writes those “higher Medicaid payments increase the contributions from the federal government to states’ Medicaid programs.”Republicans creating a per-enrollee cap on federal spending.Congress establishing a cap on federal spending for Medicaid enrollees who became eligible for the program after their state expanded eligibility under the ACA.Lawmakers repealing two Biden-era rules that addressed the Medicare Savings Programs and standardized how states approached enrollment and renewals.The analysis said states could raise taxes or cut spending on other programs to replace the lost federal revenue that would coincide with the first four scenarios, though CBO “expects that such steps would prove challenging for many states.”“In CBO’s view, different states would make different choices regarding how much of the reduced Medicaid funds to replace,” the analysis states. “Instead of modeling separate responses for each state, the agency estimated state responses in the aggregate, accounting for a range of possible outcomes.”Overall, CBO expects state governments would be able to replace about half of the lost federal revenue and that they would “reduce provider payment rates, reduce the scope or amount of optional services, and reduce Medicaid enrollment” to address the other half.Alternatives studiedThe first scenario, where lawmakers reduce the federal matching rate for expanded Medicaid populations, would save the government $710 billion during the next decade.But in 2034, CBO expects that “2.4 million of the 5.5 million people who would no longer be enrolled in Medicaid under this option would be without health insurance.”CBO wrote that in the second, third and fourth scenarios, “Medicaid enrollment would decrease and the number of people without health insurance would increase.”The second scenario of limiting state taxes on health care providers would save the federal government $668 billion during the 10-year budget window. It would lead to 8.6 million people losing access to Medicaid with a 3.9 million increase in the uninsured population by 2034.The third projection that looked at a federal cap on spending per enrollee would reduce federal spending by $682 billion during the next decade. A total of 5.8 million people would lose Medicaid coverage and 2.9 million would become uninsured under that proposal. And the fourth scenario, where Congress caps federal spending per enrollee in the expansion population, would cut the deficit by $225 billion during the next 10 years. More than 3 million people would lose Medicaid coverage and 1.5 million would become uninsured under this scenario.Under the fifth scenario, where GOP lawmakers would change two Biden-era rules, CBO expects that the federal government would spend $162 billion less over the 2025–2034 window.“CBO estimates that, in 2034, 2.3 million people would no longer be enrolled in Medicaid under this option,” the letter states. “Roughly 60 percent of the people who would lose Medicaid coverage would be dual-benefit enrollees who would retain their Medicare coverage.”",,,,2025-05-07 15:07:45.477615

Just one year ago, JD Vance was a leading advocate of the Great Lakes and the efforts to restore the largest system of freshwater on the face of the planet.
As a U.S. senator from Ohio, Vance called the lakes “an invaluable asset” for his home state. He supported more funding for a program that delivers “the tools we need to fight invasive species, algal blooms, pollution, and other threats to the ecosystem” so that the Great Lakes would be protected “for generations to come.”
But times have changed.
This spring, Vance is vice president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is imposing deep cuts and new restrictions, upending the very restoration efforts that Vance once championed. With the peak summer season just around the corner, Great Lakes scientists are concerned that they have lost the ability to protect the public from toxic algal blooms, which can kill animals and sicken people.
Cutbacks have gutted the staff at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Severe spending limits have made it difficult to purchase ordinary equipment for processing samples, such as filters and containers. Remaining staff plans to launch large data-collecting buoys into the water this week, but it’s late for a field season that typically runs from April to October.
In addition to a delayed launch, problems with personnel, supplies, vessel support and real-time data sharing have created doubts about the team’s ability to operate the buoys, said Gregory Dick, director of the NOAA cooperative institute at the University of Michigan that partners with the lab. Both the lab and institute operate out of a building in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was custom built as NOAA’s hub in the Great Lakes region, and both provide staff to the algal blooms team.
“This has massive impacts on coastal communities,” Dick said.
Multiple people who have worked with the lab also told ProPublica that there are serious gaps in this year’s monitoring of algal blooms, which are often caused by excess nutrient runoff from farms. Data generated by the lab’s boats and buoys, and publicly shared, could be limited or interrupted, they said.
That data has helped to successfully avoid a repeat of a 2014 crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when nearly half a million people were warned to not drink the water or even touch it.
If the streams of information are cut off, “stakeholders will be very unhappy,” said Bret Collier, a branch chief at the lab who oversaw the federal scientists that run the harmful algal bloom program for the Great Lakes. He was fired in the purge of federal probationary workers in February.
The lab has lost about 35% of its 52-member workforce since February, according to the president of the lab’s union, and it was not allowed to fill several open positions. The White House released preliminary budget recommendations last week that would make significant cuts to NOAA. The budget didn’t provide details, but indicated the termination of “a variety of climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs, which are not aligned with Administration policy” of ending “‘Green New Deal’ initiatives.”
An earlier document obtained by ProPublica and reported widely proposed a 74% funding cut to NOAA’s research office, home of the Great Lakes lab.
Vance’s office didn’t respond to questions from ProPublica about how federal cuts have affected Great Lakes research. The White House also didn’t respond to messages.
Municipal water leaders in Cleveland and Toledo have written public letters of support on behalf of the lab, advocating for the continuation of its work because of how important its tools and resources are for drinking water management.
In a statement to ProPublica, staffers from Toledo’s water system credited the Great Lakes lab and NOAA for alerting it to potential blooms near its intake days ahead of time. This has saved the system significant costs, they said, and helped it avoid feeding excess chemicals into the water.
“The likelihood of another 2014 ‘don’t drink the water’ advisory has been minimized to almost nothing by additional vigilance” from both the lab and local officials, they said.
Remaining staff have had to contend with not only a lack of capacity but also tight limits on spending and travel.
Several people who have worked in or with the lab said that the staff was hampered by strict credit card limits imposed on government employees as part of the effort to reduce spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheaded by presidential adviser Elon Musk.
“The basic scientific supplies that we use to provide the local communities with information on algal bloom toxicity — our purchasing of them is being restricted based on the limitations currently being put in by the administration,” Collier said.
NOAA and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, didn’t respond to messages from ProPublica. Neither did a DOGE official. Eight U.S. senators, including the minority leader, sent a letter in March to a top NOAA leader inquiring about many of the changes, but they never received a response.
The department described its approach to some of its cuts when it eliminated nearly $4 million in funding for the NOAA cooperative institute at Princeton University and emphasized the importance of avoiding wasteful government spending. ProPublica has reported on how the loss of research grants at Princeton and the more significant defunding of the NOAA lab it works with would be a serious setback for weather and climate preparedness.
A number of the staffing losses at the Great Lakes lab came when employees accepted offers of early retirement or voluntary separation; others were fired probationary workers targeted by DOGE across the government. That includes Collier, who had 24 years of professional experience, largely as a research professor, before he was hired last year into a position that, according to the lab’s former director, had been difficult to fill.
A scientist specializing in the toxic algal blooms was also fired. She worked on the team for 14 years through the cooperative institute before accepting a federal position last year, which made her probationary, too.
A computer scientist who got real-time data onto the lab’s website — and the only person who knew how to push out the weekly sampling data on harmful algal blooms — was also fired. She was probationary because she too was hired for a federal position after working with the institute.
And because of a planned retirement, no one holds the permanent position of lab director, though there is an acting director. The lab isn’t allowed to fill any positions due to a federal hiring freeze.
At the same time, expected funds for the lab’s cooperative institute are delayed, which means, Dick said, it may soon lay off staff, including people on the algal blooms team.
In March, Cleveland’s water commissioner wrote a letter calling for continued support for the Great Lakes lab and other NOAA-funded operations in the region, saying that access to real-time forecasts for Lake Erie are “critically important in making water treatment decisions” for more than 1.3 million citizens.
In 2006, there was a major outbreak of hypoxia, an issue worsened by algal blooms where oxygen-depleted water can become corrosive, discolored and full of excess manganese, which is a neurotoxin at high levels. Cleveland Water collaborated with the lab on developing a “groundbreaking” hypoxia forecast model, said Scott Moegling, who worked for both the Cleveland utility and Ohio’s drinking water regulatory agency.
“I knew which plants were going to get hit,” Moegling said. “I knew about when, and I knew what the treatment we would need would be, and we could staff accordingly.”
The American Meteorological Society, in partnership with the National Weather Association, spotlighted this warning system in its statement in support of NOAA research, saying that it helps “keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.”
Collier, the former branch chief, said that quality data may be lacking this year, not just for drinking water suppliers, but also the U.S. Coast Guard, fisheries, shipping companies, recreational businesses and shoreline communities that rely on it to navigate risk. In response to a recent survey of stakeholders, the president of a trade organization serving Great Lakes cargo vessels said that access to NOAA’s real-time data “is critically important to the commercial shipping fleet when making navigation decisions.”
Because federal law requires NOAA to monitor harmful algal blooms, the cuts may run against legal obligations, several current and former workers told ProPublica. The blooms program was “federally mandated to be active every single day, without exception,” Collier said.
The 2024 bloom in Lake Erie was the earliest on record. At its peak, it covered 550 square miles. Warming temperatures worsen the size and frequency of algal blooms. While the field season was historically only about 90 days, Collier said, last year the team was deployed for 211 days.
As the shallowest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is typically first to show signs of problems. But it’s also an emblem of environmental stewardship, thanks to its striking recovery from unchecked industrial pollution. The lake was once popularly declared “dead.” A highly publicized fire inflamed a river that feeds into it. Even Dr. Seuss knocked it in the 1971 version of “The Lorax.” The book described fish leaving a polluted pond “in search of some water that isn’t so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.”
But the rise of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, and labs like the one protecting the Great Lakes, along with legislation that protected water from pollution, led to noticeable changes. By 1986, two Ohio graduate students had succeeded in persuading Theodor Geisel, the author behind Dr. Seuss, to revise future editions of his classic book.
“I should no longer be saying bad things about a body of water that is now, due to great civic and scientific effort, the happy home of smiling fish,” Geisel wrote to them.
Early this year, headlines out of the Midwest suggested that “Vance could be a game-changing Great Lakes advocate” and that he might “save the Great Lakes from Trump.”
A 2023 report to Congress about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular funding mechanism for projects that protect the lakes, including the research lab’s, described the lab’s work on harmful algal blooms as one of its “success stories.” Last year, with Vance as a co-sponsor, an act to extend support for the funding program passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Another bipartisan effort to reauthorize it launched in January.
Project 2025, the plan produced by the Heritage Foundation for Trump’s second term, recommended that the president consider whether NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.”
NOAA is “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” the plan said, and this industry’s mission “seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”
“That is not to say NOAA is useless,” it added, “but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”
When asked at his confirmation hearing in January if he agreed with Project 2025’s recommendation of dismantling NOAA, Howard Lutnick, head of the commerce department, said no.
One month later, the Great Lakes lab’s probationary staff got termination notices. That includes Nicole Rice, who spent a decade with NOAA. A promotion made her communications job vulnerable to the widespread firings of federal probationary workers.
In recent testimony to a Michigan Senate committee, Rice expressed deep concern about the future of the Great Lakes.
“It has taken over a century of bipartisan cooperation, investment and science to bring the Great Lakes back from the brink of ecological collapse,” Rice said. “But these reckless cuts could undo the progress in just a few short years, endangering the largest surface freshwater system in the world.”

Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, speaks to the House Education Policy Committee while holding a binder that reads ""Religious Release Act"" on March 19, 2025, at the Alabama State House in Montgomery, Alabama. The Senate version of the legislation was effectively killed on Wednesday in the House State Government Committee. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would require local school boards to adopt policies on extending academic credit for “religious instruction” outside the classroom failed an Alabama House committee on Wednesday.
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, is identical to HB 342, sponsored by Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, that failed the House Education Policy Committee on April 2. DuBose presented the legislation to the House State Government Committee.
“This bill simply allows public school students to enrich their school opportunities with an optional religious class. The bill simply requires our school districts to create a policy that allows students to attend an off campus religious class during the school day,” DuBose said.
The Senate passed the legislation 25-6 on April 22 after the Senate Education Policy Committee approved it with one “no” vote.The Legislature passed a law in 2019 that allows school boards to adopt a policy on released time religious instruction (RTRI). The 2025 legislation would mandate such policies.
But House members have been far more skeptical about the legislation, citing pushback from school superintendents. 
Sunnie Cotton, the director of LifeWise Academy in Alabama and a proponent of the legislation, called it a parental rights bill.
“This bill strengthens parental rights and protects religious freedom while giving parents the choice to provide religious instruction for their children during the school day,” Cotton said. 
According to LifeWise’s sample curriculum, the organization teaches the Christian belief that “God created all things good” to a list of virtues that the nonprofit describes as “LifeWise qualities.” Cotton said the organization is operating in about 600 schools nationwide and is prepared to launch over 900 programs this year.
DuBose claimed 4,500 Alabama parents have signed a petition in support of the legislation. DuBose has not presented the petition when requested Wednesday.
Ryan Hollingsworth, executive director of the State Superintendents Association, has been a consistent opponent of the legislation. Hollingsworth said Wednesday he is not convinced that the petition has been signed by Alabama parents.
“I don’t believe those are verified as being the parents of Alabama students in public schools if they are,” Hollingsworth said. “Even if they are, we have about 725,000 students, so that’s about a half of 1% of folks that have signed it.”
He said the bill is lacking key definitions of religious instruction, core instruction and sponsoring entity. 
“We have 1,080 hours in the school year to cover everything the state board requires,” Hollingsworth said. “There’s 8,760 hours in the calendar year. That means the parent has the responsibility of the child about 88% of the time.” 
Scott Suttle, St. Clair County Board of Education president and Alabama Association of School Boards (AASB) president-elect, echoed similar concerns. He said the legislation is government overreach in schools.
“Our local leaders have been abundantly clear that we don’t want another overreach into our school systems,” Suttle said. “It works as it is. Let’s please leave it as it is.”
Sally Smith, executive director of the AASB, said after the bill failed that she is thankful the committee listened to school board leaders.
“We are pleased with the committee outcome. We think that the law as it is is working fine,” she said in an interview after the meeting.
Jennifer Riggs, a mother from Huntsville, brought her son to the meeting, like she did at the Senate Education Policy Committee public hearing on April 15. She said the program has helped her children learn about the Bible in public schools since they cannot afford to send their four children to private school.
“Five days per week, seven hours per day, and in public school, the Bible is not being taught. We believe a release time for religious instruction program would bridge that gap,” she said. “I believe this is legislation that upholds parental rights by allowing us to choose Bible education for our children without having to incur the financial burdens of private school.”
Rep. Marcus Paramore, R-Troy, who also serves on the House Education Policy Committee, said he would not support the legislation because of its failure in the first committee.
“So here we are in another committee trying to get a bill that was voted down, back out and on the floor in a different format,” he said. “I just want to make some comments and make it clear for what Mr. Hollingsworth said earlier this has already been before a body in this house once this year, and here we are again.”
The committee had a tie vote on the legislation 4-4 with Paramore; Rep. Russell Bedsole, R-Alabaster; Rep. Barbra Boyd, D-Anniston; and Rep. Marilyn Lands, D-Huntsville, opposing it. In order for the legislation to receive final approval from the House, a House committee would have to approve the legislation on May 14, the final day of the 2025 session.

(Photo by Aleksandr Yu/Getty Images)The number of Utah minors who vape has substantially diminished since a 2019 peak. Still, vaping is a notorious issue in schools — so much so that the state banned flavored e-cigarettes with lawmakers hoping to prevent children from starting nicotine addictions. 
However, advocates worry that federal cuts may halt that progress, as mass layoffs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may have an impact on the government’s anti-tobacco programs.
That’s because major players like Brian King, head of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products division, were fired in addition to other cuts to the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health, an office that aims to prevent tobacco use, especially among children.

Some health advocacy groups are sounding the alarm on how the cuts may harm children in the country and the state. 
Yolonda Richardson, president and CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, issued a news release criticizing the Trump administration’s fiscal 2026 budget plan over “devastating” funding cuts to health agencies, eliminating public health programs such as the CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, which includes the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health.
With House split on whether to keep ban on flavored vape sales, status quo remains

“These massive budget cuts would cause enormous harm to the nation’s health, and they are at odds with the Administration’s own stated commitment to reduce chronic disease and protect children’s health, as well as to save money,” Richardson wrote.
Tobacco kills nearly 500,000 Americans a year and costs over $241 billion in annual health care expenses, she said, “more than 60% of which is paid by taxpayers through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.”
The cuts could also impact national educational efforts that prevented nearly 450,000 young people from starting e-cigarette use between 2023 and 2024, according to the FDA.
The move also caused concern among some Utah Republicans who believe the government can juggle multiple priorities simultaneously, including Mackey Smith, former vice chair of the Salt Lake County Republican Party and current State Central Committee member for the state’s chapter of the party.
While anti-tobacco campaigns may not be as daunting as other priorities, like national security and the deficit, the government can still work diligently to “get low-hanging fruit wins, like addressing vaping and these public health topics,” Smith said. 
Smith is aware of public health campaigns in Utah. But for him, focusing just on them isn’t enough. The solution, he said, may be in enforcing already existing laws that would discourage underage smoking and vaping.



Let us know what you think...


 


“The big piece is there already are laws that enable the FDA to come in and enforce this,” he said. “But there are a lot of these products that are sold illegally, that are not on the approved flavors list, so to speak, and they’re being peddled to kids.”
This doesn’t mean he supports “the massive expansion of a bureaucratic state,” he said, describing some of the federal cuts as “good,” and some layoffs as “inevitable.”
“I do feel in some ways, we were overbloated from a personnel standpoint at the federal level,” he said. “However, I wouldn’t say that you just do massive layoffs all at once. You need to be using the scalpel for surgeries as needed, not a saw.” 
In 2019, 12.4% of Utah students in grades 8, 10 and 12 reported vaping. It was a peak, more than doubling what was seen in 2013. The number has since decreased with 7.5% students reporting in a school survey they had recently vaped in 2023. But, with less regulatory oversight, supporters of anti-smoking efforts say the tobacco industry may thrive.
Advocates from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids warned that smoking is a primary driver of chronic disease including cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes.
“The gutting of these agencies conflicts with the repeatedly stated commitments of President Trump and Secretary Kennedy to reduce chronic disease and protect children’s health,” Richardson said in a past statement. “We cannot achieve these goals and make America healthy if our nation backs off its efforts to reduce tobacco use.”

In a decision released Tuesday, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied an appeal of a lower court’s dismissal of a lawsuit by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative group that has filed legal challenges across the U.S. seeking to remove people from voter rolls.
“I’m very grateful that a federal court has once again recognized our strong work keeping our voter file up to date,” Benson said in a press release. “Since 2020, our department has fought a record number of lawsuits based on false and meritless claims meant to undermine people’s faith in Michigan’s elections.”
Public Interest Legal Foundation filed the lawsuit against Benson, a Democrat who is also a candidate for governor, in November 2021, alleging Michigan was violating the National Voter Registration Act by refusing to remove 27,000 individuals from its qualified voter file the group said were dead. 
Lawyers for Benson’s office had argued that she declined to remove the voters because doing so without confirming the accuracy of the group’s list would have risked removing eligible voters in violation of federal voting law, which seeks to ensure voters aren’t wrongly removed.
That argument was supported by U.S. District Court Judge Jane Beckering of the Western District of Michigan, who in March 2024 rejected as “theoretical” the harms claimed by the group, and concluded that deceased voters were removed from Michigan’s voter rolls on a regular basis.
In its decision to reject Public Interest Legal Foundation’s appeal, the 6th Circuit said Michigan has actively made “an inherently rational, sensible attempt at maintaining accurate voter registration lists,” and that the state “goes further by also actively employing a third party, ERIC, to assist in identifying deceased registrants. This additional effort only further enhances the reasonableness of Michigan’s efforts to maintain accurate voter rolls.” 
The Electronic Registration Information Center, commonly called ERIC, is a nonpartisan interstate cooperative that seeks to maintain accurate voter registration rolls.
According to the Public Interest Legal Foundation’s website, the group has filed numerous lawsuits across the country requesting similar releases of voter roll information in an effort to prove illegal voting, which is extremely rare.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) Rhode Island’s Department of Corrections has agreed to let an Indigenous man incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) in Cranston wear a headband reflecting the religious practices of his tribe.
That largely resolves a federal lawsuit filed in January 2024 by the ACLU of Rhode Island and the Roger Williams University (RWU) School of Law Prisoners’ Rights Litigation Clinic. The suit accused the state prison system of violating inmate Wolf Pawochawog-Mequinosh’s right to freely exercise his religion under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

Pawochawog-Mequinosh and the state reached the agreement on April 30. Under the terms, the Department of Corrections will cover the $40,000 in legal fees and $405 in costs to the plaintiff’s lawyers, Jared Goldstein, director of the RWU Law legal clinic and ACLU cooperating attorney Lynette Labinger.
Pawochawog-Mequinosh, who is serving a life sentence at the ACI for two first-degree sexual assault convictions, sued the department in January 2024 after he claimed prisonadministrators repeatedly denied his request to wear a White Mountain Apache Tribe headband. Formerly known as Brian Brownell of Tiverton, he was sentenced in August 2023.
Prison officials denied the requests because his religion is designated as “Pagan/Wiccan” in the department’s data management system. The Department of Corrections did not offer a religious designation for those who follow Native American religious traditions, according to the lawsuit.
The settlement gives the Department of Corrections 120 days to establish a way for inmates whose religions are not explicitly recognized by the prison to request approval for religious items and services consistent with their beliefs.
The ACLU and the RWU Law legal clinic will have up to 30 days to determine if the settlement terms have been fulfilled.
“This case reflects a fundamental principle: People in prison may lose their liberty but they cannot be deprived of their humanity, and the free exercise of religion is a basic human right,” Goldstein said in a statement Wednesday.
Department of Corrections spokesperson J.R. Ventura did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced on Tuesday that the state will investigate Loudoun County Public Schools following a media report that the school division launched a Title IX investigation after three high school boys said they felt “uncomfortable” when a biologically female student changed clothes in a boys’ locker room and recorded their discussion about it.
Loudoun’s school policy allows students to use bathrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identification instead of their biological sex. But Seth Wolfe, the parent of one of the three boys, said his 15-year-old son is being “unfairly targeted for simply asking a basic question that any boy would be asking in that situation.”
“It’s astonishing that Loudoun school officials are subjecting him to a formal investigation for a bogus charge that could derail his life,” Wolfe said in a statement released by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, which is representing the student. 
In a WJLA report on Tuesday, Wolfe criticized LCPS for investigating his son and the other students for expressing their discomfort with the male-identifying student being in the boys’ locker room and said the division’s bathroom policy creates an “unsafe environment” for all students. An attorney with the law center confirmed with the Mercury that Wolfe was the unidentified parent in WJLA’s report.
On May 6, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced that he asked Miyares to investigate the case to ensure the school division is upholding every student’s privacy, dignity and safety.
“It’s deeply concerning to read reports of yet another incident in Loudoun County schools where members of the opposite sex are violating the privacy of students in locker rooms,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Even more alarming, the victims of this violation are the ones being investigated — this is beyond belief.” 
Miyares added that the case “is just the latest example of what happens when school boards disregard common sense. The safety, dignity, and privacy of every student in Virginia should be non-negotiable. This is about safety and privacy, not political correctness — and it’s time Loudoun County recognized that.” 
The school division said in a statement that it was “deeply disheartening” to see an elected official, which they did not identify by name, rely on the media report to publicly criticize LCPS.
The division added that the report by WJLA contains “false” and “misleading” information. The school system said it would not discuss the specifics of the incident in recognition of students’ privacy but defended its policies and commitment to student safety. 
“We reject any characterization that implies our schools are unsafe or that we fail to protect the rights of all students,” the school division stated. “We remain steadfast in our legal and ethical obligation to uphold the rights of every student and will continue to create and nurture an environment that is welcoming and accepting for all students, so that everyone has the opportunity to learn, grow and succeed.”
In 2023, Loudoun County Public Schools announced it was launching a pilot program to support students and staff concerning restroom privacy and safety. The goal was to increase accessibility and allow students a choice to use the multi-fixture, gender-specific restrooms or single-occupancy restrooms in all LCPS facilities, the division said.
Stone Bridge High School, which Wolfe’s son and the other students attend and where the locker room recording occurred, was not part of the pilot program.
This situation is not the first time Loudoun schools have made headlines for issues involving students’ gender identity. In 2021 the school division faced criticism and a $30 million lawsuit over how it responded after a teenage male student was found guilty of assaulting two female students at two different schools over six months. In the first incident, the male student was wearing a skirt when he attacked a female student in a girl’s bathroom, but there’s no evidence the male student identified as female. 
The Loudoun County Court ordered the teen to receive immediate treatment and register as a sex offender. Since then, the school board has adjusted policies and hired a new superintendent.
To align Virginia school divisions with the governor’s sustained advocacy for parents’ rights, the governor’s administration overhauled the state’s model policies for the treatment of transgender students in 2023. 
Some of the key changes included requiring students to use the locker room corresponding to their sex, unless federal laws state otherwise, requiring schools to notify parents if a student is permitted to use a locker room that differs from their biological sex and allowing parents to opt their child out and use alternative facilities.

The federal government provided $189 billion in aid money for schools during the crisis, giving them broad latitude in how to spend it.
Nearly all that money had been spent, but some school districts received deadline extensions that gave them additional time to use it. Districts spent it on things like after-school tutoring, summer school, social workers, college counselors, library books and renovations to make school buildings safer.
On March 28, Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent a letter to school officials saying she had moved the deadline up — to that very day. She said the department would consider releasing some funds, but only on a project-by-project basis.
“Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities,” McMahon said.

Officials in sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued in response, leading to Tuesday’s order from U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in New York City.
Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has unilaterally cut education funding and downsized the Education Department, leading to numerous legal challenges. The Trump administration also cut teacher-training programs that helped rural schools combat educator shortages and has threatened to withhold funding from schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — In marking the merger of two water-focused state agencies, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen on Wednesday said he and other farmers “messed up” in managing water resources.
“What’s really, really important as we go forward, that we all just have the courage to say the way it is,” said Pillen, whose family runs a Columbus-based hog operation and who became the state’s first farmer-governor in more than a century.

“I’m a farmer. We don’t want to admit that we messed up, but we did. We’ve over-applied fertilizer, we’ve over-applied water, and we drove nitrates down into the ground, and we have nitrates in groundwater.”
Adding that it was time to “stop talking about it,” Pillen said a motivation behind merging two state agencies focused on water resources was to lean on new technology and scientific advancements to “educate all farmers in Nebraska so that we fix the problem and start having measurable breakthroughs.”
With that, the governor signed into law Legislative Bill 317, which he pushed and State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth helped carry over the finish line. The law combines the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy (DEE) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) into the new Department of Water, Energy and Environment (DWEE).
 Familiar leaders

Pillen, during the same Capitol news conference Wednesday, introduced two men already involved in the respective departments who will lead the combined agency. 
Jesse Bradley takes the reins as DWEE director and Matt Manning becomes “chief water officer.” Both described themselves as lifelong Nebraskans.

Bradley, who most recently was interim director of both agencies, said he would stress collaboration with organizations across the state and building a good internal culture.
He said the department’s priorities include fulfilling the Perkins County Canal project and working with the new “Water Quality and Quantity Task Force” Pillen is launching to help adopt solutions for water issues, especially in agriculture.
Manning, most recently a DNR engineer responsible for the Perkins project, said he sees his task as building upon and improving what the two organizations already do.
Also at the event was State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, chair of the Legislature’s Agriculture Committee.
 ‘Common sense’ 

Asked about the potential for finding cost-savings, Pillen said he had no definitive projection or supportive data but said it made “common sense” that efficiencies would result.
During debate on the legislative floor in April, a few lawmakers noted the lack of a clear vision for any cost savings. State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said at the time it would be more accurate to call the merger a “rebranding.”

State and federal appropriations for the two departments totaled about $203 million, according to a recent legislative fiscal impact statement. It said that over time, efficiencies from a merger should result in savings.
Pillen on Wednesday called water the second most important thing about Nebraska, behind its people. 
“It’s our lifeblood. It’s like God’s grace. You can’t make it. You receive it, and we can take care of it,” he said.
Pillen said the merger was “timely and important” and noted that many take for granted “our pot of gold” — the Ogallala Aquifer — which the governor said irrigates almost 11 million acres in the state. 
He said he has been meeting with local Natural Resources Districts over the past 18 months, and there will be a broader effort to preserve and improve water resources and to protect the aquifer.
Today’s technology and science, he said, allows the state to be proactive rather than reactive in managing water, and that’s a mission of the newly merged team. 
 ‘Every drop of water’ 

Pillen said power and water will be increasingly vital to future generations of Nebraskans. “When you think about the production of hydrogen, you think about the advancement of biofuels, you think about all the biobased products and all that we’re making out of ethanol from corn. You think about the animal processing, how our livestock industries exploded in the last 20 years.” 
In response to a reporter’s question, Pillen said he would continue to push construction of the Perkins County Canal. “We’re gonna fight like heck to make sure that we get every drop of water that comes to Nebraska for us,” he said.

Some state lawmakers, during debate on how to close the state’s budget deficit, have urged reducing funding earmarked for the western Nebraska canal, which would transport water from the Platte River in Colorado into Nebraska. The initiative has spurred water rights debates between the two states.
Pillen, reiterating his hope to turn a page on water quality and quantity in Nebraska, noted that the room in which he holds news conferences used to be dark from people smoking in it. He said that is no longer the case.
“You know, we learn and we move forward, and it’s time to get after it,” he said. “That’s what I’m excited about with this merger.”

CT Sen. Richard Blumenthal called it 'nonsensical.'","WASHINGTON — Veterans and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday protested the Trump administration’s planned cuts for the Department of Veterans Affairs that include slashing some 80,000 jobs, which many worry will affect the massive agency’s delivery of medical care and benefits.
The group rallied outside the U.S. Capitol shortly after VA Secretary Doug Collins finished lengthy questioning before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, where he defended the cuts as necessary to improve the department’s efficiency.
Holding signs that read “Veterans Healthcare Not For Sale,” a crowd of former service members joined by senators and representatives decried that argument as “nonsensical,” as Sen. Richard Blumenthal, top Democrat on the Veterans Affairs Committee, put it.
“We’re not going to allow veterans to be betrayed by this administration,” Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said. “I’ve just come from a hearing with the VA secretary, and to say it was a disappointment is a huge understatement. That hearing was a disgrace.”

‘Non-stop smear campaign’
Jose Vasquez, executive director of Common Defense, the advocacy group that organized the press conference, said, “They call this efficiency, but we call it betrayal.”
Vasquez, an Army veteran who recently received care from the VA in New York for a cancerous tumor on his pancreas, said, “Millions of veterans depend on VA every day — survivors of cancer, toxic exposure, traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress.”
He contends the agency’s workers, many of whom are veterans, have been the target of a “non-stop smear campaign.”
“Why? Simple. Because a small group of greedy billionaires would rather get tax cuts than pay for the true cost of war,” Vasquez.
[RELATED: Some CT veterans fear federal changes will lead to health care cuts]
Trump’s temporary DOGE organization, led by top campaign donor Elon Musk, cut roughly 2,400 VA jobs in early March.
Collins, a former Georgia congressman who still serves in the Air Force Reserve, unveiled a plan in early March to return VA staffing to 2019 levels of 398,000, down from the current approximately 470,000 positions.
The lawmaker told senators Tuesday that he’s “conducting a thorough review of the department’s structure and staffing across the enterprise.”
“We’re going to maintain VA’s mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission-essential roles like interior designers and DEI officers. The savings we achieve will be redirected to veteran health care and benefits,” Collins said.
Collins drew pushback during the hearing, including from Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who told the secretary “there’s no way that all those 80,000 are in those job fields,” referring to his comment about DEI and interior designers.
“I’m having a problem understanding how the veterans in Michigan are going to get the same or better care, which is what we want,” said Slotkin, who served three tours in Iraq as a CIA analyst.
GOP says VA must change
Many Republicans on the panel maintained the VA, as Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said, “is not working.”
“If we just say everything has to stay the same and you just gotta add more money and more people, then you’re looking at it the wrong way,” Tillis said, adding that he’s “open to any suggestions” and will review the proposal for workforce reductions.
Collins criticized the increase in hiring under former President Joe Biden, who signed into law the PACT Act, the largest expansion of VA benefits in decades.The law opened care to roughly 1 million veterans who developed certain conditions and cancers following exposure to burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Vietnam vets exposed to Agent Orange.
Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said Collins was being “battered” about the possible 80,000 cuts. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe there were 52,000 new positions added between 2021 and 2024. … That 52,000, has that saved the day for our veterans?
“I don’t think so,” Collins responded.
But at the rally afterward, Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio, a former Navy officer who served in Iraq, defended the PACT Act expansion.
“At this moment when so many toxic-exposed veterans of my generation, Agent Orange-exposed veterans from the Vietnam era, are finally getting the benefits they’ve earned because of the PACT Act, we should be investing in the resources for the VA, and Donald Trump and his team are doing the opposite,” said Deluzio, who represents Pennsylvania.

It’s one of the biggest issues this session. Legislators are considering bills that would allow “constitutional carry,” or the idea that individuals should be able to carry concealed weapons without restrictions based on the Second Amendment.
Senate Bill 50, “Freedom to Carry NC,” allows North Carolinians who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age, and not otherwise prohibited by law, to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s backed by Republican leadership and would make North Carolina the 30th state to enshrine such a policy in state law. The bill has passed the Senate and is awaiting action in the House.
Its counterpart in the lower chamber, House Bill 5 or “NC Constitutional Carry Act,” has the same idea. This measure still needs approval from the House Rules Committee.
Rep. Phillip Rubin, a Democrat from Wake County, said the fact that either bill is even under consideration is a reflection of the troubled state of democracy in North Carolina.
North Carolina is one of the “most intensely” gerrymandered states in the country, he said, with Republicans earning less than 48% of the vote statewide but holding 59% of the seats in the legislature. At the congressional level, the North Carolina delegation went from an even 7-7 split to a 10-4 Republican majority following GOP-crafted redistricting.
“In a functioning democracy where elected representatives feel accountable to the people they represent, a bill this unpopular and this dangerous would never pass. It would never even come to a vote,” he said. “That is why I’m so sad to see common sense gun regulation measures that can’t get a vote, and dangerous measures like permitless concealed carry that repeatedly can.”
Polls released recently by Everytown for Gun Safety and Elon University found the bulk of North Carolina voters against loosening gun regulations.
Rev. Jennifer Copeland is the executive director of the North Carolina Council of Churches, which represents 19 denominations. She said owning or carrying a gun doesn’t make people safe.
“All of us are less safe when everyone around us has a gun tucked into their waistband or carries it around in their purse,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2025-guns.jpg,,,2025-05-07 14:11:09.278153

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont has lost over $150 million in the past four years. If it fails, the state’s entire health care apparatus could fall apart, officials say.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, in Burlington on Friday, May 31, 2024. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerOver the past several months, Vermont lawmakers and state officials have been preoccupied with the fate of the state’s largest health insurance company. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the Vermont-based member of the nationwide health insurance organization, is also the only health insurance company based in Vermont. The nonprofit covers roughly a third of the state’s population across all its plans. Now, with its reserves drained by a multi-year surge in insurance claims, the nonprofit is facing a financial crisis with little recent precedent. As Blue Cross Blue Shield prepares to ask state regulators to increase premiums in 2026, the financial health of the company has alarmed policymakers and prompted a scramble to shore up the company.“If Blue Cross cannot pay the claims, the system fails,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, a key health care regulator, told lawmakers last month. Federally qualified health centers, independent clinics, mental health agencies, possibly even hospitals — “if they don’t get paid, they close their doors,” Foster said.  The financial headwinds facing Blue Cross Blue Shield are familiar to many in Vermont’s health system. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals and other providers have seen a surge of patients, many presenting with more complex conditions. What’s more, the price of care — particularly drugs, and more particularly specialty drugs, like popular weight-loss medications known as GLP-1s — has increased precipitously in the past few years. That’s led to unexpected increases in health care expenditures across the state. In both 2023 and 2024, for example, the University of Vermont Medical Center exceeded its budgets by tens of millions of dollars — overages that, hospital administrators said, were caused by a massive surge in patients needing more care.That surge has, in turn, drained Blue Cross Blue Shield’s cash reserves. From 2021 through the end of 2024, Blue Cross Blue Shield has lost nearly $152 million, according to data the insurer presented to legislators earlier this month. Last year alone, Blue Cross lost $62.1 million.In 2019, the insurer had $133.5 million in the bank. At the end of 2024, Blue Cross Blue Shield had just $58 million — and pays out an average of $35 million a week in claims.Last year, credit rating agency A.M. Best downgraded Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rating twice, bringing its score from B++ to C++. That’s moved the insurer’s rating from “good” to “marginal” in a matter of less than six months.“I’ve lived and worked in Vermont for 45 years,” Don George, the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield, told lawmakers in the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare last month. “And I’ve just never seen anything remotely close to what we’re going through now.” ‘We’re fortunate’A significant chunk of those losses have come from Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Medicare Advantage plans, Vermont Blue Advantage. From 2019 through 2023, Blue Cross Blue Shield lost $43.4 million on those plans, according to financial records. Roughly 35,000 Vermonters are on Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage plans, Sara Teachout, a spokesperson for the insurer, said. Some of those early losses were startup costs ahead of the plans’ rollout in 2021, Teachout said. Once they hit the market, the plans continued to lose money — $11.5 million in 2022 and $22.5 million in 2023 — along with the rest of the insurer’s portfolio, records show.  Those deficits are due to the same factors affecting the rest of Blue Cross Blue Shield’s generally, Teachout said: a rise in residents needing care and increasing costs for that care.Those losses “are proportionate to the losses in our other lines of businesses that are due to the cost surge,” she said. To shield itself from those losses, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has almost entirely unloaded its Medicare Advantage business onto Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, an affiliate nonprofit insurer. It’s also taken out a $30 million loan from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont headquarters in Berlin. VTDigger file photo Because of its shaky financial footing, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is paying 8% interest on that Michigan loan. George, the CEO, said in an interview that the insurer was lucky to have even gotten a loan in the first place.“The reality is, we would likely — under those circumstances and that risk — not be able to find anyone that would loan Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (money),” he said. “So we’re fortunate to have Michigan, and that’s how we come up with that interest rate.”To shore up its finances, the insurer has also held off hiring roughly for 30 positions and has embarked on a “comprehensive capital recovery plan” with the Department of Financial Regulation, according to George. ‘The number one cost driver’As part of an annual regulatory process, Blue Cross Blue Shield is preparing to request increases to its insurance premiums later this month — increases that are expected to be large. Last year, the insurer raised premiums for individual and small group plans on the state’s health insurance marketplace by roughly 20%. For 2026, “Given the pace of medical and pharmacy costs and the utilization that we saw right through to the end of 2024, I would expect increases not unlike what we’ve recently seen in the past,” Ruth Greene, the insurer’s chief financial officer, said in March. Those increases impact not only individual Vermonters’ insurance costs — already some of the highest in the nation — but also their taxes. Most municipalities buy small group insurance plans on the state health insurance market, according to Ted Brady, the executive director of the Vermont League of Cities and Towns. Prior to last year’s premium increases, roughly 80% of municipal employees were insured with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Brady said, although he now expects that many municipalities have switched to MVP, the other insurer that sells on the marketplace.“Health insurance is the number one cost driver for municipalities right now,” he said.School and state employees are also insured on Blue Cross plans, but are on a different type of plan known as self-funded plans. Although those organizations have also seen significant premium increases as health care costs rise, members contribute proportionally less to Blue Cross’ reserves — meaning they are more insulated from the insurer’s financial struggles, administrators at those organizations say. Still, increasing insurance premiums are “a tremendous economic strain on every part of Vermont,” Vermont’s Chief Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher told lawmakers last month. ‘Acute and immediate threat’Meanwhile, policymakers and legislators are taking steps on their own. In March, the Green Mountain Care Board, a key health care regulator, announced a deal with the University of Vermont Health Network that will deliver $12 million in hospital funds to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont. Lawmakers are also hashing out the details of a bill that would allow for emergency action to help health insurers in financial crisis. That bill, H. 482, would allow the Green Mountain Care Board to reduce the reimbursement rates paid to a Vermont hospital if the insurer in question faces “an acute and immediate threat to its solvency.” Such a rate reduction would only be allowed if the hospital is part of a financially stable network, according to the bill language. The proposed legislation passed out of the House in March. A key legislative committee, the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, is scheduled to vote on advancing it Friday. Sen.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMeanwhile, in the other chamber, the House’s health committee is looking to address the problem of rising costs closer to their source — at hospitals and other providers. A sprawling bill, S.126, would implement a new payment model known as reference-based pricing, in which hospital charges are pegged to Medicare reimbursement rates, to go into effect no later than 2027. The bill would also direct the Agency of Human Services to work with providers to reduce health care spending by 5% “for hospital fiscal year 2026,” which begins October 1.That bill passed the Senate in March, and lawmakers in the House Health Care Committee are working on amendments this week. “There’s a lot of work that has to be done,” Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, the chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare, said of her committee’s legislation last month. “We can’t let Blue Cross and Blue Shield go under.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Financial struggles have pushed Vermont’s largest health insurer to the brink.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bernie-health-costs-7-20240531-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-07 14:11:09.278153

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Tuesday ruled that the Trump administration’s effort to deport immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act “exceeds the scope” of the centuries-old wartime law and granted a preliminary injunction against any such removals of detainees held in Colorado.
The 25-page ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney extends indefinitely a block on Alien Enemies Act removals that she had granted in a temporary restraining order last month. Sweeney also issued an order certifying the case, which was brought by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals detained in Aurora, as a class action.
The injunction bars President Donald Trump’s administration “from detaining, transferring, or removing Petitioners and members of the certified class under the Act … from the District of Colorado.” More than 100 people detained at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora could be affected, ACLU attorneys have estimated.
The injunction followed similar orders by a federal judge in New York earlier on Tuesday and another in Texas last week. A wave of litigation has followed in the wake of Trump’s March 14 invocation of the Alien Enemies Act and subsequent deportation of 137 migrants to El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a maximum-security prison criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions.
Passed in 1798, the Alien Enemies Act has been invoked on only three previous occasions and only during war, most recently during World War II as the basis for the incarceration of noncitizens of Japanese, German and Italian descent. The Trump administration seeks to use it to expedite the removals of people it claims are part of an “invasion” of the United States by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
About 90% of the deportees sent to CECOT last month had no criminal record, according to Bloomberg. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for other deportees say that they were falsely identified as gang members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team. Trump has openly floated plans to send American citizens to CECOT next.
The plaintiffs in the Colorado case, who are identified in court documents by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M., say they have been falsely identified as Tren de Aragua members by the Trump administration and fear imminent deportation to the CECOT facility.
Sweeney’s injunction reiterates many of her findings from an April 22 temporary restraining order, including a judgement that Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is likely unlawful because the statute requires “military action” by a “foreign nation or government.”
She again dismissed claims by the Trump administration that the court lacks jurisdiction because the plaintiffs are not currently designated for removal under the Alien Enemies Act. In court proceedings, Trump’s Department of Justice has defended the administration’s practice of providing as little as 12 hours’ notice to detainees to indicate they wish to contest their designation as alien enemies.
“Fundamentally, the court concludes R.M.M. and D.B.U. face a sufficient risk of wrongful and harmful deportation under the Act and Proclamation, and that other class members certainly do as well,” Sweeney wrote.
Her ruling also had harsh words for the Trump administration’s argument, in an April 30 filing in opposition to a preliminary injunction, that determining whether the Alien Enemies Act was properly invoked “is the President’s call alone; the federal courts do not have a role to play.”
“This sentence staggers. It is wrong as a matter of law and attempts to read an entire provision out of the Constitution,” wrote Sweeney, referring to the first section of the Constitution’s article that establishes the federal judicial branch.

Hundreds of ""energy innovation"" leaders flock to state's annual conference to tout Wyoming's potential role in national energy transition.
The post Wyoming draws interest in new nuclear and low-carbon fossil fuel investments appeared first on WyoFile .","LARAMIE—Wyoming is on the cusp of a nationwide nuclear power resurgence with the backing of a presidential administration that also promises to overhaul federal regulations to ensure the state’s coal, oil and natural gas are positioned to meet booming electrical demand while lowering carbon emissions, Gov. Mark Gordon told an audience of energy enthusiasts.
In Wyoming, he said, “We talk about what’s practical, what’s good and what can we accomplish if we really put our minds to it. That has been, I think, the hallmark of what has driven so much of American energy [innovation] over the years.” 
Gordon spoke to about 350 attendees of the Next Frontier Energy Summit, an annual event organized by the Wyoming Energy Authority, at the University of Wyoming on Tuesday. The two-day conference featured speakers representing utility giant PacifiCorp, nuclear energy manufacturer BWXT Advanced Technologies, and leaders in the oil and gas and uranium mining industries. The governor suggested that, after decades of visionary work by state leaders to create regulatory pathways and boost investor confidence to scrub carbon from fossil fuels, markets and national policies are finally beginning to align with Wyoming’s attitude to “find a way forward.”

In fact, Gordon said, he’s recently modified his long-touted mantra of an “all-of-the-above” energy and environmental strategy: “Now, we need to talk about the best of all-of-the-above.”
“We have opportunities to innovate,” he said, “to make mistakes, to correct from those mistakes and to really drive through to a future that is efficient, that is environmentally sound, that has a mix in the energy portfolio — everything from renewables in the appropriate place to fossil [fuels] done right to nuclear done right.”
Faith in Wyoming nuclear, natural gas and coal
As evidence of Wyoming leading on the next generation of energy, PacifiCorp CEO Cindy Crane noted the utility’s tentative agreement to take on TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear power plant under construction near Kemmerer. Not only will Natrium — among the first “advanced small modular reactors” in development in the nation — help the six-state utility secure reliable, low-carbon electricity, it fits within PacifiCorp’s penchant for proven technologies over more speculative endeavors and political favor. 
“We don’t shift our strategy based on who’s in the White House,” Crane said. “We don’t manage our business on politics. We manage our business for our customers, first and foremost, and for our states and their energy policies, not the federal government’s policies.”
A big part of what makes advanced nuclear attractive to PacifiCorp, according to Crane, is the partnerships between the utility, TerraPower, the state, federal agencies and the University of Wyoming to build a domestic nuclear energy supply chain and workforce to back it up.
“We don’t shift our strategy based on who’s in the White House. We don’t manage our business on politics.” Cindy Crane, PacifiCorp
“It is elevating education and job training for Wyoming, as well as a future U.S. workforce,” Crane said. “It is building a transition for our existing and experienced workforce, and it is positioning Wyoming to continue and grow its electrification and supply of power throughout the western U.S.”
After burning more than $5 billion worth of Wyoming coal at its power plants over the decades, PacifiCorp is making the shift — although critics say too slowly — to not only renewables backed by energy storage, according to Crane but to nuclear and natural gas.

In fact, PacifiCorp has converted two of four coal-burning units at its Jim Bridger power plant outside Rock Springs to natural gas, and will convert the final two coal-burning units at the Naughton power plant near Kemmerer to natural gas in 2026. However, Crane noted, PacifiCorp isn’t giving up on Wyoming coal. The company is still evaluating whether it makes sense to retrofit coal units at its Jim Bridger and Dave Johnston power plants with carbon capture, use and sequestration technologies.
Despite a steep price tag for such retrofits, if they move forward — estimated at over $1 billion — the efforts would create thousands of construction jobs and sustain hundreds of existing jobs in the state, Crane said.
“This is truly an example of planting the seeds for long-term jobs and economic prosperity in the state,” she said.
Gordon noted that such efforts to push new commercial-scale technologies are expensive, including for customers, but suggested it is worth the investment.
“The technologies that have come along over the last couple of years are remarkable,” Gordon said. “Yes, some of them are very expensive. First-generation stuff generally is. But we’ve all had the benefit of lessons of time to develop the technologies and see what can be done better.”

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature is advancing a measure that would allow colleges and universities to contact the parents of students experiencing a mental health crisis. 
House Bill 202 by Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, would require colleges and universities to offer privacy waivers to students that would allow the schools to contact a pre-designated person in the case of a mental health crisis or situation in which the student poses a risk to themselves or other. 
The measure is necessary because colleges are currently not able to contact parents under privacy laws that protect adult students, Boyd said. Students would be given the option to fill out the waiver. 
Legislators on the House Committee on Education described the proposal Wednesday as  a “fail safe.” It comes on the heels of several high-profile deaths on college campuses. 
“Just recently, we had a student at Xavier University that committed suicide about a month ago,” Boyd told the committee. “Imagine if someone had paid attention to the change in attitude, the personality or what have you, it could have ended in a different way.” 
Boyd’s bill will next be discussed on the House floor.

The women were ready for a two-mile group walk around Montgomery’s historically Black Centennial Hill neighborhood. But Campbell wanted to give them a quick tour of the building first.
For most, it was their first time inside the new Montgomery outpost of GirlTrek, a national organization dedicated to improving the health of Black women. A veteran of the nonprofit group’s Chicago chapter, Campbell moved south three months ago to open the new office in Montgomery.
GirlTrek chose its location deliberately. The Bricklayers Hall was the nerve center of the 1955-1956 Montgomery bus boycott, which successfully desegregated the city’s public buses and became a model of nonviolent protest. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other boycott leaders strategized inside the hall, where King also kept an office.
That office is now Campbell’s office. GirlTrek’s walking teams are designed to empower Black women to improve their health, but also to encourage civil rights-inspired activism to tackle broader health disparities.
This year marks the milestone anniversaries of several civil rights victories: the 70th anniversary of the bus boycott, the 60th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.

But 2025 also marks the 60th anniversary of Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes.
The creation of Medicaid isn’t typically considered a civil rights victory. But the idea of health care as a human right was very much a part of the Civil Rights Movement, as was the belief that universal coverage could help dismantle racial inequities in health care.
“The connection between Medicare, Medicaid and the Civil Rights Movement was there from the beginning,” said Zachary Schulz, a history lecturer at Auburn University who specializes in public health history and policy. “Desegregation is often discussed in education, but there could be an argument made that it began in health care.”
Many of the Alabama communities that were home to the fiercest civil rights battles of the 20th century still grapple with systemic neglect that’s resulted in poor health outcomes, high uninsured rates and a shortage of medical providers.
In the neighborhoods around the Alabama Capitol, where nearly 50,000 people gathered in March of 1965 to meet the Selma-to-Montgomery marchers and push for voting rights, nearly a quarter of residents don’t have health insurance, according to the latest U.S. census data, for 2023. Around the Bricklayers Hall, the median household income is about $23,615, less than half of what it is statewide.
The neighborhood’s closest hospital filed for bankruptcy in February.
Statewide, 12% of Black residents under age 65 are uninsured, compared with 8.2% of white people and 10.3% for all races, according to the census.










Desegregation is often discussed in education, but there could be an argument made that it began in health care. 


– Zachary Schulz, Auburn University history lecturer


Just as civil rights activists marched for voting rights and an end to segregation, the next generation of organizers is demanding something they see as no less essential: the right to accessible, affordable health care in a system that continues to deny it.
The women in the Saturday morning walking group come from different neighborhoods across the city. Most said they have health insurance. But everybody knows somebody who’s struggled to get the health care they need.
Campbell believes unjust policies harm the health of Black women everywhere — and wants to encourage them to continue pushing for change.
One policy change that has long been the focus of rallies, committee hearings and advocacy across the state: Alabama’s refusal to expand Medicaid to more adults under the Affordable Care Act, despite evidence that the state’s health care system is failing huge swaths of Alabamians. Alabama consistently ranks at or near the bottom in health measures, including high rates of heart disease, obesity and maternal deaths.
“We’re trying to save our own lives,” Campbell said. “We’re here in the footsteps of the Civil Rights Movement where, when they walked, things changed.”

‘The most shocking and the most inhuman’

Black medical leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, such as Dr. W. Montague Cobb, advocated for the passage of Medicaid and Medicare. Others, including King, spoke of health care as a moral imperative. “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman,” he reportedly said in a 1966 speech to health care workers.

When Medicaid and Medicare launched that year, many Southern hospitals were still segregated. The feds sent teams to thousands of hospitals over the next few years to make sure they were following federal law before they could receive federal Medicare and Medicaid funding.
“Southern states were especially resistant back then to participation because it required compliance with federal regulations, including civil rights laws,” said Schulz, of Auburn University. Alabama didn’t launch its Medicaid program until 1970.
Some see echoes in today’s debate over Medicaid expansion.
Under the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010, states can extend Medicaid coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — currently about $21,000 a year for a single person. The feds currently cover 90% of the costs for those newly eligible enrollees.
Congressional Republicans are now considering whether to reduce the amount the federal government kicks in. But even at the 90% rate, 10 states — most of them in the South — have refused to take the deal. Many Republicans in those states say extending coverage to working-age adults would take away resources from people in greater need.

“Yet again, as in the ’60s, Southern states, including Alabama, were slow or resistant to expansion,” said Schulz. “The parallels are there: States’ rights versus federal mandates are very much the bottom line.”

‘Connect and keep moving’

Less than three miles from the Bricklayers Hall, Valtoria Jackson pastors the St. Peter African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her flock is a small but active Black congregation whose mission work often centers on health issues. Situated in a lower-income Montgomery neighborhood that’s recently seen signs of gentrifying, the church has sponsored a community garden, fitness classes and a fund to help neighbors pay their medical bills.
Jackson has also been a nurse for 41 years, most of them in Montgomery, and reckons she’s worked at every hospital in the city.
“I see myself as a connector,” she said. “I don’t like being in front. I just connect and keep moving.”
On a recent weekday morning she was in her car, delivering boxes of food to older people as part of a nutrition program funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She’s also a familiar face in Montgomery’s advocacy circles. She’s spoken at rallies on the steps of the state Capitol, protesting with organizations such as the Poor People’s Campaign against poverty and for universal health care and Medicaid expansion.
“There’s no reason we shouldn’t have Medicaid expansion here in the South,” Jackson said.

Alabama’s skeletal Medicaid program does not cover able-bodied adults without children. Its income eligibility limit for parents — 18% of the federal poverty line — is among the lowest in the nation. A single parent with one child, for example, is ineligible if she makes more than $3,816 per year.
Some of Jackson’s parishioners work low-wage jobs and fall into the so-called coverage gap, earning too much to qualify for Alabama Medicaid, but not enough to afford private health insurance.
About 161,000 uninsured adults in Alabama would gain coverage if the state expanded Medicaid, according to a KFF analysis of federal data. More than half are people of color, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.

‘Good Sam’

In 1965, Lula Edwards was a 35-year-old nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital in Selma, Alabama. The hospital, known in the community as “Good Sam,” was the only medical center in six counties that was open to Black people.
On March 7, 1965, its hallways filled with the bleeding and injured after Alabama state troopers attacked civil rights marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what would become known as Bloody Sunday. Edwards was supposed to be off work that day, but was called in to care for the wounded.
Outside of her hospital work, she kept her Montgomery home open to people who needed treatment. For Edwards, community-based care was a human right.
“She treated people in her own home when she wasn’t at the hospital, giving people their shots, giving stitches, giving medicine,” said her grandson, Robert Stewart. “She was right there in the neighborhood and treated them for free.”
Stewart was determined to continue her legacy and that of his other grandparents, who marched in Selma during the Civil Rights Movement and helped register people to vote.

Edwards died in 2022 at age 92, a day after Stewart announced he was running for a seat in the Alabama state Senate. At her funeral, he said, mourners came up to him with campaign donations in her honor.
“My grandmother always told me I would be in politics,” he said. Stewart won his election a few months later. The Selma native now represents an eight-county district in central Alabama that has some of the poorest health outcomes in the state.
As a Democrat in a state with a Republican supermajority, his calls for Medicaid expansion go largely ignored. But he’s proud the legislature expanded Alabama’s postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to a year in 2023 and eliminated Medicaid application delays for pregnant women earlier this year — significant steps for a state where Medicaid covers about half of all births.
But it’s still not enough.
“I represent eight counties, yet only two of them have pediatricians,” he said. “I have people in my district who have opted to stay out of the workforce so they can qualify for Medicaid because that’s the only way they can afford their insulin or their blood pressure medication.”
Two hospitals closed in Alabama just last year, including one in his district. Four Alabama hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units since 2023. The Alabama Hospital Association has long advocated for Medicaid expansion as a way to help financially struggling hospitals, particularly in rural areas.
Stewart and other Democrats have adapted their calls for Medicaid expansion to include the ways it could fit into Republican priorities, such as benefiting the state’s workforce.
“Expanding Medicaid needs to be a number one priority if we’re going to be serious about improving workforce participation as well as improving the overall health of Alabamians,” he said.
In recent years, conservative lawmakers in holdout states such as Alabama and Mississippi have signaled interest in expanding Medicaid. But after President Donald Trump’s reelection put federal Medicaid cuts on the table, expansion seems further away than ever.
Earlier this year, Alabama’s Republican House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter said expansion was no longer a priority this legislative session because Medicaid could see changes at the federal level.
“We are better off seeing what they are going to do,” he told reporters.

Sacred ground

The front office at the Bricklayers Hall is sparsely furnished. There’s a metal desk, a small filing cabinet, a tripod with a ring light for filming social media videos. Bulletin boards lean against the wall, waiting to be hung.
In the corner, a big blue sign: “Black women, you are welcome here.”
As Campbell shows the women around the space, she tells them the office once belonged to King.
“It’s like we’re walking on sacred ground,” someone says quietly.
In a back room, posters and protest signs decorate the wall:
“When Black women walk, things change”
“We walk for healthier bodies, families & communities”
Mary Mixon, 73, is retired from the Air Force and already walks up to five miles each day. But she comes to the Saturday morning GirlTrek walks, she says, “for the joy.”
She moved to Montgomery decades ago when she was assigned to nearby Maxwell Air Force Base.

“I was literally afraid to come because I’m from the Midwest, and I’d heard of so many ugly things here,” she recalled. “But as the time went on, I learned that injustice — yes, it does happen. But initiatives happen also. You can take the injustice and turn it around to justice.”
After Campbell passed out GirlTrek T-shirts to everyone, the group began its two-mile walk.
They set a speedy pace but waited at red lights for one another — no woman left behind. They chatted about kids and jobs. Some listened to music.
Their walk took them through the same neighborhood streets where, 60 years ago, Black Montgomery residents marched for justice and equal treatment.
But their route didn’t pass the Alabama State House, where lawmakers are winding down another legislative session without expanding Medicaid.

There is no denying that anymore. According to the latest data, nearly one in five adolescents in North Carolina suffered from depression and one in ten of our high school students reported attempting suicide. 
There has been a drastic increase in rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation amongst our youth in recent years and we know that what happens at school is contributing to those issues through peer pressure and bullying. That’s why schools have to be part of the solution. 
Schools are places of learning and connection. Schools are where young people spend the most important hours of their day and where some of their most formative moments will occur. Schools have a huge impact on their health and wellbeing. And that impact should be positive. 
But today there is a gap between the needs of our young people and the services available. In 2024, there were 1,928 students for each school psychologist in North Carolina — nearly four times the ratio recommended by the National Association of School Psychologists. For school social workers, the ratio was also nearly four times higher than what is recommended. 
That’s a challenge that we should address. We know that school personnel provide much needed support for students with developmental and social-emotional needs. They monitor progress, they develop prevention and intervention plans, and they help students who are in need or who are at risk of dropping out. They’re on the frontlines and they are often the first responders of our youth mental health crisis. And they need our support.
That was a focus of the 2025 North Carolina Child Health Report Card recently released by NC Child and the North Carolina Institute of Medicine. 
The report card included a special section on school-based mental health including access to support staff, referral services, the connection between physical activity and mental health, and the impact of social media on mental health. And we can learn so much from this report. 
We should address the causes of the youth mental health crisis (from new technology to social pressures) and we should also provide support to young people who are dealing with these issues. We are encouraged by efforts to increase pay for providers, develop the mental health workforce, and improve the state’s crisis system. And that more people are paying attention. 
The Whole Child NC Advisory Committee at the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction recommends improving access to school-based health services as a statewide priority. 
East Carolina University has a Healthier Lives at School and Beyond program utilizing telemedicine to reduce barriers to services in rural areas. There’s also the Carolina School-Based Telehealth Learning Collaborative, comprised of health care providers across the state that implement both physical and mental virtual health services in our schools. 
Several of our partners are raising awareness about the importance of school-based mental health services through the EarlyWell Initiative, Essentials for Childhood, and CaroNova’s NC Youth Mental Health Action Plan. And we will continue to as well. We know that what happens at school can affect mental health and we need the resources to make that a positive outcome. 
About the North Carolina Child Health Report Card: 
At the North Carolina Institute of Medicine and NC Child, we are dedicated to ensuring that communities and policymakers have the best information on the issues facing our children. For nearly three decades we have partnered together to publish a Child Health Report Card. 
The biannual report card provides a snapshot of the health and well-being our state’s children, and sheds light on the successes and challenges facing our youngest generations. 
This year the results were mixed. North Carolina received an “A” for insurance coverage and a “B” for maternal health and support. But we also received poor grades for oral health, healthy eating and active living, and education outcomes, and a failing grade for youth mental health. 
That’s why we are speaking out about the severity of the youth mental health crisis and the opportunity we have to make a difference. Our hope is that the report card will inform leaders and policymakers across the state. The report card tells us what’s working and where we need to improve so that every child can reach their full potential. And that’s our goal.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/istock_SeventyFour.jpg,,,2025-05-07 13:13:58.485527

Chris Murphy (D-CT) wants to ban presidents and members of Congress from selling meme coins.
He and U.S. Representative Sam Liccardo (D-CA-16) on the House side have introduced the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act.
A meme coin is a form of cryptocurrency inspired by internet phenomena, often called memes. Meme coins have been around for about a decade, and usually have a very low monetary value.
President Donald Trump (R) started selling one just before he took office. Since then, its sellers have made more than $100,000 off the product. CIC Digital, a Trump Organization affiliate, is one of the companies that receives trading revenue from the coin.
The coin’s top 220 buyers get to attend a dinner with the president later this month.
Murphy called it “the most unethical thing a U.S. president has ever done.”
“It’s essentially a way for any corporate CEO, any Saudi prince, any foreign oligarch who has business before the Trump administration, to send Trump money privately, secretly, and then whisper to the Trump administration about how much money they’ve sent and the favor that they need,” Murphy said.
During an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press last weekend, Trump said he “hadn’t even looked” at how much he made off the coin.
At first, he denied that he was profiting off the venture. Then, facing pushback from interviewer Kristen Welker, Trump said he was.
“If I have stock in something and I’m doing a good job and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting,” Trump said, before changing the topic to insider stock trading in Congress.

In March that rose to 56%, according to court records (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).One year after a federal judge ruled Missourians were being illegally denied food aid by the state, the Department of Social Services has made “no progress” in addressing the problem, the judge wrote in a scathing order this week.
“The excessive call wait times and denials based on the failure to provide a reasonable opportunity to interview persist and in some respects have deteriorated,” wrote U.S. District Court Judge M. Douglas Harpool in an order late Tuesday afternoon, referring to the call wait times for participants to receive required interviews to enroll in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “The current efforts do not fulfill (the state’s) responsibilities under federal law.”
Because of this inaction, Harpool wrote, Missourians who are eligible for food assistance continue “to endure wholly unacceptable bureaucratic telephone wait times and benefit denials solely because of the inadequacy of the system.” 
Missourians living in poverty “have gone hungry,” the judge wrote, because of the state’s deficiencies administering the program. 
‘Broken system’: Call center backlogs impede Missouri families seeking food assistance

Last May, roughly 51% of applications for SNAP were denied due to failure to complete an interview. In March that rose to 56%, according to court records.
The average wait time for the general call line was just over one hour in March and was 49 minutes for the line specific to SNAP interviews.
Thousands of callers are still automatically disconnected before getting through to a human being: over 50,000 calls were automatically ended for the SNAP interview call line in March and nearly 16,000 for the general call line.
Missouri has been aware of the issues for years and was ordered into compliance ”yet no significant improvement in the administration of SNAP has occurred,” Harpool wrote.
A spokesperson for Missouri’s social services agency said it is “in the process of reviewing the court’s order,” but declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.
In 2022, a lawsuit arguing the state’s “dysfunctional” call center deprives eligible Missourians of SNAP benefits, more commonly known as food stamps, was filed by New York-based National Center for Law and Economic Justice, Legal Services of Eastern Missouri and Stinson LLP, on behalf of low-income Missourians and the advocacy group Empower Missouri.
Plaintiffs described subsisting on little food while using up prepaid phone minutes waiting on hold for an interview. Some with a disability said they struggled to understand the application forms but being unable to get through the call center for help.
An interview is required to sign up for or recertify SNAP benefits.
Without interviews, SNAP applications and renewals are automatically denied after 30 days — even if applicants have tried and been unable to get through.
Harpool last year found that the state’s practices — including long call center wait times and a lack of accommodations for those with disabilities — violate the laws governing the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Americans with Disabilities Act. He ordered the state to submit data regularly for the court to monitor compliance, and laid out steps to come into compliance. 
The groups suing the state entered mediation with the department, but earlier this year told the court settlement negotiations had “irretrievably broken down,” according to the order.
While the plaintiff advocacy groups laid out specific policy proposals during negotiations, the state’s proposal “is fairly described as ‘trust us we are doing the best that we can with currently available resources,’” Harpool wrote.
The federal government pays 100% of the cost of SNAP benefits, and the state pays half of the administrative costs. 
Missouri “has failed to identify a single program change or resource reallocation” made to address the issues raised in last year’s order, Harpool wrote. 
The data the state has submitted monthly over the last year has not shown improvement.
On Tuesday, Harpool laid out benchmarks and steps for the state to take, including creating an Americans with Disabilities Act policy within 60 days.
The state must take whatever steps necessary, so that 90% of callers wait no longer than 20 minutes. 
“This wait time is far more flexible than the goal private call centers have, according to [the state’s] own briefing, of answering 80% of calls within 2 minutes,” Harpool wrote.
The state also must ensure no more than 20% of applications are denied for failure to interview. 
Missouri must make “substantial progress” toward these benchmarks within six months, according to the court order. If not, the court “will consider more specific and extensive remedial changes in the administration of the SNAP program.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Just one day after Gov. Mike Braun signed the state’s next two-year budget into law, the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a lawsuit to halt a provision slipped last-minute into the must-pass legislation last month. 
The Wednesday filing urges the Monroe County Circuit Court to rule on a budget provision giving the governor full control over Indiana University’s board of trustees — and that went into effect Tuesday with Braun’s signature. Previously, three members of the nine-person committee were elected by IU alumni and the governor appointed the others. 
  Gov. Mike Braun answers reporter questions after an event to celebrate his first 100 days in office held Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“The new provisions violate the prohibition on special legislation contained in the Indiana Constitution,” said Ken Falk, the ACLU’s Indiana legal director, in a statement. “Every other four-year public university in the state has a process for allowing alumni to select at least some members of the board of trustees, and there is no justification for denying that ability to the alumni of IU.”
The target on IU, and not other higher education institutions, makes those sections of the newly enacted budget “special legislation,” the lawsuit alleged.
At Purdue University, three of the 10 board of trustees members are similarly elected by the school’s alumni association. Both Ball State University and Indiana State University have an alumni council that nominates two members for its nine-member board. 
At the University of Southern Indiana, all nine members are appointed by the governor, though three are selected from a pool of screened applicants provided by the schools’ alumni association. 
In contrast, the governor controls the entire membership of Ivy Tech Community College and Vincennes University — both of which are two-year institutions. 
Trustees traditionally approve budgets, set tuition rates and oversee new academic programs alongside campus projects. 
 More on the lawsuit

The ACLU filed the suit on behalf of Justin Vasel, a Bloomington resident and IU alumnus. Vasel was a candidate for the IU board election scheduled to begin in June, along with five other alumni. 
“When I decided to run for IU Trustee, I committed to defending the university’s interests and alumni representation. I never imagined my first act would be to defend the very existence of the position itself,” Vasel said in a statement. “Thousands of alumni are preparing to cast their votes in this election, as they have done for over 130 years. Their voices deserve to be heard and respected, not silenced through legislative maneuvering that our state constitution was designed to prevent.”

Previously, members served three-year terms with the exception of the student appointee, who served a two-year term. The student term is now one year. And Braun has the power to replace the three members chosen by alumni mid-term — though he previously said he’d keep current board members because their terms are up soon. 
Braun also criticized previous elections for low voter turnout, saying that only 1.7% of alumni participated. 
But some alumni criticized how lawmakers introduced the provision in the final version of the budget after public hearings had concluded, meaning they had no opportunity to provide input. 
Wednesday’s ACLU filing concluded by urging the court to issue a preliminary injunction and declare the relevant portions unconstitutional.

(Photo courtesy of the Nate Willems campaign)Nate Willems, a lawyer and former state representative, announced Wednesday he is running for Iowa attorney general.
Willems, a Mount Vernon Democrat, is competing for the statewide elected position currently held by Attorney General Brenna Bird. She was first elected to office in 2022, when she defeated longtime Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller.
Willems may not be competing against Bird in the 2026 general election. Bird is considering a run for governor following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she will not seek reelection. Though Willems may be competing for an open position, he said he wants to change the trajectory of how the state office is utilized, alluding to Bird’s commitment to filing legal challenges against policies from former President Joe Biden’s administration.
“Iowans deserve an attorney general focused on protecting Iowans and standing up for our fundamental rights and freedoms,” Willems said in a statement. “As attorney general, I’ll work to keep communities safe by holding violent criminals accountable and I’ll take on corporations who try to rip off Iowans by price gouging or stealing their hard-earned wages.”
If elected attorney general, Willems said he would use the office to investigate and prosecute corporations that break labor laws, as well as improving the state’s consumer protections through the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division. He also said he would work with prosecutors and local law enforcement to “secure convictions for violent crimes.”
Willems said has a background in this field, having worked as a lawyer focused on labor cases as an attorney and partner for Rush & Nicholson, P.L.C., in Cedar Rapids, a workers’ compensation firm. He has also previously held office in Iowa, representing then-House District 29 for two terms, from 2008 to 2012.
“I’ve spent my career representing tens of thousands of Iowans who have had crimes committed against them,” Willems said. “I’ve successfully taken on corporations who think they’re above the law and steal wages, require off-the-clock-work, hurt their employees, or violate the rights of working men and women in our state. As attorney general, I’ll fight to make sure every Iowan gets the justice they deserve.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nate-Willems-Headshot-scaled-e1746637066410-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-07 13:13:58.485527

The Florida Legislature passed a bill at the 11th hour of its regular session that could shutter low-performing nursing schools in an attempt to improve the state’s standing on the national nursing exam.
Before the legislative session started, lawmakers sought answers from nursing school administrators about why Florida has the worst passing rate on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX).
A proposal creating harsher penalties for nursing programs seemed unlikely to pass until the House inserted it into another bill before the clock struck midnight on May 2, the deadline to take up policy bills.
  The Florida Center for Nursing based at the University of South Florida included this chart in its annual report showing the state’s pass rate for the national licensure exam for registered nurses compared to the national rate.
If DeSantis signs HB 1427, nursing schools with passage rates 10 percentage points below the national average would end up on probation, and they would have two years to improve the scores before getting shut down.
Although Florida’s NCLEX passing rates are the highest they’ve been in a decade, the 2024 rates for registered nurses and practical nurses to get their licenses (84.9% and 80.78%, respectively) are well under the national average, which was 91.16% for RNs and 88.38% for PNs, according to the annual report from the Florida Center for Nursing.
“Members, this is a great bill that will set us up to allow for nursing education to be the number one in the state of Florida, whereas now, we are number 50,” said Palm City Republican Rep. Toby Overdorf on the House floor Friday. “This is where we need to be working hard and getting to that new level of nursing.”
The Florida Board of Nursing placed 16 programs on probation in 2024, nine of which were for-profit private institutions, according to the Florida Department of Health. The board terminated four programs last year.
Additionally, nursing program directors who fail to submit annual reports by Nov. 1 detailing their number of applicants, retention rates, accreditation status, and scores for a newly required exit exam could face disciplinary actions, including revocation of their nursing license and fines up to $10,000.
“I’m worried that we’re gonna be negatively impacting people from applying to be nursing directors here in the state,” said Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman. Five senators voted against the bill, with Sarasota Republican Sen. Joe Gruters joining Democrats.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Disability Rights Center-NH launched “The Disability Facility Hub” Wednesday in an effort to increase transparency around quality of care for people with disabilities and provide easy-to-understand information about New Hampshire’s care system.
“Since the closure of the Laconia State School, New Hampshire has been recognized as a leader in ending institutionalization for people with disabilities,” the organization’s executive director, Stephanie Patrick, said in a press release announcing the portal. “However, the reality is that many of today’s congregate care settings still have institutional-like conditions where people with disabilities face abuse, neglect, exploitation, and isolation. The Disability Facility Hub is a step toward accountability and empowerment.”
The hub provides basic information about each facility — who it serves, its capacity, where it’s located, photos, and its parent company — operating in New Hampshire, but it also offers details that had previously been harder to access. It includes any police reports associated with that facility, the rights residents have specific to each facility, and the facility’s licensing information. The hub also allows people who live in, work at, or have a loved one in one of these facilities to report incidents. There are 71 facilities currently listed in the hub.
The Disability Rights Center said this information had been too difficult to access for too long. They hope the hub will allow people and families with disabilities to make more informed choices and will be used as a tool by lawmakers as they regulate, manage, and oversee the state’s care system.

After a judge entered a temporary restraining order blocking Homeland Security from detaining or deporting the plaintiffs, attorneys for the students identified the four to Homeland Security for the purpose of complying with the court’s order.
Earlier this week, the judge ruled that in order for the plaintiffs to proceed with their case they would have to publicly identify themselves as is customary with litigants in civil cases.
In newly filed court papers, the four students are now identified as:
— Sri Chaitanya Krishna Akondy, who is an Indian national, a master of public health graduate of the University of Iowa, and a practicing epidemiologist working for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services.
“My daily responsibilities include analyzing data related to substance use and overdose deaths using statistical methods, which helps in shaping public health responses and policies,” Akondy told the university’s news service in 2024. “My education at Iowa was vital in preparing me for my role in public health. The university enabled me to undertake internships across Iowa, including at Lakeside Lab in Okoboji, and Linn County Public Health in Cedar Rapids, providing a broad view of public health challenges and solutions within the state.”
Akondy’s only interaction with law enforcement is alleged to be an arrest for drunken driving that was later expunged from court records.
— Prasoon Kumar, who is an Indian national and resides in Iowa City, is a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying chemical engineering. He first came to the United States on an F-1 visa in 2021. The lawsuit alleges his only criminal history is a speeding ticket and a misdemeanor conviction for drunken driving.
— Songli Cai, who is a Chinese national and third-year undergraduate student living in Tiffin. His only interactions with law enforcement are alleged to be for speeding, driving without a valid driver’s license and a disorderly conduct conviction.
— Haoran Yang, who is a Chinese national living in Iowa City and is both a third-year undergraduate and pre-doctorate student at the university. The lawsuit indicates he has been convicted of first-offense drunken driving, and has two speeding citations, one failure-to-yield citation, and one citation for driving without a valid driver’s license.
Students await ruling on injunction
According to their lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa.
The lawsuit alleges that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database. The same day, the plaintiffs each received emails from the University of Iowa’s International Students and Scholars Services informing them of the cancellation and the fact that the university was not responsible for the action.
Four days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs’ visas were revoked without explanation. The three each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation,” and adding that “deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.”
Since beginning their studies, the lawsuit claims, the plaintiffs have maintained their status as students, are in good academic standing and have not committed any serious criminal offenses.
The lawsuit alleges that Homeland Security has initiated a national policy of “coercing international students into self-deportation by leveraging ambiguous student-status revocations, coupled with visa revocation notices and threatening language.” The students also allege that Homeland Security’s “lack of transparency and procedural safeguards created chaos within educational institutions and upended the lives of lawful F-1 visa holders.”
The lawsuit emphasizes that the plaintiffs are not challenging the revocation of their F-1 student visas but are instead challenging DHS’ termination of their student status to create a “pretext for future adverse immigration actions against them.”
The judge in the case has yet to rule on the students’ motion to convert the short-term temporary restraining order to a preliminary injunction that would be in force until the case is resolved.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is a federal program. (Getty Images)With a goal of cutting spending and promoting “self-sufficiency,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wants to overhaul the nation’s largest federal food assistance program by requiring states to pay a bigger share, starting with 5% more a year until states take on 50% of the costs.
That would shift billions of dollars in food stamps costs to states and likely lead to slashed benefits. And if a recession hits — a time when state revenues usually fall and the need for food stamps increases — hundreds of thousands of Americans would fall into poverty who otherwise wouldn’t be if states don’t increase their spending.
Lee’s home state of Utah could also be among the hardest hit states when it comes to loss of benefits per household.
That’s according to two analyses that unpack the impacts of Lee’s proposal, which he introduced in March as the SNAP Reform and Upward Mobility Act. The legislation comes as Republicans in Congress consider expanding work requirements and other eligibility restrictions on programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid.
A news release on Lee’s website described his proposal as “a bold piece of legislation aimed at strengthening work requirements” for SNAP and “closing loopholes that have contributed to its rapid expansion.” According to a two-page summary of the bill issued by Lee’s office, “the program has ballooned from 17.1 million food stamp recipients in 2000 to 41.1 million in 2022,” with a cost that’s risen from $17 billion to $119 billion in that same time period.
“SNAP was designed to provide temporary relief to vulnerable people facing difficult times, not a permanent subsidy for able-bodied adults,” Lee said in a prepared statement in that release. “Work requirements are widely supported by the American public, save taxpayer dollars, and will strengthen the program for families who really need it. Our legislation tackles fraud and abuse while promoting self-sufficiency, which should be the goal of all such programs.”
The bill has also been introduced in the U.S. House by Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Oklahoma, who accused federal government officials of “grossly” mismanaging SNAP by “loosening eligibility requirements, allowing more recipients to be totally exempt from work requirements, and overseeing massive fraud and abuse.”
“This has created a culture of dependency instead of opportunity,” Brecheen said.
But mandating that states cover even just a portion of SNAP benefits would shift “huge costs” to states, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an organization that was founded to analyze fiscal policies that impact low- and moderate-income Americans.
“Requiring states to pay even a modest portion of SNAP benefits would radically change the program’s funding structure, abandoning the long-standing national commitment to provide low-income households a SNAP benefit sufficient to afford a basic healthy diet, and undermining SNAP’s important role as an economic stimulus during recessions,” the analysis said. “This unfunded mandate would hit state budgets hard at a time when state finances are already highly strained. States could pass along some of the cost to counties and cities, either directly or indirectly.”
In Utah, $383 million in total SNAP benefits were issued in 2024, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In 2026, if the state were to be required to pay 5% of the costs, it would cost the state about $19 million. At 10%, Utah’s share would be roughly $38 million; 25% would be $95 million. At 50%, Utah would need to pay an estimated $190 million.
Between fiscal year 2026 and 2034, Utah could be looking at upwards of $907 million in costs — that is, if the state took on only 25% of the cost, according to the analysis. That number would be much bigger if states were required to take on 50% in that same time frame.
Another analysis by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit founded by former Democratic President Lyndon Johnson that focuses on social and economic policy research, contemplates how a SNAP state cost share policy, like the one Lee is proposing, would play out in a recession scenario.
In the first year of a recession — if states were required to take on just 10% of the costs — the Urban Institute estimates states would need to spend an additional $980 million to cover increased benefit costs.

However, if states don’t increase their spending during the recession and opt instead to cut benefits to control costs, “all SNAP participants — not just those who lost jobs — would face an average annual benefit reduction of $327 per household, and 862,000 people would fall into poverty who would otherwise be out of poverty if SNAP were fully funded,” according to the Urban Institute report.
It also estimated Utah (if it was required to pay for 10% of the costs but also opted to prevent SNAP costs from rising in a recession by implementing across-the-board benefit cuts) would see one of the biggest losses in average annual benefits per household relative to what would be received during a recession under current rules.
Utah would lose about $731 in average annual benefits per household under that scenario, the Urban Institute estimated. That’s compared to a national average of $327 per household lost annually, with annual benefit reductions ranging from $174 in Massachusetts to the highest loss of $776 in Wyoming.
That’s only contemplating a 10% requirement on states. If Lee’s proposal is implemented, that share would eventually be 50%.
Lee’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the impact analysis on Monday.
Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of the Urban Crossroads Center, a low-income advocacy group that provides food pantry services, criticized Lee’s proposal as “out of touch” during a time when families are already struggling to afford rent, utilities, transportation and food.
“Cutting federal funding in half for a program that helps thousands of Utah families to buy food shows how out of touch some people in D.C. can become,” Tibbitts said. “Do they not know how much inflation is already hurting Utah families? It makes you wonder when Mike Lee last visited a grocery store.”

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the government must transfer Öztürk to a detention facility in Vermont within a week. She’s currently being held in Louisiana. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal appeals court orders Trump administration to comply with Vermont judge’s ruling in Öztürk case.","A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered President Donald Trump’s administration to comply with a lower court’s ruling in Vermont last month to transfer Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish graduate student, to federal immigration custody in the state.The administration must move Öztürk from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana — where she’s largely been held since she was arrested by armed and masked federal agents in March — to a facility in Vermont within a week, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday.Last month, a federal judge in Vermont ordered Öztürk be transferred to the state. But the Trump administration appealed that ruling, and the transfer has been on pause since.The appeals judges’ decision came a day after they heard arguments from Öztürk’s legal team, and a top prosecutor for the Trump administration, on the case in a New York City courtroom.Öztürk is a graduate student at Tufts University. After her arrest near Tufts’ campus in Massachusetts earlier this year, ICE agents whisked her north and held her overnight at an agency field office in St. Albans. Early the following morning, she was flown to Louisiana out of Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport.Öztürk’s lawyers have challenged her arrest — which appears to have stemmed from an op-ed she co-wrote in Tufts’ student newspaper criticizing the university’s response to the war in Gaza — and are pushing for her release from custody.“No one should be arrested and locked up for their political views. Every day that Rümeysa Öztürk remains in detention is a day too long,” said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing the student, in a press release Wednesday. “We’re grateful the court refused the government’s attempt to keep her isolated from her community and her legal counsel as she pursues her case for release.”This story will be updated.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal appeals court orders Trump administration to comply with Vermont judge’s ruling in Öztürk case.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rumeysa-ozturk-7-20250414-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-07 12:12:58.582302

On my short trips to the grocery store or daily errands these empty buildings are impossible to miss, leaving me and many others to wonder why they lie dormant? 
 Especially with the current housing crisis and a rising number of unhoused people around the city of Hartford.


In the greater Hartford area, the vacancy rate for office space is currently above 22%. Twenty-two percent of office space is completely empty and this trend of rising vacancies doesn’t seem to be limited to Hartford or even the state of Connecticut itself. In the COVID-19 pandemic world, companies and tasks were shifted online and many workers continue to utilize their newly found ability and freedom to work remotely. 
Besides just office space, many other commercial buildings such as warehouses and factories sit vacant as well. 

Logan Mueller
With these spaces and buildings remaining empty, there must be some way to find a purpose beneficial to the community and greater Hartford area— and Connecticut legislators have identified this problem as well. Proposed Senate bill 703 addresses issues of converting commercial real estate. The bill, which is currently being discussed in the legislature’s 2025 session, aims to help convert these vacant properties into residential or mixed use properties by allowing and supporting developers to convert these buildings. This bill, as well as Senate bill  778 aimed at creating a tax credit for potential developments and conversions, and House bill 6121 aimed at requiring a 25% affordable housing quota, are also being proposed to further support SB 703.
 Approving legislation like this would create a large opportunity zone for developers and potentially provide city inhabitants with new economic opportunities and jobs in these conversions, but also new residences and areas for new commerce in mixed use developments. 
 These measures can be greatly beneficial, but only if done properly and with residents of Hartford in mind. 
 Many projects in other states allow developers too much free rein at times, leading to construction and conversion of these spaces into high end condos or apartments selling for a mint, which are not the most beneficial use of these spaces. 
In Baltimore, the city government incentivized developers to help with affordable housing projects around the city, which has now been exposed as contributing to the housing crisis and scandals involving corruption. It ended in disaster with very little affordable housing coming to fruition, and with the developers and government officials lining their pockets.  
Besides corruption and developers misusing funds, gentrification is also an ever-pressing problem amongst projects involving new or redevelopments in municipalities. Edge Hill, a suburb of Nashville, Tennessee, has seen redevelopment by way of gentrification which has displaced numerous residents, and resulted in pricing out many more when new, larger single family homes began taking over the neighborhood. 
For legislation like this to work, it must be equally beneficial to the municipalities and developers involved as well as the people who are in the most dire need for more affordable housing.
 To ensure these projects and the opportunities involved in the conversion of these commercial buildings into residential or mixed use properties remain beneficial, the legislature must offer strict guidelines for these properties. Whether these guidelines come in the form of having a certain number or percentage of low income units or rent controlled units, to ensure mixed use spaces create opportunities for local small business’ and workers to benefit— they most definitely have to include specific and detailed uses for these properties from the planning and development committee. 
These projects should target lower income housing and be monitored closely by city officials to ensure developers are not taking advantage of certain tax credits and the opportunity that these developments may present.
 Bills such as SB 703, paired in tandem with SB 778 and HB 6121 are a great opportunity to bring a new vibrant life and renovation to many empty crevices of the city of Hartford, but it must be done in the right way, with not just the wealthier developers and residents in mind.

The nation’s last unsettled race from the 2024 general election has been decided. North Carolina Supreme Court Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin has conceded to incumbent Democratic Justice Allison Riggs.
The Associated Press reported that Griffin provided a statement Wednesday morning indicating that he has decided not to appeal the ruling of U.S. District Court Judge Richard Myers II that Riggs must be certified as the winner.
“While I do not fully agree with the District Court’s analysis, I respect the court’s holding — just as I have respected every judicial tribunal that has heard this case,” Griffin said. “I will not appeal the court’s decision.”
Riggs defeated Griffin by the razor-thin margin of 734 votes out or more than 5 million cast — a figure that was confirmed in two recounts. But Griffin challenged the result in a series of administrative and judicial proceedings.
On Monday, Myers issued a 68-page ruling directing the state Board of Elections to certify Riggs as the winner and rejecting Griffin’s effort to have thousands of ballots thrown out as violative of the U.S. Constitution, writing:
“[T]his case concerns whether the federal Constitution permits a state to alter the rules of an election after the fact and apply those changes retroactively to only a select group of voters, and in so doing treat those voters differently than other similarly situated individuals. This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible.
“To this court, the answer to each of those questions is ‘no.”
Justice Riggs issued the following statement in response to the concession:
“After millions of dollars spent, more than 68,000 voters at risk of losing their votes, thousands of volunteers mobilized, hundreds of legal documents filed, and immeasurable damage done to our democracy, I’m glad the will of the voters was finally heard, six months and two days after Election Day. It’s been my honor to lead this fight – even though it should never have happened – and I’m in awe of the North Carolinians whose courage reminds us all that we can use our voices to hold accountable any politician who seeks to take power out of the hands of the people.”
The State Board of Elections was meeting Wednesday morning. Final certification of the election result will take place automatically at the end of the seven-day stay that Myers attached to his ruling in order to provide Griffin with an opportunity to appeal.

Republicans in Des Moines have heard your concerns about high prices, and they’re doing something about it.
Members of the Iowa House took the bold step recently of voting to eliminate the sales tax on toilet paper. This was such a high priority that Speaker Pat Grassley led the charge, along with nearly two dozen other members of the House GOP. The Senate and Gov. Kim Reynolds still must act before it becomes law, but judging by the non-partisan estimates, if all of them get on the same page, this will save every Iowan about $2.65 a year.
Go to town, Iowa. Buy a couple of candy bars.
To be fair, this isn’t the only item Republicans want to shelter from the state sales tax this session. They’re talking about adding laundry detergent, too.
In all seriousness, I can see why Republicans might be eager to look like they’re reducing the sales tax burden on Iowans. Public opinion polls say Americans are worried about high prices. Meanwhile, the tariffs President Trump is imposing have convinced people, correctly, that prices will go up even more.
Still, Republicans in Iowa have more to be concerned about than just what their party’s leader is doing to shrink American bank accounts.
They’ve created problems of their own.
Big shift in Iowa tax collections
Over the past few years, the Iowa GOP has slashed personal and corporate income taxes that, historically, have taken a bigger percentage out of the incomes of the rich, even as they have collected more and more sales and use taxes, which exact a higher toll on low- and middle-income Iowans.
Here’s a good illustration. The March report by the state Revenue Estimating Conference on general fund revenues predicted that in fiscal year 2026, 55% of total tax receipts, or $5.6 billion, will come from personal and corporate income taxes. Meanwhile, 44%, or $4.4 billion, will come from sales and use taxes. (These figures don’t include refunds, the vast majority of which are personal income tax refunds.)
That’s an extraordinary shift.
In 2019, almost 63% of total tax receipts came from personal and corporate income taxes, while nearly 34% of the total came from sales and use taxes, a 29-point difference. That gap fell to 24 points in 2023. In 2026, the REC says, it will shrink to about 11 points.

This is an easy trend to miss.
Republicans have made a big deal out of cutting income tax rates, and they get plenty of news coverage from it, too. Meanwhile, the state’s sales and use tax rates have remained the same. But don’t think the state isn’t collecting more money every year just because those tax rates stayed the same. It clearly is.
People are spending more money each year on goods and services, and they’re paying more sales tax as a result. In addition, the Legislature expanded the sales tax, beginning in 2019, to include digital goods, subscription services and other online sales.
This was no small tax increase. In fiscal year 2024, the state raised about $349 million from the tax on remote sales. Six years earlier, that number was zero.
Meanwhile, the money the state is raising from the income tax is steadily declining. Between fiscal years 2023 and 2026, Iowa will collect nearly $1 billion less from personal and corporate income taxes, according to the Revenue Estimating Conference. At the same time, the state will raise almost $500 million more from sales and use taxes, the REC estimates.
Again, the state is raising more money from the tax that hits low- and middle-income Iowans the hardest and less from the tax that traditionally has had a bigger impact on higher-income Iowans.
Think of it this way: The sales tax on the $50 spent for clothes or dinner at a restaurant takes a bigger chunk out of the income of someone making $30,000 a year than it does from someone who’s making $1 million. Last year, a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said the 20% of Iowa households with the lowest incomes in the state paid 6.6% of their family incomes on sales and excise taxes. The top 1% only paid 1.1%.
  (Source: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy)
This should not be a surprise. The same principle is at work with Trump’s tariffs.
The tariffs, which are a sort of sales tax, will hit low-income families harder than the wealthy.
A new study by ITEP said for households making less than $29,000 next year, Trump’s tariffs will impose an additional 6.2% tax on them, according to CNBC. Households making more than $915,000 a year will also see an increase, but it will be much smaller—only 1.7% of their incomes.
Meanwhile, those tariff revenues will undoubtedly backfill some—but certainly not all—of the revenue lost to the federal treasury by extending the Trump tax cuts, which favor the wealthy.
Hedging their bets
In Iowa, Republican lawmakers support their president. And they are working to permanently freeze the shift they’ve implemented in state tax collections. They’ve pressed forward with a proposed amendment to the Iowa Constitution that would require supermajorities in the state Legislature to raise the personal or corporate income tax. But not the sales tax. They purposely excluded this tax from their proposal.
Why?
I think it’s because they’re hedging their bets.
Iowa Republicans already see that their income tax cuts have yielded a $900 million deficit for fiscal year 2026. They have suggested they’ll use one-time reserve funds to close the deficit this year. But what about down the road? What happens if Iowa’s economy hits the skids? Or if lawmakers find they can’t squeeze public education budgets more than they have already? Or if the economy doesn’t grow as much as they promised and state reserves drain faster than expected?
If this constitutional amendment is approved by voters, it will be practically impossible to raise personal or corporate income taxes, even on the wealthy who have benefitted the most from the Republicans’ new flat income tax. Which may leave them no alternative but to raise sales and use taxes.
The trend here isn’t hard to figure out. The state of Iowa is relying more on the taxes that hit low- and middle-income Iowans the hardest, even as they lean less on the tax that has traditionally taken more money from the wealthy.
This is a big shift, and saving $2.65 on a year’s supply of toilet paper does nothing to change that fact.

(Photo courtesy of Antwan King)A federal judge in Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday, blocking a Trump administration executive order from effectively closing three federal agencies that support museums and libraries, promote labor peace and assist minority-owned businesses.
The agencies involved are the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Minority Business Development Agency and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. They were among the agencies that President Donald Trump listed in a March 14 executive order to be effectively shut down.
The order violates the federal Administrative Procedures Act “in the arbitrary and capricious way it was carried out,” wrote Judge John J. McConnell of the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island.
“It also disregards the fundamental constitutional role of each of the branches of our federal government; specifically, it ignores the unshakable principles that Congress makes the law and appropriates funds, and the Executive implements the law Congress enacted and spends the funds Congress appropriated,” McConnell wrote.
The lawsuit against the order was brought by 21 states, including Wisconsin, with attorneys general in Rhode Island, Hawaii and New York leading the litigation.
“Today’s preliminary injunction is a critical win for the public interest,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in a statement. “When the Trump Administration attempts to dismantle these agencies, it is making a targeted, concerted effort to prohibit everyday people from accessing their full potential.”
Trump’s order named seven agencies — including the three involved in Tuesday’s court ruling — and directed them to eliminate their “non-statutory components and functions . . . to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” It also directed them to “reduce the performance of their statutory function and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.”
McConnell wrote that the day after issuing the order, Trump signed a continuing appropriations bill “in which Congress funded IMLS, MBDA, and FMCS through Sept. 30, 2025 at the same level it funded these agencies in fiscal year 2024.”
Despite that, in the aftermath of the order, the three agencies “are rescinding or deferring appropriated funds and do not plan to spend them,” McConnell wrote.
The FMCS provides mediation in labor negotiations between employers and unions and was established under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. The IMLS, established in the 1990s, provides grants to museums and libraries while also providing research and policy analysis for museums, libraries and information services.
  Help for minority-owned business 

The MBDA, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, was launched in 1969 by President Richard Nixon and was given its present name 10 years later.
Duirng its lifetime “it’s gotten bipartisan support,” Henry Childs, who served as the agency’s national director from 2018 to 2020, the last three years of Trump’s first term, told the Wisconsin Examiner.
In 2021, the bipartisan infrastructure law enacted under President Joe Biden made the MBDA a permanent federal agency — the result of an amendment to the legislation promoted by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, with support from members of both parties. Baldwin went on to advocate for an MBDA center in Milwaukee, which was established in 2022.
After Trump returned to the White House this year, Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at his January confirmation hearing that he did not support dismantling MBDA.
Last month, however, Milwaukee’s MBDA center abruptly closed when the federal grant that supported the program was canceled.
Carolyn Mosby, interim president of the North Central Minority Supplier Development Council, a nonprofit that had the federal contract to operate the center, said she received notice April 17 of the grant’s cancellation. The Milwaukee center was one of more than 40 across the country that were closed, she said.
“The MBDA and other programs are not about exclusion, they’re about inclusion,” Mosby told the Wisconsin Examiner. “These initiatives were created to address long-standing, well-documented disparities when it comes to access to capital and contracts and opportunities that have disproportionately affected minority businesses across this country.”
Antwan King started his Milwaukee-based trucking business in 2020 with a simple cargo van. He graduated to a semi-trailer cab unit and found his niche hauling loads on flatbed trailers across the country — everything from pipes to wire coils to farm equipment and heavy construction machinery.
Along the way, he needed help at times, primarily with access to capital, advice on business planning and connections with large corporations that had programs to encourage minority-owned suppliers.
Through coaching at the Milwaukee MBDA center, he got guidance on funding sources for new equipment and learned how to pursue opportunities targeted to minority owned businesses.
“Those resources were extremely valuable,” King said. “I was kind of shocked to hear they were shutting down. There were some things I was still working on.”
Democrats on the Senate Commerce, Science & Transportation committee have written three times to the Department of Commerce demanding that Lutnick protect the agency from Trump’s order.
The third letter, sent April 30, quotes the closing notice that centers received stating they are “unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities and no longer serves the interests of the United States and the MBDA Program.” The termination notice also stated that “MBDA is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”
The letter demands an explanation of what types of funded activities would be “consistent with the agency’s priorities” and would serve its interests. It also demands a “detailed explanation” of how MBDA will repurpose its funding.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-07 15:18:52+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal agency reinstates CT State Library grant after pulling funds,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/07/ct-library-federal-funding-restored/,CT was one of only three states to lose its IMLS grant for libraries. The state library will now get those funds back and receive a new award.,"Connecticut was one of only three states to learn last month its federal grant for public libraries was terminated midyear. But this week, the federal agency overseeing those funds reversed the decision and reinstated the Connecticut State Library’s grant.
For almost two decades, the CT State Library has been a recipient of federal funding provided through the Institute of Museum and Library Services. That changed in early April when officials got notice that the $2.16 million grant for the fiscal year would end because it was “unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities and no longer serves the interests of the United States.”
Recipients disputed the grant termination through internal IMLS processes alongside efforts in federal court to block the dismantling of the agency. For the past five weeks, the library was operating without the remainder of its current funding, which they estimated amounted to about $800,000 or $900,000.
State Librarian Deborah Schander celebrated the reinstatement of the fiscal year 2024 funds. Much of the federal grant goes toward staff salaries. The State Library found out the news through an email on Monday evening and learned the following day it would get a new grant. But she did not get a reason for the change from IMLS or whether it was because of the internal challenge.
“We didn’t know if we’d receive a notice at all,” Schander said. “It was actually something of a surprise to receive it so quickly.”
“We were very fortunate we did not have to interrupt any services. We knew we’d be getting answers,” Schander said, adding that the library was “not placed in the position to stop work or stop services but always a possibility.”
Schander said they will be able to start drawing down the current grant now that the CT State Library got notice Tuesday that it will get a new award for fiscal year 2025. The funding can change from year to year, but is expected to be around the same range of $2 million.
The CT State Library was initially among the Connecticut libraries and museums facing funding cuts from the IMLS as part of a larger effort driven by the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to curtail government spending.
Schander noted that there is a long history of President Donald J. Trump proposing cuts to the agency that date back to his first term — and that Congress ultimately kept it alive.
She hopes that will be the case again as Congress sorts out government funding in the coming months.
“In some ways, this is not new. It’s a return to previous tactics,” Schander said. “There’s definitely concern about the long-term viability of IMLS and the funding. Those are conversations we’ll be needing to have here in Connecticut about funding.”
Trump signed an executive order in late March dramatically paring back that department and six others that he deemed “unnecessary.” That order is tied up in a lawsuit backed by a coalition of state attorneys general, including Connecticut’s William Tong. On Tuesday, a federal judge halted the executive order and granted a preliminary injunction in that case.
In a statement Wednesday, Tong called the numerous lawsuits he and other state attorneys general have filed over the past few months, including the one backing IMLS, “a firewall.”
Through IMLS’ Grants to States program, every state gets money allocated through a population-based formula. Connecticut, Washington and California were the only states to see funding cuts, though all three will see the current grants restored.
IMLS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about why Connecticut lost its funding and the reasoning for reinstating its grant.
Schander said the federal funding is tailored to states’ needs and gives them the ability to make local decisions. The grant supports 13 staff members in the Division of Library Development and provides resources to boost local libraries and build capacity. That program benefits about 5,500 patrons in Connecticut, including around 300 veterans.
Libraries or classrooms that want a large group of kids to read a book often get multiple copies from the Middletown Library Service Center. They also provide books for schools participating in the Battle of the Books reading competition and offer “bundles” for classrooms exploring topics such as Connecticut history or social-emotional learning, said Kymberlee Powe, the children and young adult consultant at the division.
The Middletown center trains librarians in new technologies and also operates the CT Library for Accessible Books. The center has technology and books available for people to check out if they are visually impaired or otherwise disabled and need an accessible device for “talking books,” or books read aloud.
By offering training for librarians, larger bundles of books, access to technology and reading guides for kids, the library center saves local Connecticut libraries millions of dollars each year, Dawn La Valle, director of the Division of Library Development for the state library system, said in an interview last month. The center provides software that allows kids to count books and pages read for their summer reading program.
“Cuts to the Connecticut State Library would have endangered summer reading, early literacy, and digital connectivity programs — a rash and reckless move,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement.
Two weeks ago, Blumenthal was one of three senators who wrote a letter to IMLS Acting Director Keith Sonderling asking for the immediate reinstatement of funds and an explanation by Tuesday about the agency’s decision. He commended the agency for restoring the funds, but said “our fight is far from over.”
The cuts have left many of the state’s libraries and museums in limbo. Some of these Connecticut institutions, like the Mark Twain House & Museum and the Lyman Allyn Art Museum, needed to lay off workers or consultants. Others remain in a holding pattern as they decide the future of some services and see if they can fill in the gaps.

At a time when pocketbooks are tight and inflation is rising, legislators should be giving money back to those who need it most — our state’s families. 
Expanding eligibility for the already successful state Child Tax Credit should be a top priority for our elected officials. 
The cost of raising kids is expensive, especially when inflation is high. Over the past year, inflation has impacted our grocery stores, with the food index rising by 3.2%. Fruit and vegetable prices rose by nearly 7%, compared to other foods like sugars and oils only rising by 3%. For families trying to keep their children’s bellies full and healthy, a 7% increase certainly takes a bite out of the budget.
In addition to food inflation, we are seeing elevated prices for utilities, housing and child care. 
Although the economic forecast looks cloudy long-term, the state still has a small surplus of $456 million for fiscal year 2026-2027. A portion of that money should be put right into the pockets of those doing the most important work of raising the next generation, by expanding the Child Tax Credit. It will pay dividends. Strong families contribute to a strong state.
Expanding the CTC has broad legislative and organizational support
The Child Tax Credit is a proven success. It has reached over 440,000 children in our state, with 84% of eligible households taking advantage of the program that was created during the 2023 Minnesota legislative session. Given our state’s population of just over 1.3 million children, that means the Child Tax Credit has benefited over one-third of our state’s children.
A single parent raising two kids and making $50,000 will receive about $1,400 through the Child Tax Credit.  For a married couple with four children making $65,000, they will receive about $3,750 from the Child Tax Credit. This is meaningful relief to working class families.
But many at the Capitol agree that we can and should do more. Members of both parties have put forward a variety of proposals to offer direct relief by expanding eligibility for the Child Tax Credit.
One vehicle that has widespread support is HF2339/SF2508. This bill proposes a modest 20% increase in the program’s ceiling, which would likely reach an additional 200,000 children — meaning about half of our state’s children would qualify for the Child Tax Credit. The House version has a growing list of 22 authors who fall on all sides of the political spectrum. The Senate version is at capacity with five authors who also bring a diverse set of viewpoints.
Not only is there broad support amongst legislators, but more than two dozen organizations back a variety of Child Tax Credit expansion bills, with HF 2339/SF2508 at the center of a letter being circulated to legislators. The signatories include organizations like the Minnesota Budget Project, the Minnesota Family Council, the Minnesota Nurses Association, Children’s Minnesota, the Joint Religious Legislative Coalition, and more. 
The widespread support enjoyed by the Child Tax Credit cuts across party lines and political viewpoints because it gives direct relief to those who are doing the most important work in our state — raising the next generation.
And instead of subsidizing child care or funneling the funds into a certain bucket, the state puts trust in families and allows them to use the money however they see fit.
The birth rate in Minnesota is the lowest it has been since its 2007 peak, and we have a fertility rate of just 1.75 births per woman — below replacement level. This will certainly impact our workforce long-term. It is in Minnesota’s interest to address this problem head-on by making Minnesota a hospitable place for families. Strengthening the Child Tax Credit will aid in this effort. 
The divided Legislature must work together and find compromises. Fortunately, expanding the Child Tax Credit is an area that has widespread support, so embracing an increase would not be a compromise, but rather a benefit for our state. 
We hope that the Legislature puts money where it’s needed most, into the hands of our families.

(Photo courtesy of Antwon King)A federal judge in Providence issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday, blocking a Trump administration executive order from effectively closing three federal agencies that support museums and libraries, promote labor peace and assist minority-owned businesses.
The agencies involved are the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) and the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). They were among the agencies that President Donald Trump listed in a March 14 executive order to be effectively shut down.
The order violates the federal Administrative Procedures Act “in the arbitrary and capricious way it was carried out,” wrote Judge John J. McConnell of the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island.
“It also disregards the fundamental constitutional role of each of the branches of our federal government; specifically, it ignores the unshakable principles that Congress makes the law and appropriates funds, and the Executive implements the law Congress enacted and spends the funds Congress appropriated,” McConnell wrote.
The lawsuit against the order was brought by 21 states, with attorneys general in Rhode Island, Hawaii and New York leading the litigation.
“Today’s preliminary injunction is a critical win for the public interest,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in a statement. “When the Trump Administration attempts to dismantle these agencies, it is making a targeted, concerted effort to prohibit everyday people from accessing their full potential.”
Trump’s order named seven agencies — including the three involved in Tuesday’s court ruling — and directed them to eliminate their “non-statutory components and functions . . . to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.” It also directed them to “reduce the performance of their statutory function and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.”
McConnell wrote that the day after issuing the order, Trump signed a continuing appropriations bill “in which Congress funded IMLS, MBDA, and FMCS through Sept. 30, 2025 at the same level it funded these agencies in fiscal year 2024.”
Despite that, in the aftermath of the order, the three agencies “are rescinding or deferring appropriated funds and do not plan to spend them,” McConnell wrote.
The FMCS provides mediation in labor negotiations between employers and unions and was established under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. The IMLS, established in the 1990s, provides grants to museums and libraries while also providing research and policy analysis for museums, libraries and information services.
 Help for minority-owned business

The MBDA, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, was launched in 1969 by President Richard Nixon and was given its present name 10 years later.
Over its lifetime “it’s gotten bipartisan support,” Henry Childs, who served as the agency’s national director from 2018 to 2020, the last three years of Trump’s first term, told the Wisconsin Examiner.
In 2021, the bipartisan infrastructure law enacted under President Joe Biden made the MBDA a permanent federal agency — the result of an amendment to the legislation promoted by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) with support from members of both parties. Baldwin went on to advocate for an MBDA center in Milwaukee, which was established in 2022.
After Trump returned to the White House this year, Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at his January confirmation hearing that he did not support dismantling MBDA.
Last month, however, Milwaukee’s MBDA center abruptly closed when the federal grant that supported the program was canceled.
Carolyn Mosby, interim president of the North Central Minority Supplier Development Council, a nonprofit that had the federal contract to operate the center, said she received notice April 17 of the grant’s cancellation. The Milwaukee center was one of more than 40 across the country that were closed, she said.
“The MBDA and other programs are not about exclusion, they’re about inclusion,” Mosby told the Wisconsin Examiner. “These initiatives were created to address long-standing, well-documented disparities when it comes to access to capital and contracts and opportunities that have disproportionately affected minority businesses across this country.”
Antwon King started his Milwaukee-based trucking business in 2020 with a simple cargo van. He graduated to a semi-trailer cab unit and found his niche hauling loads on flatbed trailers across the country — everything from pipes to wire coils to farm equipment and heavy construction machinery.

Along the way, he needed help at times, primarily with access to capital, advice on business planning and connections with large corporations that had programs to encourage minority-owned suppliers.
Through coaching at the Milwaukee MBDA center, he got guidance on funding sources for new equipment and learned how to pursue opportunities targeted to minority owned businesses.
“Those resources were extremely valuable,” King said. “I was kind of shocked to hear they were shutting down. There were some things I was still working on.”
Democrats on the Senate Commerce, Science & Transportation committee have written three times to the Department of Commerce demanding that Lutnick protect the agency from Trump’s order.
The third letter, sent April 30, quotes the closing notice that centers received stating they are “unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities and no longer serves the interests of the United States and the MBDA Program.” The termination notice also stated that “MBDA is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”
The letter demands an explanation of what types of funded activities would be “consistent with the agency’s priorities” and would serve its interests. It also demands a “detailed explanation” of how MBDA will repurpose its funding.

The park went online in 2019 and was built on top of a retired landfill at Burcham Park. | Kyle DavidsonMichigan has 24,000 known contaminated sites, a legacy of heavy manufacturing where industries carelessly discarded hazardous materials with minimal regulatory oversight. Taxpayers are often left to clean up these abandoned locations, known as brownfields, while the sheer volume of toxic sites has overwhelmed state regulators.
With a little effort, these spaces can be more than a permanent blight on the landscape. Kelly Thayer, senior policy advocate with the state’s Environmental Law & Policy Center, envisions a future where Michigan’s brownfields are transformed into sites for diverse solar energy projects.
The potential for new solar siting in Michigan aligns with growing nationwide support of the technology, according to a survey co-led by the University of Michigan. Among residents living within three miles of solar energy developments, positive opinions about the projects outnumbered negative ones by almost a 3-to-1 ratio.
For the study, a large-scale solar project was defined as a ground-mounted photovoltaic system that generates one megawatt or more of direct current. The majority of respondents lived near new greenfield solar sites—“disturbed” industrial locations or retiring coal plants were strongly preferred for solar development over forests or productive farmland.
Thayer, from Frankfort on the shores of Lake Michigan, said there is already precedent for solar on former industrial land in his home state. A 120-megawatt solar array on a long-vacant mining operation in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, for example, was met by residents with little controversy.
Yet, a Michigan Department of Natural Resources proposal to transition a former oil-and-gas plot in Gaylord to solar energy was met with substantial public backlash in January. Following resident protests against tree and grassland removal for the solar array, the agency extended the public comment period and halted state land leases for solar projects.
This limbo period gives Michigan a chance to readjust its solar siting approach, with an emphasis on distressed lands that would allow the technology to flourish, Thayer said.
“The work now is to chart the near-term future of how Michiganders get their energy,” said Thayer, whose advocacy group focuses on renewable energy and clean transportation solutions for the Midwest. “This can be talked about through the lens of climate or the environment, but the public health ramifications are enormous as well.”
 A Vital Asset

Last year, the state of Michigan won a $129 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for utility-scale renewable energy projects, including those on brownfields. These “orphan” industrial plots—landfills, auto plants and other properties left to molder by private industry—are vital assets for a state seeking to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, noted Thayer.
Michigan aims to be a national climate action leader, driven by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s 2050 carbon neutrality goals. Among the tenets of the MI Healthy Climate Plan is streamlining the siting process for wind, solar and battery storage projects. State legislation like Senate Bill 277, meanwhile, includes solar facilities as a permitted use for farmers under the Farmland and Open Space Preservation Act.
Thayer’s organization, the Environmental Law & Policy Center, also views retiring coal plants as potential solar energy hubs, considering that they are already connected to the energy grid. For instance, the organization helped develop a blueprint for the Dan E. Karn coal plant site, slated as the future home for an 85-megawatt solar energy site expected to be operational in 2026.
“These are flat, highly-disturbed sites that also have a substation in place that’s hard-wired to the grid,” Thayer said. “Having that infrastructure saves millions in development, and saves time because it takes four or five years to add new energy resources to the grid.”
Some Michigan clean energy projects are hindered by years-long grid connection delays as well as restrictive zoning ordinances that impede their development. In addition, Michigan lacks a comprehensive database of brownfields that detail key characteristics sought by solar developers, said Julie Lowe, brownfield coordinator for the remediation and redevelopment division of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE).
“Developers will have to use multiple resources to site projects on known sites of contamination,” said Lowe. “They need databases for tree canopy cover, or have to do site reconnaissance to eyeball the slope and see if it fits their needs.”
 An Array of Solar Options

EGLE does offer a list of guidelines for anyone asking to purchase a contaminated property for renewable energy development. Prospective buyers must conduct a two-phase Baseline Environmental Assessment before moving ahead with a project. Due diligence may encompass a deep dive into a site’s former use, as well as comprehensive testing of soil or groundwater samples.
“You may have to go back to the 19th century to determine what the property was used for,” Lowe said. “And there might be drilling or radar work needed to see if there’s something in the ground. For brownfields, we see solvents [in the soil] for dry cleaning or auto repair, because those were chemicals used in those activities.”
Various brownfield incentives and programs may subsidize environmental remediation or any additional assessment a site requires, added Lowe. EGLE’s Brownfield Tax Increment Financing utilizes the rise in tax revenue from a revitalized site to reimburse developers for the cleanup and demolition work that generated that increase.
That is not to say developers should always foot the bill, said Thayer. A series of “polluter pay” laws—which force parties responsible for contamination to pay for site cleanup and remediation costs—are currently being proposed by Michigan lawmakers. Thayer also advocates for virtual power plant programs, enabling utilities to pay homeowners with solar and battery storage to contribute stored power during peak demand.
Community solar, which involves installing arrays on vacant lots or working farmlands, can be another multi-billion-dollar boon for Michigan, said Thayer. According to a 2021 study by Michigan State University, community solar could deliver a nearly $1.5 billion boost to the state’s economy over the next 30 years.
For now, Michigan officials should prioritize cleaning up and advancing solar energy projects on the state’s innumerable polluted brownfields, said Sarah Mills, a University of Michigan researcher who directs the Center for EmPowering Communities at the Graham Sustainability Institute.
“I go to meetings about large renewables projects, and it’s mostly for farmland,” said Mills. “People will say, ‘Why here, why not a brownfield?’ From a community acceptance perspective, this is what most people consider a no-brainer.”

(Courtesy photos) The nation’s last unsettled race from the 2024 General Election has been decided. Republican North Carolina Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin has conceded to incumbent Democratic Justice Allison Riggs.
The Associated Press reported that Griffin provided a statement Wednesday morning indicating that he has decided not to appeal the ruling of U.S. District Court Judge Richard Myers II that Riggs must be certified as the winner. “While I do not fully agree with the District Court’s analysis, I respect the court’s holding — just as I have respected every judicial tribunal that has heard this case,” Griffin said. “I will not appeal the court’s decision.”
Riggs defeated Griffin by the razor-thin margin of 734 votes out or more than 5 million cast — a figure that was confirmed in two recounts, but Griffin challenged the result in a series of administrative and judicial proceedings.
On Monday, federal District Court Judge Richard Myers II issued a 68-page ruling directing the state Board of Elections to certify Riggs as the winner and rejecting Griffin’s effort to have thousands of ballots thrown out as violative of the U.S. Constitution, writing:
“[T]his case concerns whether the federal Constitution permits a state to alter the rules of an election after the fact and apply those changes retroactively to only a select group of voters, and in so doing treat those voters differently than other similarly situated individuals. This case is also about whether a state may redefine its class of eligible voters but offer no process to those who may have been misclassified as ineligible.
“To this court, the answer to each of those questions is ‘no.”
The State Board of Elections was meeting Wednesday morning and could certify the result shortly.

The ruling by Judge Eli Richardson came Wednesday after attorneys for Casada and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, claimed prejudicial evidence was introduced to the jury, after government lawyers played audio that should have been redacted.
The audio of Casada’s January 2021 interview with FBI agents included Casada saying House Speaker Cameron Sexton did not like Cothren and wouldn’t have approved the use of a political consulting firm formed by Casada and Cothren had he known Cothren was involved.
Arguments for a mistrial by the defense rested on the assumption that airing of the audio constituted testimony by Casada against his co-defendant.
In his ruling, Richardson said that while the tape should have been redacted, he was not convinced the unredacted portion of the interview was “powerfully incriminating.” The judge said he understood that Cothren could be “frustrated,” but he also questioned why the defense waited before asking for a mistrial and raised doubts about whether jury members had paid attention to the questionable section.
The trial is now in its third week and the prosecution is expected to rest its case by week’s end.

Susan Estes, a Wichita Republican on a bipartisan task force drafting a new funding formula for Kansas public schools,  makes a point during a meeting in which concern about the project timeline was raised and disputes on fundamental issues surfaced. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Legislature's YouTube channel) TOPEKA — Republican Sen. Renee Erickson wants the task force crafting a new state funding formula for K-12 public schools to be far enough along to present a draft in January to the Kansas Legislature, despite concern among some members the timeline was too aggressive.
The 2026 Legislature and the state’s next governor must come to agreement on financing education before expiration of the existing framework on June 30, 2027.
Stakes are high given previous Kansas Supreme Court decisions that funding formulas developed by lawmakers at the Capitol violated the state Constitution. A central issue in school-finance lawsuits has been whether spending on behalf of nearly 500,000 students in prekindergarten through 12th grade was constitutionally equitable and adequate.
Erickson, who chairs the bipartisan task force of legislators and educators, said her goal was to provide peers in the Legislature a glimpse of the funding strategy so the cycle of evaluation and revision could begin well before the final deadline.
“They’re going to have to start being familiar with what we are thinking. We need something in hand to vet,” Erickson said Tuesday during a task force meeting. “This is probably a process that we could spend five years really trying to get it just right.”
Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat on the task force, said the project was monumental and potentially the most important work of legislators’ careers.
She said issuing the report as the 2026 Legislature convened in January — 18 months before the new formula had to be implemented — was “awfully aggressive and potentially unreasonable.”
“I worry if we rush into this we’re going to make mistakes,” McDonald said. “I want to make sure our formula is constitutional. I want to make sure we don’t fall back into a pattern of having lawsuits and wasting taxpayer dollars.”
Task force member Frank Harwood, a deputy commissioner of the Kansas Department of Education and supervising administrator of more than $6 billion in state and federal funds devoted to Kansas schools, said delivering recommendations on a revised formula in eight months could be relatively easy or profoundly difficult.
“If you’re making small changes, we have plenty of time,” he said. “If you’re starting from scratch, we probably don’t have enough time.”
 
Reading a conflict
Rep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican appointed to the task force, started a conversation about reading instruction that illustrated that reaching consensus on fundamental ideas could be challenging.
She pointed to reports showing improvements in reading among the general student population also raised scores for special-education students in Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and other states.
“If we could just get our students to read, it looks like it’s going to impact everyone,” Williams said. “I just would love to see a formula that incentivizes outcomes so that we’re constantly moving in the right direction.”
Williams referenced the 2022 “Sold a Story” podcast that argued educators stuck with popular early-intervention literacy strategies despite research exposing flaws in methods that ignored the potential of phonics.
McDonald, the House Democrat, reminded the task force the 2025 Legislature approved a budget bill that didn’t deliver as promised an additional $10 million in funding to the Kansas Blueprint for Literacy. The literacy initiative was created last year by legislators to retool university instructional methods in reading and to retrain all elementary school teachers in the science of reading by 2030.
The blueprint’s goal was to have 90% of 3rd through 8th graders achieving at Level 2 on the state’s four-level assessment scale. An additional target was to have 50% of 3rd through 8th grade students reading at Level 3 or Level 4 on the assessment by 2033.
“A budget is a reflection of our priorities,” McDonald said. “We have missed that opportunity to amp up the number of teachers who are trained in the science of reading so we can close that gap.”
 
Don’t blame Legislature
Erickson, the task force chair, said it would be inaccurate to blame politicians for shortcomings in reading skills that were the responsibility of educators or parents.
“I’m going to be very adamant about that,” the former teacher said. “By no means am I going to allow the Legislature to be the convenient villain in this reading scenario. It just defies logic.”
Task force member Scott Hill, an Abilene Republican in the Kansas House, said it was shocking the state’s school districts didn’t take prompt action to improve reading instruction when it was clear students were struggling statewide.
“I find it bordering on immoral that people would understand, which we all do, that we’ve been teaching kids wrong for a long time. And, to not change that teaching direction on their own without supplemental money is abhorrent,” he said.
The state Department of Education has been using federal funding to train teachers working in state-accredited public and private elementary schools in the Kansas Science of Reading Professional Learning Course. The literacy initiative — separate from the Kansas Blueprint for Literacy — was a response to disruption in student learning tied to remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Harwood, the deputy commissioner with the Department of Education, urged the task force to appreciate the full historical context of reading theory in Kansas and to accept it was difficult to come up with a one-size-fits-all program for students of different abilities.
He said the “whole language” method pilloried by some task force members was useful to many students.
“The problem wasn’t that whole language was not successful. It just wasn’t successful with everybody and it left people behind. Now we know better,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Estes-education-task-force-1024x539.png,,,2025-05-07 11:07:04.936103

(Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Tara Campbell unlocked the front door of the Bricklayers Hall, a no-frills brick building on South Union Street in downtown Montgomery, half a mile from the white-domed Alabama Capitol.
She was dressed in leggings, a T-shirt and bright blue running shoes. It was 8 a.m. on a Saturday, and she exuded the bouncy enthusiasm of a Zumba instructor as she welcomed the handful of Black women who’d just arrived.
Like Campbell, they were dressed for a workout. Three of them wore superhero socks that boasted tiny capes, which earned some laughs.
The women were ready for a 2-mile group walk around Montgomery’s historically Black Centennial Hill neighborhood. But Campbell wanted to give them a quick tour of the building first.
For most, it was their first time inside the new Montgomery outpost of GirlTrek, a national organization dedicated to improving the health of Black women. A veteran of the nonprofit group’s Chicago chapter, Campbell moved south three months ago to open the new office in Montgomery.

GirlTrek chose its location deliberately. The Bricklayers Hall was the nerve center of the 1955-1956 Montgomery bus boycott, which successfully desegregated the city’s public buses and became a model of nonviolent protest. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other boycott leaders strategized inside the hall, where King also kept an office.
That office is now Campbell’s office. GirlTrek’s walking teams are designed to empower Black women to improve their health, but also to encourage civil rights-inspired activism to tackle broader health disparities.
This year marks the milestone anniversaries of several civil rights victories: the 70th anniversary of the bus boycott, the 60th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.

But 2025 also marks the 60th anniversary of Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes.
The creation of Medicaid isn’t typically considered a civil rights victory. But the idea of health care as a human right was very much a part of the Civil Rights Movement, as was the belief that universal coverage could help dismantle racial inequities in health care.
“The connection between Medicare, Medicaid and the Civil Rights Movement was there from the beginning,” said Zachary Schulz, a history lecturer at Auburn University who specializes in public health history and policy. “Desegregation is often discussed in education, but there could be an argument made that it began in health care.”
Many of the Alabama communities that were home to the fiercest civil rights battles of the 20th century still grapple with systemic neglect that’s resulted in poor health outcomes, high uninsured rates and a shortage of medical providers.
In the neighborhoods around the Alabama Capitol, where nearly 50,000 people gathered in March of 1965 to meet the Selma-to-Montgomery marchers and push for voting rights, nearly a quarter of residents don’t have health insurance, according to the latest U.S. census data, for 2023. Around the Bricklayers Hall, the median household income is about $23,615, less than half of what it is statewide.
The neighborhood’s closest hospital filed for bankruptcy in February.
Statewide, 12% of Black residents under age 65 are uninsured, compared with 8.2% of white people and 10.3% for all races, according to the census.

Just as civil rights activists marched for voting rights and an end to segregation, the next generation of organizers is demanding something they see as no less essential: the right to accessible, affordable health care in a system that continues to deny it.
The women in the Saturday morning walking group come from different neighborhoods across the city. Most said they have health insurance. But everybody knows somebody who’s struggled to get the health care they need.
Campbell believes unjust policies harm the health of Black women everywhere — and wants to encourage them to continue pushing for change.
One policy change that has long been the focus of rallies, committee hearings and advocacy across the state: Alabama’s refusal to expand Medicaid to more adults under the Affordable Care Act, despite evidence that the state’s health care system is failing huge swaths of Alabamians. Alabama consistently ranks at or near the bottom in health measures, including high rates of heart disease, obesity and maternal deaths.
“We’re trying to save our own lives,” Campbell said. “We’re here in the footsteps of the Civil Rights Movement where, when they walked, things changed.”
‘The most shocking and the most inhuman’
Black medical leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, such as Dr. W. Montague Cobb, advocated for the passage of Medicaid and Medicare. Others, including King, spoke of health care as a moral imperative. “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman,” he reportedly said in a 1966 speech to health care workers.

When Medicaid and Medicare launched that year, many Southern hospitals were still segregated. The feds sent teams to thousands of hospitals over the next few years to make sure they were following federal law before they could receive federal Medicare and Medicaid funding.
“Southern states were especially resistant back then to participation because it required compliance with federal regulations, including civil rights laws,” said Schulz, of Auburn University. Alabama didn’t launch its Medicaid program until 1970.
Some see echoes in today’s debate over Medicaid expansion.
Under the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010, states can extend Medicaid coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — currently about $21,000 a year for a single person. The feds currently cover 90% of the costs for those newly eligible enrollees.
Congressional Republicans are now considering whether to reduce the amount the federal government kicks in. But even at the 90% rate, 10 states — most of them in the South — have refused to take the deal. Many Republicans in those states say extending coverage to working-age adults would take away resources from people in greater need.

“Yet again, as in the ’60s, Southern states, including Alabama, were slow or resistant to expansion,” said Schulz. “The parallels are there: States’ rights versus federal mandates are very much the bottom line.”
‘Connect and keep moving’
Less than three miles from the Bricklayers Hall, Valtoria Jackson pastors the St. Peter African Methodist Episcopal Church. Her flock is a small but active Black congregation whose mission work often centers on health issues. Situated in a lower-income Montgomery neighborhood that’s recently seen signs of gentrifying, the church has sponsored a community garden, fitness classes and a fund to help neighbors pay their medical bills.
Jackson has also been a nurse for 41 years, most of them in Montgomery, and reckons she’s worked at every hospital in the city.
“I see myself as a connector,” she said. “I don’t like being in front. I just connect and keep moving.”
On a recent weekday morning she was in her car, delivering boxes of food to older people as part of a nutrition program funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She’s also a familiar face in Montgomery’s advocacy circles. She’s spoken at rallies on the steps of the state Capitol, protesting with organizations such as the Poor People’s Campaign against poverty and for universal health care and Medicaid expansion.
“There’s no reason we shouldn’t have Medicaid expansion here in the South,” Jackson said.

Alabama’s skeletal Medicaid program does not cover able-bodied adults without children. Its income eligibility limit for parents — 18% of the federal poverty line — is among the lowest in the nation. A single parent with one child, for example, is ineligible if she makes more than $3,816 per year.
Some of Jackson’s parishioners work low-wage jobs and fall into the so-called coverage gap, earning too much to qualify for Alabama Medicaid, but not enough to afford private health insurance.
About 161,000 uninsured adults in Alabama would gain coverage if the state expanded Medicaid, according to a KFF analysis of federal data. More than half are people of color, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.
‘Good Sam’
In 1965, Lula Edwards was a 35-year-old nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital in Selma, Alabama. The hospital, known in the community as “Good Sam,” was the only medical center in six counties that was open to Black people.
On March 7, 1965, its hallways filled with the bleeding and injured after Alabama state troopers attacked civil rights marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what would become known as Bloody Sunday. Edwards was supposed to be off work that day, but was called in to care for the wounded.
Outside of her hospital work, she kept her Montgomery home open to people who needed treatment. For Edwards, community-based care was a human right.
“She treated people in her own home when she wasn’t at the hospital, giving people their shots, giving stitches, giving medicine,” said her grandson, Robert Stewart. “She was right there in the neighborhood and treated them for free.”
Stewart was determined to continue her legacy and that of his other grandparents, who marched in Selma during the Civil Rights Movement and helped register people to vote.

Edwards died in 2022 at age 92, a day after Stewart announced he was running for a seat in the Alabama state Senate. At her funeral, he said, mourners came up to him with campaign donations in her honor.
“My grandmother always told me I would be in politics,” he said. Stewart won his election a few months later. The Selma native now represents an eight-county district in central Alabama that has some of the poorest health outcomes in the state.
As a Democrat in a state with a Republican supermajority, his calls for Medicaid expansion go largely ignored. But he’s proud the legislature expanded Alabama’s postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to a year in 2023 and eliminated Medicaid application delays for pregnant women earlier this year — significant steps for a state where Medicaid covers about half of all births.
But it’s still not enough.
“I represent eight counties, yet only two of them have pediatricians,” he said. “I have people in my district who have opted to stay out of the workforce so they can qualify for Medicaid because that’s the only way they can afford their insulin or their blood pressure medication.”
Two hospitals closed in Alabama just last year, including one in his district. Four Alabama hospitals have closed their labor and delivery units since 2023. The Alabama Hospital Association has long advocated for Medicaid expansion as a way to help financially struggling hospitals, particularly in rural areas.
Stewart and other Democrats have adapted their calls for Medicaid expansion to include the ways it could fit into Republican priorities, such as benefiting the state’s workforce.
“Expanding Medicaid needs to be a number one priority if we’re going to be serious about improving workforce participation as well as improving the overall health of Alabamians,” he said.
In recent years, conservative lawmakers in holdout states such as Alabama and Mississippi have signaled interest in expanding Medicaid. But after President Donald Trump’s reelection put federal Medicaid cuts on the table, expansion seems further away than ever.
Earlier this year, Alabama’s Republican House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter said expansion was no longer a priority this legislative session because Medicaid could see changes at the federal level.
“We are better off seeing what they are going to do,” he told reporters.

Sacred ground
The front office at the Bricklayers Hall is sparsely furnished. There’s a metal desk, a small filing cabinet, a tripod with a ring light for filming social media videos. Bulletin boards lean against the wall, waiting to be hung.
In the corner, a big blue sign: “Black women, you are welcome here.”
As Campbell shows the women around the space, she tells them the office once belonged to King.
“It’s like we’re walking on sacred ground,” someone says quietly.
In a back room, posters and protest signs decorate the wall:
“When Black women walk, things change”
“We walk for healthier bodies, families & communities”
Mary Mixon, 73, is retired from the Air Force and already walks up to five miles each day. But she comes to the Saturday morning GirlTrek walks, she says, “for the joy.”
She moved to Montgomery decades ago when she was assigned to nearby Maxwell Air Force Base.

“I was literally afraid to come because I’m from the Midwest, and I’d heard of so many ugly things here,” she recalled. “But as the time went on, I learned that injustice — yes, it does happen. But initiatives happen also. You can take the injustice and turn it around to justice.”
After Campbell passed out GirlTrek T-shirts to everyone, the group began its 2-mile walk.
They set a speedy pace but waited at red lights for one another — no woman left behind. They chatted about kids and jobs. Some listened to music.
Their walk took them through the same neighborhood streets where, 60 years ago, Black Montgomery residents marched for justice and equal treatment.
But their route didn’t pass the Alabama State House, where lawmakers are winding down another legislative session without expanding Medicaid.
