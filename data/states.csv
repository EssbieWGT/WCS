(Photo courtesy of Clallam 2 Fire-Rescue)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Sunday visited near the site of a tanker truck crash that spilled thousands of gallons of fuel into a tributary of the Elwha River near Port Angeles. 
His visit came two days after the fuel truck failed to negotiate a turn on Highway 101, veered off the road, and careened down an embankment before landing upside-down in Indian Creek, according to the Washington State Patrol. The creek feeds into the Elwha River.
The overturned tanker was removed from the creek early Saturday morning. Cleanup crews have deployed containment booms to limit the fuel’s flow and absorbent materials to mop it up.
Contamination from the spill disrupted water service to Port Angeles, a city of 20,000 residents, and killed an untold number of fish. 
Ferguson called the crash a “setback” to restoring the Elwha, which saw the landmark removal of two hydroelectric dams in the 2010s. 
“There has been so much work, so much effort, so much investment by so many folks here and many others to make this place the place that it is now, to work on bringing back salmon and to restore this really amazing, amazing habitat,” he said in a press conference along the banks of the river.

The water in the Port Angeles area is safe for bathing, flushing toilets and doing laundry, but shouldn’t be used for drinking, washing dishes and making ice until officials give the OK. The city was distributing free bottled water for drinking and cooking. 
Distribution sites were quickly met with long lines of residents, said Mayor Kate Dexter.
Preliminary testing showed no issues with the drinking water, according to state health officials. Additional results were expected later Sunday.
The PetroCard truck, with a capacity of 10,000 gallons, leaked an estimated 3,000 gallons of fuel into the creek, according to the state Department of Ecology. Most of that was gasoline, and the rest was diesel.
The Department of Ecology responded to the spill a few hours after it happened, sending personnel from the Olympia area, said Alison Meyers, an agency coordinator focused on spill response.
The Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe calls Indian Creek the “rockstar” of the Elwha River, as it’s the most “productive and diverse” of the river’s tributaries, said Matt Beirne, the tribe’s natural resources director. 
Hundreds, if not thousands, of juvenile salmon, bottom-feeding sculpin and lamprey died in the fuel’s wake, he said. Tribal Chairwoman Frances Charles said, “Our hearts sank” at the news.
Ferguson, a Democrat who took office in January, acknowledged this is the first sudden disaster he’s had to jump into action to respond to.
“It’s pretty clear to me,” he said, “the level of preparation that goes into something like this. I don’t think anything, maybe, truly prepares you.”
The river is Port Angeles’ primary source of potable water. After the crash, the city shut down water treatment processing and advised locals to limit their water use. At the time, its reservoirs had enough water for up to 24 hours without a disruption to normal service.
On Sunday morning, the city told water utility customers, both in and out of the city limits, not to drink the tap water amid ongoing state testing that was taking longer than expected. 
The reservoirs had been drawn down, so to maintain water pressure the city had to let in more water. Once the samples show the water is safe, the reservoirs will need to be refilled.
The driver of the truck was taken to a local hospital after the crash but is now recovering at home, said PetroCard President and CEO Laura Yellig. Authorities accused the driver, a 58-year-old man, of negligent driving.
Yellig said her company takes “full responsibility” for the crash and the resulting impacts.
Ferguson planned to remain in the Port Angeles area until at least Monday morning.
“It is heartbreaking to see what’s happened. There’s no two ways around that,” he said. “We’re going to get through this. It’s going to be a challenge.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fuel-truck-crash-in-river-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-20 18:56:16.818254

Laura Kelly.,"Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, is joining a crowded field to seek the Republican Party's nomination for governor in 2026. The GOP field includes former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt. In this image, Masterson is presiding over deliberations in the Kansas Senate. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson on Sunday became the latest prominent Republican to plunge into the 2026 campaign for governor.
Masterson, who has held the top leadership post in the state Senate since 2021, joined a field of candidates that included Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt and former Gov. Jeff Colyer. They GOP primary is set for August 2026. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly can’t seek a third term.
“Tangling with Laura Kelly these last few years has taught me I can only do so much from the position I’m in,” Masterson said in an announcement video. “Big change comes from the big seat. It’s time to take the fight to the status quo.”
In the video, Masterson took credit for work in the Legislature on a $2 billion reduction in state taxes and improvements to election security. He said he advanced bills forbidding transgender health care for minors and blocking transgender individuals from taking part in sports teams designated for girls or women. He said he devoted himself to getting the “woke ideology off our college campuses.”
He said Kansas needed a governor capable of reducing property taxes, lowering crime and addressing excessive spending by state government.
“President Trump is breaking the ice dam on the federal bureaucracy,” Masterson said. “We need to take advantage of this amazing opportunity to bring the Kansas economy roaring back and prevent things that are holding us back.”
Masterson, 55, of Andover, has served in the Kansas Senate since 2009 and previously was a member of the Kansas House. He was reelected to another four-year Senate term in 2024 while earning 65% of the vote in his district. That meant he could run for statewide office in 2026 without giving up his seat in the Legislature.
Schwab, the secretary of state and a former member of the Kansas House, greeted Masterson’s announcement by saying Kansas voters deserved “a robust airing of the issues that face our state that the next governor will have to address.” Schwab said Republicans had to nominate a candidate capable of winning.
Masterson has sought to be a conservative counterpoint to Kelly’s vision of centrist governance by mustering votes to override her vetoes, expanding state regulation of abortion and opposing broadening access to Medicaid health services for lower-income Kansans.
The Senate president endorsed diversion of state tax dollars to private education and championed placement on 2026 ballots an amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would allow direct election of Kansas Supreme Court justices. He advocated replacing the state’s three-tier income tax structure with a single tax rate regardless of income. Kansas has adopted a two-rate system.
Masterson placed significance on deepening the Republican supermajority in the House and Senate to help blunt Kelly’s policy agenda. Before the 2025 session of the Legislature, he also collaborated with House Speaker Dan Hawkins of Wichita to reduce Kelly’s influence over state budget recommendations.
At the same time, Masterson has spoken about his ability to work collaboratively with the Democratic governor.
“While we’ve certainly had our differences, I’ve been pleased with our ability to work together across an array of issues,” he said in a January rebuttal to Kelly’s State of the State speech to the Legislature. “While the controversial differences certainly garner the most headlines, the vast majority of our work is bipartisan in nature, and that’s a good thing.”
In that speech, he celebrated election of Trump in 2024 and viewed the president’s victory in Kansas as a mandate to “put Kansans first, control the overreach of government and keep our promises.” Masterson said that included a pledge to lower property taxes. “For too long it’s just been a political talking point,” he said.
During the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, however, the GOP leadership placed emphasis on reducing state income taxes and eliminating the state’s sales tax on groceries.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3050486-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-20 17:56:19.012270

Washington, D.C. has the second largest spike in inventory (+63.6%) followed by Raleigh, N.C. (+56.4%), says the report from the National Association of Realtors. Nationwide, the number of homes for sale is up 28.9%.
Las Vegas Realtors reported last week that at the end of June, 6,992 single-family homes for sale had no offers, a 70% increase from a year ago. The 2,564 condos and townhomes without offers in Southern Nevada account for an 87.6% jump over 2024.
Sales in June were down 7% from a year ago and the average home is staying on the market for more than 30 days, with about 80% selling within 60 days.
While housing stock is up over last year, it remains well below pre-pandemic levels.
“It’s been some time since we had this many homes on the market,” says Jeff Crampton, a Las Vegas Realtor, noting that 6,000 to 10,000 properties for sale is a healthy market.

Two factors, he says, are “keeping buyers on the shelf. One is the interest rates, and the other is the unsettling financial news on our TV every freaking day. Tariffs. No tariffs. War. No war. When people are going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on something, they want certainty.”
Some borrowers are attempting to cushion the blow of higher interest rates by taking on adjustable rate mortgages, which offer a lower rate for an initial period – usually five years – and increase periodically after that.
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that for the week ending April 11, 2025, the share of borrowers applying for ARMs rose to its highest level since November 2023.
“Given the jump in rates, more borrowers are opting for the lower initial rates that come with an ARM, with initial fixed rates closer to 6% in our survey last week,” Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s SVP and chief economist, said in a press release.
However, ARMs are riskier than 30-year fixed rate loans, which are set about a point higher.
Experts warn the market’s woes are a harbinger of economic disarray.
“Housing will … soon be a full-blown headwind to broader economic growth, adding to the growing list of reasons to be worried about the economy’s prospects later this year and early next,” Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi wrote Monday in posts on X and Linkedin. “Home sales, homebuilding, and even house prices are set to slump unless mortgage rates decline materially from their current near 7% soon. “
President Donald Trump is calling for a decrease in the benchmark interest rate, currently at 4.25% to 4.5%, to 1%, a move economists fear would trigger another set of economic woes, including higher inflation.
The inflation rate ticked up in June, pushing the annual rate to 2.7%, the highest since February. The likely cause, experts say, is Trump’s tariffs.
 The price is right?

The U.S. housing market has no shortage of would-be buyers, evidenced by a 25% year-to-year increase in purchase applications, HousingWire reports.  While some sellers are holding out for top dollar, many homes are priced right, experts contend.
“Normally, if a listing is priced too high, you’re not getting showings for it,” observes Crampton. “I’ve had 13 showings for one house, and I’ve had 19 showings for another house, but just one offer between them.”
Utah home prices slowed in 2024 — but housing market still ranks among nation’s most expensive

The dearth of offers, he says, is evidence of a lack of confidence among buyers who are not balking at home prices, but at the long term costs of financing.
Home prices have been “pretty stable so far this year,“ LVR President George Kypreos said in a news release last week, adding the increase in homes for sale “is good for buyers. It should also be prompting sellers to be realistic when pricing their properties.”  Kypreos was not available for an interview.
The median price of an existing single-family home sold in Southern Nevada in June was $485,000. That’s up 1% from the previous month, up 2.1% from last year, and ties the record set during the first quarter.
In Washoe County (excluding Incline Village) the median sales price for existing single-family homes was $616,400 in June, up 3.8% from May and 2.7% from last year. Inventory was up 7.7% from May and 46% from a year ago.
But home prices, which have held up amid sagging sales, “have gone sideways and are set to fall,” projects Zandi of Moody Analytics.
Price reductions last week in Southern Nevada were up 95% over last year, says real estate agent Diane Varney. “We appreciated too quickly during Covid. We’re in a correction. We needed one. ”
Prices, however, remain at record levels. Varney says that’s because the Multiple Listing Service no longer reports seller concessions, resulting in skewed data on sale prices. “If you sell a house for $750,000 and there was a $25,000 to $50,000 concession for repairs, rate buy down, closing costs – anything like that – it’s not going to show up in the sale price at the end of the day.”
Agents, Varney says, get calls from appraisers “all the time” because they need the information to determine the true value of comparable properties.
Even new home builders, who have bought down interest rates as a means of buoying sales, are giving up, according to Zandi.
“It’s simply too expensive,” he wrote Monday. “A big tell is that many builders are delaying their land purchases from the land banks. New home sales, starts, and completions will soon fall.”
Those who are attempting to sell in the current market are likely facing a life-altering event, such as marriage, divorce, or the addition of a child, according to Crampton and Varney.
“It’s not ‘I may want to sell.’ It’s not  ‘if I can get my price I’ll sell, otherwise, I’m going to stay here.’ Those players are out of the game,” Varney says of non-motivated sellers.
Complicating matters, one in five deals is falling out of escrow, she says.
“With the inventory climbing, buyers see another home that came on the market that’s more attractive, or maybe the rates took a spike, and they cancel,” says Varney. “Buyers right now are real touchy.”

U.S. District Court Chief Judge David G. Estudillo granted a preliminary injunction sought by three Catholic bishops, temporarily blocking enforcement of a controversial element in a new state law set to take effect July 27.
Estudillo ruled that requiring disclosure of information priests hear in the confessional infringes on their First Amendment right to practice religion and will force them to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
The decision means clergy will be added to the state’s roster of professions that must report to law enforcement when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.”
But the state cannot require Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima and Bishop Thomas Daly of Spokane — the three who filed the suit — or any Catholic priest in Washington under their direction to disclose such information they hear in confession.
“There is no question that SB 5375 burdens Plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion,” Estudillo wrote in a 25-page ruling issued four days after a court hearing in Tacoma.
The legislation “places them in the position of either complying with the requirements of their faith or violating the law. The consequences for violating the law are serious and, as Plaintiffs assert, the implications of violating the Sacramental Seal are more serious still,” he wrote.
Attorney General Nick Brown’s office emphasized that the ruling only applies to “the Sacrament of Confession” and that, if clergy learn about abuse in any other setting, the injunction does not change that they will be mandated reporters. Brown did not provide any further comment.
The ruling drew praise from Catholic Church leaders and attorneys who brought the suit.
“By protecting the seal of confession, the court has also safeguarded the basic principle that people of all faiths should be free to practice their beliefs without government interference,” Mark Rienzi, president and CEO of Becket, one of the legal teams, said in a statement.
Jean Hill, executive director of the Washington State Catholic Conference, said Catholic faithful have sought reconciliation with God through the sacrament of confession for centuries.
“This ruling protects that sacred space and ensures that Washingtonians of all religious stripes can live out their beliefs in peace,” she said in a statement.
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson signed the legislation in early May. Ferguson, a Catholic, has said requiring disclosures about information learned in confession did not give him pause and he was disappointed his church was suing “to protect individuals who abuse kids.”
Mandatory reporters
The law adds clergy to a list that includes school personnel, nurses, social service counselors, psychologists, and many others, who must report suspected abuse or neglect.
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
Violations of the law carry potential penalties of up to 364 days in jail, a $5,000 fine, and civil liability.
The three bishops filed their lawsuit May 29, naming Ferguson, Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties as defendants.
Prosecutors for the counties did not take sides in this dispute. Collectively, they agreed to accept a preliminary injunction as long as the plaintiffs did not seek attorney fees from them.
This basically put the counties on the sidelines, said Geoff Enns, a Snohomish County deputy prosecuting attorney.
State attorneys have argued the law can survive a First Amendment challenge because it was tailored to serve the compelling government interest of prosecuting perpetrators of child abuse.
But in his ruling, Estudillo said the state “arguably could have chosen a less restrictive means of advancing its interest” by adding members of the clergy to the list of mandated reporters and providing a narrow exception for the confessional, as other states do.
Attorneys for the bishops have argued the law treats Catholic priests, and the religious activity of confession, differently than other professions that involve confidential conversations. They pointed to House Bill 1171, which also takes effect July 27.
That law exempts attorneys employed by public or private higher education institutions, and employees under their supervision, from their mandatory reporting obligations if the information obtained is related to the representation of a client.
Estudillo agreed, ruling this undermined the state’s argument that it was not singling out the church practice.
“The government interest at issue in both statutes — protecting children from abuse and neglect — is the same. Nevertheless, one law eliminates the privilege for clergy while the other expands the privileges available to secular professionals,” he wrote.
“Ultimately, Washington’s failure to demonstrate why it has an interest of the highest order in denying an exemption to clergy while making such exemptions available to other professionals who work with underserved children … is likely fatal” to the law, the judge added.
Trump administration 
Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice sought to join the legal fight as an intervening party on the side of the bishops. Estudillo granted the request. The Trump Administration also filed a separate request for a preliminary injunction. It is slated for a hearing next week.
Meanwhile, a similar legal battle is unfolding in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Washington. The Orthodox Church of America, along with other churches and individual priests, has sued state officials and county prosecutors, contending the law violates the First Amendment right to practice one’s religion.

We’re not working for our philosophies. And we’re not working for our political parties.” Matt Vasilogambros/StatelineLocal election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.
And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

A 10-week experiment offering free foot ferry service between Anacortes and the San Juan Islands drew positive reviews but has room for improvement, according to a post-mortem given to the San Juan County Council.
A separate reexamination of possible new passenger-only ferry routes in the North Sound by a state consultant said large start-up costs would be incurred to launch new walk-on services. The tight budgets at all levels of government cast doubt on whether additional walk-on ferries may cast off anytime soon.
A $1.5 million state grant to San Juan County made the temporary foot ferry possible. The boat trial grew out of frustration with unreliable state ferry service in recent years.
The county can’t afford to continue the walk-on ferry on its own dime, but at least one county councilmember said the concept of car-free transportation to, from and among the scenic islands is worthy of further exploration.
“I would love to see us apply for some additional funding,” Councilmember Jane Fuller said Tuesday. “So we could run it out further in time, get more data and understand more of the implications of this.”
The twice-daily scheduled roundtrips between the three most populous islands and Anacortes ran from April 18 to June 30 using a chartered whale watching tour boat.
As part of the same state-funded pilot project, San Juan County also contracted with another local tour company for on-call emergency interisland water taxi service and paid a retainer to a barge company to keep a commercial truck transport vessel in reserve. Those back-up options in case of lengthy state ferry service cancellations have also wrapped up.
Health and Community Services Director Mark Tompkins said the 49-passenger boat hired for the twice-daily mainland ferry service attracted 2,399 riders over the two-and-a-half-month trial. Nearly two-thirds of riders said they were on leisure trips, with the remainder booked for work, school, errands or appointment reasons. The foot ferry achieved an enviable 100% on-time record, Tompkins reported to the county council Tuesday.
The emergency interisland water taxi was activated nine times this spring and early summer. It made 12 roundtrips between Orcas, Lopez and Friday Harbor, carrying 127 people home or to work who were stranded on those nine days when the Washington State Ferries interisland vehicle ferry unexpectedly went out of service.
“I look at these statistics and, while they’re not tens of thousands of riders, had (the state) ferries not worked, they would be,” County Councilmember Justin Paulsen said in reaction.
County Manager Jessica Hudson said passenger feedback praised the reliability of the daily scheduled service and appreciated the downtown Anacortes terminus, which was walking distance to many businesses and restaurants, unlike the outlying state ferry terminal.
Hudson performed some back-of-the-envelope math in front of the council to estimate the per-passenger cost of the free ferry rides the county provided. It penciled out to about $250 a person per ride, borne by state taxpayers via the governor-directed grant.
Fuller responded that it’s not a surprise that public transportation requires a heavy subsidy, but added that this was instructive about the “order of magnitude” a lightly-used foot ferry would consume.
The true cost of the fare-free ride also gave one-time foot ferry passenger Brian Clark pause. Clark was pleased by the service and the free parking in downtown Anacortes when he used the county’s boat in June to check on a rental property his family owns on Lopez Island.
“They need to get one of those electric hydrofoil ferries that have lower fuel costs,” Clark said in an interview from his home in Seattle this week.
Tompkins said securing a faster ferryboat for the passenger service was a common refrain in the “room for improvement” column. He also said better communication was needed to alert stranded travelers to the availability of the emergency interisland water taxi when it was activated. Some state ferry terminal workers didn’t refer customers there when the interisland vehicle ferry went down.
Other barriers needing attention include the lack of a suitable public dock on Shaw Island for foot ferry service. Also, the limited to nonexistent public transit options for travel on land once arriving at landings other than Friday Harbor present a hindrance to increasing car-free exploration of the San Juans.
Bellingham to Friday Harbor foot ferry gets another look
Earlier pleas from the ferry-dependent San Juan Islands resulted in the 2024 Legislature commissioning a $500,000 study of potential new state-supported passenger-only routes throughout Puget Sound. That report to the Legislature has coincidentally just been publicly released.
The hired consultants who took on the study determined four passenger routes deserved a detailed evaluation:

Bellingham – Friday Harbor
Whidbey Island – Everett
San Juan Islands interisland with two larger vessels
San Juan Islands interisland using a small private operator

The consultant group led by the firm KPFF estimated potential ridership for each foot ferry route, which ranged from a low of 85 commuters daily for the Whidbey Island-Port of Everett workday route. A circular San Juan Islands interisland route was the most attractive, with up to 223 riders estimated per day. The Bellingham to Friday Harbor connection fell in the middle, assuming a seasonal, seven days per week schedule. 
San Juan Cruises already operates one daily round-trip on the Bellingham-Friday Harbor route in summer, geared toward tourist daytrippers from the mainland. It is commercially successful, but the unsubsidized fare of $79 is expensive compared to the state ferry system’s $16.50 walk-on fare from Anacortes to the islands. The state ferries, while often running late, have lots of spare walk-on capacity, although parking at the Anacortes terminal can be a limiting factor at peak times.
The study authors observed that new foot passenger ferry service offers an opportunity to expand connectivity “at a lower capital and operating cost than WSF vehicle ferry service.” But the costs still rise into eight figures when vessel acquisition and landing site improvements are figured in.
The report presented the numbers and caveats but was circumspect in its recommendations. It said ultimately the next steps “will require direction from the Legislature regarding the state’s role” in providing or financing passenger-only services.
Even before the consultant study’s release, WSF leadership indicated it is focused on improving reliability of its existing car ferries and isn’t interested in adding passenger-only routes on top of that.
“We don’t have any plans to add any new routes for WSF,” state ferries chief Steve Nevey told ferry riders during an online town hall in May. “Only the Legislature can add routes.”
Legislature reluctant to take on new costs
The majority of the Legislature’s members appear cool to taking responsibility for new foot ferry routes. In fact, this spring, the lead transportation budget writers tried to phase out the state’s remaining support for locally-operated foot ferries, which flowed to the Vashon Island water taxi and Kitsap Fast Ferries to backfill for reduced state ferry service. Determined lobbying by local ferry advocates managed to keep their state subsidy in place for a year or two longer, even though WSF ferry service to Vashon and Bremerton has recently been restored to pre-pandemic levels.
Legislators are staring at daunting price tags to build new hybrid-electric 160-car ferries to modernize the state’s aging fleet, as well as the tab to install shoreside battery charging infrastructure.
“Passenger service in the future makes sense, but for now we’re focused on the core of WSF service,” state Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias said near the end of this year’s legislative session.

Speaker Mike Johnson is celebrating massive cuts to foreign aid programs and public media that he successfully navigated through the House of Representatives.
But Johnson’s own political campaign budget just took a modest hit, too — thanks to a thief, according to new federal records reviewed by OpenSecrets.
The Mike Johnson for Louisiana congressional committee lost $9,995.50 on April 28 when an unidentified person swiped one of the committee’s paper checks, which was “reissued to a fraudulent payee, and processed,” Johnson’s campaign wrote to the Federal Election Commission last week.

Federal Election Commission filing
“This was not due to misuse of funds internally,” the campaign committee told federal regulators. “The Committee is currently working with the bank to retrieve the lost funds if possible.”
Greg Steele, spokesman for Johnson’s campaign, told OpenSecrets on Friday that they do not know who stole the check and are “exploring” whether to involve law enforcement.
“We just caught it during our normal reconciliation process at the end of the financial quarter, and the account is locked down,” Steele said.
He added that Johnson’s campaign has had no other theft-related issues since.
While losing $10,000 will barely dent Johnson’s overall political finances — his committee reported more than $6.7 million in cash on hand as of June 30 — the theft is the latest in a series of incidents involving fraudsters hitting high-profile politicians and party committees.
Taken together, federal political committees have lost millions of dollars this decade, an OpenSecrets analysis of federal records and media reports indicates.
Thieves have successfully targeted the political campaigns of President Joe Biden, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Virginia Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Tulsi Gabbard, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 and now serves as President Donald Trump’s national security advisor.
The campaign committee of Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) lost nearly $700,000 in 2022, prompting an FBI investigation.
In May and June of this year, Moran’s committee reported two small “unauthorized charges” for purchases at a Target store in Overland Park, Kan., that have since been reimbursed, according to FEC records.
Scammers have also hit the Republican National Committee, Wisconsin Republican Party, Oregon Republican Party, anti-Trump super PAC Lincoln Project and the Democratic-supporting Retired Americans PAC.
In addition to Johnson, OpenSecrets has found evidence of more than a dozen federal political committees experiencing a financial crime against them since the November election, including those of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and Reps. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) and Brittany Pettersen (D-Colo.).
Someone used the National Republican Congressional Committee’s credit card for a shopping spree — the damage: $2,425 — at retailers Canada Goose and Fendi.
The FEC acknowledges that while misappropriation of political committee funds is “not common,” it has “encountered a number of cases.”
If a political committee discovers misappropriated funds, it “must notify law enforcement” as well as the FEC to properly disclose any reporting errors caused by a theft or unauthorized expenditure of campaign money.
The FEC recommends political committees take several proactive steps to avoid theft, including limiting the number of people authorized to sign checks, “carefully controlling” credit and debit cards and placing dollar restrictions on financial account withdrawals.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)WINFRED — Ken Meyer’s boots imprint the fine layer of dust settled over the concrete floor as he walks through South Dakota’s first industrial hemp processing facility.
It’s loud. Fans whirl and machinery grinds. Strips of sunlight cut through the haze.
Piles of dry hemp stalks line one wall. Meyer gestures toward a forklift feeding one of the piles into an industrial contraption. 
On one side of the machine, fiber pours out in tangled ribbons. On another, chunks of the woody core, called “hurd,” tumble into a large sack atop a pallet. Meyer reaches in and raises a handful. 
“We can turn hemp stalks into materials for animal bedding, hempcrete, bioplastics, you name it,” he said. “Right here in South Dakota.”

Meyer has a vision. He said expanding the hemp supply chain in South Dakota will bring more small processing and manufacturing into the state, and pull heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
“Hemp absorbs carbon as it grows, and we can lock the carbon into the various materials produced,” Meyer said. “And all that manufacturing could happen here in South Dakota.”
But coordinating the investments, infrastructure, oversight and market development needed to realize that vision is more work than Meyer alone can accomplish with his company, Complete Hemp Processing. 
In Wakonda, John Peterson with Dakota Hemp is not only constructing the state’s second processing facility but is also a hemp farmer. 
“We can’t just have everybody start planting hemp,” Peterson said. “You need the whole chain — growers, processors, and manufacturers — to come online at the same time. And that’s hard.”
Hemp and carbon
South Dakotans have only been growing hemp since 2021. The state is now the No. 1 hemp producer in the country, with 3,700 acres harvested in 2024. To capitalize on hemp’s potential to sequester carbon dioxide and keep it from trapping heat in the atmosphere, millions more acres are needed.
Hemp can grow 16 feet tall in three months. Growing a field of 16-foot-high stalks requires a lot of photosynthesis, which is the way plants absorb carbon dioxide and water to convert sunlight into energy for growth. An acre of hemp stalks absorbs approximately 5.5 tons of carbon per acre each season, according to Brittany McKell, with Hemp Carbon Standard in Canada. She said an additional ton of CO2 per acre is stored in the soil if less invasive tillage practices are used.
Pipeline won’t capture all carbon emitted by ethanol plants

Hemp Carbon Standard works with farmers to quantify the amount of carbon sequestered by their hemp farm and convert that to credits. Those are sold on global, private carbon markets where companies and individuals purchase them to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. The company then shares those profits back with farmers. Peterson recently signed up and earned 367 carbon credits on one year’s harvest, which can be sold for over $100 each. 
While corn stalks can temporarily store up to about 4 tons of above-ground carbon dioxide per acre, most of it is re-released through digestion and decay.

Decay happens to harvested hemp, too. Keeping the carbon in the hemp stalks requires a longer-term carbon storage solution: processing those stalks into long-lasting materials. Hemp’s utility extends to everything from bioplastics and lumber to textiles and insulation. Hempcrete, for example, is a construction material made from hemp hurd and lime that absorbs CO2 as it sets.
Hemp Carbon Standard promotes the use of those products, too, because McKell said they serve as sustainable, less carbon-intensive alternatives that indirectly offset the production of their more carbon-intensive counterparts: oil-based plastics, wood from trees and energy-intensive construction materials. Depending on the product being made, McKell said, the impact of producing hemp-based, less carbon-intensive alternatives prevents another 9 to 18 tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere, per acre of hemp allocated to the production of the material.
The numbers mean that if 18% of South Dakota’s approximately 18.5 million cropland acres grew hemp every summer, the hemp stalks — not counting the carbon potentially stored in the soil or the material offset of producing less carbon-intensive materials — would remove over 18 million tons of atmospheric carbon per year. That’s as much as a proposal in South Dakota aiming to achieve a similar vision: Summit Carbon Solution’s carbon sequestration pipeline, which would annually capture up to 18 million tons of carbon emissions from 57 ethanol plants in five states. The five-state project has faced numerous regulatory and legal hurdles, along with opposition from landowners refusing to grant access and expressing concerns about potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes.
Farmers with land crossed by the pipeline would receive easement payments. In hemp production, farmers can capitalize the carbon-storage potential of their crop by selling carbon credits. Hemp also requires no herbicides, unlike other row crops such as corn and soybeans.
Despite its potential, the hemp market faces regulatory challenges. And industrial hemp advocates say getting hemp this far was not easy. 
The fight to legalize hemp
Although hemp was federally legalized under the 2018 farm bill — which defined hemp as cannabis containing no more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (known as TCH, which results in a high at greater concentrations) — South Dakota did not immediately follow suit.
Early efforts to legalize hemp production at the state level were met with resistance, particularly from former Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration, which expressed concern that legal hemp could lead to broader marijuana legalization. Oren Lesmeister, a rancher and Democratic former legislator from Parade, spent years fighting to get the hemp industry rolling in South Dakota. 
“There was this fear that everyone was going to run out and get stoned,” Lesmeister said. “We had to beat that misconception with education and persistence.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legal and regulatory barriers fell in several stages. The first major step was ensuring that South Dakota’s laws aligned with federal standards legalizing the crop, something the 2018 farm bill allowed states to do.
Implementation in South Dakota lagged, with hemp cultivation beginning in 2021 after state administrative rules were finalized and approved. Even then, regulatory burdens remained. But Meyer said many of these initial state restrictions have since been scaled back as South Dakota gained experience with the crop.
Meyer said the two major impediments still in place are THC testing requirements and criminal background checks. He hopes those requirements will be loosened in the next federal farm bill. 
Selling a bottom-up vision
Lesmeister sees parallels with corn-based ethanol, which grew into a major industry with help from the federal government. It created a guaranteed market through the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires refiners to blend billions of gallons of ethanol into gasoline each year or buy credits. The number of corn acres in South Dakota went from about 4 million before the standard was enacted to about 6 million last year.
“Hemp got this far without any of that,” Lesmeister said. “But imagine where it could be with a little help.”
Doug Sombke, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, sees helping the emerging hemp industry as a better way to sequester carbon than controversial proposals to capture carbon emitted by ethanol plants.
“If you really want to support the climate and agriculture, get that money to the people working the land,” Sombke said.
Bryan Jorgensen is a regenerative farmer and soil health expert from Ideal. He is skeptical that climate change requires government action. But Jorgensen does see industrial hemp as a chance to rebuild rural communities as part of America’s manufacturing base.
“This could localize manufacturing,” he said. “But it takes vision and the will to invest in producers instead of propping up extractive systems.”

By comparison, he sees carbon pipelines as an extension of a flawed farm economy that has become overly dependent on corn and soybeans, partly due to the federal support for those crops.
“We’ve created this monster,” Jorgensen said. “We’ve invested billions in learning how to grow corn, so now we don’t know how to do anything else. And farmers are stuck in a system where they’re not even the ones benefiting.”
Silvia Secchi, a professor at the University of Iowa who studies agricultural and climate policy, agrees.
“We subsidized the corn, not the farmer,” she said. “That’s the problem.”
For now, the few thousand acres of hemp grown in South Dakota pale in comparison to about 6 million acres of corn and 5 million acres of soybeans. But advocates believe that could change rapidly if hemp processors and manufacturers move in, and the U.S. government backs the vision.
“There’s a real opportunity here,” said Karll Lecher, co-founder of Dakota Hemp. “We just need more boots on the ground.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hemp-photo-adjusted-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-07-20 10:57:55.468032

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association


Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

(Photo by Jim Peaco/National Park Service)The U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources on Tuesday narrowly voted in favor of delisting the grizzly bear from the Endangered Species Act, pushing legislation long sought by western state elected officials to the next step in the congressional process.
House Resolution 281, the Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2025, was introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, along with Montana’s two Republican congressmen, Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing.
The legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to remove the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population of grizzly bears from the Endangered Species Act, restoring a ruling by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued in 2017 during the first Trump Administration.
That rule was later vacated by a federal circuit court, and the agency, under the Biden administration, reversed its stance and recommended the grizzly stay on the list, and under federal jurisdiction.
“The GYE grizzly population has exceeded the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s recovery goals for over two decades,” Hageman said during the committee’s markup hearing. “Since a mere 3% of species listed under the ESA have ever been delisted the ESA desperately needs a success story like the GYE grizzly bear. The grizzly is, in fact, the poster child for how the ESA has failed in terms of what it was intended to do and how it has actually been implemented.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But Democrats on the committee pushed back against the bill, arguing that the proposal amounted to a political football and could jeopardize the continued recovery of the species.
The court ruling that vacated the 2017 delisting rule cited the federal government’s “failure to consider long term genetic effects on other populations and concerns that the decision was driven by political pressure … instead of the best available science,” ranking member Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, said.
He said the decision continued the partisan game played with the ESA, ignored consultation with Native American tribes on a culturally significant species, and removed public input from the process.
“To legislatively delist the population located around Yellowstone in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, from the ESA and then block judicial review, that is not going to lead us down the path of success,” Huffman added. “That’s going to lead us to some really unfortunate consequences.”
Grizzly bears throughout the contiguous states were listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975 when there were only an estimated 300 to 400 animals left in the wild. Currently, FWS estimates there are roughly 2,314 grizzlies living between Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Washington.
During the last decade, a saga of proposed delisting actions, lawsuits and petitions have left the fate of grizzly bears overshadowed with questions.
Montana previously petitioned FWS to delist the species in the GYE and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, centered around Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness, but the agency rejected the petition early this year. A similar petition from Wyoming was also rejected in the final weeks of the Biden administration.
Instead, FWS proposed a new comprehensive approach to federal grizzly management, including consolidating grizzlies living in six distinct recovery zones into a single population. That move would have prevented sub-populations, such as the GYE, from being considered for delisting separately from the species as a whole.
Montana officials derided that decision, with Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, saying the administration was embracing a “scorched earth strategy,” in its final days. He added that he looked forward to working with the Trump administration on a new path forward.
Rep. Zinke shared similar sentiments at the time: “Thankfully the political hands pulling the strings at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are about to be fired and President Trump will no doubt immediately rescind this train-wreck decision.”
Zinke briefly served as Interior Secretary during Trump’s first administration, and was in office when the 2017 delisting was announced.
Zinke’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the committee’s vote on the 2025 rule or questions about preventing judicial review.
But Montana Sen. Steve Daines praised Tuesday’s vote in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that “delisting the grizzly bear is long overdue.”
Ahead of the committee vote, more than 50 conservation organizations signed onto a letter urging representatives to vote against the legislation.
“The grizzly bear populations in those locations are stable and growing, but conservationists remain concerned about the geographic and genetic isolation of those populations, the threat of increased human-induced mortality through hunting or predator control if they were delisted and management returned to the states of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, and the effects of delisting particular populations on grizzly bears in the rest of the lower-48 states,” the letter states.



Let us know what you think...


 


Chris Servheen, a retired FWS grizzly bear recovery coordinator who petitioned the federal government to consider managing grizzlies as a single population — the plan the agency put forth this year — said in a statement that the efforts to delist grizzlies by congressional actions ignored key components of the ESA.
“The current administration and Congress are working to defund grizzly bear science and monitoring, dramatically reduce funding for federal land management agencies in grizzly range, increase timber harvest and road building in grizzly habitat, and weaken or eliminate the fundamental laws that grizzly recovery depends on like the ESA, the National Environmental Policy Act and the United States Forest Service Roadless Rule,” Servheen said. “At the same time, recreation pressure on public lands and private land development are accelerating rapidly in grizzly habitat putting even more stress on grizzlies. Congressional delisting while the cumulative impacts of these actions are ongoing is irresponsible and will result in immediate declines in grizzly numbers and range.”
During the committee discussion, Rep. Hageman hammered home her argument that the reason environmental groups and previous administrations had pushed to keep the grizzlies listed was for “controlling large swaths of land and water resources. It’s that simple.”
She said that both individual states, and the federal government, have limited resources to spend on issues like endangered species, and they should be allocated to where the need is highest.
“There are species that truly do need our protection and need the resources to be made available so that we can protect them and recover them,” she said. “When we are wasting money on a recovered species, those are resources that cannot be used for that purpose.”
Democrats proposed three amendments to the bill — one to require DOI to follow the new 2025 species assessment issued by FWS that considered all grizzlies in the lower 48 to be considered a single population; another to require more tribal consultation in management decisions for grizzlies; and a third that sought to strip out the prohibition on judicial review in the bill.
All three amendments failed on party-line votes.
On the discussion over judicial review, Hageman said the point of the bill is to carry out the purpose and intent of the Endangered Species Act, and removing the legal provision amounted to a “gift to the radical environmental lobby.”
“Until the bear has returned to state control where it belongs, lawsuits and ever shifting recovery standards will stand in the way activist judges have stood in the way of delisting for far too long,” she said.
Hageman added that when the grey wolf was delisted in 2011, during the Obama administration, a similar provision was put into that legislation.
The committee voted 20-19 along party lines to recommend approval by the full House of Representatives.
Huffman gave notice that he intended to file “dissenting or minority views,” on the measure for the full chamber.
Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, and Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn, also cosponsored the legislation.

But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”

Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.

How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”

Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.

‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.










We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association


Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

That description could apply to former President Barack Obama after his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention – or, 20 years later, to Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow.
McMorrow has worked with Democratic communications operative Lis Smith, who also served as Obama’s re-election campaign’s director of rapid response and helped propel former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg onto the national stage as a presidential candidate in 2020 though he had only served as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
But with the Democratic primary for president in 2028 wide open, McMorrow says that’s where the parallels end.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She told the Michigan Advance during a recent campaign stop in Flint that, if elected to the U.S. Senate in 2026, she is committed to serving out her full term.
Several rising stars in the Democratic Party have previously been crowned the “next Obama” – including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who did launch a campaign president halfway through her term in the U.S. Senate, the same timeframe as Obama when he was elected president in 2008, but dropped out before a single state had voted.
“I am always flattered. It’s also very strange when people talk about Democratic Party stars like this is a celebrity contest,” McMorrow said. “It’s not. So I’m just going to do everything I can do to win the Senate seat, and we’ll see what happens.”
McMorrow is running in a Democratic field that already includes U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), former state House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) is the only announced GOP candidate.

McMorrow wouldn’t be the only Michigan official to be the subject of speculation as the Democratic Party searches for a leader in 2028.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has long been named a potential candidate for president, though she has repeatedly denied interest in the job and the speculation has quieted since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, with some Democrats expressing frustration over her collaborative approach toward Trump, which landed her unexpectedly in the Oval Office but also garnered a new fighter mission for Selfridge Air National Guard Base.
Since taking office in January, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) has been profiled by The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, POLITICO and The New York Times and delivered multiple high-profile speeches about the party’s path forward, including the Democratic response to Trump’s first Joint Address of his second presidency earlier this year.
Outgoing U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) was among those floated as a candidate to be Harris’ running mate in 2024, with strong backing from labor groups, and he has emphasized that his decision to not seek re-election doesn’t mean he’s retiring from the public sphere.
And polls show Buttigieg, a Traverse City resident, as one of the early front-runners in hypothetical Democratic primary matchups.
In the meantime, McMorrow says Democrats who are already in positions of power need to be doing everything they can to stand up to Trump in the present.
“It is completely unacceptable for some of the leaders in my own party to go out giving interviews where they say things like, ‘well, we’re not in power right now, but don’t worry, their polling numbers are coming down, and we’ll get them in the midterms,’” McMorrow said.
“That is heinous to me. As a U.S. senator, you are one of the 100 most powerful people in the entire country. And even if you are not in power with gavels in your hand, in that sense, you still have a platform, you still have a voice.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AMR_0004-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-20 08:57:16.705997

Our state government and many private institutions in our state need major reform.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Carter Neubieser: We haven’t done enough to put working families first.","This commentary is by Carter Neubieser, a Progressive city councilor representing Ward 1 in Burlington.


Vermonters have made clear that they want a fair tax system, union jobs, affordable housing and health care, and an end to a corrupt political system. Folks have been clear that we must do all we can to address pollution and protect our environment — both for our quality of life and economy. It’s clear that Vermonters understand that all of our neighbors deserve the dignity and respect every human being is entitled to.
Vermonts have also been clear on what our communities don’t want.
We don’t want to live in a state with nearly 39,000 households paying more than half of their income for housing.
We don’t want a state where the plan for poverty is to kick 800 people out of their housing, and onto the streets, with no serious solutions put forward.
We don’t want to live in a state where health care premiums have risen 92% since 2018, compared to the national average of 12%. Or where one organization — the UVM Health Network —  controls much of our health care market, leading to all sorts of wasted money and high costs.
We don’t want to live in a state where the federal government will kick tens of thousands of Vermonters off their health care, while cutting taxes for billionaires and their kids.
We don’t want our State Legislature and governor to completely gut public education, while refusing to raise taxes on the wealthiest people in our state. They had the gall to do this, without even taking a roll call vote on the legislation — that way voters don’t know who voted which way.
Our economic and political systems feel stagnant and tired, because they are — our ability to buy a home, make a decent living and provide for our families is disappearing before our eyes.
The good news is that they don’t need to be. The outcomes we are experiencing are the result of bad, sometimes cruel, choices made by politicians and large institutions. Different choices — grounded in fairness, anti-corruption and the needs of Vermont families — will produce better outcomes. 
Our state government and many private institutions in our state need major reform.
Moving forward we must tax those who can most afford it. These folks are about to receive the benefits of the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the wealthy in the history of our nation.
We must reign in the power of the UVM Health Network. We must reorganize our health care system with the goal of delivering quality, affordable care for everyone. We must recognize the importance of accessible care for rural communities.
We cannot rebrand and repeat the failed trickle-down economic policies of the last 50 years. We must instead make historic investments in the creation and maintenance of thousands of permanently affordable housing units, for buyers and renters alike.
We must strengthen — not gut — public education in Vermont. We must recognize the important role our public schools and teachers play in many rural communities across the state.
We must rapidly move to fully staff state government and focus on delivering services as effectively as possible.
We must reform our elections to encourage more participation and choice — not less. We must move rapidly to publicly funded elections and ban dark and corporate money.  
We must do everything in our power to oppose a dangerous Trump administration that will happily suppress political opposition by force and consolidate power in the executive. We must make clear that Vermonters support civil liberties and oppose more regime-change wars abroad.
In this moment, we must build a political movement that elects and supports leaders who are accountable to their neighbors and coworkers, not to other politicians and lobbyists in Montpelier.

(Courtesy Automobile License Plate Collectors Association)If you’re one of Rhode Island’s 471 motorists with a license plate featuring the Pell Bridge and the lighthouse from nearby Rose Island, prepare to brag to your peers that you have the best license plate in the world.
That’s according to the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association. Members of the world’s largest license plate hobbyist group will be in Providence Monday morning to officially award the designation.
It’s the first time Rhode Island has received the honor in the association’s 71-year history, receiving a score of 396 points. Second place went to Idaho, whose “wildlife” plate featuring a bluebird scored 379 points.


Here were the top 10 plates and their scores:

Rhode Island (396)
Idaho (379)
Oklahoma (367)
Wisconsin (362)
Alaska (351)
Kentucky (305)
Colorado (286)
New Mexico (274)
Florida (265)
Newfoundland and Labrador (246)



Every spring, the association offers its members a chance to vote for their favorite plates issued during the previous calendar year — with 23 making this latest cut, including one from Canada and Australia. A representative from the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Rhode Island’s winning plate features a graphic of the Rose Island Lighthouse with the Claiborne Pell Bridge in the background as two Shields sailboats with mainsails marked by the numbers 18 and 70 glide by. The numbers are a reference to the year the lighthouse was completed and first shone its light over Narragansett Bay.
The plate was designed by Ross Cann of A4 Architecture + Planning with support from longtime lighthouse aficionado Jan Slee. Sailboat art was done by Kara Acosta.
First issued last summer, the plates were created under a 2022 law on behalf of the Rose Island Lighthouse and Fort Hamilton Trust, the nonprofit dedicated to preserving the historic and environmental integrity of the 18-acre island, revolutionary-era barracks, and historic lighthouse.
For every $43.50 plate registration, $20 goes back to the nonprofit.

“It takes money to achieve our mission,” Sean O’Connor, the trust’s executive director, said in an interview Friday. “The charity plates are a great fundraiser — and we’re starting to see them more and more on the road.”
But O’Connor acknowledged the slow rollout to get the plates out.
State law requires 600 pre-orders before plates can enter production. Within a year of the enabling legislation, O’Connor said only around 350 had been purchased. So to ensure production of the plates, he said the trust paid the DMV roughly $4,500 on the remaining pre-orders.
That means the fundraiser was actually a net negative.
O’Connor said he is hopeful the recognition by the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association will encourage more drivers to sport one on their vehicles.
“If we get just 500 new orders from July – December, that will result in $10,000 additional revenue for our education programs on Rose Island, as well as on-going maintenance and restoration work of the historic Rose Island Lighthouse, revolutionary-era Fort Hamilton Barracks, and native habitat restoration and bird monitoring in our wildlife refuge,” he wrote in an email.
As of Friday, DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said there were 471 active registrations with the Rose Island plate design.
Gov. Dan McKee will be among those speaking at Monday’s event scheduled for 10 a.m. at the Department of Adminis­tration’s One Capitol Hill building. McKee will be joined by Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) administrator Walter “Bud” Craddock; Cyndi McCabe, president of the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association; and state Rep. Lauren A. Carson of Newport, and Sen. Dawn Euer, both Newport Democrats.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-20 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Does Jason White deserve to be cursed or praised? Depends on the issue.,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/20/jason-white-curse-praise/,"Column: The dichotomy that is Jason White was on full display during a recent speech. Whether you want to curse him or praise him, the first-term House speaker is taking strong stances.","The dichotomy that is Jason White was on full display during a speech he delivered during a recent lunch meeting of the Mississippi State University Stennis Institute of Government.
Some at the meeting most likely cursed House Speaker Jason White because of his work to eliminate the Mississippi income tax and because of his unapologetic support of sending public funds to private schools.
Darn that Jason White.
But many of the same people would praise the first-term Republican speaker for his past support of expanding Medicaid to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor and for his support of restoring voting rights for people convicted of felonies.
Thanks, Jason White, some might say, perhaps begrudgingly.
But those people should give White some credit. It was no small feat for White to publicly voice support for Medicaid expansion as he campaigned in 2023 to gather the votes to win the speakership. Before then it was rare for a Republican politician in Mississippi to even utter the words “Medicaid expansion.” Theoretically, White could have been putting his political future on the line.
But in 2024 after being elected speaker by his Republican caucus, White made a good faith but ultimately unsuccessful effort to pass an expansion bill. The proposal was defeated for multiple reasons.
But White has not ruled out the possibility of Medicaid expansion being revisited.
He said the state still needs to help struggling rural hospitals and to work to increase the number of Mississippians who have health coverage. And to achieve those goals, Medicaid expansion, despite changes made to the program in the so-called federal “Big Beautiful Bill,” appears to still be the best mechanism to help struggling hospitals and to ensure health care coverage for poor, working Mississippians.
Another proposal that many Republican leaders, including Gov. Tate Reeves, have opposed that White has embraced is restoring voting rights for people who have been convicted of felonies. In Mississippi people convicted of some crimes, even some relatively minor ones, lose their voting rights for life.
White recently said that he supports “addressing barriers to suffrage for those … who have served their time … paid their debt to society, paid all fines and fees. We are looking for a way to remove barriers for those folks to reengage with the community and be able to vote.”
But many of the same people who would support White’s efforts in health care and in expanding voting rights would curse the considerable political capital he spent to pass a bill that is intended to phase out Mississippi’s income tax, which accounts for about 30% of the state’s general fund revenue.
While White has stepped outside of the Mississippi Republican policy boundaries on some issues, he is right in line with many of his Republican colleagues on the issues of tax cuts and even of providing public funds to private schools. As a matter of fact, White admits he is more of an advocate on the private school voucher issue than many of his fellow House Republicans.
White’s background might help explain his diverse political philosophy.
White was elected as a Democrat in 2011 from a rural district where it would have been difficult for a Republican to win. The district was held by a Democrat — Mary Ann Stevens — who was voting with the burgeoning House Republican caucus. White ran as the candidate of the Democrats, who were desperately trying to maintain their House majority. He won, but the Democrats lost.
After that pivotal election, White saw the handwriting on the wall and changed parties. With that party switch, the Republican majority redrew House boundaries to create a district where White could win as a Republican.
But it is reasonable to assume that in many ways, White is still the person he was when he ran as a rural Democrat.
He is still from a poor, rural area where health care is at the top of mind — and where, often, health care is nearly non-existent.
And in his day-to-day activities, White, an attorney, crosses paths with people convicted of felonies who have paid for their mistake and want a chance to reenter society. That reentry for many includes voting.
And yes, there are struggling schools in the rural area where White lives in Holmes County.
Rightfully or wrongfully, White sees private school vouchers as a way for students trapped in struggling schools to have a better chance.
Many believe that it is wrong-headed thinking to take money from the struggling public schools that need all the help they can get, and that may be a reason to curse White. For others, though, his support of Medicaid expansion is a reason to praise him.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05015952/3X0A7063-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-20 07:56:35.006229

BURLINGTON — The line for entry at Centennial Field nearly stretches to Colchester Avenue. More than 30 minutes before first pitch, parking spots have evaporated. The smell of sunscreen lingers, kids buzz with the freedom of their outdoor voices and chatter bleeds into the sounds of the ballpark.
Sweaty and patient, they’re all there to catch the Vermont Lake Monsters. 
“Hotdog Hysteria” nights like this, on the first of July, are one of a long list of promotions designed to pull in crowds and keep them coming back, even on nights when the franks are the usual $4. Tonight, they’re just 25 cents, and predictably, the concession line snakes across the park to the bullpen on the other side.

From June to August, if the crowds are any indication, the Lake Monsters have made themselves a must-see event. 
Just a few years ago, the future of baseball in Burlington was far from certain. In 2020, Major League Baseball shrunk its minor league circuit, and teams like the Lake Monsters were left on the outside looking in.
Those changes put a long history in peril: Between 1994 and 2020, the Lake Monsters boasted 132 Major League alumni. The team’s park, leased from the University of Vermont in the summer, was built in 1906 and is one of the oldest in the country. Over the course of 119 years, it hosted multiple Hall of Famers as they made their way to the big leagues.
That’s when Chris English stepped to the plate. A native of Montreal, English led the Nos Amours Baseball Club group that purchased the Lake Monsters in March 2021. With no MLB club providing players, the front office needed to find ways to build a roster — and swiftly. 
One of English’s first calls was to former general manager C.J. Knudsen.

English called once, then again, Knudsen said, with the former manager rebuffing the idea of rejoining the team. 
“Then he called me a third time,” Knudsen said, and the two came to an agreement: Knudsen would come back.
“We had no players,” he said. “It was basically myself, Chris and Morgan Brown, who’s our director of baseball operations, and we were able to rebuild the franchise and rebuild the roster.” 
The franchise’s reinvention as part of a summer league for college players began that first summer in 2021.
“We had 67 different players play for us, 11 Vermonters, and somehow we were able to put together an amazing win streak,” Knudsen said. 
A championship trophy in the team’s inaugural 2021 season in the Futures Collegiate League followed. 
In affiliated minor league baseball, the Major League club has complete control of the coaches and players on the field for its smaller counterpart. 
As an amateur team, the Lake Monsters have enjoyed a newfound flexibility to build rosters on the field that represent Vermont while committing more firmly to partnerships with Vermont businesses off the field, Knudsen said. 
“I think the fans loved it because the level of baseball is much better than when it was a single-A, short season,” Knudsen said. “The guys are all in college. They’re from all across the country, but there’s also some Vermont identity here.”

Baseball in Vermont has seen declining youth participation. Long winters and competing youth sports have made it harder to engage young ballplayers. Knudsen said he understands that community impact is more central than ever to the franchise’s mission — and that now, with the power to choose their players, the Lake Monsters could help revive the game in the Green Mountain State.
“I think that people can identify when they see a person’s name like Wyatt Cameron last year, or Colby Brouillette, you know. Wyatt Cameron’s from Salisbury, Vermont. Colby Brouillette from Georgia, Vermont … people know their names,” Knudsen said. “It gives the opportunity for boys and girls playing Little League Baseball and youth sports to potentially play for the Vermont Lake Monsters because they literally can see it.” 
Since the new ownership came into place, the team has pursued local products for the park: An ice cream stand sources from an Arlington dairy; the franchise formulated its own hot sauce and enlisted a bottler in Barre so fans can take it home.
And this year, for the first time, the ballpark will go by a new name: Delta Dental Park at Centennial Field (a 10-year sponsorship deal, Knudsen said, that will help fund the things fans enjoy).
It has been 20 years since the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, five since professional play left Vermont entirely. “We are celebrating our 31st season here,” Knudsen said. “That’s a long time for a sports franchise to be in business and operate.”

Nobel Prize winning author Sinclair Lewis sequestered himself on his Vermont farm during the summer of 1935 and hammered away on his latest novel. He was in a hurry, fearing that real-world events might overtake his narrative.
For his plot, Lewis drew from national and international headlines of the day, but he made the main character a Vermont newspaper editor and set most of the story among the green valleys of his adopted home. For 12 hours a day, seven days a week, Lewis plotted his story and then tapped it out on his portable typewriter, before making copious handwritten revisions to the text. He finished the 498-page manuscript on August 13. It told a story sure to grab the public’s attention. 
The resulting book, “It Can’t Happen Here,” was an instant bestseller. It tells the dystopian story of a populist American politician, Berzelius “Buzz” Windrip, who stokes people’s fears and preys on their patriotism, promising sweeping reforms to return the country to its original values. Windrip defeats Franklin Roosevelt in the Democratic primary and is then elected president. Once in power, Windrip leads a fascist takeover of the United States. He declares martial law to neutralize Congress, which had refused to pass his legislation, and disempower the Supreme Court, which could have blocked his decrees. Windrip’s violent paramilitary force, the Minute Men, suppresses opposition. Windrip seizes control of the media in a way that makes it appear the country still has a free press; he censors some journalists while co-opting others to spread his propaganda. 
In 1935, Lewis, like many Americans, was alarmed by the rise of fascism in Europe, led by Adolf Hitler in Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy. Lewis was well informed about the situation, hearing firsthand details from his wife, famed journalist Dorothy Thompson, who had been a correspondent in Germany. Thompson had interviewed Hitler when he was still aspiring to power and wrote a dismissive profile. Hitler didn’t forget the slight. After he became German chancellor, he had Thompson expelled from the country. 
American politics had its share of demagogues during the 1930s. Among the most prominent was Louisiana Gov. Huey Long, who promised to obliterate privilege and wealth in order to make “every man a king.” At the same time, Long ran Louisiana with an iron fist while facing credible claims that he committed bribery, election fraud, and voter intimidation; put loyalists into state jobs, profited from ties to oil companies doing business with his state, and even tried to get his bodyguard to kill a political rival. As Lewis wrote his novel, Long was eyeing challenging Roosevelt in the Democratic primary. 
It may be hard now to imagine Roosevelt as politically vulnerable—he would ultimately be re-elected president three times—but in 1935 he was in his first term, America was in the depths of the Great Depression, and his wide-ranging programs had yet to alleviate American suffering.

Vermont served as a sanctuary for Lewis, who yearned to return whenever he was gone too long. 
On a property-buying expedition in Vermont in 1928, Lewis and Thompson visited their New York City landlord’s 300-acre property in Barnard. They were so struck by the stone walls, mixed woodlands and distant view of Mount Ascutney that they offered $10,000 on the spot for the property, which was worth about $3,000, if it were farmed. Their landlord jumped at the offer, leaving the next day for Florida, where he planned to retire.
The Barnard property had two farmhouses; Thompson and Lewis called it Twin Farms and made it their warm-weather base. They would live in the smaller house and renovate the larger as a guesthouse. The couple hired a large staff of locals to maintain the houses and grounds. Thompson invited employees to bring their children to work so her son would have playmates. Seeking a quiet spot away from the children, Lewis shifted his office to the guesthouse. 
Lewis wasn’t a recluse, though. When he wasn’t working, he would often socialize with Vermonters, particularly writers and journalists, and became conversant in the state’s history. Speaking to the Rotary Club of Rutland, he declared his love for his adopted state: “Vermont is the first place I have seen where I really wanted to have my home—a place to spend the rest of my life.”
Lewis sets the opening scene of “It Can’t Happen Here” at a Rotary Club meeting in the fictional Vermont city of Fort Beulah, which he describes as a “comfortable village of old red brick, old granite workshops, and houses of white clapboards or gray shingles, with a few smug little modern bungalows, yellow or seal brown.” Lewis supposedly modelled Fort Beulah after Rutland, though he makes Fort Beulah’s main product granite in place of Rutland’s marble.  

After its publication as a novel, “It Can’t Happen Here” was adapted for the stage. In October 1936, the play ran simultaneously in 21 American theaters in 17 states in productions sponsored by the Federal Theatre Project.  Poster via the New York Public Library
The speakers at the meeting are a cantankerous retired general and a conservative female activist. The general says he doesn’t “altogether admire everything Germany and Italy have done,” but urges the United States to mimic their belligerence toward other countries: “We’ve got strength and will, and for whomever has those divine qualities it’s not only a right, it’s a duty, to use ’em!”
Meanwhile, the conservative activist urges a return to what she considers traditional American values. She is best known for opposing the right of women to vote and calling for women to remain at home and have as many babies as possible. 
Discussing the meeting afterward, the book’s protagonist, Doremus Jessup, the 60-year-old editor of the city’s newspaper, is dismayed to hear a local businessman, banker, school superintendent, and others agreeing with much of what the speakers said. The businessman even praises Hitler. Jessup is incredulous: “Cure the evils of Democracy by the evils of Fascism!”  
While the others seem to relish the prospect of a Windrip presidency, Jessup worries what he would do once in office. “Wait till Buzz takes charge of us,” he says. “A real Fascist dictatorship!”

When Windrip wins, Jessup is forced into the role of opposition, writing editorials against the administration. Things spiral out of control. The government seizes Jessup’s newspaper. When he is caught publishing anti-government pamphlets for a resistance movement called the New Underground, he is thrown into a concentration camp, where he is tortured by the Minute Men. Jessup escapes and flees to Canada. By the end of the book, he has slipped back into the United States, under the alias William Barton Dobbs, to spy for the New Underground. 
Immediately after the book was published, people tried to figure out who was the inspiration for Jessup. Many believed it was Howard Hindley, the longtime editor of the Rutland Herald and a friend of Lewis. It was an entertaining theory, but Vermont author Charles Crane, in his 1937 book “Let Me Show You Vermont,” wrote: “It’s not so, as both Lewis and Hindley declare.”
Crane quoted Hindley as saying, “I’m not at all like Doremus Jessup. I’m…not given to philosophical remarks such as are put into Jessup’s mouth by the author, and certainly I wouldn’t have the guts to go through what Jessup did.”
Most scholars believe that Jessup isn’t modelled after a real-life individual, but instead represents upper middle class, small-town, political moderates who were struggling to figure out how to confront the rise of Fascism. Lewis also seems to speak through the character, expressing his own concerns about current events and fears about the future. 
Lewis’ book mentioned a real-life, one-time Vermont resident who, although little remembered today, played a role in the promotion of fascism in America. 
At one point in the story, Windrip lists people who have inspired him and mentions William Dudley Pelley. During the 1930s, Pelley was a leading American fascist. But before his life took that dark turn, he was a Vermont newspaperman. Born in Massachusetts in 1890, Pelley moved to Vermont in his mid-20s to work for the Bennington Banner newspaper. His job involved the physical production of the newspaper, not writing for it. 
In his spare time, Pelley wrote fiction. He created stories about a fictionalized version of Bennington, which he called Paris, Vermont. The proceeds from his four novels and the many short stories that appeared in popular magazines easily outstripped his $16 weekly salary at the Banner.
A couple of years later, Pelley was able to purchase a St. Johnsbury newspaper called the Caledonian at a steeply discounted price, because it had fallen on hard times. To serve the community properly, Pelley declared, a newspaper “must have no politics and no religion.”  
After only a year in charge, Pelley was ready to move on. The Methodist Episcopal Church hired him to study its missions around the world. His tour brought him to Europe and Asia, where he witnessed brutality related to the Russian Revolution. Pelley believed the false claim that the revolution had been incited as part of a vast Jewish conspiracy. He returned to America deeply anticommunist and antisemitic.
Having sold the Caledonian, Pelley moved to California, where he wrote scripts for the movie industry. But during his time in Hollywood, Pelley said he had a transformative experience. He claimed he had died and gone to heaven for seven minutes. During that time, he said, he met God and Jesus Christ, who told him to help bring about a religious transformation in the United States. Pelley interpreted the instructions to mean he should move to North Carolina and publish a Christian, fascist magazine. 
When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Pelley was ready, launching a paramilitary group called the Silver Legion in North Carolina. Its members were dubbed the Silver Shirts, inspired by Hitler’s brutal Brown Shirts. 
In 1936, like a real-life version of Buzz Windrip, Pelley ran for president. Unlike Windrip, he only managed to get on the ballot in one state and won 1,600 votes.
Pelley was called before the recently created House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1940 and accused of “fulsomely praising Hitler and of advocating dictatorship, vigilantism, and segregation of Jews.” A federal agent testified that Pelley had told her that he planned to organize a march on Washington, take over the government and implement Hitler’s program.
Two years later, with the United States having entered World War II, the federal government arrested Pelley and charged him with a dozen counts of making false and seditious statements, intent to cause insurrection within the military, and intent to obstruct military recruitment. A federal prosecutor called him “a tool of Axis propaganda.” The jury at his trial in federal court in Indiana convicted him on 11 counts. The judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison.
Pelley’s trial made news around the country. His career was finished and newspapers referred to him as the very thing that Lewis had warned about—a would-be American dictator.
For more on Pelley, see this 2018 review of his work from the Walloomsack Review.

Residents at Genesis HealthCare-run facilities in Vermont have reported numerous care and safety concerns over the years, including violations at two facilities in recent months.

Genesis HealthCare, a prominent nursing home provider in Vermont and one of the largest skilled nursing companies in the nation, filed for bankruptcy last week. 
Genesis currently operates three long-term care facilities in the state: the Bel Aire Center in Newport, the Mountain View Center in Rutland City and the Saint Albans Health & Rehabilitation, a spokesperson told VTDigger.
There are provisions in the bankruptcy filing to ensure staff at all Genesis-owned facilities, including the three in Vermont, retain positions, pay and benefits, for residents to continue receiving care during the court proceedings, and for the company’s vendor agreements to stay in place, according to the spokesperson. 
“There will be no expected impact to patient care as a result of this filing. Our daily operations remain unchanged, and our commitment to those we serve continues uninterrupted,” the spokesperson wrote.
According to bankruptcy documents filed in the Northern District of Texas U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Genesis has racked up between $1 billion and $10 billion in estimated liabilities, including over $700 million in unsecured claims to their 30 highest creditors. This includes $324 million in a real estate loan, over $103 million in deferred payroll taxes to the Internal Revenue Service and over $12 million owed to the New England Health Care Employees Pension Fund. 
Genesis faced challenges due to legacy debt, including “approximately $8 million per month in settlement and defense costs arising from alleged personal injury and wrongful death claims, most of which date back many years,” Genesis’ co-Chief Restructuring Officer Louis Robichaux IV wrote in the court document. 
Genesis skirted bankruptcy in the spring of 2021 after the private equity-backed company RenGen HealthCare provided an influx of capital, according to a case brief filed by Robichaux. RenGen, backed by Pinta Capital Partners, is also aiding Genesis’ “exit plan” through the form of a stalking horse bid, setting a minimum price for the company at auction, Robichaux wrote.
Three New York-based owners planned to take over five of the nine facilities Genesis owned in Vermont in 2020, including Bennington, Berlin, St. Johnsbury, Burlington and Springfield, after financial struggles, Covid-19 outbreaks, neglect cases and safety violations. According to reporting by Seven Days, the New York buyers dropped their bid for the five facilities in 2021 after state scrutiny into their previous management of facilities. 
The Genesis spokesperson wrote that the company has no current ownership stake and is not affiliated with any nursing homes other than the Bel Aire Center, the Mountain View Center and Saint Albans Health & Rehabilitation. 
However, Vermont’s business database shows that limited liability companies registered to six other facilities previously owned and operated by Genesis in Bennington, Berlin, Burlington, Rutland, Springfield and Saint Johnsbury were noted as affiliates or subsidiaries of Genesis in the bankruptcy filings. 
The spokesperson did not say why these limited liability companies were listed in the bankruptcy documents. The Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding the current ownership and operating companies of the six facilities. 
Genesis’ bankruptcy filing comes after the company has faced a number of controversies in recent years.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., spoke out against Genesis in 2021, calling the $5.2 million bonus to the company’s top executive amid patient deaths and Covid-19 outbreaks a display of “unfathomable greed.”
In one of the largest nursing home settlements in the state’s history, Genesis HealthCare entered a $740,000 settlement with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office in 2020, which created a patient care coordinator position and mandated at least two years of ongoing monitoring. 
The settlement followed four reports of neglect that resulted in a resident’s death and two residents being hospitalized at the then-Genesis-operated facilities Burlington Health & Rehab, Berlin Health & Rehab and St. Johnsbury Health & Rehab. 
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office sent a letter “identifying some concerns” to Genesis when the settlement ended in 2023, and there is no present ongoing monitoring, according to the office’s Chief of Staff Lauren Jandl. However, Division of Licensing and Protection surveys reveal recent deficiencies at the Mountain View Center and Saint Albans facility. 
In a survey of the Mountain View Center in June, residents said they were questioned by a staff member following a previous complaint and feared they would face retaliation if they spoke out about their concerns with care.
Another resident reported verbal abuse from a licensed nurse assistant after experiencing incontinence, according to the report. The division’s surveyors also found that a resident diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which affects the body’s ability to regulate temperature, reported inconsistent temperature being set in their room that caused the resident to be cold despite reporting concerns with the heating to staff. 
The division’s report stated that numerous medications, cleaning supplies and food kept past expiration dates were in view as well.
According to a January survey of the Saint Albans Health & Rehabilitation center, the division found the building had numerous environmental safety violations. The report included descriptions of cracks and bare plaster spots on walls, a displaced electric outlet, visible rust and brown stains on a heater and bathrooms with broken or no toilet paper holders and tiles that were caked in unknown substances. On April 2, the division conducted a revisit survey and found the center in compliance. 
Kaili Kuiper, the state’s long-term care ombudsman with Vermont Legal Aid, said the organization has heard complaints from residents at Genesis-operated facilities and other privately run, private equity-backed facilities in the state of poor food quality and staff turnover, which indicate challenges in providing “good quality, patient centered care.” 
Executive Director of the Long-Term Care Coalition, Richard Mallot, said the organization has tracked an increasing “corporatization of nursing home care” in which for-profit, and private equity health care providers cut costs, particularly staffing, at the expense of quality care. 
Mallot said low staffing and a lack of hours nurses have to spend with residents tend to indicate quality of care at nursing homes. Currently, the average nursing staff hours per day for residents in Genesis-operated facilities in the state is below the Vermont average and the expected amount set by the Long-Term Care Coalition.
Sam Piesch, a health policy analyst with the state’s Health Care Advocate’s Office at Vermont Legal Aid, said there is broad consensus and concern regarding increasing private equity ownership of nursing homes due to lack of quality care, staffing level and health outcomes. 
According to data with the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, 26% of nursing homes in the state are run by private equity or private equity-backed companies. With a large aging and elderly population, Piesch said Vermont faces a “dystopian challenge” with lack of viable health care and nursing home ownership and operating options.
Piesch said the state’s existing protections and transparency requirements for private equity ownership in health care and nursing homes are weak. He said Vermont Legal Aid is advocating for a bill, introduced this past legislative session, to increase health care transaction oversight and hopes the bill gains traction next session.
Piesch said the main objective of the bill is to arm regulatory bodies with strong state statutes to act upon when requirements for transactions are not being followed, to “prevent some of the worst harms” that result from the private-equity model in the health care industry from happening in Vermont in the future.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on July 17.
Watch out, Gov. Phil Scott – Dean Roy, a 14-year-old from Stowe, is running for your job.
It started as a bit of a joke with one of Roy’s teachers at Stowe Middle School. If Roy ever ran for office, the joke went, he’d have a campaign manager in his teacher.
Over time, it became less of a joke, and while Roy’s teacher isn’t running his campaign, the rising freshman hit the streets with a few of his peers last week collecting signatures. As of Monday, he had just shy of 100, with almost a year left to reach 500 and make his campaign official.
To be clear, Roy isn’t expecting to oust the Republican governor of nearly 10 years, and he understands when people tell him he’s too young for the job, but Roy is looking at the big picture. He said politics is his lifeblood, and he wants to start proving himself as a viable option for voters now.
Roy is running as part of the Freedom and Unity Party, which emerged in Vermont around 2022. As far as he knows, he would be the youngest third-party candidate for governor in the nation. In 2018, Ethan Sonneborn, a 13-year-old from Bristol ran for governor as a Democrat. Both Sonneborn and Roy benefit from a Vermont election rule that doesn’t set an age limit for running for public office.
Roy is no stranger to the Statehouse. Over the winter, he served as a legislative page in Montpelier, a distinction given to a handful of students throughout Vermont every year. He shadowed politicians, gained an inside look at the legislative process and mingled with a few of Vermont’s top lawmakers.
During one interaction, he challenged Lieutenant Governor John Rodgers on his electric vehicle stance. Rodgers has been outspoken about the negative impacts of the electric vehicle industry and, while their opinions differ, Roy still went a few rounds with Rodgers before they went their separate ways.
Roy’s campaign is centered around affordability and rising property taxes in Vermont, the number one issue facing the state right now, he added. Roy acknowledged the irony that, as a 14-year-old, he doesn’t own a home.
“When a kid in Vermont understands that there’s a housing and affordability crisis, that’s when you know it’s bad,” he said.
Scott might be his opponent for governor, but Roy applauded the work his administration has done to reform education spending in Vermont and reduce property taxes. Roy said H.454, the recently-signed education reform bill, isn’t perfect, and he admitted it might not be great for rural districts like his own, but he thinks the state must take big – and sometimes painful – steps if it’s going to save money for residents.
Roy leans conservative when it comes to finances, and he said a variety of political voices is important to creating good laws. But, like many conservatives in Vermont, he wants to keep it about the money. As for social issues, he believes women have a right to choose and he’s opposed to the way immigrants are being treated in Vermont and across the country.
“This country needs immigration reform badly,” Roy said. “No one should be pulled from the home, and it shouldn’t take decades to become a legal citizen in our country. That’s wrong.”
If elected, he would also work to restore Vermont’s relationship with its neighbors to the north, which has been tested by the President Donald Trump and his administration.
When it comes to hyperlocal issues, Roy said he’s witnessed how short-term rentals have impacted his hometown — those issues exist throughout the state, he added. Roy is a proponent of short-term rental caps and a five-percent tax on those properties statewide.
Part of his motivation for running is to engage his peers – Vermont’s youth – in politics. His friends Charlie Bass, Paul Slesar, JP Rozendaal and Roger Andelin have all been active in his campaign, and he wants to bring in more people.
“We’re all looking for something different,” Roy said, which is part of the reason he’s running as a third-party candidate.
Even if he doesn’t win, Roy wants to stay politically active. He’s currently vying for a letter of recommendation from Bernie Sanders – a political idol to Roy’s – to become a U.S. page in Washington D.C., a highly competitive process.
As for his political candidacy, voters can expect to see Roy on the ballot until he reaches office, he said.
“I want to do great things for the state of Vermont,” he added. “I know I’m young, but I hope I can get my name out there and start building some credibility this year. That way I can run a very serious campaign when it’s time.”

Insurers want higher premiums to cover the usual culprits — rising medical and labor costs and usage — but are tacking on extra percentage point increases in their 2026 rate proposals to cover effects of policy changes advanced by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. One key factor built into their filings with state insurance departments: uncertainty over whether Congress allows more generous, covid-era ACA tax subsidies to expire at the end of December.
“The out-of-pocket change for individuals will be immense, and many won’t actually be able to make ends meet and pay premiums, so they will go uninsured,” said JoAnn Volk, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.
Especially if the higher subsidies expire, insurance premiums will be among the first financial pains felt by health care consumers after policy priorities put forward by President Donald Trump and the GOP. Many other changes — such as additional paperwork requirements and spending cuts to Medicaid — won’t occur for at least another year. But spiking ACA premiums, as the nation heads into key midterm elections, invites political pushback. Some on Capitol Hill are exploring ways to temper the subsidy reductions.
“I am hearing on both sides — more from Republicans, but from both the House and Senate” — that they are looking for levers they can pull, said Pennsylvania-based insurance broker Joshua Brooker, who follows legislative actions as part of his job and sits on several insurance advisory groups.
In initial filings, insurers nationally are seeking a median rate increase — meaning half of the proposed increases are lower and half higher — of 15%, according to an analysis for the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker covering 19 states and the District of Columbia. KFF is a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
That’s up sharply from the last few years. For the 2025 plan year, for example, KFF found that the median proposed increase was 7%.
Health insurers “are doing everything in their power to shield consumers from the rising costs of care and the uncertainty in the market driven by recent policy changes,” wrote Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, the industry’s lobbying group. The emailed response also called on lawmakers “to take action to extend the health care tax credits to prevent skyrocketing cost increases for millions of Americans in 2026.”
Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to requests for comment.
These are initial numbers and insurance commissioners in some states may alter requests before approval.
Still, “it’s the biggest increase we’ve seen in over five years,” said analysis co-author Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA.
Premiums will vary based on where consumers live, the type of plan they choose, and their insurer.
For example, Maryland insurers have requested increases ranging from 8.1% to 18.7% for the upcoming plan year, according to an analysis of a smaller set of insurers by Georgetown University researchers. A much larger swing is seen in New York, where one carrier is asking for less than a 1% increase, while another wants 66%. Maryland rate filings indicated the average statewide increase would shrink to 7.9% from 17.1% — if the ACA’s enhanced tax credits are extended.
Most insurers are asking for 10% to 20% increases, the KFF report says, with several factors driving those increases. For instance, insurers say underlying medical costs — including the use of expensive obesity drugs — will add about 8% to premiums for next year. And most insurers are also adding 4% above what they would have charged had the enhanced tax credits been renewed.
But rising premiums are just part of the picture.
A bigger potential change for consumers’ pocketbooks hinges on whether Congress decides to extend more generous tax credits first put in place during President Joe Biden’s term as part of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, then extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
Those laws raised the subsidy amounts people could receive based on their household income and local premium costs and removed a cap that had barred higher earners from even partial subsidy assistance. Higher earners could still qualify for some subsidy but first had to chip in 8.5% of their household income toward the premiums.
Across the board, but especially among lower-income policyholders, bigger subsidies helped fuel record enrollment in ACA plans.
But they’re also costly.
A permanent extension could cost $335 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Such an extension was left out of the policy law Trump signed on July 4 that he called the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Without action, the extra subsidies will expire at the end of this year, after which the tax credits will revert to less generous pre-pandemic levels.
That means two things: Most enrollees will be on the hook to pay a larger share of their premiums as assistance from federal tax credits declines. Secondly, people whose household income exceeds four times the federal poverty level — $84,600 for a couple or $128,600 for a family of four this year — won’t get any subsidies at all.
If the subsidies expire, policy experts estimate, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise by an average of more than 75%. In some states, ACA premiums could double.
“There will be sticker shock,” said Josh Schultz, strategic engagement manager at Softheon, a New York consulting firm that provides enrollment, billing, and other services to about 200 health insurers, many of which are bracing for enrollment losses.
And enrollment could fall sharply. The Wakely Consulting Group estimates that the combination of expiring tax credits, the Trump law’s new paperwork, and other requirements will result in ACA enrollment dropping by as much as 57%.
According to KFF, insurers added premium increases of around 4% just to cover the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, which they fear will lead to lower enrollment. That would further raise costs, insurers say, because people who are less healthy are more likely to grit their teeth and reenroll, leaving insurers with a smaller, but sicker, pool of members.
Less common in the filings submitted so far, but noticeable, are increases pegged to Trump administration tariffs, Cox said.
“What they are assuming is tariffs will drive drug costs up significantly, with some saying that can have around a 3-percentage-point increase” in premiums as a result, she said.
Consumers will learn their new premium prices only late in the fall, or when open enrollment for the ACA begins on Nov. 1 and they can start shopping around.
Congress could still act, and discussions are ongoing, said insurance broker Brooker.
Some lawmakers, he said, are consulting with the CBO about the fiscal and coverage effects of various scenarios that don’t extend the subsidies as they currently exist but may offer a middle ground. One possibility involves allowing subsidies for families earning as much as five or six times the poverty level, he said.
But any such effort will draw pushback.
Some conservative think tanks, such as the Paragon Health Institute, say the more generous subsides led people to fudge their incomes to qualify and led to other types of fraud, such as brokers signing people up for ACA plans without authorization.
But others note that many consumers — Democratic and Republican — have come to rely on the additional assistance. Not extending it could be risky politically. In 2024, 56% of ACA enrollees lived in Republican congressional districts, and 76% were in states won by Trump.
Allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire could also reshape the market.
Brooker said some people may drop coverage. Others will shift to plans with lower premiums but higher deductibles. One provision of Trump’s new tax law allows people enrolled in either “bronze” or “catastrophic”-level ACA plans, which are usually the cheapest, to qualify for health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside money, tax-free, to cover health care costs.
“Naturally, if rates do start going up the way we anticipate, there will be a migration to lower-cost options,” Brooker said.

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)Since taking office Jan. 20, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders that forced businesses, schools, universities and state and federal agencies to dismantle all diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
Describing Black America as in a “state of emergency,” the National Urban League said the directives show the federal government is “determined to sacrifice its founding principles—equality, liberty, and justice—rather than accept the truth of a diversifying nation and deliver equitable opportunity for all.’’
The National Urban League, a civil rights and advocacy organization focused on economic empowerment of Black and other underserved communities, is scheduled to release its annual State of Black America 2025 report Thursday morning at 8:30 at its conference in Cleveland.
In an executive summary, it credits the Voting Rights Act of 1965 with the “true birth of American democracy.” But the federal government under Trump has “set fire to policies and entire departments dedicated to protecting civil and human rights, providing access to an equal education, fair housing, safe and effective healthcare, and ensuring that our democratic process is adhered to across the nation,” the executive summary said.
Yet despite those actions, Americans bolstered by the civil rights community are pushing back. The group pointed to lawsuits filed across the country by state attorneys general, governors and civil rights groups, including the National Urban League, NAACP Legal Defense Funds and Lambda Legal. As of May 23, 247 cases challenging Trump administration policies had been filed in federal courts.
“There is a state of emergency in Black America, and our report this year is a warning and rallying cry as civil rights protections are being unraveled,” said Marc Morial, National Urban League president and CEO, during a briefing ahead of the report’s release. “Democracy is under siege. What began as what we thought were fringe attacks on racial equity has now become national policy.”

Since 2013, U.S. Supreme Court decisions have struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act that required federal preclearance in communities with a history of racial discrimination before making changes to voting practices, the report notes. And after a 2023 decision that declared affirmative action unconstitutional in college admissions, the National Urban League said the ruling threatens the ability to sue over racial discrimination in voting and to challenge district maps. Other voting-related practices from mail-in ballots and early voting to requirements to provide voting materials in languages other than English are at risk, the group said.
The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, once a protection against discriminatory practices, is now seen as a threat to enforcement of civil rights laws that could become a “tool of retribution,” the report summary said. Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump attorney and election denier, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in April to serve as assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, one of the largest at Justice. Dhillon also opposed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act Amendment in an op-ed which would have restored the landmark law, the executive summary said.
The group defended the value of diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that it “protects and advances democratic ideals.” But the Trump administration has targeted colleges, universities and businesses “for simply having the words diversity and inclusion as part of their mission,’’ adding that Michigan and Columbia universities were forced to end their programs.
“In short, DEI policies don’t just level the playing field in education and employment; they fortify democracy itself. By expanding opportunities, ensuring equitable access to information, and creating leadership pipelines, DEI helps guarantee that every American—not just the privileged few— can contribute to the nation’s future,’’ the group said in the summary.
‘Dividing America’
The report also notes how hate and extremist views are more prevalent on social media that began to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic and the acquisition of Twitter (now X) in 2022 by billionaire Elon Musk. The summary said that a day later, right-wing accounts on the platform jumped while those with progressive views dropped. And two years later during the election, accounts of progressive candidates were “banned without explanation.”










In short, DEI policies don’t just level the playing field in education and employment; they fortify democracy itself ... DEI helps guarantee that every American — not just the privileged few — can contribute to the nation’s future.


– National Urban League


A study published in February by researchers from the University of Southern California’s Viterbi Information Sciences Institute showed that general hate speech increased by 50% and transphobic slurs increased by 260%. The study analyzed posts between January 2022 and June 2023.
“People have become very adept at misinformation, disinformation. But my mother called it something different: She said it was lying,” Morial said.
One way to counter that, he said, is increasing voter turnout in next year’s midterm elections and in local elections this year such as mayoral races in Atlanta, New York City and New Orleans.
“I think people should host town hall meetings. I think people should make their voices known on social media,” Morial said. “All of this is important to building a bulwark of resistance. What are we resisting? We’re resisting [a] dividing America. We’re resisting an America where the agenda is white supremacy or white nationalism. But it also is the fight for a multiracial American democracy.”
The report includes nearly two dozen contributors such as congressional officials, attorneys and civil rights activists with a focus on the official name of this year’s report: “State of Emergency: Civil Rights, Democracy & Progress Under Attack.”
Beth Lynk, executive director of the When We All Vote initiative established by former first lady Michelle Obama in 2018, wrote an essay in the report entitled, “A Revised Movement for Democracy – On the Ground and in the Culture.”
“Voting rights is the foundation of all other rights in this country,” she said in an interview Monday. “This essay is really a call to action understanding that we can empower Black Americans to shape the next chapter of our democracy, as we always have from the ground up, by reimagining voter education and registration.”
Lynk noted how Maryland has crafted policies to protect voting rights, crediting Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Maryland), chair of the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, who worked with other caucus leaders.
One topic missing from the National Urban League’s executive summary this year: reparations.
For the first time, the Maryland caucus officially endorsed the creation of a Reparations Commission in a bill that passed this year. Maryland became one of the few states in the nation to assess “appropriate benefits” for those affected by “historical inequity.”
But Gov. Wes Moore (D), the nation’s only Black governor, vetoed the bill in May. With the caucus’s backing and a Democratic majority in the General Assembly, legislators and advocates are confident that a veto override will take place when the legislature returns in session.
“We strongly believe that it’s essential to see this commission through [and] bring it to fruition, especially at a time like this as we’re seeing the most grave attacks and threats to our freedoms since Reconstruction,” Wilkins said. “Now is the time for us to boldly go forward here in the state of Maryland around repairing harms, while we continue to fight back around the present attacks on our freedoms.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Montior)When North Dakota state Sen. Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
  Sens. Ryan Braunberger, left, and Jeff Barta co-sponsored legislation to seal some eviction records. (Photos provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”
The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
Compromises
Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Bills seek to add protections for North Dakota renters

Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
Elsewhere
Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.
This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Halle Parker/Verite News)SHREVEPORT — When Robert Smith met his future girlfriend in 2010, he wanted to take things slowly. For Smith, no relationship had been easy in the years since he was diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. People often became afraid when they learned his status, even running away when he coughed.
The couple waited months to have sex until Smith felt he could share his medical status. To prepare her, Smith said, he took his girlfriend to his job in HIV prevention at the Philadelphia Center, a northwestern Louisiana nonprofit that offers resources to people with HIV, which also provided him housing at the time.
Finally, he revealed the news: Smith was diagnosed with HIV in 1994 and started taking daily antiviral pills in 2006. The virus could no longer be detected in his blood, and he couldn’t transmit it to a sexual partner.
Smith said his girlfriend seemed comfortable knowing his status. When it came to sex, there was no hesitation, he said. But a couple of years later, when Smith wanted to break up, he said, her tone shifted.
“She was like, ‘If you try to leave me, I’m gonna put you in jail,’” recalled Smith, now 68. “At the time, I really didn’t know the sincerity of it.”
After they broke up, she reported him to the police, accusing him of violating a little-known law in Louisiana — a felony called “intentional exposure to HIV.” He disputed the allegations, but in 2013 accepted a plea deal to spend six months in prison on the charge. He had a few months left on parole from a past conviction on different charges, and Smith thought this option would let him move past the relationship faster. He didn’t realize the conviction would also land him on the state’s sex offender registry.
For nearly two decades, Smith had dealt with the stigma associated with having HIV; the registry added another layer of exclusion, severely restricting where he could live and work to avoid minors. Not many people want to hire a sex offender, he said. Smith has been told by the local sheriff’s office he’s not allowed to do simple things, like go to a public park or a high school football game, since the conviction.
“I’ve been undetectable for 15 years, but that law still punishes us,” Smith said.
Louisiana is one of 30 states with criminal penalties related to exposing or transmitting HIV. Most of the laws were passed in the 1980s during the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. Since then, several states have amended their laws to make them less punitive or repealed them outright, including Maryland and North Dakota this year.
But Louisiana’s law remains among the harshest. The state is one of five that may require people such as Smith to register as a sex offender if convicted, a label that can follow them for over a decade. And state lawmakers considered a bill to expand the law to apply to other sexually transmitted infections, then failed to pass it before the session ended.

Meanwhile, people with HIV also face the threat that federal funding cuts will affect their access to treatment, along with prevention efforts, supportive services, and outreach. Such strategies have proved to slow the HIV/AIDS epidemic, unlike the laws’ punitive approach.
The tax and domestic policy law previously known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” will likely affect HIV-positive people enrolled in Medicaid by reducing federal support for Medicaid and restricting eligibility. About 40% of adults under 65 with HIV rely on Medicaid.
The Trump administration proposed in its fiscal 2026 budget request to eliminate HIV prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to cancel a grant that helps fund housing for people with HIV. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, the largest federal fund dedicated to supporting HIV-positive people, also faces cuts. The program serves more than half of the people in the U.S. diagnosed with HIV, including in Louisiana, according to the health information nonprofit KFF.
Public health officials maintain that state laws criminalizing HIV exposure hurt efforts to end the HIV epidemic. Epidemiologists and other experts on AIDS agree that the enforcement of such laws is often shaped by fear, not science. For example, in many states that criminalize HIV exposure, people living with HIV can face heightened criminal penalties for actions that can’t transmit the virus, such as spitting on someone. The laws further stigmatize and deter people from getting tested and treatment, undermining response to the epidemic, experts say.
At least 4,400 people in 14 states have been arrested under these laws, though data is limited and the actual number is likely higher, and the arrests aren’t decreasing, according to analyses by UCLA’s Williams Institute.
“ Some people think it’s an issue that’s gone away, and that simply isn’t the case,” said Nathan Cisneros, a researcher at the Williams Institute.
In Louisiana, a 2022 Williams Institute analysis found at least 147 allegations reported to law enforcement under the state’s HIV law from 2011 to mid-2022. Black people made up nearly three-quarters of the people convicted and placed on the sex offender registry. Most were Black men, like Smith. At the time of the analysis, Black people made up about two-thirds of HIV diagnoses in the state.
“ We see over and over that Black people are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic and disproportionately affected by policing and incarceration in the United States,” Cisneros said.
Nationally, other marginalized groups such as women, sex workers, the queer community, or people who overlap across more than one group are also disproportionately arrested and prosecuted under similar criminalization laws, Cisneros said.
Ensnared in the system
Louisiana’s law hinges on the requirement that if a person knows they have HIV, they must disclose their HIV status and receive consent before exposing someone to the virus.
Louisiana District Attorneys Association Executive Director Zach Daniels said these cases don’t come up often and can be difficult to prosecute. Daniels said the intimate nature of the cases can lead to little evidence in support of either side, especially if the accuser doesn’t contract HIV.
When it comes to talking about one’s sex life, Daniels said, “there are often no other witnesses, besides the two participants.”
Louisiana’s law is written so that “intentional exposure” can occur through “any means or contact.” That includes sex and needle-sharing, practices known to transmit the virus. But the language of the law is so broad that actions known not to transmit the virus — like biting or scratching — could be included, said Dietz, the statewide coordinator for the Louisiana Coalition on Criminalization and Health, an advocacy network founded by people living with HIV that has opposed the law.
The broad nature of the law creates opportunities for abuse, as the threat of being reported under the law can be used as a coercive tool in relationships, said Dietz, who goes by one name and uses they/them pronouns. Such threats, Dietz said, have kept people in abusive relationships and loomed over child custody battles. Dietz said they’ve supported people accused of exposing their children to HIV in ways that are not medically possible.
“ ‘Any means or contact’ could be just merely being around your kids,” they said.
The prosecutors’ organization still supports the law as a recourse for emergency responders who, in rare instances, come into contact with blood or syringes containing the virus. In one recent high-profile case in New Orleans, the law was used against a local DJ accused of knowingly transmitting HIV to several women without informing them of his status or using a condom.
The person accused of violating the law, not the accuser, must prove their case — that they disclosed their HIV status beforehand. Without a signed affidavit or tape recording, courts can end up basing their decisions on conflicting testimonies with little supporting evidence.

That’s what Smith alleged happened to him.
After his relationship ended, he said, he remembered being called into a meeting with his parole officer where a detective waited for him, asking about his former relationship and whether his girlfriend had known about his HIV status.
Smith said yes. But that’s not what she had told police.
Verite News could not find a working phone number for Smith’s former girlfriend but corroborated the story with the incident’s police report. His attorney at the time, a public defender named Carlos Prudhomme, said he didn’t remember much about the case, and court documents are sealed because it was a sex offense.
In court, it was her word against his. So when he was offered six months in prison instead of the 10-year maximum, he switched his plea from not guilty to guilty. But he said he didn’t know his new conviction would require him to register as a sex offender once he got out — worsening the stigma.
“When people see ‘sex offender,’ the first thing that comes to their mind is rape, child molester, predator,” Smith said. “This law puts me in a category that I don’t care to be in.”
He has tried to make the most of it, despite the expense of paying fees each year to re-register. After being rejected from jobs, he started a catering business and built a loyal clientele. But he said he’s still stuck living in a poorly maintained apartment complex primarily inhabited by sex offenders.
“I understand their strategy for creating this law to prevent the spread, but it’s not helping. It’s hurting; it’s hindering. It’s destroying people’s lives instead of helping people’s lives, especially the HIV community,” he said. “They don’t care about us.”
The case for reform
Since 2014, there has been a nationwide effort to update or repeal state laws that criminalize HIV nondisclosure, exposure, or transmission. A dozen states have changed their laws to align more closely with modern science, and four have gotten rid of them completely in hopes of reducing stigma and improving public health outcomes, according to the Center for HIV Law and Policy.
Sean McCormick, an attorney with the center, said these changes are influenced partly by a growing body of evidence showing the laws’ negative consequences.
McCormick said the laws offer a “clear disincentive” for people to get tested for HIV. If they don’t know their status, there’s no criminal liability for transmission or exposure.
A 2024 survey by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and DLH Corp. researchers found that after California updated its HIV criminalization law in 2018, respondents were more likely to get tested. Meanwhile, survey respondents in Nevada, which still had a more punitive law on the books, were less likely to get tested.
There’s no one-size-fits-all solution, McCormick said. His center works with HIV-positive people across the country to determine what legislative changes would work best in their states.
Texas was the first to repeal its HIV law in 1994.
“As a person living with HIV in Texas, I’m deeply appreciative that we don’t have an HIV-specific statute that puts a target on my back,” said Michael Elizabeth, the public health policy director for the Equality Federation.
But Elizabeth points out that Texans living with HIV still face steeper penalties under general felony laws for charges such as aggravated assault or aggravated sexual assault after state courts in Texas equated the bodily fluids of a person with HIV with a “deadly weapon.”
Louisiana activists have pushed lawmakers in the state to amend the law in three ways: removing the sex offender registration requirement, requiring transmission to have occurred, and requiring clear intent to transmit the virus.
“Our strategy, as opposed to repeal, is to create a law that actually addresses the kind of boogeyman that they ostensibly created the law for: the person who successfully, maliciously, intentionally transmits HIV,” said Dietz with the Louisiana Coalition on Criminalization and Health.
In 2018, a bill to narrow the statute was amended in ways that expanded the law. For example, the updated law no longer had any definition of which actions “expose” someone to HIV.
In 2023, state lawmakers created a task force that recommended updating Louisiana’s law to align with the latest public health guidelines, limit the potential for unintended consequences, and give previously convicted people a way to clear their record.
Lawmakers in the state House pushed forward a bill this year to criminalize other sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B and the herpes simplex virus. That bill died in the Senate, but it spurred the creation of another legislative task force with a nearly identical mission to that of the first.
“ This state has no idea how closely we just dodged a bullet,” Dietz said.

In the meantime, the Louisiana coalition is helping Smith petition the state to take his name off the sex offender registry. Louisiana law allows people to petition to have their names removed from the registry after 10 years without any new sex crime convictions. Smith expects his case to be approved by the end of the year.
Despite the difficulty of the past 12 years, he said, he’s grateful for the chance to be free from the registry’s restrictions.
“It’s like a breath of fresh air,” Smith said. “I can do stuff that I wanted to do that I couldn’t. Like, go to a football game. Simple stuff like that, I’m going to be ready to do.”

An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
On its surface, the Connecticut River can be deceptive. On a sultry, partly overcast afternoon in early July, the river appeared to be in no rush to complete its meandering 410-mile journey to Long Island Sound.
Under the water, however, forces were at work that grabbed the attention of ferry Captain Blaise Clemente.
“This current’s unbelievable today. Sorry, Sal,” Clemente called out to his first mate as the two worked in tandem to turn their tug, the “Cumberland,” so that it faced into the river for the next crossing to Glastonbury. The mate, Sal Carta, stood alongside on a barge handling the ropes while Clemente got a feel for the tides, which can shift up to 2 feet even 50 miles inland.
Each trip across the river takes Clemente about four minutes. It’s one he’s made hundreds of times a week for the last two decades since he joined the crew of the nation’s oldest continuously operated ferry service.
“You do anything 300,000 times, you know, you get it down,” Clemente said as he approached the landing slip. “But you have to be more cautious here. You don’t want to bang in, you don’t want to hit the pilings. You don’t want to jar anybody.”
Before he took this job in 2004, Clemente owned a brokerage operating on the floor of the Boston Stock Exchange — he still carries the city’s distinctive accent — while filling his spare time on a lobster boat on Massachusetts Bay. But if he had hoped for a more relaxing career on the water, the reality proved a bit more challenging.
“It has its own tension,” he said. “Some days we do between 80 and 100 crossings a day, and every single one, it’s safety. You get three cars and 18 passengers, and regardless of how long the trip is, your license is at risk every single time you cross, so you have to have a good crew.”
Clemente, who serves as the ferry’s master captain, splits the route with two other captains, along with two mates and a summer intern. During the off season, the crew works on maintaining the boats for the next season, use up their vacation time and, when the weather requires, take turns driving snow plows for the state Department of Transportation.
“There’s certainly a lot of maintenance that has to be done, and during the coldest months of the year, for only a four-month period, it’s hard to do,” said Paul Costello, who served as a ferry captain for seven years before taking another job at the Department of Transportation last November. “You can’t put the boats inside and work on them, so you’ve got to work around the weather.”

When it opened in 1655, the Rocky Hill-Glastonbury Ferry was one of several private raft-and-pole operations that were used to transport people and livestock across the growing colonies. Its slightly younger sibling, the Chester-Hadlyme Ferry, began operations in 1769. (The state’s first bridge crossing Connecticut River opened in 1808 between Enfield and Suffield.)
The number of ferry crossings in Connecticut peaked at around 30 near the end of the 18th century, according to ConnecticutHistory.org. Over time, rafts gave way to boats that were pulled by ropes, horses and eventually steam engines. As more permanent bridges were built, however, the number of ferries dwindled until the DOT eventually took over the last three remaining river crossings between 1915 and 1917. Shortly afterwards, the state closed Bissell’s Ferry in Windsor due to its dwindling use.
Since then, the ferries’ role in providing transportation has continued to evolve.
The current setup for the Rocky Hill-Glastonbury crossing, known as “towing on the hip,” consists of a tugboat that is secured to the side of a barge — the “Hollister III” — that carries cars, bicycles and passengers on foot. The Chester-Hadlyme Ferry, meanwhile, uses a single vessel, known as the “Selden III.”
Clemente estimated that roughly 90% of his passengers today are sightseers or infrequent customers — including the occasional traveler, following a GPS, who’s surprised to see the route leading onto a boat. The number of regular commuters has dropped since the pandemic, he said, when the ferry service shut down for several months.
The ferry operates annually between April 1 and Nov. 30, though its opening is sometimes delayed due to high waters, as was the case earlier this year. Fares are $5 per vehicle ($6 on weekends) and $2 for pedestrians and cyclists. Starting last year, passengers could purchase tickets through an app, Token Transit.
Beyond serving as a novelty for tourists and the occasional waylaid driver, the ferry also offers a convenient commuting option for a small number of residents on each side of the river. Without it, a 4-minute crossing becomes a 13-mile trek on highways that can take 20 minutes or more — without traffic.

“I usually come around 4:30 p.m., when everyone’s coming home from work,” said Lisa Lankton of Rocky Hill, who takes the ferry about four times a week to visit her grandchildren in Glastonbury. “It cuts out so much traffic. That time of day, going over the Putnam Bridge and going over [Interstate] 91 is a lot longer.”
Lankton added that while on the ferry, she has a few minutes to catch up on a book or simply enjoy being on the water. “Sometimes I’ll get carried away and I’m like, ‘Oh, we’re there already!'”
The ferry has also become a source of local pride, which swells up whenever leaders in Hartford — during occasional periods of belt tightening — propose cutting the service. Even more modest proposals to raise revenues from the ferries, including selling ads, have prompted pushback.
The yearbook of nearby Rocky Hill School even takes its name, “The Cumberland,” from the tug that drives the ferry.
“They talk about putting in a bridge every once in a while,” said Mark Packard, whose family has lived in the area since before the ferry opened three centuries ago. “I don’t know if you’ve ever been over here in South Glastonbury, but it’s a little chunk of farmland that hasn’t changed much in a very long time. [We’re] not interested in having a bridge with all kinds of cars coming through.”
As a kid growing up in Rocky Hill, Sandy Doran said she would take the trip every few weeks with her friends or while running errands with her family. 
“We would take our bikes and go take the ferry,” she said. “My sister had riding lessons in Glastonbury, so she and I would go over there, and I would wait through her lesson and then we’d head back.”
Decades later, she still takes the ferry on outings with her 10-year-old grandson, Henrik.
“This is such a unique experience,” she said during a recent trip. “Not every town has a nice ferry that goes from town to town.”
It costs the state roughly $1.4 million a year to operate both ferries, with roughly $900,000 of that coming from federal funds, according to the DOT. Total ridership last year surpassed 100,000 passengers and 45,000 vehicles.
Last year, the department also announced plans to upgrade the landing sites on either side of the river — in Rocky Hill and Glastonbury — by installing fencing, a new gate system and sidewalk and lighting improvements for pedestrian access. The project is expected to cost $600,000, to be completed during the upcoming off season.
For Clemente, the value of the ferry is more that a measure of its ridership or a line item on the budget.
“We’ve never lost a boat, we never lost a car off the deck, we’ve never had a collision, we’ve never had any of that,” the captain said. “You know, obviously we can’t handle the volume of a bridge, but I don’t believe that’s why this ferry is here. It’s to service the local community. It’s been doing so for 370 years.”

Crossing the river, Clemente and his fellow captains have to steer the barge in a sweeping arc, both to avoid a large sandbar on the Glastonbury side and so that they come into the slip at a perpendicular angle in case they need to back up. “At low water and low tide, you’ve got to be on your toes,” he said.
Still, Clemente said, the biggest hazard on the river comes from other boaters, particularly on the weekends.
“Rocky Hill’s boat launch is probably the best on the river, and it gets busy,” he said. “You have to keep a proper lookout.” 
The crew’s summer intern, Makaela Wasik, recently returned for her third season in the ferry service. In the winter, she attends school at Central Connecticut State University, but she also hopes to get her own captain’s license one day.
Her biggest surprise on the job? “Honestly, how many people don’t know how to use a parking brake,” she said with a laugh.
Robert Laughlin, the executive director of the Glastonbury Historical Society, is a relatively recent convert of the ferry. Growing up in the area, he said he’d frequently drive past the landing area. But it wasn’t until after moving back to Glastonbury during the pandemic that he actually ventured on board.
On the deck of the “Hollister III,” Laughlin discovered “beautiful” views of the river and “a nice little seafood place” on the other side, the Ferry Grill, serving lobster rolls, fried calamari and other creations. Now it’s a trip he makes every so often.
“I call it my mini vacation,” Laughlin said. “A four-minute cruise across the Connecticut River.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CROSSING-CT-FERRY-0711-DE-420-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-20 05:56:12.692669

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Now that her killer has been sentenced to life in prison, what is there left to say about the death of Zoey Felix?
We must do more.
The 5-year-old Topeka girl was raped and murdered at a Topeka homeless encampment in October 2023. Her killer was Mickel Cherry, then 25, a family acquaintance she called “uncle.” Cherry, who confessed to police and later struck a plea deal with prosecutors to avoid the death penalty, was given 50 years in prison July 15 by a Shawnee County district judge.
From the start, the case has been gut-wrenching.
It’s also been difficult for me to write about, because the suffering of children gets to me in the way other tragedies don’t. When I was a young reporter I covered deaths involving children, and they always left me shaken. Some were deliberately killed, others died in house fires or car wrecks. My reaction got so bad that I couldn’t pass one of those ubiquitous “Prevent Child Abuse” billboards without shedding tears.
With the Zoey Felix case, it’s not just the horrific way in which she died, but the revelations about the multiple failures by the people and agencies Zoey should have depended on for help that get to me.
There was, according to court filings, the unstable and violent family life, a home where there was no water or electricity, a mother who abused substances, and a father who eventually brought Zoey to live in a homeless encampment in a wooded area in southeast Topeka. The family had declined requests from child protective services for help, and the state did not press the issue. About the only kindness she experienced in her short life was from neighbors, who worried about her roaming the streets at all hours and sometimes provided her with food and clothing.
Perhaps most damning of all were multiple investigations by the Kansas Department for Children and Families into Zoey’s welfare, none of which resulted in removing her from the environment. According to a filing by Cherry’s defense counsel, DCF determined that Zoey had only a slightly higher than average risk of being hurt or suffering other lasting “negative effects.” In September 2023, the department sent investigators out seven times, but they were unable to locate the family and the case was closed.
Zoey was killed Oct. 2.
“Had the agencies responsible for Z.F.’s safety taken action by communicating, verifying information, and pursuing protective custody, her trajectory could have been different,” wrote Peter Conley, a deputy defender in the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit, in a memorandum to the court asking for concurrent, instead of consecutive, 25-year sentences. “She would not have been forced to live in a tent in the woods, nor left in the care of a traumatized person (Cherry) unfit to care for her.”
Her death, Conley argued, was avoidable.
While Cherry bears the ultimate responsibility for his actions, Conley said, he did not create the systems that failed him — and Zoey — in similar ways.
Conley described Cherry as a “developmentally delayed” individual who grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive home and who did not receive the help he needed from Texas child services. He had been passed to 17 foster homes, been in two psychiatric hospitals, had no high school degree, and had been diagnosed as a child with retinitis pigmentosa, an incurable genetic eye disease.
“Mickel could have and should have had interventions such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy,” according to the court filing. “Medicaid would have covered this expense. He should have also been receiving more regular counseling and psychiatric visits given his traumatic childhood and the number of adverse childhood events he experienced.”
Conley argued the trauma and failures experienced by both Mickel and Zoey were similar.
“Mickel has lived an extraordinarily difficult life where he was first abused by his parents and then by the system in place to protect children like him,” he said in the filing. “The same system in Kansas allowed Z.F. to fall through the cracks to allow her to be in a position of being babysat by a developmentally delayed homeless man from Texas.”
Zoey’s death resulted in a statewide conversation about child victims of violent crime. In October 2023, I attended a candlelight vigil in downtown Topeka in memory of murdered children. At that time, one-third of all homicide victims for the year — 10 in all — had been children.
There was a clamor in the wake of Zoey’s murder about improving the state’s child protective services, whose administrative errors resulted in the girl not getting the help she needed. Recently, I asked the Kansas Department for Children and Families whether there had been any meaningful reforms since 2023.
“The safety and well-being of every child under the care of the Kansas Department for Children and Families is the top priority of the agency,” Jenalea Randall, DCF’s director of public and government affairs, wrote in an email. “Unfortunately, Zoey Felix’s story reflects systemic challenges and the need for resources to help families that go beyond any one agency — such as assisting the homeless population.”
After Zoey’s death in 2023, the DCF undertook an internal review resulting in policy revisions to provide guidance to child protection specialists and supervisors on when to contact law enforcement in cases when the well-being of a child may be at risk and the family cannot be located.
“During the 2024 Kansas Legislative session, the agency worked to pass HB 2628, which ensures the public receives timely information about tragic cases such as this one,” the email said.
That measure, aimed to allow the release of information about individual cases where there is pressing legislative and public interest, became law in 2024.
“DCF also sponsored legislation during the session that would have made it easier for families like Zoey’s to access additional services, decreasing the likelihood of this situation happening again,” she wrote. “Unfortunately, the Kansas Legislature did not take up those measures.”
This month, Randall said, DCF began contacting families every day of the week, including weekends and holidays, when there was a report from law enforcement that a child could be a victim of abuse or neglect.
“DCF continues to look for ways to increase transparency and better support families, especially those who are homeless,” she said.
Progress had been made, she asserted, and the department remains committed to working with other agencies and partners to “strengthen the state’s safety net and ensure all Kansas families get the assistance they need.”
But is any of this meaningful reform?
It’s good public relations, I suppose, but declaring goals and intent is short of providing evidence of meaningful change.
Kansas families aren’t getting the assistance they need. It only takes a walk around most Kansas towns to realize the state’s safety net is fraying badly. From the woman sitting on the curb outside the local Walmart panhandling to buy food to the homeless individuals, mostly men, moving their camps ever deeper into remote areas to avoid the bulldozing of tent camps too near trails and parks, there’s ample evidence that people are hurting.
There were 534 individuals experiencing homelessness in Topeka as of January 2025, according to local government reports. That’s an increase of more than 100 over the 2023 figures. Of the most recent count, nearly 1 in 5 were under the age of 18.
Being unhoused places children in particular immediate peril and may have lasting physical and psychological effects. The number of homeless students in Topeka and Shawnee County schools is estimated to be between 750 and 1,000, far higher than the January 2025 “Point in Time” homeless count.
There are, to be sure, services offered in Topeka and across Kansas for students and families experiencing homelessness. Some of those initiatives are new, including a “one-stop” multi-agency resource center called “Let’s Help” at 245 S.W. MacVicar Ave.
But such initiatives require homeless individuals be amenable to help. Unfortunately for Zoey, her family could not or would not seek the help they needed, and the state’s child protective services failed to act when she needed them most.
Nothing will bring Zoey back.
There is little to say about the manner of Zoey’s death that has not already been documented in news reports or court filings. The public wouldn’t have learned her name had she not been the victim in a capital murder case. It disturbs me now — just like looking at that billboard long ago — that her name is forever linked to collective societal failure for which she paid the ultimate price. But the dead are beyond our help. To honor Zoey’s memory, we must aid the living.
Our communities — the services they provide, their appearance, the joy and the suffering that occurs in their homes and on their streets or at tent camps hidden away from public view — are ultimately expressions of our collective values. Too often our desire is to look away, to ignore the failures of compassion in our midst, to close our eyes to the unhappiness around us. If Zoey’s death has moved you, then give your time and your money to those agencies in the community fighting hunger, homelessness and neglect. And the next time you encounter a situation in which a child in your presence is in need of help, do not turn away.
Be like the neighbors in Zoey’s block.
Provide food or water or clothes if you can do so safely. Summon the help from any of the agencies available, including DCF. Call the police if there is reason to believe the child is in immediate danger. Do this in Zoey’s memory.
The tragedy is not just the way in which Zoey Felix died, but in the years denied her. Those years will now presumably be spent in prison by Cherry, who received consecutive sentences for the rape and murder and will serve at least 50 years before he is eligible for parole.
His eye disease will, according to the memorandum filed by his defense attorneys, progress. He will probably go blind during his incarceration.
It is not justice. It is simply an unhappy fact in the jumble of unhappy facts of an unhappy life. As his defense attorneys said in their court filing, Cherry never stood a chance.
Neither did Zoey.
But the living children in need among us do.

Earlier in my career I may have been the guy you heard, both on WHCN/Hartford and later on NBC.  When I started in radio in 1967, AM Top 40 was king and FM was just getting started.  But in 1961 the FCC decreed that all radios should have both AM and FM bands… and that FM should broadcast in stereo. And no longer could station owners just simulcast their AM programs on their FM stations: FM programming had to be different.


Thus was born “Progressive Album Rock” on FM, usually programmed by long-haired LP fans.  That was me, again.  Within years radio listening went from predominantly AM to majority FM thanks to better audio quality and changing musical tastes.
Today the AM band is filled with syndicated political talk, foreign language shows and sports.  Only a handful of stations have real news departments (think WTIC, WICC here in Connecticut).
Then came the all-electric car.  Because of their wiring Teslas and such could not have AM radios due to interference.  What to do?
Well, Congress is expected to pass a law requiring AM radios in all cars.  The bill has hundreds of co-sponsors, including the entire Connecticut delegation.  No wonder:  pols love being interviewed on AM stations.
“But AM radio is effectively aging out, with less than a 20% market share.  And many news / talk stations have transitioned to FM where there are far more listeners,” (think WINS in New York City) says former station consultant Steve Goldstein of Westport.
Goldstein left radio years ten years ago to become a podcasting consultant.  He also teaches at NYU and says not one of his students listens to AM.  Most don’t listen to FM, either, preferring streaming services like Pandora and Spotify or on-demand media like podcasts. “AM radio is going the way of the phone booth and fax machine,” he laments.
So why save AM radio in the car when folks aren’t listening?  And what will be left on FM to tune into?
If your listening habits tend toward the NPR stations at the lower end of the FM band you’re in for disappointment.  Congress has just voted to claw back (“rescind”) $1.1 billion from funds previously allocated to CPB, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting which funds both PBS television and NPR radio stations.
In the case of Connecticut Public Radio (WNPR) we’re talking about a 10+% budget cut.  That will probably mean layoffs and less local programming for shows like “Colin McEnroe.” 
At WSHU they say they’ll need to raise an additional $500,000 to make up for the loss.  Elsewhere in the U.S. it’s estimated that as many as 80 NPR stations will just go dark.
Your mail is already crowded with funding appeals, not just from public broadcasters but from other non-profits also losing federal funding.  With so many hands outstretched, how will donors prioritize their gifts?  Feeding the hungry or keeping the airwaves alive?
So Congress giveth (renewed life to AM radio) and taketh away (cutting PBS and NPR). The media world (and listeners) will adapt. 
Now, if only I could find my old eight-track tape player.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wnpr-hq.jpg,,,2025-07-20 04:56:27.180586

On a site that spans nearly 275 acres, the Ag Processing Inc. plant at full speed is expected to process 50 million bushels of soybeans and produce 700 million pounds of refined soybean oil. Such byproducts are used for animal feed, cooking and biofuel.
The operation about an hour northwest of Nebraska’s capital city, will be the 11th soybean processing location for AGP, an agribusiness headquartered in Omaha and owned by local and regional cooperatives representing farms and producers across the U.S. 
A spokesman said the latest plant location, announced in 2022, was chosen largely for proximity to cooperative members, a reliable supply of soybeans, workforce and transportation access. Infrastructure was another factor, said AGP’s Michael Dolch, as the grounds include 2.5 miles of paved roads and nearly 13.6 miles of rail track.

“As a cooperative, AGP’s mission is to add value to our members’ soybeans by processing the beans into meal and oil, selling those products in the open market, and returning the earnings to our local owners,” Board Chair Dean Thernes said in a statement. 
He said David City adds to AGP’s midwestern processing capabilities and improves its competitive edge in domestic and international markets for the growing industry. The cooperative’s last soybean processing plant opened six years ago in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
State leaders including Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen joined AGP members and industry representatives on Thursday for a ceremonial grand opening.
Pillen talked about Nebraska’s reliance on agriculture and said the new plant would consume more than 15% of the state’s soybeans grown.
“AGP’s processing facility is creating fantastic opportunities for our soybean farmers and bringing rewarding careers to David City,” he said. “This plant … improves the basis for local markets and puts more cash in producers’ pockets.”
AGP managers credited local support for helping the project to materialize.
“With the amount of rail track on site, AGP will load a unit train of 110 cars every three to four days. We will be able to hold a loaded unit train, receive an empty unit train and continue to build a third unit train of soybean meal,” said Lou Rickers, chief operations officer.

At the heart of our statewide economic development efforts is the goal of growing Nebraska’s tax base, because the best and most sustainable paths to reducing the tax burden on Nebraska families run through expanded economic growth, private-sector investment and job growth.
To achieve this, Nebraska must become more competitive focused on economic growth. While we are home to nationally significant industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, construction and financial services, these sectors are rapidly evolving.
Companies are investing in automation, data analytics and artificial intelligence-driven processes, and they are making location decisions based on where innovation is embraced and where the policy environment supports growth. Increasingly, we are seeing companies, including those with existing footprints in Nebraska, choose to grow in other states that offer more competitive incentives and greater speed to market.
The next permanent DED Director must champion a pro-growth agenda that prioritizes business attraction and retention, modernizes incentive tools and site-readiness programs, reimagines our state’s marketing and seeks innovative ideas to utility infrastructure enhancements.
To assist this new director, we recommend having an industry-respected entity undertake a comprehensive economic competitiveness assessment of Nebraska to assist in evaluating the state’s current economic and workforce landscape — eyeing opportunities and challenges.
Having the Nebraska Department of Economic Development work with other stakeholders on growing new high-wage, high-skilled, high-demand jobs is not only critical to Nebraska’s economy, but also generates the kinds of opportunities young people seek.
Transformations underway in agriculture, manufacturing, health care and financial services demand new skills, new technologies, and new thinking, qualities that define our emerging talent base. By creating the right economic environment, we can ensure that our state remains a place where younger Nebraskans can find rewarding careers, build their futures and stay closer to home.
We are encouraged by Gov. Jim Pillen and other state leaders focusing on making Nebraska stronger. As organizations engaged in the daily work of growing our economy, we stand ready to support the administration’s next permanent DED director in building a more competitive, prosperous and opportunity-rich Nebraska through a new pro-growth agenda.
Together, we can ensure our state is not only open for business but positioned to lead in a rapidly changing economy.

(Natasha Torkzaban for Kansas Reflector)LEAVENWORTH — When an inmate attacked former correctional officer Diana Polanco at CoreCivic’s Leavenworth prison, only one thought raced through her mind: “I need to survive this.”
In 2021, Polanco had been working alone with another female officer in a high-risk male unit when an agitated inmate suddenly turned violent, targeting her co-worker. Stepping in to protect her, Polanco tried to restrain the inmate on her own — and was brutally assaulted.
She suffered multiple stab wounds to her back and face, a broken jaw, fractured ribs and lasting nerve damage. After relearning basic functions in the wake of the attack, Polanco now stands as a vocal opponent of CoreCivic’s plans to reopen its former prison as an expanded immigration detention center.
“After what I went through there, to put immigrants that have worked hard and haven’t even probably done anything serious and to put them in that type of environment — that’s going to be a danger to them,” Polanco said. “You had high-risk people in there dying. So what’s going to keep an immigrant from dying in there now? What’s the difference?”

Polanco was among the roughly three-dozen people who participated in a “pots and pans” march Saturday in Leavenworth. The demonstration was organized by the CoreCivic Opposition Group of Leavenworth.
According to a press release, the group’s primary concerns include a lack of public transparency, bypassing of standard public processes, broken economic promises to the local community and CoreCivic’s national record of abuse. CoreCivic didn’t respond to a Kansas Reflector request for comment.
Critics of CoreCivic point to a track record marred by chronic understaffing, inmate deaths and unsafe working conditions during the facility’s previous operations from 1992 to 2021 under CoreCivic management.

In a 2021 executive order, President Joe Biden directed federal agencies to end contracts with privately run prison facilities. The prison closed that year after its contract with the U.S. Marshals Service expired.
However, the facility’s proposed reopening as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center avoids that executive order, which only applies to criminal, not civil, detention. ICE gave CoreCivic a no-bid federal contract worth $4.2 million a month.
But the city of Leavenworth said CoreCivic would need to apply for a special use permit to reopen the facility, and sued the company to block the reopening.
Leavenworth District Judge John Bryant issued an injunction that prevented CoreCivic from accepting ICE detainees at the facility.

Polanco wasn’t alone in her experience. Former corrections officer William Rogers also spoke to the dysfunction of the facility and the toll it took on employees.
“What brings me here is to try to keep other folks, not just detainees but employees, from suffering and seeing what we had to see,” Rogers said. “It’s a big deal when this many people get up on a Saturday morning and we all have something we’d rather be doing, but they chose to be here.”
In addition to members of the CoreCivic Opposition Group of Leavenworth and former CoreCivic employees, demonstrators included community advocates and nuns from the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth.
“CoreCivic has shown over the years that it does not respect or care for its employees or the people in its prisons,” said Sister Jean Panisko. “We’re asking that people be respected, given due process, access to immigration lawyers, and afforded all the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. That’s our stand — because we care about our God-given rights.”

Ashley Hernandez, organizing and policy coordinator for the Sisters of Charity Leavenworth Office of Justice, Peace and Integrity of Creation, emphasized the importance of the march’s symbolism.
“The pots and pans march is about waking up our neighbors,” Hernandez said. “When we make noise together, people listen. Residents need to know who is trying to set up shop in their backyard.”
As legal battles continue and public pressure mounts, community members say their goals remain simple — to prevent history from repeating itself.
“I think that (people) right now think they’re alone, but they need to stand strong through all of this,” Polanco said. “You got a voice, speak out.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC08928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

The fire that tore through Gabriel House, killing 10 residents and injuring more than 20 others, wasn't just a tragic accident; it was a catastrophic failure of a system that promised safety and delivered a death trap. 
The post In Fall River, our promise to the elderly went up in smoke  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE SMELL OF smoke should never be the last thing a person experiences in their own home. Yet for residents of the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, that nightmare became a reality last week.  
The fire that tore through their building, killing 10 residents and injuring more than 20 others, wasn’t just a tragic accident; it was a catastrophic failure of a system that promised safety and delivered a death trap. 
Gov. Healey’s emergency safety orders for all 273 assisted living residences in Massachusetts are a necessary first step. But let’s be clear: They are an admission of a colossal failure. Why did it take bodies being carried from a smoldering building to mandate that evacuation routes be posted on a resident’s door? Why did it take a fatal blaze for the state to demand that facilities simply report the age of their fire safety systems? 
These aren’t just uncomfortable questions. They are an indictment. 
For too long, we have mistaken compliance paperwork for a culture of safety. We trusted that profit-driven facilities and overstretched state agencies were upholding their end of the bargain. The fire at Gabriel House burned that illusion to the ground. 
The fact that the state must now order facilities to communicate safety plans to families reveals a terrifying gap in transparency. The mandate for immediate fire safety assessments confirms what many have feared: that the agencies tasked with oversight may have been flying blind, unaware of the crumbling infrastructure and inadequate protocols inside the very buildings they were supposed to monitor. 
This isn’t just about one facility. It’s about a statewide system where the well-being of our parents and grandparents has been subordinated to bureaucratic convenience and the bottom line. The COVID-19 pandemic already exposed the fragility of our elder care systems. We learned nothing if we are now facing a fire safety crisis that was just as predictable and just as deadly. 
If we are serious about preventing the next Fall River, our response cannot end with the governor’s press conference. Real reform is not a suggestion box; it is a set of non-negotiable demands. The industry’s pledges of cooperation are welcome, but trust must be earned through action, not press releases. We must demand: 
·  Aggressive, Unannounced Inspections. End the charade of facilities self-assessing their way to a passing grade. We need surprise inspections with real teeth and steep, public fines for non-compliance. 
·  Mandatory Staffing-to-Resident Ratios for Evacuations. A perfect evacuation plan is worthless without enough staff to execute it. We must establish and enforce staffing levels sufficient to get every resident out in a crisis, not just on a sunny afternoon. 
·  A “Safe Buildings” Fund and Mandate. The state must create a fund to help older facilities modernize with critical upgrades like sprinkler systems, while also mandating that all facilities meet modern fire codes within a strict timeframe. No more grandfather clauses for safety. 
·  A Public Safety Dashboard. Every family has the right to know the safety record of a facility before they entrust their loved one to its care. All inspection results, violations, and staffing levels must be published online in an easily accessible database. 
Implementing these, and other, reforms could be achieved without wasting time for more study. An Assisted Living Commission, established in last year’s long-term care reform law, is due to report within weeks, although its draft report is largely silent on life safety recommendations. The commission should not worry about its August 1 reporting deadline if it gets this issue right. Attorney General Andrea Campbell is on the cusp of releasing new assisted living consumer protection regulations that could easily address issues responsive to the Fall River tragedy. There’s no reason to delay and both actions would be fitting memorials to the victims of the fire. 
The residents of Gabriel House were more than statistics. They were mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers. They were people who trusted the Commonwealth to keep them safe in their final years. We broke that trust. 
We cannot bring them back. But we can honor their memory by ensuring no other family has to receive that horrific phone call. The true test of our leadership will not be in the flurry of activity last week, but in the sustained, relentless oversight months and years from now, long after the cameras have moved on. 
The ashes in Fall River are a stain on our conscience. The wake-up call has sounded. We cannot afford to hit snooze again.

A key office charged by Congress with coordinating the federal government’s work against human trafficking was gutted July 11, the latest in a string of cuts across different agencies to the government’s work on an issue that Republicans have long hailed as a top priority.
The cuts at the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP) decimated a team that worked to combat labor and sex trafficking abroad and helped coordinate domestic efforts across other agencies, including the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Labor.
The so-called “reduction-in-force” at the State Department came amid a maelstrom surrounding the Trump administration over its handling of federal investigations into sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019. Officials have said he died by suicide, but his death sparked new conspiracy theories that were fueled by President Donald Trump, who at one point maintained a friendship with Epstein. When this month the Justice Department said there was no Epstein client list, after previously promising to release it, many who had supported Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi were angered, in part because they believed the client list would reveal new truths about Epstein.
Republicans have for years made human trafficking a key issue, pushing for legislation to boost law enforcement and support for victims and telling voters that combating trafficking was a major priority.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

For Secretary of State Marco Rubio, anti-trafficking work has been a centerpiece of his policy agenda. Rubio cosponsored bipartisan legislation to help domestic trafficking survivors during his time in the Senate and as recently as May discussed his concerns about a rise in human trafficking in an unstable Haiti. He criticized former President Joe Biden’s immigration policy by saying it “empowered” child trafficking into the United States.
Bondi, too, has long been an advocate of local and federal efforts to combat human trafficking, making it a key focus of her tenure as Florida’s attorney general. She went on to lobby on behalf of a Christian anti-human-trafficking advocacy group and the Qatari government on anti-human-trafficking efforts.
People working on human trafficking issues in the federal government and for advocacy groups on the front lines of that work in the United States and abroad have been surprised at the pullback. The administration’s attention to the issue during Trump’s first term and the ascent of high-profile advocates to the Cabinet gave them the impression that their work would be shielded from the kinds of cuts they were seeing elsewhere.
Instead, funding and staffing for human trafficking work has taken sizable hits.
“We really thought that the broad, bipartisan nature of the issue of trafficking was going to provide some protection for our office. All Americans are against trafficking — Republicans, Democrats, everybody,” said Cindy Dyer, the former ambassador-at-large under Biden to monitor and combat trafficking in persons at the State Department. The office she oversaw had close to 90 full-time staffers. It lost about a dozen to the Trump administration’s voluntary resignation program earlier in the year, and, last Friday, about half were dismissed. The remaining were demoted, Dyer said.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The office’s work spanned a broad range of human trafficking issues, including sex trafficking, which disproportionately affects women, girls and LGBTQ+ people, and forced domestic labor, which also disproportionately affects women and girls. Dyer is now the chief program officer at the McCain Institute at Arizona State University, which promotes democracy and human rights across the world.
“We really thought that broad bipartisan support we have had for 25 years — ever since the Trafficking Victims Protection Act passed in 2000 — would provide us some protection, and it did not. And I think people are really both surprised and disappointed,” said Dyer, who also worked in the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration.
Gov. Landry makes leadership change at Children and Family Services

The most recent reauthorization of the law was approved in 2017, during the first Trump administration. The law charged the TIP office with producing an annual report that was due to Congress on June 30; this year’s report has been delayed without explanation. Last week’s cuts severely impacted the team working on that report, which is widely considered a critical global assessment of human trafficking prevention work.
Before those staffing cuts, the office had also paused the disbursement of grants for nongovernmental organizations working on human trafficking. The 19th could not confirm the current status of those grants.
Varina Winder, who worked as the chief of staff in the Office of Global Women’s Issues at the State Department during the Biden administration, said she was dismayed by the pullback on work to uphold global human rights, including stopping trafficking at TIP.
“If you can’t empower the office that is literally ending human slavery, what does that say about your larger ambitions about the value proposition of humans in this administration?” she said.
Martina Vandenberg of the Human Trafficking Legal Center said federal work to combat human trafficking falls into four buckets: the State Department’s global work, prosecution at the Justice Department, federal funding for outside groups and immigration policy. Every area has taken a hit since the start of the administration, Vandenberg said.
“We have grave concerns,” said Vandenberg, whose anti-trafficking advocacy group connects trafficking survivors with pro bono representation. “It is distressing to see U.S. anti-trafficking programs decimated by an administration that rode to victory, at least in part, on claims that it would combat human trafficking.”
The Human Trafficking Legal Center published an analysis of federal data this week showing that visas for victims of human trafficking who cooperate with law enforcement to arrest and prosecute traffickers are being issued at record-low levels, despite a growing backlog.
At the Labor Department, the Trump administration in March put an end to close to 70 programs and more than $500 million in grant funding that the agency was using to combat child labor and human trafficking in countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The funding helped ensure foreign governments were fighting human trafficking while also protecting U.S. jobs, The Washington Post reported at the time. The office that managed the funding was also tasked with producing a congressionally mandated report that, in part, outlined goods produced with child labor.
“To have this administration cut funding so significantly has just been a huge blow to the progress that has been made over the last several decades,” said a federal government employee familiar with this work who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.
“Within the anti-trafficking movement and in the government, we were hoping that we would be protected in some way since during Trump’s first administration, there was more funding for anti-trafficking then than there had been in previous administrations even. And Ivanka Trump took a really strong interest in the issue,” the employee said. In his first term, the president’s oldest daughter made the issue central to her portfolio and hosted a summit at the White House.
“We’ve just seen a huge shift in this administration, and honestly, it’s sent shock waves through the community,” the employee said.
On Thursday night, Trump said he would authorize Bondi to request from a federal court the grand jury testimony from Epstein’s trial. It was a reversal from her previous position on what she would release, though it is still unclear what transcripts the courts could approve to be made public.
Reps. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, have been trying to force a floor vote on releasing the complete Epstein files. Several far-right Republicans have signed on to the discharge petition effort so far, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Eli Crane, Lauren Boebert and Max Miller.
Discharge petitions are a procedural maneuver that circumvents House leadership and the powerful Rules Committee to force a floor vote. They’ve rarely been successful because they require a majority of House members’ signatures to kick off. Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, managed to kill the last one raised in April, which would have let new parents vote by proxy while away from the Capitol.
But Khanna said he’s confident that the petition will move forward: “We have the votes.”
“Moms being allowed to vote in the House is important,” he said of the failed discharge petition effort, then added: “But the release of the Epstein files to the MAGA base matters 100 times more to them. I think it’s a totally different situation in terms of the intensity of scrutiny. … The base cares so deeply about this.”
Next week, a group of high-profile Republicans are expected to gather at the Capitol for the annual International Summit Against Human Trafficking put on by the Conservative Political Action Conference, the group behind the annual gathering of right-wing activists and politicians.
“This pivotal event upholds CPAC’s steadfast dedication to eradicating modern-day slavery by uniting survivors, legislators, advocates, and law enforcement from both domestic and international communities to drive bold solutions,” the announcement for the event reads. The group said earlier this month that Trump’s investments in immigration enforcement in the “one big beautiful bill” will “hit traffickers where it hurts by taking away the shadows they exploit.”
Just days later, Freedom Network USA, one of the leading anti-trafficking groups in the country, is planning to hold a webinar on World Day Against Trafficking in Persons “to break down how the Trump administration’s heinous attacks have impacted human trafficking survivors.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.
Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
 How it works

The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
Utah hospitals ‘deeply concerned’ about Medicaid cuts. Rural areas could lose an estimated $870M

The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
 Hardest hit

Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
 ‘Rural at heart’

Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.











We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association



Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)State regulators approved a price hike for Anchorage electric consumers less than a year ago, with the exact impacts to members’ bills depending on their area of the city. 
Another increase went through in February, boosting bills by an estimated 5%.
Now, bills could rise another 4% in the coming months — a step that utility leaders, in part, are blaming on unusual warmth last winter.
Chugach Electric Association, cooperatively owned by its more than 90,000 Anchorage area members, typically sees higher demand in winter stemming from more lighting, indoor cooking and electric heating. 
But this past winter, the seventh-warmest in Anchorage in a century, Chugach recorded a 4% decline in sales, utility executives said at a pair of recent meetings — meaning that the utility didn’t collect all the revenue it expected from its previously approved price hikes. Responding to a January wind storm also cost Chugach some $1 million.
Board members are expected to vote on whether to submit the latest increase to regulators at a meeting later this month.
“The main driver that we’ve seen that’s really pushing on sales, at this point, is weather,” Matt Clarkson, Chugach’s top attorney, said at a board committee meeting last week.
 
Inside the ‘titanic’ legal case that will help determine Alaska’s energy future: an analysis

	Other trends are contributing to a longer-term sales decline, according to Chugach spokeswoman Julie Hasquet. Anchorage’s population has stagnated, and consumers are increasingly conserving power and using more energy efficient appliances, she said. Inflation has also put pressure on the utility’s budget.
But Chugach has also documented a consistent trend of warming temperatures that appear to be linked to declining demand and thus sales. Since 1953, the number of heating degree days — a measurement of how cold it is — has fallen by 14% in Chugach’s service area, the utility said in follow-up correspondence with regulators.
Chugach maintains a 10-year sales forecast, which is reviewed annually, according to Hasquet. “We are not weather forecasters, but we review historic and long range weather, as well,” she wrote in an email. 
One of the considerations driving the potential new increase, said Hasquet, is the need to preserve Chugach’s credit rating — affirmed at an ‘A’ grade by one agency earlier this week.
Keeping that grade, Hasquet said, ensures that the utility can borrow money at favorable rates for anticipated major investments — whether in liquefied natural gas imports infrastructure or large-scale renewable developments.
The warming trend in Anchorage is expected to continue, as the winter season is when temperatures are rising the most in the state, according to Rick Thoman, a specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
“There’s no reason to think winters will not continue to warm in most of the state, I think, including Southcentral,” Thoman said, referring to the region that includes Anchorage. “The warm end is creeping up — but not nearly as fast as the loss of the really cold weather.”
The warm winter also affected Matanuska Electric Association, the cooperative based in the Mat-Su region north of Anchorage, according to spokeswoman Julie Estey.
The utility recently filed a quarterly adjustment with state regulators to boost its base rates by 3% — an increase Estey said was higher than normal. Conversely, the previous year’s colder winter allowed the cooperative to delay increases that were expected earlier, she added.
In Fairbanks, the local utility, Golden Valley Electric Association, didn’t experience similarly declining sales last winter because of its “larger industrial load,” President Travis Million wrote in an email.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)A day after declaring a state of emergency in the region, Governor Josh Stein toured flood-stricken Chapel Hill and spoke with residents and local business owners still reeling from recent damage.
A Chapel Hill native, Stein returned to his hometown Friday to console residents who lost their homes to flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal and pledged to seek relief for the region as well as work toward resilience against future disasters. Chantal, which brought as much as 12 inches of rain to some areas, killed at least six people in North Carolina.
At a press conference in Kipos Greek Taverna, among the businesses in Chapel Hill’s Eastgate Crossing closed indefinitely due to flood repairs, Stein said the recovery process is still in the “damage assessment phase” but he hopes that the disaster declaration will help yield federal assistance. Eastgate Crossing is less than three miles from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s main campus.

“I know this place exceptionally well, and it hurts my heart that these business owners who invested their blood, their sweat, their tears, their capital into building successful small businesses just to have it washed away in a single day,” Stein told reporters. “That’s what’s crazy, is that a few hours of rain can completely turn lives upside down.”
Stein said that if damage proves great enough, the state will go to FEMA seeking federal disaster assistance. On Thursday, he declared a state of emergency for Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, Davidson, Durham, Forsyth, Guilford, Lee, Moore, Orange, Person, Randolph, and Wake counties over the damage brought by Chantal on July 6 and by subsequent severe storms in the following days.
He also expressed concern that the Trump administration has stopped providing funding through its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program — funds that would typically go toward shoring up communities like Chapel Hill and neighboring towns against flooding.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 19 other attorneys general Wednesday in suing over withheld BRIC funds. That program was also the subject of controversy in the wake of Hurricane Helene, when it came to light that the state lost out on an estimated $70 million in preparedness funds due to outdated building codes. “We’re in court right now to try to get that spigot turned back on,” Stein said.
He added that he hopes the legislature will also provide support to the counties hit hardest by Chantal. Stein said he has reached out to legislative leaders and has spoken with a number of local legislators as well to try to rally aid for the region.
“My hope is that these businesses get back in operation as quickly as possible,” Stein said. “I’ve been inside two stores, I’ve heard about a third from another owner. They’re already in there cleaning, they’re taking sheetrock off the wall, they’re bringing in new electrical. They are going to work as fast as they can so they can welcome customers here in Chapel Hill.”
Residents at Camelot Village described floodwaters that rose five feet high sweeping the community and forcing them to await rescue by boat. Shelton Stokes, who lived in his home for seven years prior to the flood, said he drove out just as the waters began to rise. A tree collapsed near the entrance of the community just after he left, blocking other vehicles from making it out.
“We just lost our security, everything we worked hard for, and we just need to get that back. We’ve got community, even though they’re at the hotel, we’ve got our community there,” Stokes said. “Everybody’s chipping in, everybody — trying to get everybody out, trying to get the older folks out of the windows, everybody did their job.”




Kirby Saunders, the Orange County Emergency Services Director, said forecasts did not prepare them for the severity of the flooding that would come. “We got notice about an hour before the heaviest rains started that it was going to be a really, really heavy rain — that’s unfortunate that we didn’t have that opportunity to bring in additional resources.”
Saunders praised the work of public safety officials as well as town and volunteer responders, noting that they were able to carry out more than 70 swift water rescues the night of the flooding. He said the lesson is to get serious about flood mitigation before more lives are lost, adding that developments like Camelot Village, located on a flood plain, “should never have been constructed.”
“How do we remove people and things that are critical to our communities from harm’s way, especially when we have the knowledge that it’s going to happen?” he said. “We don’t know when it’s going to happen, but we know it’s going to happen.”
Other officials in attendance included Sen. Graig Meyer (D-Orange), Rep. Allen Buansi (D-Orange), and Chapel Hill Council Member Amy Ryan.

Meyer said he hopes to help deliver aid to resident when the legislature reconvenes later this month, likely as part of a broader relief Helene-focused package that also addresses the damage already brought by this year’s hurricane season. He expressed regret that small businesses will likely not receive direct aid, however, as the state constitution is interpreted by some to prevent allocating funds directly to private entities.
“We can provide assistance to the local government bodies for things like addressing the flood mitigation or for trying to help Hillsborough with their water and sewer system and moving some of that. We generally have not been able to be the ones who will take care of small businesses,” Meyer said. “With Chantal, we have significant need for small business assistance, and if the feds aren’t going to do that, then I’m not entirely sure where these businesses are going to get the support that they need and deserve.”
He also took aim at the Trump administration for pulling federal funds away from climate and resilience programs, including the National Weather Service’s forecasting tools.
“Clearly, there’s a correlation here in Texas and other places between them pulling money out of the National Weather Service and then people getting hit by unexpected, devastating weather events,” Meyer said. “We’re not able to warn people, but to me, the bigger concern is we’re not able to take on the challenge of addressing climate change as a whole.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182601-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

(Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.
While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
 
Sweeping Colorado requests
In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.
Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
 
Letters to other states
As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

This effort is aimed at cleaning up the state’s elections. “Hold on,” you might say. “I didn’t know there was a problem with our elections.” Well, there isn’t. But that isn’t keeping the issue from being front and center at the Legislature and in county commission meetings across the state.
In the last legislative session there were more than 50 election-related bills introduced. About half of those had to deal with “election integrity” in the areas of voter qualification, technology and security. That’s a great deal of attention being paid to a part of government that, in the past, has been noted for working just fine.
Legislature seeks tighter limits on voter qualifications with host of ‘election integrity’ bills

Some of these bills may be duplicates. It has become a practice in the Legislature to introduce similar bills in the Senate and in the House. That way, if cooler heads prevail in the Senate, there’s still a similar bill in the House, where bad ideas go to flourish.
Spurring on the quest for election integrity is an entity called South Dakota Canvassing Group. The group’s mission statement is on its website: “We are a volunteer organization working to restore free, fair, transparent and secure elections in South Dakota, now and for future generations.”
Their work to “restore” elections in South Dakota implies that voting here has gone off the rails. If the Canvassing Group wants to ferret out corruption and illegalities in elections, they’re best off moving to another state. South Dakota, with a history of fair elections, doesn’t need their help.
According to a story by The Dakota Scout, many of the election integrity chasers in this state got their inspiration at a three-day event in Sioux Falls. It turns out that their North Star, their inspiration, their muse, is none other than Mike Lindell. He’s not just the My Pillow guy; he’s the My President’s Election was Stolen guy.
Lindell was, and continues to be, one of the staunchest supporters of the idea that Donald Trump was somehow cheated out of victory in the 2020 election. At his 2021 “Cyber Symposium” in Sioux Falls, Lindell spent so much time offering false claims about Dominion Voting Systems throwing the election to Joe Biden that he was recently sued for defaming one of the company’s executives. The jury awarded the executive $2.3 million in damages.
Some bills backed by the Canvassing Group were approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor: assigning a federal-only ballot to people who don’t live permanently in the state, changing the definition of resident eligibility, designating county voter registration files as public records, changing the process for challenging someone’s residency status, increasing the penalty for voting illegally, placing citizenship status on driver’s licenses, and sending a constitutional amendment to voters clarifying that a person must be a U.S. citizen to vote in the state.

However, just as Lindell continues to spout his falsehoods about the 2020 election, look for the Canvassing Group to keep up the pressure on legislators for more election integrity laws that aren’t needed. On its website, the top issue on the group’s want list is an effort to make Election Day a holiday. In the last session, this came to the Legislature in a bill sponsored by Dell Rapids Republican Tom Pischke.
Pischke explained to the Senate State Affairs Committee that a holiday was needed because in some communities there are not enough poll workers nor enough polling places. He said he hoped to work on solutions to those problems without legislation, asking the committee to table the bill.
Creating a Tuesday Election Day holiday might free up more people to work on the elections, but it could just as easily cut down on voter participation. Instead of looking ahead to how they’ll mark their ballots, citizens could just as easily be looking ahead to using a vacation day on Monday to create a long weekend.
South Dakota has a long history of running fair, accurate elections. For all their finger-pointing and hand-wringing, the Canvassing Group and the legislators who indulge them can’t change that. Election integrity legislation amounts to nothing more than solutions in search of problems, trying to fix a system that doesn’t need fixing.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/591A8322-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

Line 5 stretches from Northwestern Wisconsin to Sarnia, Ontario, including a 4.5 mile stretch on the lakebed where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet. The pipeline transports more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the Great Lakes daily, raising concerns amongst environmental advocates, who warn that an oil spill would carry catastrophic consequences.
Enbridge identified gaps in the pipelines protective coating in 2014, and the pipeline was later dented in three places by an anchor strike in 2018. The pipeline company later reached an agreement with the state to consolidate the dual pipelines currently operating in the Straits of Mackinac into a new segment housed in a concrete-lined tunnel and buried below the lakebed, in hopes of containing any potential oil spills.

In order to move forward with the project, Enbridge needs approval from three agencies, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
While EGLE and the Public Service Commission have both approved permits for the project, a 2024 settlement between Enbridge, EGLE and the Bay Mills Indian Community requires the company to redo its water resources permit using the results of new wetlands surveys.
EGLE opened public comment on the company’s revamped wetlands protection and Great Lakes Submerged Lands permits on July 17, with the comment period to remain open through Aug. 29, 2025.
The department will also host two meetings throughout the public notice period: an information session on Aug. 12 in a Q&A format regarding the application and EGLE’s review process and a formal public hearing on Aug. 19, where comments will be taken for the record. Additional comments can be submitted online.
During this period EGLE said it would review the application and information provided by the applicant, collect and consider public comments, continue tribal consultations and continue coordinating with other agencies and partners.

During the public notice period, EGLE said it’s common for the department to request applicants to consider additional modifications to the project and provide additional information in response to the ongoing review and in coordination with other state agencies and parties.
“Enbridge’s commitment to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities continues to drive our work behind building the Great Lakes Tunnel, and locating a new, replacement section of the Line 5 pipeline inside the protection of the tunnel, deep under the lakebed,” Enbridge Spokesperson Ryan Duffy said in an email.
“We support and welcome the public comment process now underway. Public and stakeholder input is essential to the process and we look forward to hearing feedback and answering questions,” he said.
As EGLE opens public comment on the permits, members of the National Wildlife Federation are demanding the department conduct a full review of Enbridge’s proposed drilling area as required by the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act, pointing to concerns of tunnel collapse, explosion and pollution during the construction of the Line 5 tunnel.
“The Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act is in place to safeguard the Great Lakes and our natural resources from unnecessary projects that cause harm,” Beth Wallace, the federation’s Great Lakes climate and energy director said in a statement. “Any attempt to shortcut or narrow their review will only benefit the interest of big oil, could open a wide door for other extractive industries, and would undermine the legal standards meant to protect our public waters.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)How do you get students to remember what they learn? According to Gladys Hawk, a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, you tell them a story.
Hawk is one of dozens of tribal elders featured on the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction’s Teachings of Our Elders website, which now boasts more than 350 videos.
In an interview played for educators at the Department of Public Instruction’s annual Indian Education Summit in Bismarck on Friday, Hawk spoke of the bedtime stories her grandmother would tell her in Lakota growing up. 
Hawk said at the end of each tale, her grandmother would tie in an important life lesson.
“She would say, ‘And that’s why I want you to be good — don’t be like this one in the story,’” said Hawk. “We have to listen to what our elders have to say, because usually they’re teaching us something important.”
Sharla Steever and Scott Simpson, who worked on the videos for North Dakota’s Native American Essential Understandings project, shared Hawk’s interview as one example of how attendees can integrate Native culture and history into the classroom.

“You can pull those stories in any time you want, if you want to focus in on a concept or a theme or something historical that the elder is speaking about,” Steever said of the Teaching of Our Elders videos.
Steever said in her experience, storytelling helps to create a sense of community in the classroom. Kids tend to retain information if they have a personal anecdote to connect it to, she said.
Under a law adopted by the state Legislature in 2021, K-12 schools in North Dakota are required to teach Native history. The website is one of a number of resources the Department of Public Instruction’s Office of Indian and Multicultural Education has developed that can support schools in this area, Steever said.
She said the Department of Public Instruction is still doing interviews with elders from time to time. However, it can be difficult to arrange.
While the agency likes to give elders who participate a stipend, there’s not a ton of funding available, Steever said.
“There’s never really been a budget for that,” she said. The department also has to squeeze in time for the interviews around its other work, she added.

Steever said she’s working on an additional set of video interviews with Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate elders.
Haiden Person, a recent graduate from Bismarck High School and the conference’s youth speaker, said Friday that teaching more Native American culture and history in schools is key to combatting anti-Indigenous racism.
“They don’t know it’s wrong, you’ve just got to teach them,” said Person, a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Person recently graduated from Bismarck High School and plans to attend United Tribes Technical College in the fall. Person said mental health is an issue close to his heart, and that he plans to become a psychiatrist.
The summit also welcomed Daniel Kish, an expert in human echolocation — using sound to locate objects — and president of World Access for the Blind, for a keynote address.
Kish has been blind since he was a year old. He said he gained the ability to echolocate because his parents wanted him to be self-sufficient despite his disability. He now helps teach the skill to other blind people.
“It’s an ability that provides you with awareness of the environment that’s way out beyond the length of your cane,” he said.
He said a broader goal of his is studying how people develop a sense of personal identity and agency. Kish said he appreciated hearing Person talk about mental health and the importance of leaning on others in your community.
“Haiden had it right, don’t be afraid to ask for help,” Kish said.

The same urgency, fresh-thinking and spirit being applied in other areas must drive school reform.","Students head to class in a 2022 file photo. A new book that divided Democrats over issues such as housing and transportation has not yet filtered down to school reform, but it needs to, writes Kalman Hettleman. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)A few weeks ago, I proposed mandatory summer school for low-performing students. I should have also prescribed summer reading for all interested in public policy and politics: the book “Abundance” by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, leading writers at the New York Times and The Atlantic respectively. It’s that good.
But not so good for liberals. In their No. 1 bestseller, they write, “Over the course of the twentieth century, America developed a right that fought the government and a left that hobbled it.”
They show, in voluminous detail, how liberals are chiefly responsible for the nation’s failure to build and grow in housing, environmental protection, transportation and health. Well-intentioned efforts to bring about reform in these areas have led to laws, lawsuits, regulations and other bottlenecks. Liberals believe in government, they add, “and then pass policy after policy hamstringing what it can actually do.”
In 2023, metro areas in San Francisco, Boston, New York and New Jersey together didn’t issue as many housing permits as Houston, where the median home costs around $300,000; in San Francisco, it’s $1.7 million.
On the environment, Klein and Thompson write, “well-meaning laws to protect nature in the twentieth century now block clean energy projects needed in the twenty-first.”  Another writer for The Atlantic (who has called Democrats “The Great Defenders of the Status Quo”) points out that environmental impact statement requirements have “ballooned from about 10 pages to hundreds, a process that now takes four years on average.”
On transportation, despite an all-out campaign since 1996 by California governors and U.S. presidents for high-speed rail across California, little has been built. “In the time California has spent failing to complete its 500-mile high-speed rail system,” Klein and Thompson write, “China has built more than 23,000 miles of high-speed rail.”
California is a poster child for our nation’s paralysis on infrastructure, but other politically blue states and cities have been just as bad, as “Abundance” documents.

And at the national level, witness the ill fate of President Joe Biden’s groundbreaking actions to build semiconductor manufacturing capacity and infrastructure. When he left office, writes veteran journalist Jonathan Chait, “only a fraction of the funds were spent … and of those, hardly any yielded concrete results.” Biden, and the nation, have paid a catastrophic political price.
It’s hardly a surprise that “Abundance” blowback has been swift, fierce and fratricidal. Chait describes “The Coming Democratic Civil War” over the abundance agenda. “[It] has set off clanging alarms on the left — it is a direct attack on the constellation of activist organizations … that control progressive politics and have significant influence over the Democratic party.”
David Dayen, editor of the progressive magazine The American Prospect, has called the abundance agenda an attack on basic democratic rights. Housing and environmental activists claim the role of communities in decision-making would be destroyed.
Of special note, Chait lists Maryland Gov. Wes Moore as among the top Democratic officials (New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro among them) to be receptive to the abundance agenda.
Keep in mind, too, that Klein and Thompson (and Chait) are staunch liberals. (And on a personal note, I am a democratic socialist and ardent fan of Bernie, Elizabeth, AOC and the New York City phenom Zohran Mamdani.)
What does all the “Abundance” controversy have to do with public education? It’s not discussed in the book. But the leader of a prominent centrist education group thinks: “Nowhere is an abundance mindset more urgently needed than in K-12 education … It challenges the progressive status quo and calls for outcome-focused, innovation governance that produces rather than merely regulates.”
I have problems with “innovation” as a guiding principle for school reform (in my view, we need less innovation and more effective management of, and funding for, evidence-based best practices). But the idea of a different mindset is compelling.
How might that play out? In what ways are liberals sometimes their own worst enemy in public education? Why is it generally conceded that Democrats have lost the political high ground on public education to Republicans?
For one thing, liberals have failed to tack from the left to the center on popular issues like school choice (even with tax credits and vouchers excluded). For another, liberals have done little to nothing to assure that national, state and local school funding is well spent (the subject of my recent commentary).
It also means that ideological progressives have favored decentralization of school policy to the point of resistance to (a) national and state efforts to promote accountability and (b) evidence-based practices, most notably the science of reading.
Of course, on education, don’t be fooled for a minute: Missteps by Democrats are a minuscule fraction of what Republicans are doing to undermine public education altogether.
Turning back to the book, one flaw is that it does not propose corrective political actions. Though “Abundance” mentions general goals like zoning reform for housing and expedited permitting for infrastructure, Klein and Thompson concede that “Abundance” is “A Lens, Not a List.”
We can’t let it go at that. Liberals must fill in the political blanks. A turning point may have occurred June 30, when California ”rolled back a landmark law that was a national symbol of environmental protection before it came to be vilified as a primary reason for the state’s severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis.” “We’ve got to get out of our own damn way,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group that advocates in favor of Alaska’s nonpartisan judicial system has filed a lawsuit against Gov. Mike Dunleavy, alleging that he illegally appointed a member to the board that nominates candidates for the state’s judicial vacancies.
The suit, filed Wednesday in Anchorage Superior Court by Alaskans for Fair Courts, claims Dunleavy violated the constitution and state law when he picked John W. Wood — also named as a defendant — for a public seat on the Alaska Judicial Council.
Under the state constitution, the council consists of three non-attorneys picked by the governor and three attorneys selected by the Alaska Bar Association. In addition, whoever holds the office of chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court sits as the council’s chair.
The council accepts applications for judicial vacancies, vets those applicants for merit using nonpartisan metrics, then submits a list of nominees to the governor for final selection.
Wood was picked for a non-attorney seat on the board but is a former attorney, making him ineligible to serve, the suit alleges. In addition, the suit says Wood is ineligible because he held a “position of profit” with the state when appointed in May.
State records show Wood has served as a state contractor, receiving more than $132,000 this year. The most recent payment is listed as June 6.
Alaskans for Fair Courts also claims that Wood is ineligible because he has not been confirmed by the Legislature. 
Wood was appointed during this year’s legislative session, but after lawmakers had voted on confirmations for the year, the suit claims, meaning that Wood’s appointment should not be considered a recess appointment subject to confirmation next year.
“If the governor were to appoint a (judge) nominee selected by a judicial council that is not properly constituted … the resulting legal deficiency … could subject actions taken by the new judge to challenge by litigants,” the suit claims.
It asks that the Anchorage Superior Court issue an order declaring that Wood is ineligible, and that his appointment is void.
In a written statement, Attorney General Treg Taylor said the state hasn’t yet been served with the lawsuit and can’t comment on the merits.
About the timing issue, Taylor said, “The Governor has the ability to appoint three members to the Judicial Council, and the Alaska Bar Association appoints the other three members to provide a 50/50 balance on the Council. The Council then nominates judges for the Governor’s selection with any ties on the Council being broken by the Chief Justice. It is important that the Council have this balanced perspective as it moves forward with its work. Having to wait almost a full year before seating a Governor’s appointee, as the Alaskans for Fair Courts argues, upsets that balance and doesn’t seem so fair.”
Dunleavy has seemingly violated the state constitution’s judicial nomination process before. 
In 2019, he failed to appoint a judge under the timeline required by the constitution, which was part of the basis of a failed attempt to recall him from office. In 2021, he called for the council to add a nominee in addition to the three it had forwarded to him for a seat on the Supreme Court. The constitution does not allow governors to appoint someone from outside of the council’s list of nominees. He ultimately did by the constitutional deadline in that instance.

Then the raids happened,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/marijuana-immigration-raid/,"Federal agents arrested hundreds of workers after immigration sweeps at a California cannabis company, stoking fears that President Trump might target the marijuana industry.","In summary
Federal agents arrested hundreds of workers after immigration sweeps at a California cannabis company, stoking fears that President Trump might target the marijuana industry.


After massive federal raids last week at two Southern California cannabis farms, the United Farm Workers posted an urgent message to its social media accounts. Because weed remains illegal under federal law, the union advised workers who are not U.S. citizens to avoid jobs in the cannabis industry, even at state-licensed facilities.
“We know this is unfair,” the United Farm Workers wrote Monday, “but we encourage you to protect yourself and your family.”
The immigration enforcement operations at the Camarillo and Carpinteria facilities of Glass House Farms, one of the state’s largest licensed cannabis companies, have unsettled California’s legal industry, which feels more vulnerable than it has since voters approved recreational weed in 2016.
The chaotic scene has brought to the forefront simmering concerns that weed farms could become an easy target as President Donald Trump ramps up deportations, because simply working in the industry could provide the criminal pretext to arrest even a legal immigrant.
It has also resurfaced for many industry veterans traumatic memories of raids during the “war on drugs,” raising alarms that the Trump administration may be hardening its stance against what remains a federally illegal substance.
“There is a sense that the community has gotten a little complacent in our legalization bubbles,” said Caren Woodson, senior director of compliance and licensing for Kiva Brands and the board president of the California Cannabis Industry Association. “We’re definitely in a moment of uncertainty.”

The fears of California cannabis growers had largely faded in recent decades, since voters legalized medical marijuana in 1996 and its recreational use in 2016. The legal market was nearly $4.9 billion last year and employed an estimated 83,000 people, though its growth is precarious as it struggles to compete with a stubbornly robust illicit industry.
But any sense of ease was snapped by the immigration raids last week, which were tied to alleged labor violations by Glass House Farms. Federal authorities ultimately reported more than 360 arrests of people they suspected of being in the country illegally and the recovery of 14 immigrant minors. Glass House Farms did not respond to emailed questions.
“There is absolutely heightened risk working for a cannabis facility. It shouldn’t be that way,” Woodson said. “Folks should be aware of that risk and we should be prepared as an industry to manage that risk.”
The Trump administration has not given an indication whether those operations were an isolated incident or a reflection of shifting enforcement priorities on cannabis. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration did not respond to emailed questions.
Advocates had hoped that Trump might finally lead the way on loosening federal restrictions on cannabis. Yet since suggesting during his campaign last fall that he would downgrade the classification of weed so that its medical uses can be more easily studied, Trump has made no moves toward rescheduling.
Other developments signal that momentum may be moving in the opposite direction. During his confirmation hearing, Trump’s nominee to lead the DEA would not commit to removing cannabis from the list of serious narcotics, and there is an ongoing effort in Congress to block its reclassification.

“We can’t take anything for granted,” Steph Sherer, executive director of the advocacy group Americans For Safe Access, warned industry members on a video call last week following the raids. “We’ve gotten dependent on this broader layer of support for medical cannabis that’s being tested right now.”
She suggested that growers learn how to read a search warrant, have a criminal lawyer on retainer and plan how they would pay for bail.
Not everyone believes it’s time to panic just yet. Some local members of the cannabis industry have noted that Glass House’s facilities are surrounded by other weed farms that were not raided by federal authorities, which could mean the operation was entirely unrelated to drugs.
The California Department of Cannabis Control subsequently confirmed that it was actively investigating a child labor complaint against the company.

A new state audit found that caused the agency to skip in-person inspections, even when workers were injured.","In summary
Nearly a third of Cal/OSHA positions were vacant last year. A new state audit found that caused the agency to skip in-person inspections, even when workers were injured.


California’s worker safety agency is under-inspecting workplaces after accidents and worker injuries, failing to enforce labor regulations in a way that “may undermine” them because it does not have enough employees to do the inspections, a state audit found. 
In a review of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health published Thursday, state auditors found understaffing was a primary factor leading inspectors to skip in-person inspections of worksites even in cases where auditors found — and division managers agreed — it was likely warranted. 
Nearly one-third of the division’s 800-plus positions were vacant last year, a rate that is even worse in some district offices and among some of the staff responsible for inspections and enforcement. 
“When it does perform inspections, Cal/OSHA’s process has critical weaknesses,” state auditor Grant Parks wrote. 
The weaknesses, he wrote, included inspectors failing to review employers’ required injury prevention plans, document notes from interviews with workers, initiate inspections quickly and ensure employers had addressed alleged hazards before closing a case file.
State law allows Cal/OSHA to inspect workplaces in-person proactively, after accidents or in response to a complaint. But it only mandates inspections for workplace deaths or “serious” accidents, generally defined as those requiring inpatient hospital care or resulting in “serious permanent disfiguration.”
Enforcement staff first determine if the complaints are valid, and then often choose to inspect “by letter” instead, which involves writing to employers asking them to investigate the complaints themselves and document how they’ve addressed hazards. 
Last year out of more than 12,000 complaints, the agency found 87% valid; staff inspected just 17% of those workplaces in person rather than investigating “by letter.” Out of 5,800 workplace accidents, the agency deemed 42% serious enough to send an inspector. 
Auditors found staff didn’t always investigate a complaint or inspect a worksite when they should have.
In one case, a union representative filed a complaint saying that construction workers were riding on heavy machinery on the road with no seat belts, and another worker was hanging off the side of the vehicle, in danger of falling and being hit in oncoming traffic. Cal/OSHA declined to investigate because the incident was on a public road and therefore outside the agency’s jurisdiction. But the audit found the agency should have opened the complaint because workers were riding in a company vehicle — activity covered by workplace safety regulations.
Auditors reviewed another complaint from a kitchen worker who was taken to the ER by ambulance, possibly from heat illness. The worker reported poor ventilation, broken air conditioning and temperatures that reached 90 degrees indoors. Despite agency policies requiring on-site inspections for serious hazards involving current employees, and for any heat-related complaints, Cal/OSHA sent the employer a letter. Auditors reviewing the case records found the employer had not responded. 
Serious injuries investigated by letter
The audit also highlighted two injuries that Cal/OSHA said weren’t “serious” enough to inspect in person; in one, a worker was cut by a chainsaw, requiring surgery and an overnight hospital stay, and in another a worker was knocked out when hit in the head and suffered a skull fracture, but was not formally admitted to the hospital. 
In the chainsaw case, managers told auditors the worker was wearing protective equipment so there was less reason to suspect workplace violations. In general, the audit found that managers overwhelmingly reported understaffing as the reason for not inspecting.
The agency, the audit noted, doesn’t have a complaint form on its website. To file a complaint, workers must call or email a Cal/OSHA district office, or fill out a complaint form on the federal OSHA website.  
The audit places further pressure on Cal/OSHA and its beleaguered parent agency, the Department of Industrial Relations, to deal with a trenchant staffing problem that advocates and lawmakers say renders some of the strictest worker protections in the nation toothless. 
It comes a year after a similar audit of the Labor Commissioner’s Office, also a part of that department, which found workers complaining to the agency about wage theft were waiting more than two years on average to get their claims resolved — six times longer than the time required by law. 
Both audits were ordered by state lawmakers, who are by now familiar with the understaffing complaints. One bill this year would require the department to study how to make more appealing career paths for the inspector positions, some of which require engineering degrees.
Stephen Knight, director of the advocacy group Worksafe, called the audit’s findings “really disappointing.”
“It confirms that California’s promise to hold employers accountable remains unfulfilled,” Knight said. “There’s a lot of good solid detail and suggestions in the audit, nothing they couldn’t have figured out beforehand. Certainly what it would require is resources and political leadership that sides with workers over corner-cutting employers.”
The problem is urgent, he said, noting workplace accidents have killed three teenagers in California just the past two weeks: one who fell into a meat grinder at a burrito factory in Los Angeles County and two who died in a fireworks warehouse explosion in rural Yolo County.
The workplace agency has been the subject of several investigations in recent years. Last year the Sacramento Bee found the division of Cal/OSHA that recommends cases for criminal prosecution was so understaffed it couldn’t even consider cases in which workers suffered severe but nonfatal accidents, such as ones that caused paralysis. CalMatters last year reported that the agency’s inspections and citations of heat-related hazards had plummeted since the pandemic, despite the rising risks of extreme heat for outdoor workers. 
In a letter dated June 27 responding to the audit, Department of Industrial Relations director Katrina Hagen wrote that the department “has been working to address structural and process issues, as well as recruitment and retention issues,” including studying the agency’s pay and job responsibility levels. Hagen wrote that Cal/OSHA’s vacancy rate had dropped to 12% this year; the auditor responded they hadn’t seen up-to-date data showing that. 
Hagen also wrote that Cal/OSHA is working on making an online complaint form, and said the agency is getting a new case management system that will flag cases that should have gotten an in-person inspection, but didn’t. Both upgrades, she wrote, are expected in 2027.
‘What’s the point?’
The audit also questioned Cal/OSHA’s practice of reducing the fines it issued to employers after citing them for safety violations. Employers often appeal citations, a process that can take years to resolve, and the fines or violations can be reduced during settlement conferences, but the auditors wrote that the reasons aren’t always documented. In a four-year period reviewed by auditors, the average reduction was more than half the original fine. 
Assembly Labor Committee Chair Liz Ortega, a Hayward Democrat who requested the audit last year, slammed the practice. 
“This Cal/OSHA standard operating procedure can stop TODAY,” she wrote in response to a query from CalMatters. “Injuries won’t abate until there are consequences. If Cal/OSHA won’t do it, we should get  someone who will.”
She said she wanted to see the agency increase its referrals for criminal prosecution to 5% of serious cases this year, and called the investigations that don’t include in-person inspections “fake.”
“Sending a letter!!!” Ortega wrote. “What’s the point?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070125-Farmworker-Harvest-LV-CM-54.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

Generations of survivors of the federal government’s nuclear testing program and the state’s uranium mining industry have waited for years for recognition from the United States as they watched their friends and families die from cancers.
The 1990 federal Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act — created to provide restitution to people sickened by exposure to radiation and uranium — excluded New Mexico’s downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners, and expired last year after years of lobbying for expansion by victims and New Mexico’s elected leaders. New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, for instance, began introducing RECA legislation when he was first elected to the U.S. House in 2008, and did so so every year since.
Just last month, Luján, other members of the state’s congressional delegation and long-time advocates held a news conference to call for RECA’s renewal once again. Over the years, the coalition calling for RECA’s expansion and extension has grown across states and become a bipartisan effort. In the end, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri got it over the finish line as a provision in President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill.
Advocates and New Mexico officials say while RECA’s passage is worthy of celebration, more remains to be done.
“It was quite a relief, because we’ve waited so long,” said Tina Cordova, founder of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium, during a news conference last week. The documentary film First We Bombed New Mexico highlights Cordova’s 20-year fight for justice for New Mexico’s downwinders. “Honestly, the acknowledgement is long past due,” she said. “But I also want to recognize…that we’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do.”
RECA’s two-year expansion “will not be long enough for us to get everybody enrolled that should be enrolled,” Cordova said. The bill also provides $100,000 lump sum payouts but no longer includes health care coverage. “We will take the win, and we will continue our fight,” Cordova said. “And we will also never forget that there are some very important people that have been left out: the people of Guam, the people of Colorado, the people of Montana, the remainder of Arizona and Nevada.” While grateful New Mexico was included, she said, “we will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our sisters and brothers from those places who we’ve come to love.”
Luján and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) last week also sent letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer urging both to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short timeline for compensation.
Later on Wednesday, a sign dedication will take place at the entrance to the Trinity site, placing a marker there “acknowledging the sacrifice and suffering of the people of New Mexico as a result of the Trinity bomb,” Cordova said. A mass in the evening in Tularosa will include the annual candlelight vigil and reading of the names of the people who are no longer here. Source will have coverage from both events.
In advance of the 80th anniversary, Luján issued a statement about the anniversary, characterizing it as “eight decades of pain, loss, and injustice for the victims still living with the fallout of nuclear testing and uranium mining…As we reflect on the lasting harm caused by these tests and the government’s negligence, we must renew our commitment to the people still suffering today. That means doing everything we can to help them access the compensation they deserve. Together, we will keep fighting to make sure no one is left behind.”

Tina Cordova has relived the death of her father, Anastacio, many times over. In speeches before a handful of people, in phone conversations with reporters and when Luján commemorated her father on the Senate floor of Congress on March 7, 2024.

Anastacio’s story starts in Tularosa in 1945. He was just 4-years-old when the federal government detonated the first atomic bomb in the Jornada Del Muerto desert 45 miles away. Like many people living there, he drank water from open cisterns, ate local crops and hunted wildlife for food — all likely contaminated with ash from radioactive fallout.
Cordova’s voice only shakes a little as she recounts his death from 12 years ago: He whittled away to 125 pounds, the pain he was in, the months on a feeding tube. He was diagnosed with two rare oral cancers and prostate cancer — all compensable under RECA, except the program excluded the New Mexicans living downwind from the first-ever bomb.
Cordova, 64, said her dad’s death also gave her clarity. She’s a cancer survivor herself and founded the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium in 2005 to advocate for southern New Mexicans impacted for generations by the legacy of Trinity.
“I chose to do this work. I know it’s my life’s work. I know I’m suited to do this work, and I’m grateful that I’ve had this opportunity,” she told Source NM.
  Tina Cordova attends an interfaith service remembering the Trinity Test on Sunday, July 13, 2025. ‘The government never warned us afterwards, never said we should be concerned,’ she told attendees. ‘But today, we have acknowledgement, and we have the beginnings of going back to the government for more, and we will do that.’ (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)
With the recent extension of RECA, her father will finally be recognized as a downwinder and her mother may finally receive compensation on his behalf.
“My dad should still be here;$100,000 pales in comparison to who he was, and who he used to be to us,” she said. “I don’t want to sound ungrateful, I don’t want to minimize what it means, but that’s not justice. That’s the beginning of justice — it’s a step forward in the right direction.”
Cordova said she’ll take the fight back to Congress to expand benefits to states and territories that were left out and require the government to pay to cover health care costs for people exposed.
She said that in the last year, her niece was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and her youngest brother with kidney cancer.
“This just doesn’t end for us,” Cordova said. “These are the people that we can never stop fighting for. These are the people that we can never allow to be forgotten, to just basically be treated as the human collateral damage.”
 Larry and Arlene Juanico

Just under the mesa, past the horno outside of Arlene Juanico’s childhood home, lie the remains of the Jackpile uranium mine, once the largest in the world. Nearly 60 miles outside of Albuquerque, the holes appear on Laguna Pueblo lands between the red and white striated mesas, nearly abutting the little village of Paguate.

With the rush for nuclear arms during the Cold War and the domestic expansion of nuclear power, the federal government was seeking to purchase uranium. A thick belt of ore snaked from Navajo Nation lands through Grants and into Laguna Pueblo. The mine operated from 1951 to 1984, marring the landscape. Tracks from the trucks wind through the valley. Entire mesas now have a terraced effect from the strip-mining. After the rain, there comes the smell: a sharp, metallic smell of uranium.
Life in the village before the closure was punctuated by blasts from the mine site, scattering light yellow dust across the landscape.
“When they blasted, everything shook, our homes rattled,” she said. “Often the ladies would run out to get the laundry, get whatever meat or fruit would be drying in the yards.”
Like her father and brother  — who later died from cancers — Arlene Juanico worked at the mine. She drove the water truck on the narrow roads, making good money at what she thought was a good job for a single mother. Her husband Larry Juanico also worked at the mine, then transferred to the Bluewater Mill, where the ore was processed into yellowcake uranium, with minimal safety precautions. People packed uranium into 55-gallon drums with their bare hands. He’d have to clean bins by climbing into them and scrubbing them with a brush, no masks, no suits.
Since they worked after 1972, the Juanicos and other uranium miners and millers did not qualify for RECA, even as many died or were sickened by exposure from radiation. But even now, the recognition or compensation from RECA is paltry to the devastation left by the mine, he said.
“Our people, our animals, our culture, our way of life are all affected by what’s happened here. The money part of it is good, but it’ll only last for a certain amount of time,” Larry Juanico said. “After all that’s gone — we’ll still be dealing with this.”
After the mine’s closure, the waste it left behind leaked uranium and other metals into the surface water and released radon, a cancer-causing gas, into the air and people’s homes. Clean up by the federal government remains unfinished.

The Juanicos said federal efforts to restart uranium mining in the area are insulting to the people sickened by exposure.
“They haven’t been taking care of us, but they want to start new mines,” Arlene Juanico said. “That will force the next generation to still fight for what the federal government still hasn’t lived up to.”
 Paul Pino

Paul Pino, a retired schoolteacher, was in a daze for several days after Congress passed RECA on July 3, saying the July 4th weekend passed in a haze.
“I’m feeling two very different things,” he said. “On one hand, totally ecstatic, like over the moon, the best feeling of victory and happiness I’ve ever had in my life. On the other, I feel terrible for the people who’ve been left out from the bill; they needed the compensation also.”

Pino was born nine years after Trinity, but his mother, big brother and two older sisters were living on his family’s Carrizozo ranch, only 54 miles from the test site. His mother survived bouts of skin cancer, but died from bone cancer – selling her pickup to pay for her funeral costs just before her death. His older brother Greg died from stomach cancer, while one sister had breast cancer and the other suffered from several brain tumors.
“It was 100% devastation to my family,” he said.
Pino joined the steering committee at the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium to fight for compensation for New Mexicans impacted by Trinity.
“All my life, plus more, people in New Mexico still have been waiting for some peace,” he said. “They got it on the 80th anniversary. It’s better late than never, you know?”
Pino performs a song titled “It Ain’t Over ‘til We Win,” about the downwinders’ struggle. He recently changed the lyrics of the last line: “Yeah we won, and it’s still not over.”
“But that’s all right,” he said. “You know it’ll be a good fight.”
 Phil Harrison

Uranium mining was supposed to be a good job, not a death sentence. But for hundreds of people on the Navajo Nation, it was just that, said former uranium miner Phil Harrison.
“There was no warning of the dangers,” Harrison told Source NM. “They took advantage of us.”
  Phil Harrison, a former uranium miner on the Navajo Nation, has dedicated his life to expanding compensation for people injured or killed from radiation exposure. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)
Harrison, 74, is an advocate with the Uranium Radiation Victims Committee, a grassroots group formed in the 1970s as rising deaths and injuries rose among Navajo Nation uranium workers. He grew up in Cove, Arizona where 32 Ker-McGee Corporation mines operated from the 1940s to the 1980s. He was an underground uranium worker and remediated sites near Tuba City.
He lost his father at age 44 to lung cancer, after 20 years working in the mines. His father was part of a spate of men on the Navajo Nation dying from lung diseases and various cancers, 400 former uranium workers died in Cove and Red Valley alone.
“It wasn’t just the miners. Spouses and children who were also getting contaminated and exposed to radiation,” he said.
The grassroots group was one of the first to file lawsuits seeking compensation from the federal government, which led to Congress establishing RECA in 1990 and expanding the program in the 2000s.
The two-year window for the RECA expansion offers little time to collect the necessary documentation and visit doctors, sometimes out of state. For former uranium workers who are now eligible, that could mean difficulties since many rely on oxygen, are hospitalized or rely on assisted living and family caretakers.
“We have to get started right away,” he said. “Time is of the essence.”
 Bernice Gutierrez

Bernice Gutierrez, 80, nearly shares a birthday with the Trinity Anniversary, born in Carrizozo only eight days before the blast. Her family moved to Albuquerque just a few years after the test, but health concerns followed. Gutierrez documented 41 members of her family experiencing some form of sickness, including 23 members with cancers. Seven have died as a result, including her son from pre-leukemia in 2020.

She’s documented health issues among downwinders and their descendants post-Trinity test for more than a decade, volunteering with the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium.
Gutierrez called the passage “bittersweet,” as the short extension of RECA came inside a bill that cuts food assistance and medical care programs for low-income residents, which New Mexico relies heavily on.
“If the Medicaid cuts come to pass, it’s going to put people here in a world of hurt,” she said.

Gutierrez said there’s only two short years to extend the program, while trying to enroll folks who never qualified before, meaning a lot of work for the volunteers ahead.
“It was not the victory that we had hoped for, but one that we’re happy to get. It’s a starting point for us, but a point that we will continue working on to change,” Gutierrez said.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is preparing to shut down seven major investigations and cases concerning alleged housing discrimination and segregation, including some where the agency already found civil rights violations, according to HUD records obtained by ProPublica.
The high-profile cases involve allegations that state and local governments across the South and Midwest illegally discriminated against people of color by placing industrial plants or low-income housing in their neighborhoods, and by steering similar facilities away from white neighborhoods, among other allegations. HUD has been pursuing these cases — which range from instances where the agency has issued a formal charge of discrimination to newer investigations — for as many as seven years. In three of them, HUD officials had determined that the defendants had violated the Fair Housing Act or related civil rights laws. A HUD staffer familiar with the other four investigations believes civil rights violations occurred in each, the official told ProPublica. Under President Donald Trump, the agency now plans to abruptly end all of them, regardless of prior findings of wrongdoing.
Four HUD officials said they could recall no precedent for the plan, which they said signals an acceleration of the administration’s retreat from fair housing enforcement. “No administration previously has so aggressively rolled back the basic protections that help people who are being harmed in their community,” one of the officials said. “The civil rights protections that HUD enforces are intended to protect the most vulnerable people in society.”
In the short term, closing the cases would allow the local governments in question to continue allegedly mistreating minority communities, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. In the long term, they said, it could embolden local politicians and developers elsewhere to take actions that entrench segregation, without fear of punishment from the federal government.
HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett declined to answer questions, saying “HUD does not comment on active Fair Housing matters or individual personnel.”
Three of the cases involve accusations that local governments clustered polluting industrial facilities in minority neighborhoods.
One concerned a protracted dispute over a scrap metal shredding plant in Chicago. The facility had operated for years in the largely white neighborhood of Lincoln Park. But residents complained ceaselessly of the fumes, debris, noise and, occasionally, smoke emanating from the plant. So the city allegedly pressured the recycling company to close the old facility and open a new one in a minority neighborhood in southeast Chicago. In 2022, HUD found that “relocating the Facility to the Southeast Site will bring environmental benefits to a neighborhood that is 80% White and environmental harms to a neighborhood that is 83% Black and Hispanic.” Chicago’s mayor called allegations of discrimination “preposterous,” then settled the case and agreed to reforms in 2023. (The new plant has not opened; its owner has sued the city.)
In another case, a predominantly white Michigan township allowed an asphalt plant to open on its outskirts, away from its population centers but near subsidized housing complexes in the neighboring poor, mostly Black city of Flint. The township did not respond to a ProPublica inquiry about the case.
Still another case involved a plan pushed by the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, to build a water desalination plant in a historically Black neighborhood already fringed by oil refineries and other industrial facilities. (Rates of cancer and birth defects in the area are disproportionately high, and average life expectancy is 15 years lower than elsewhere in the city, researchers found.) The city denied the allegations. Construction of the plant is expected to conclude in 2028.
Three other cases involve allegations of discrimination in municipal land use decisions. In Memphis, Tennessee, the city and its utility allegedly coerced residents of a poor Black neighborhood to sell their homes so that it could build a new facility there. In Cincinnati, the city has allegedly concentrated low-income housing in poor Black neighborhoods and kept it out of white neighborhoods. And in Chicago, the city has given local politicians veto power over development proposals in their districts, resulting in little new affordable housing in white neighborhoods. (Memphis, its utility and Chicago have disputed the allegations; Cincinnati declined to comment on them.)
The last case involved a Texas state agency allegedly diverting $1 billion in disaster mitigation money away from Houston and other communities of color hit hard by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and toward more rural, white communities less damaged by the storm. The agency has disputed the allegations.
All of the investigations and cases are now slated to be closed. HUD is also planning to stop enforcing the settlement it reached in the Chicago recycling case, the records show.
The move to drop the cases is being directed by Brian Hawkins, a recent Trump administration hire at HUD who serves as a senior adviser in the Fair Housing Office, two agency officials said. Hawkins has no law degree or prior experience in housing, according to his LinkedIn profile. But this month, he circulated a list within HUD of the seven cases that indicated the agency’s plans for them. In the cases that involve Cincinnati, Corpus Christi, Flint and Houston, the agency would “find no cause on [the] merits,” the list reads. In the two Chicago cases and the one involving Memphis, HUD would rescind letters documenting the agency’s prior findings. Hawkins did not respond to a request for comment.
The list does not offer a legal justification for dropping the cases. But Hawkins also circulated a memo that indicates the reasoning behind dropping one — the Chicago recycling case. The memo cites an executive order issued by Trump in April eliminating federal enforcement of “disparate-impact liability,” the doctrine that seemingly neutral policies or practices could have a discriminatory effect. Hawkins’ memo stated that “the Department will not interpret environmental impacts as violations of fair housing law absent a showing of intentional discrimination.” Four HUD officials said such a position would be a stark departure from prior department policy and relevant case law.
The reversal on the Chicago recycling case also follows behind-the-scenes pressure on HUD from Sen. Jim Banks. In June, Banks, a Republican from Indiana, wrote a letter to HUD Secretary Scott Turner and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin in which he criticized the administration of President Joe Biden’s handling of the case as “brazen overreach.” Noting that the Chicago plant would supply metal to Indiana steel mills, Banks asked the Trump appointees to “take any actions you deem necessary to remedy the situation.” Banks did not respond to a request for comment.
That case and others among the seven had also received scrutiny from other federal and state agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice. The EPA declined to say whether it was still pursuing any of the cases. The DOJ did not respond to the same inquiry.
The case closures at HUD would be the latest stage in a broad rollback of fair housing enforcement under the Trump administration, which ProPublica reported on previously. That rollback has continued in other ways as well. The agency recently initiated a plan to transfer more than half of its fair housing attorneys in the office of general counsel into unrelated roles, compounding prior staff losses since the beginning of the year, four HUD officials told ProPublica.
The officials fear long-lasting ramifications from the changes. “Fair housing laws shape our cities, shape where housing gets built, where pollution occurs, where disaster money goes,” one official said. “Without them, we have a different country.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eric-Turner-HUD-nominee-700x483-1.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

A competitive U.S. Senate race is shaping up in Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters’ retirement has opened up a seat in a key swing state.
The top contenders for the Democratic nomination are Rep. Haley Stevens, who was first elected to the U.S. House in 2018, and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow. McMorrow is seen as a rising star in the party who went viral and gained national attention in 2022 for a rousing, impassioned floor speech she gave rebuking a Republican lawmaker who, in a fundraising email, baselessly accused her of wanting to “groom” kindergarteners and “teach that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.”

Also running in the Democratic primary are state Rep. Joe Tate, former speaker of the Michigan House, and Abdul El-Sayed, the former Wayne County health director and 2018 candidate for governor.
On the Republican side, former Rep. Mike Rogers, who narrowly lost the 2024 Senate race to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin, is running again. GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga is also expected to jump in the race.
Michigan is a perennial presidential battleground state: President Donald Trump won it in 2016, former Democratic President Joe Biden put the state back in the Democratic column in 2020 and Trump flipped it back in 2024. But over the last 30 years, the state has consistently elected Democrats to the Senate — the last time the state sent a Republican senator to Washington was 1994.
The state has long been a pipeline for women Democratic leaders, from former Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Rep. Debbie Dingell to Slotkin; Gov.

If either Stevens or McMorrow wins the primary and the general, Michigan would add to the number of states represented in the Senate by two women simultaneously. There are currently four such states — Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada and Washington.
Republicans currently control the Senate by a three-seat majority, 53 to 47, and Senators serve six-year terms, meaning a third of the Senate is up every election cycle. For Democrats to win back the chamber in 2026, they’d need to hold competitive seats in states like Georgia and Michigan while flipping four GOP-held seats in Maine, North Carolina and even more Republican-leaning states like Ohio, Iowa, Nebraska and Texas.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMR_1009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.
And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

(Courtesy of Sam Eckler/UNO Gateway)OMAHA — The student commission in charge of elections at the University of Nebraska at Omaha invalidated this year’s winning ticket and disregarded the will of UNO’s student voters — an act almost inconceivable in U.S. elections but far more common on college campuses.
The short version: The candidates making up The Torch ticket defeated the opposing Unify UNO ticket by 33 votes, in a spring election with near-record turnout of 1,580 students. However, prior to the vote count’s release, Unify UNO requested that the student-run Election Commission disqualify 50 votes for The Torch.
UNO’s five-member student Election Commission went a step further and eliminated every vote The Torch received. That means Unify UNO assumed the mantle of student leadership at UNO – and the prominent advisory spot that the university has on the NU board of Regents — despite losing the popular vote.
Why votes were tossed
Why was the student body’s vote thrown out? The commission decided that private messages between students shared by The Torch created a false, libelous image of their opponents, causing students to believe Unify UNO candidates were puppets of the UNO administration and working to defund student organizations.
Although The Torch appealed, calling the messages an “expression of concern, not actionable libel,” the commission didn’t budge, anointing Unify UNO.
After the unusual election result, some students say they are wary of the new leadership. One student called the election egregious. Another called Unify UNO’s actions “not truly democratic.” The former chief of staff of the student body resigned in protest amid the fallout.
To top it off, the UNO Office of Student Life has opened an investigation to see if the final vote count was leaked to either ticket before the public release of the tally following what some described as an eerily specific request to throw out 50 student votes.
It’s happened before
However odd, student election shake-ups aren’t unique to UNO, having occurred on other campuses nationally. At Florida Atlantic University this spring, an election commissioner threw out every vote received by a group that won in a landslide because they handed out 50 T-shirts promoting the campaign on student union grounds.
Similarly, 10 years ago at the University of Kansas, student election results were overturned because one group gave out free Chipotle to prospective voters. The incident is cemented in KU history as “burrito-gate.”
UNO itself has faced close, controversial elections in the past, undergoing a near-identical turnout and down-to-the-wire vote in 2018. That year, one ticket was accused and later admitted to forging student signatures to reach the ballot.
Despite the forgery, the election commission refused to throw out the student body’s vote and declared the offending party the winners. One election commissioner at the time described the request to throw out student votes “pretty dang petty.”
Student reaction
UNO political science student Elaine Arko followed this spring’s election closely, saying she was “upset” about the decision to invalidate The Torch. Although Arko said the group broke some rules, she said she feels “the Election Commission is ignoring the student body.”
“I did think The Torch violate[d] what was in the rules for the election,” Arko said. “But is it fair for the Election Commission to basically decide the election because of that? Imagine if, in this past presidential election, some other body just decided that Kamala Harris won when it was clear that Donald Trump had won. People would be so upset over that.
“So why are we expected to go with it?”
Arko relayed the gravity of such decisions to the democratic process, saying student government elections may not carry the same consequences as local or national elections, but they’re “still important.”
Randy Adkins, a UNO political scientist who studies political campaigns and elections, said the effect on the perception of whether democracy has been upheld “depends on whether all parts of the process are followed.”
“The administration of elections is something that those who do the job take very seriously,” Adkins said. “Sometimes, however, things happen, and when that does, we can make changes to the law that will prevent issues from happening in future elections.”
Push for changes
Nate Ostdiek, who served as UNO’s chief of staff, said such changes are urgently needed at UNO. Ostdiek said he resigned amid concerns over then-student body president Ishani Adidam’s refusal to disclose information to this year’s election commission that he believed could have impacted the commission’s decision.
Appointed by student government leaders, the five election commissioners underwent a lengthy interview process to reach their positions. The process focused on communication, organization and integrity, said Camden Carmichael, who served on the UNO Election Commission this spring.
Carmichael said the group places a “heavy emphasis” on conducting fair, unbiased elections, with checks and balances to ensure a level playing field.
However, Ostdiek said he believed the Election Commission lacked a “measure of consistency” in its decision. He called for UNO’s Election Commission to set standards of evidence for allegations to be proven – and to require that complainants reach a higher threshold before invalidating a ticket or a vote.
Election Commission members declined to tell The UNO Gateway more about their decision beyond the reasons they laid out in writing: that they believed The Torch deliberately attempted to destroy Unify UNO’s reputation through false narratives.
Ostdiek said the decision left the student body lacking answers — another student government election ending with questions.
“In my opinion, I don’t think that election by invalidation is a proper way [to end an election],” Ostdiek said. “I don’t really think it was fair.”

[[...]","Nathan Heffel and Grace Hood rehearse their Colorado Public Radio public affairs program in Centennial, Colo., in 2017. (Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images)The U.S. Senate narrowly approved on July 16, 2025, a bill that would claw back federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes money to NPR, PBS and their affiliate stations. The $9 billion rescission package will withdraw $1.1 billion Congress had previously approved for the CPB to receive in the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. In addition, it makes deep foreign aid cuts. All Democrats present voted against the measure, joined by two Republicans: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The House, which approved a previous version, voted early Friday in favor of the Senate’s version of the bill.
 
What will happen to NPR, PBS and local stations?
NPR and PBS provide programming to local public television and radio stations across the country. The impact on them will be direct and indirect.
Both NPR and PBS receive money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, an independent nonprofit corporation Congress created in 1967 to receive and distribute federal money to public broadcasters. More than 70% of the money it distributes flows directly to local stations. Some stations get up to half of their budgets from the CPB.
But NPR and PBS receive much of their funding from foundation grants, viewers’ and listeners’ donations, and corporate underwriting. And local public radio and TV stations also get support from an array of sources besides CPB.
Only about 1% of NPR funding, and 15% of PBS funding, comes directly from the government via the CPB. However, once local radio and television stations lose federal funding, they’ll be less able to pay NPR and PBS for the programs they produce.
The nearly 1,500 public media stations in the U.S. rely on a mix of NPR, PBS and third-party producer programming, such as American Public Media and PRX, for the programs they offer. Local stations also produce and air regional news and provide emergency broadcasts for the government.
In rural areas with few broadcast stations and spotty cellphone coverage, public broadcast stations are vital sources of information about important community news and updates during emergencies. Federal support is essential for the programming and day-to-day operations of many local stations and allows for the maintenance of equipment and personnel to operate these vital community resources.
We believe that stations in communities that most need them, especially in rural locations, would be hit especially hard because they rely heavily on CPB funding.
 
Why are Republicans taking this step?
Public broadcasting has long been a target of conservative Republicans. They say that with a highly diversified media landscape, the public no longer needs media that is subsidized by federal dollars. They also claim that public broadcasting has a liberal bias and taxpayers should not be required to fund media that slants to the left politically.
 
Why is public media necessary when there’s news on the internet?
As journalism revenue has plummeted, public broadcasting has remained a vital source for news in communities across the nation. This is especially true in rural communities, where economic and political pressures have threatened the survival of local journalism.
In addition, with much online news coverage placed behind paywalls, public radio and television plays an important role in making quality journalism available to the American public.
 
Why did Congress approve these funds 2 years ahead?

Public broadcasting has gotten roughly $550 million per year from the federal government in recent years. The CPB has always approved and designated those funds two years in advance, due to a provision in the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, after Congress has voted to provide that money. The CPB then has distributed that funding primarily through grants to PBS and NPR affiliate stations to support their technical infrastructure, program development and audience research.
 
What are the consequences for Native communities?
Dozens of Native American stations are at risk of closing once the CPB is defunded. Native Public Media, a network of 57 radio stations and four TV stations, is a key source of news and information for tribal communities across the nation and relies on CPB support.
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, publicly stated that he secured an agreement with the White House to move $9.4 million in Interior Department funding to two dozen Native American stations. But there is no provision related to this promise within the legislation.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vetoed a bill that would allow paramedics and other licensed emergency responders to provide treatment to injured police and rescue dogs.
Current state law permits non-licensed people to treat injured “operational canines,” but licensed providers are forbidden from helping because doing so would be considered veterinary medicine and a violation of their license. 
House Bill 70, from Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, was inspired by the death of an Alaska State Trooper canine during a 2017 police chase in Wasilla.
The Alaska House approved the bill by a 32-8 vote on April 28, and the state Senate followed suit with a 20-0 vote on May 20.
Some veterinarians lobbied against the bill, and in his veto message, the governor sided with those veterinarians, saying that the “veterinary community warns this approach blurs scopes of practices, increases liability exposure, and duplicates services already available.”
“Given the rarity of canine field emergencies, expanding state authority in this area is neither necessary nor prudent,” the governor wrote.
By phone, Schrage said he was “obviously disappointed” by the governor’s decision.
“This bill, in my view, was a common-sense piece of legislation to remove some red tape currently preventing our first responders from providing life-saving care to our police search and rescue dogs. And I thought it would have been a useful tool for our first responders to have, given that we have seen some of these critical first responder dogs actually pass away in traumatic circumstances in the past,” he said.
The veto of HB 70 could be overridden if 40 members of the 60-person Legislature agree to do so during the first five days of a special legislative session scheduled to begin Aug. 2 in Juneau.
Schrage said he isn’t sure whether he will seek an override.
“Overrides are a sensitive topic and fairly complicated, as we have a very limited opportunity to take those up, and I don’t want to bring a bill up that there isn’t broad support for overriding, so we’ll have to have further conversations on that topic and see how this plays out,” he said.
Of the 33 bills passed by the Legislature this year, the governor has vetoed seven and issued line-item vetoes to budget bills. Two passed bills have not yet been sent to his desk. Two others are awaiting his action. The remainder have become law.
Of the seven vetoes, one was sustained during the regular session and another was overridden. The five remaining vetoes, plus line-item budget vetoes, will be subject to consideration during the special session.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The U.S. House of Representatives voted overnight Thursday to strip more than $1.1 billion in previously budgeted money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, putting the future of many of Alaska’s small public radio stations in doubt.
Among the congressional Republicans voting for the cut was Alaska Rep. Nick Begich III. The 216-213 vote means a proposal to cancel $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting will advance to the desk of President Donald Trump, who requested the cancellation.
Earlier in the week, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, voted in favor of the cancellation in the Senate. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted against it. It passed through the Senate on a 51-49 vote. 
The cut will affect federal spending in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, but radio stations in the 49th state have already begun planning to lay off staff and cut programming.
A handshake deal organized by Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, will transfer $9.4 million from the Interior Department to some public radio stations that serve Alaska Native and American Indian communities, but it isn’t yet clear how the money will be shared and which stations will receive it.
In 2024 — the most recent for which numbers are available —public media stations statewide received $12 million in Corporation for Public Broadcasting grants. 
Many of Alaska’s stations rely on federal funding to operate.
Though the effects of the cut will be disproportionately large in Alaska, Begich voted in favor of a prior version of the cancellation as well as the final version this week.
In a written statement, Begich said technology has advanced since the development of radio and Alaskans have embraced cellphones and satellite communications, and public radio is not as important as it formerly was.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)FAYETTEVILLE — A federal judge said he will decide soon whether to block implementation of a new state law requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools, following a nearly nine-hour hearing Friday.
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
Seven multifaith families with children in Arkansas public schools filed the lawsuit in federal court last month against the Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs school districts.
Arkansas parents file lawsuit over state law requiring Ten Commandments in schools

The complaint argues the new law violates the First Amendment’s protection of religious freedom. The law’s supporters contend the Ten Commandments have historical significance because they influenced the nation’s founders and the country’s legal system.  
The families asked the court to declare the law unconstitutional and requested a preliminary injunction that would apply only to the four Northwest Arkansas school districts. Attorneys for the state on Friday asked that if a preliminary injunction is granted, it be narrowly tailored to the affected students.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks said he will issue a ruling before the law’s Aug. 5 effective date. 
Brooks has also yet to rule on two motions to dismiss the case, one from the school districts and one from Attorney General Tim Griffin, who was allowed to intervene in the case.  
“I will continue to vigorously defend Act 573,” Griffin said in a statement Friday evening.
The Northwest Arkansas school districts argued in a brief in support of their motion to dismiss that, according to the law, they’re not required to have displays of the Ten Commandments unless the districts or their school boards receive voluntary donations of funds or displays that comply with the law’s specifications. The districts said they had no plans to implement displays in the coming year because no donations, monetary or otherwise, have been made to the schools. 
In his motion to dismiss, Griffin argued that the plaintiffs lack standing. Because the plaintiffs have not yet seen these displays, their alleged injury is based on speculation, he said.
Arkansas Deputy Solicitor General Noah Watson echoed those comments Friday, arguing Brooks should not issue a preliminary injunction because it’s “guesswork at this stage” that plaintiffs will be harmed. It’s unknown if the districts will have posters or in what context they’ll be displayed, he said.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys argued there are efforts underway by third parties to make the posters available to districts.
Although the law becomes effective Aug. 5, the school districts argued there’s no deadline to comply because they can only comply if and when they receive contributions or displays. The law has no penalties for lack of compliance because some districts may never be able to comply, the brief states.
Districts’ attorney Marshall Ney said Friday that the districts aren’t trying to take “a vigorous position” on the law, and just want to return to educating students. 
“They want to teach the kids, they don’t want to be in this firestorm on an issue like this,” Ney said. “This is just a distraction for the school districts.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett serving as pro bono counsel.

After Friday’s hearing, ACLU of Arkansas Legal Director John Williams told reporters that the danger of the new law is it aims to instill particular religious values.
“We think it’s exclusionary to tell certain students that because you don’t belong to this particular religion, that you’re excluded,” Williams said. “So we think it’s important to protect those rights of people who don’t believe in this version of the Ten Commandments.”
By mandating a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments be displayed, the law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause prohibition against adopting an official position on religious matters, plaintiffs’ attorneys argued. 
They also said the law violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
The Ten Commandment displays unconstitutionally coerce into religious observance students who will feel pressured into suppressing their own beliefs to avoid potential disfavor, plaintiffs’ lawyers argued. The law also impedes parents’ ability to guide their children’s religious development. 
Attorneys for the state repeatedly argued the law mandates a “nonsectarian” version and historical representation of the Ten Commandments.
Similar arguments were made during legislative hearings this spring. Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, sponsored Act 573, but the merits of the legislation were largely presented in committee by WallBuilders, a group “emphasizing the moral, Christian, and constitutional foundation on which our nation was built,” according to its website. 
Steven Green, the director of Willamette University’s Center for Religion, Law and Democracy who served as an expert witness at Friday’s hearing, said that, according to his research, the Ten Commandments were not foundational to the country’s founding documents or legal traditions. They contain values and principles about right and wrong that can be found in other societies and are not unique to the Ten Commandments, he said.  
Though attorneys disagreed on the historical nature of the Ten Commandments, they all agreed they do have religious ties. When Brooks questioned Arkansas legislators’ decision to approve the law, the state’s attorneys said they could not comment on the Legislature’s intent beyond the text of the law.
Brooks said it seemed “pretty obvious” that the Ten Commandments address ethics and moral issues, so it seems logical that the purpose is to aid in the moral development of students. 
“Why is that so hard to acknowledge?” he asked. 
Parents have filed lawsuits against laws similar to Arkansas’ in Louisiana and Texas. A federal appeals court blocked Louisiana’s law last month. Plaintiffs in that case are represented by the same counsel as the Arkansas lawsuit.

The new manufacturing facility for large solid rocket motors will be located in Camden, where L3Harris subsidiary Aerojet Rocketdyne has operated since 1979. Estimated cost will be about $500 million, the company said.
The facility will add roughly 50 new jobs, an Arkansas Economic Development Commission press release said.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state “is proud to build the arsenal of democracy and protect our country and allies!”
The AEDC release also noted that L3Harris representatives met with Arkansas officials during Sanders’ trip to the Paris Air Show in June to secure the expansion.
A trip Sanders made to the Paris Air Show in 2023 resulted in an announced construction of a $33 million missile factory in Camden that is a joint venture between Raytheon Technologies and Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense Systems.
According to an L3Harris press release, the planned rocket motor facility will have “more than 20 buildings across 110 acres” and will add more than 130,000 square feet of manufacturing space to the company’s existing 2,000 acre production site.
The company anticipates the added facilities will “provide a six-fold increase in manufacturing capacity.” It expects construction on the expansion to start this year, with first production slated for 2027.
The expansion is part of L3Harris’ modernization program following its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government’s attempts to develop an expanded homeland missile defense shield dubbed Golden Dome, according to Reuters.
U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman, a Republican who represents the Camden area, applauded the move, calling it “Great news” for his district in a post on X.
“This expansion in Camden will continue to solidify the Natural State’s mark in defense manufacturing. Support many hardworking Arkansans, and maintain our nation’s position as a global leader in aerospace and defense,” he wrote.

Officials who oversee the Wyoming Game and Fish Department heeded the requests of houndsmen who’ve asked wildlife managers to ease up heavy hunting pressure on the big cats.
The post Game and Fish commissioners shrug off pressure, reverse hike in hunting Laramie Mountains lions appeared first on WyoFile .","Last winter in Cheyenne, Rep. Jeremy Haroldson told stories of seeing more mountain lions in the high country near his home: the Laramie Mountains.  
The Republican pastor from Wheatland recounted personal sightings of the stealthy large carnivores while testifying in support of a bill that sought unlimited, year-round mountain lion hunting — effectively stripping the Wyoming Game and Fish Department of the authority to manage the species. The proposal, led by Pinedale Republican Rep. Mike Schmid, ran into overwhelming opposition and died early in the legislative process. 
Five months later, the Game and Fish Department held a “special meeting” in Wheatland — where Haroldson lives — “in an effort to address community concerns” related to the lions, according to a press release.  
Draft regulations for Wyoming’s mountain lion hunt that were up for discussion at the meeting called for increases in the two hunt areas that sprawl over the Laramie Range, where Haroldson reported seeing an uptick in lions. 
Despite those concerns, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission on Wednesday took the rare step of overriding a hunting season proposal brought to them by the department. The rescission of the quota hike was a motion from Commissioner John Masterson, a Casper attorney.

“To my friends at the department, especially those who are experts, I respect your work. I’m not throwing it out the window,” Masterson said during the Casper meeting. “But [in] those two areas, [the increase] just gives me the heebie-jeebies.” 
Masterson didn’t otherwise seek to amend Wyoming’s mountain lion regulations, which have tilted toward heavier and heavier hunting over the past two decades. But his motion to undo planned changes in the Laramie Mountains was unanimously agreed to by other commissioners. 
The commission’s undoing of planned lion hunting hikes in the Laramie Range came after Masterson and others heard from houndsmen who run their dogs in the region. Dan McRady, vice president of the Wyoming Houndsmen Association, told commissioners that in his “home range” between Laramie and Cheyenne, he went from finding plenty of cats to watching them get “hammered” in the years after COVID. 
“They were killing everything they were catching,” McRady said. 
Aaron Kirlin, a Wheatland outfitter, suggested to commissioners that the planned quota hikes in the Laramie Mountains were rooted in anecdote. 
“I think a lot of these proposals come from pressure from landowners that have seen pictures on trail cams of multiple cats at a water tank, or something along those lines,” Kirlin said.

But from his point of view, there’s a “concerning” lack of animals. Houndsmen are putting 1,500 miles on vehicles between cutting lion tracks, he said. 
Haroldson, the state representative, told WyoFile that he didn’t take the Game and Fish Commission’s decision to maintain the status quo and undo the Laramie Mountain lion hunting hikes personally. 
“My goal is not to have a fight with Game and Fish,” he said. “But at the same time …  I’d love to see a lot more boots on the ground and less computer programs telling us what the cats are doing.”

Haroldson’s overall aim in wanting to target more mountain lions is to help mule deer, he said.
“I think that it’s just vitally important that we preserve, protect and defend our mule deer populations at all costs,” he said. 
But Game and Fish’s data-packed triennial mountain lion report suggests that Wyoming’s heavy hunting of the big cats might be hurting deer by driving down the average age of lions on the landscape. Mountain lion biologist Justin Clapp explained to commissioners how that could be so. 
“Younger animals tend to almost exclusively eat deer,” Clapp said. “These cats that are 2, 3, 4 years old in the Casper area, 60-70% of their diet was mule deer, which is expected. As we shift toward 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-year-old cats, almost 70% of their diet was elk.”

The limit, which takes effect Jan. 1, will be set at 9.683%, the state’s Department of Commerce said Friday.
House Bill 1217, signed into law in May by Gov. Bob Ferguson, restricts annual residential rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower. 
The law went into effect immediately, with the rate for the rest of 2025 set at the 10% maximum, as 7% plus inflation equaled 10.8%. 
Going forward, the Department of Commerce will announce the annual rent limit each July. The timing is based on the release of inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Rent hikes of any degree aren’t allowed in the first year of a tenancy under Washington’s landmark law. But landlords can set rent however they please when the tenant moves in.
The cap doesn’t apply to all homes. For example, new construction is not covered for its first 12 years. Public housing authorities, low-income developments, and duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in which the owner lives in one of the units are also exempt.
For manufactured homes, increases are capped at 5%.
If a landlord raises rent above the caps without an exemption, the renter must give the landlord a chance to fix the error or can terminate their lease with 20 days’ notice. A tenant or the state attorney general can bring litigation to enforce compliance. The attorney general can recover up to $7,500 per violation.
The legislation was one of the most divisive this session in Olympia. Progressives had initially pushed for a hard 7% limit, but ran into opposition from moderate Democrats. 
Democrats hope the compromise provides a modicum of predictability to renters. Republicans fear it’ll chill development and price out small landlords who won’t be able to keep up with maintenance costs without the flexibility to raise rents as they wish.
Under the law, the limit on rent increases will remain in effect until 2040.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartments-tacoma-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

“All these kids that have Medicaid will have more difficulty having access to vital treatment that will help them become more independent,” said Cathy Martinez, president of the Autism Family Network in Nebraska.
“We’re either going to pay it on the front end, doing these therapies necessary to their success, or on the back end for care provision when you don’t gain skills through their ABA therapy programs.”
Martinez commented Friday as officials with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services discussed plans to, on Aug. 1, adjust Medicaid reimbursement rates for providers of applied behavior analysis services.
Also known as ABA, the therapy and support helps youths with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental and social communication delays function better in society.
 Highest in nation

State officials say Nebraska currently has the highest reimbursement rates of any state ABA program — leading to an increase in state expenses of more than 2,000% since 2020. Five years ago, Nebraska Medicaid paid about $4.6 million for ABA services and last year the amount soared to $85.6 million.
DHHS, which is a code agency under the governor’s supervision, has said previously it wanted to re-examine and set new guardrails so services can be sustainable, as federal auditors were scrutinizing states’ behavioral health programs to ferret out possible misuse, fraud and inefficiencies.

Steve Corsi, DHHS chief executive, said Friday that state leaders “fully understand this is an important service” and said they were “unequivocally committed” to ensuring families have “access to necessary services.”
But he said his agency is obliged to be aligned more with neighboring states, and said that even with the adjustments, commonly billed ABA rates for services remain higher than the national average and median. 
Corsi said the ABA changes follow a comparative analysis and were in the works prior to the Trump administration. He said they had “zero” to do with budget woes facing the state.
“Even if we had an excess,” he said of state funds, “this is still the right thing to do.”
 Defending the change

Corsi led a news conference Friday to defend the adjustments, contending that the changes would not result in “a lapse of care for clients or their families.” He said the press conference was spurred by inquiries from families and advocates and what he described as misinformation from some sources.

Medicaid-eligible youths served in Nebraska have grown from about 169 in 2020 to about 1,150 three years later. Experts say the number of affected youths nationally has grown: One in 31 youths has autism spectrum disorder, a developmental disability with challenges ranging in social communication to repetitive behaviors.
Supporting DHHS at the conference was Drew Gonshorowski, the state agency’s Medicaid and Long-Term Care Director, and Károly Mirnics, dean and director of the Munroe-Meyer Institute, a large provider of ABA services.
A DHHS spokesman said that while the new rate schedule is effective Aug. 1, providers could still try to negotiate rates with one of the state’s three managed care organizations, which contract with Nebraska to manage health care benefits for Nebraskans enrolled in Medicaid.  


Autism in Nebraska


Based on national diagnosis rates, Nebraska potentially has 17,300 youths on the autism spectrum.
Nebraska has the capacity to serve 26% of youths who could be diagnosed.
ABA providers are called behavior analysts. Nebraska has 600 licensed behavior analysts and 1,668 registered behavior technicians who must be supervised by an LBA.

Martinez said that as of Friday, she knows of no rates that have been negotiated. She was critical of the one-month public notice that DHHS gave on the rate cut, but said that families and advocates have been calling their state senators, DHHS and Gov. Jim Pillen’s office.  
“Rather than talking to families and providers on the impact of cuts, they decided to implement it without public notice or a public hearing,” Martinez said. “We believe if Governor Pillen really knew the impact to our kids around the state he would not have allowed such a huge cut to services.”
 State ‘overcorrected’

Mariel Fernandez of the Council of Autism Service Providers, which represents members across the nation, said the “writing was on the wall” that cost reductions were coming. She acknowledged that Nebraska’s reimbursement rate, in a few service areas, was out of whack and that a change was appropriate.
But, she said, DHHS “overcorrected” with other announced changes. The reductions range from 28% to 79%, she said, depending largely on the training and expertise of the provider and whether the service is provided on an individual or group level.
Fernandez said state officials should consider the difficulty in recruiting ABA behavioral health care and other talent to the state, as well as “the cost to do business” in Nebraska.
The national council on Friday was wrapping up a survey of about 100 providers, Fernandez said, asking if they would remain part of the Nebraska network with the new rates. She said about 74% indicated they are not sure, and another 10% said they would not.
Fernandez said some member organizations indicated they would look at cost-cutting measures, including lower compensation for employees. Advocates worry that would push analysts and technicians out of the state.
“If those folks quit, it will impact everybody, not just children with Medicaid.” she said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Even though he may never get the opportunity to use his new web development and coding skills outside of the prison walls, one North Dakota inmate says he is grateful for the opportunity to learn and perhaps inspire others.
“Education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world,” Simon Jacobson said, quoting former South African President Nelson Mandela during his remarks to the other participants in a prison coding program. “I send my deepest respect, regards and gratitude to The Last Mile team as a whole for the life-changing impact that they are doing throughout our country.”
On Friday, Jacobson was one of 10 prisoners who received coding and web development certificates during a ceremony at the North Dakota State Penitentiary.
Jacobson, currently serving a life sentence at the North Dakota State Penitentiary after pleading guilty to murder, kidnapping and robbery charges in 2014, was the teacher’s assistant for the program.
“I’m making sure I take a firm stance on doing the right thing and showing these men, doing the right thing is what a man does,” he said.

The program participants completed one of two six-month programs in web development fundamentals or server and data technology training through The Last Mile, a nonprofit that provides opportunities for justice-impacted individuals through education and technology training. 
Eric Rick, program facilitator for The Last Mile, said the recidivism rate for graduates of the program is under 5% and 75% of the program graduates are employed within six months of their releases. The recidivism rate for all inmates in the state prison system is about 37%, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
“The Last Mile exists to unlock potential and break the cycle of incarceration,” Rick said. “It is changing lives through technical education and reentry support.”
Rick said the participants take 30 hours of training per week with much of their instruction coming through textbooks, video modules and remote instructors who graduated from the program as former inmates themselves.
“I’m just so proud,” he said. “I’m sad to see them go, but we start another class in August, so we just keep this ball rolling.”
The Last Mile program is operating in 19 prison facilities across eight states, he said. In North Dakota, up to 12 participants are chosen each year from dozens of applications.
Rick said he is hopeful they can expand on some opportunities for program graduates in coming years to get them using their skills through other work programs before they are released.

Davion Burris, another graduate of the program, will be eligible for parole in 2027 and said being able to take this class gives him hope for his future. He said the support network they built among the program participants was essential for them having success.
“We go at our own pace, but depending where the next person is at, they can help you with where you are at,” Burris said. “Certain people remember certain things better and in that aspect we all feel like a group of family.”
He said he hopes to continue his multimedia training in the future and learn more about audio and video production.
Jacobson said he wants to stay involved in the program to help others because it can be overwhelming at times.
“The amount of lines of code you have to go through starts off at 50 to 100 lines of code,” he said. “And then pretty soon your projects are thousands of lines of code, dozens of folders you have to pick through and debug every time you build something, so it’s definitely a tough process.”
Vicki Johnson, Jacobson’s friend for more than 15 years, traveled from Billings to watch him receive his certificate.
“He was trying to make me cry and it almost worked,” Johnson said. “He’s fantastic and just a people person. Very charismatic, loving and kind, and he’s changed his life so very, very much.”
Support from people outside of prison is important because it helps the program participants push through the difficult moments of prison life and helps hold them accountable for the improvements they are trying to make, Jacobson said.

“I got people counting on me. I got people supporting me and feeding into my dream and vision that I want to build for myself,” he said. “It’s critical to me.”
The Last Mile program is funded through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and administered by the U.S. Department of Labor.
“It’s been such an honor to walk alongside you during this part of our journey,” Jacobson said as he concluded his remarks to the other participants. “Go forth and ignite the world. Hallelujah. Education has taught me that the greatest investment we can make is in personal relationships and the development of the folks around us … rise, shine, grind and repeat.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and two Idaho county prosecuting attorneys agreed to not prosecute some Idaho doctors for referring patients out of state for abortions, under a new legal agreement published in federal court Thursday.
The settlement concludes a lawsuit that challenged a legal opinion from Idaho’s top legal official that said medical professionals who refer or prescribe abortion pills to pregnant patients across state lines are subject to criminal penalties under Idaho’s strict abortion ban.
Federal judge B. Lynn Winmill closed the lawsuit Thursday following the agreement, which protects a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate organization and two Idaho doctors.
In 2023, Labrador issued a legal opinion upon request from Idaho lawmaker Rep. Brent Crane, R-Nampa, on behalf of anti-abortion clinic Stanton Healthcare. In the opinion, Labrador said abortion pills are included in the state’s strict abortion ban law, States Newsroom reported.
Soon, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, and the two Idaho doctors sued over Labrador’s opinion. Labrador later recalled the opinion.
Idaho is surrounded by several states where abortion is legal, including Washington, Oregon and Montana. Historically, Idaho physicians referred patients to clinics in those states if they need care that is unavailable in Idaho, such as termination for medical reasons related to fetal anomalies or complications that put a pregnant patient’s health at risk.
 Labrador: ‘We do not have the authority to prosecute referrals for out-of-state services’

Under the recent agreement, Labrador along with two Idaho local prosecutors — Ada County Prosecuting Attorney Jan Bennetts and Valley County Prosecuting Attorney Brian Naugle — will not enforce Idaho’s abortion ban against the organization and two doctors for out-of-state referrals.
In a statement, Labrador said the agreement “avoids unnecessary litigation and protects Idaho taxpayers from further costs.”
“Idaho’s strong pro-life laws remain fully in effect, and we remain proud to defend the rights of mothers and their unborn children,” Labrador told the Idaho Capital Sun. “This settlement simply affirms what our office already made clear in court: We do not have the authority to prosecute referrals for out-of-state services.”
In December 2024, a federal appeals court panel upheld an injunction by a lower federal court in Idaho that blocked Labrador from prosecuting Idaho medical professionals for out-of-state abortion referrals, the Sun previously reported.
In a statement, the Planned Parenthood affiliate CEO, Rebecca Gibron, said the agreement “brings much-needed clarity, compassion, and relief to both patients and providers.”
“It ensures that health care providers in Idaho can continue doing what they are trained and ethically bound to do — offer accurate information and help patients access the care they need, even if that care is out of state. In a state where abortion is banned, those referrals can be lifesaving,” she said.
 Agreement protects referrals out of Idaho for abortion, abortion pills

The agreement blocks enforcing Idaho’s abortion law for “referring a woman across state lines to an abortion provider,” the federal judge wrote.
That includes “informing about, counseling about, recommending, providing a referral for, scheduling an appointment for, informing about sources of funding for, or otherwise advising or assisting an individual in learning about or obtaining, an abortion …”
The ruling also protects that activity for out-of-state “consultation for abortion pills where that abortion will be performed or the out-of-state prescription will be filled outside the borders of Idaho where it is legal to obtain such abortion or prescription for abortion pills.”
The agreement does not have an end date.

(Screengrab from livestream)Leaders of Arkansas’ public broadcasting stations on Friday said they’re focused on how to deal with the loss of federal funding approved by Congress this week but revealed few details of their plans.
  West Doss, chairman Arkansas PBS Commission
“We’d rather not be in this situation,” Arkansas PBS Commission chair West Doss said. “We think we’ll be able to handle it.”
Doss said he didn’t know yet whether the funding loss would lead to staff or programming cuts or both. The funds — about $2.5 million in the current fiscal year — represents about 15% of Arkansas PBS’ annual budget, he said.
The U.S. House passed the Rescission Act of 2025 early Friday that rescinds $9 billion in previously approved funding for public broadcasting and some foreign aid programs. Public media accounted for $1.1 billion of the total. President Donald Trump was expected to sign the measure. 
Arkansas’ share of those funds was $3,187,528 this fiscal year, according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s budget request.
  Mark Smith, station manager, KASU in Jonesville
“These cuts hit our communities right where it hurts,” said Clint Schaff, general manager of KUAF in Fayetteville. “Our neighbors who depend on KUAF’s vital community service are set to lose nearly $193,000 in annual federal funding —16% of our operating budget.”
Jonesboro’s public radio station, KASU, will lose about 20% of its budget, General Manager Mark Smith said. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provided $164,555 in fiscal year 2024.
The rescinded funds “will have a significant impact on programming” and staff, Smith said. The station has one full-time employee whose salary is covered by the federal money, he said.
“We’re continuing to assess what the overall impact will be and formulating a plan,” he said. It’s too early to tell whether Arkansas State University, which holds the station license, will be able to make up the shortfall, he said.
  Daniel Breen, news director, Little Rock Public Radio
Little Rock Public Radio News Director Daniel Breen said the station’s plans are still in flux, and despite the loss of about 10% of its budget, “we will continue to serve as a public resource for the community, amplifying their stories that normally wouldn’t be heard.”
CPB’s funding request to Congress showed KUAR received about $234,000 in current fiscal year. The station is part of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
Public media is “a lifeline for smaller, rural stations, often located in areas which would be news deserts otherwise,” Breen said. “At a time when local news across the board is struggling, it’s sad to think what a reduction in service will mean for those communities.”
  Clint Schaff, general manager, KUAF in Fayetteville
KUAF’s Schaff said the University of Arkansas-supported station is “a resilient mid-market operation that will work to survive this challenge,” but he fears smaller stations throughout the public media network could be forced to go dark.
“KUAF’s service will be as strong as the support it gets from the community it serves — our communities need listeners who are able to donate monthly to do so, for existing contributors to dig deeper, for charitable organizations and foundations to step up, and for universities and other institutions to invest in this vital community resource,” Schaff said.
The Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival also will be affected by the rescission. The festival gets the majority of its funds from a $160,000 CPB grant. It also received a $20,000 grant from PBS.

When Darcie Melvin started coming to Companions in Wholeness nearly four years ago, she said she was dealing with a substance abuse disorder. At first, she was just grateful for the food at the Rutland day shelter — then she got to know the staff.
“I was kind of at my wits’ end,” Melvin said. “This place has truly become like a family to me.”
Over the course of several years, the day shelter helped Melvin with bills, to furnish her apartment and connect her with other services. Melvin said she’s now been in recovery for about 16 months, but she still comes in regularly to volunteer and has slowly stopped needing to accept offers of free food.
However, the shelter now faces uncertainty as it announced plans to lay off every paid worker on Aug. 2, after federal grants froze and state ones were not renewed in the spring. Four employees plan to keep working, unpaid, to keep the organization open.
“It would be a terrible thing,” Outreach Coordinator Linda Allen said of a possible closure.
Allen is among the four employees who plan to keep working without pay, citing a deep sense of obligation to the organization’s regulars. 
People in the organization’s crowded main room on Thursday said the facility had been a cornerstone of their recovery — and sometimes survival. But Executive Director Ellie McGarry has been left with few options after losing both of her major public funding streams.

Companions in Wholeness is open Monday through Thursday, 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Apart from serving meals to about 150 people per day, it offers clothing, climate control, rest areas and appointments with service providers. In August, the schedule is set to shrink to three hours a day, offering one meal rather than two.
The loss of funding comes as the demand for Companions in Wholeness has been steadily growing over the past few years. McGarry said the latest round of evictions from the state’s motel voucher program produced acute pressure on shelter services.
The situation was already severe. A 2024 report found that Rutland County’s unhoused population had increased by a factor of seven since 2019. Statewide, the rate of homelessness still ranked fourth worst in the nation last year.
Companions in Wholeness is part of the United Methodist Church in Rutland. It even operates out of the church’s physical space — staff push the altar aside to transform the room into a shelter just hours after Sunday services. Melvin said the connection with the church had been important for her.

Companions in Wholeness is trying to expand and move to a larger church space, McGarry said. The organization also plans to become an independent entity and change its name to Rutland Neighbors.
But the building is not McGarry’s main worry. She had hoped for a total of $260,000 in grants to carry the shelter’s growing burden this year. None of it came through. The organization requires about $20,000 per month to operate, she said. Right now, it has $10,000 in the bank.
The federal Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which the organization used to receive funds from, was frozen this spring. The program was administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which did not respond to requests for comment. 
At the same time, the Housing Opportunity Grant Program through the Vermont Department for Children and Families did not choose to award a payment to the organization, despite doing so each of the past two years.

Lily Sojourner, director of the department’s Office of Economic Opportunity, said the Housing Opportunity Grants originally were intended to support overnight shelters. Given that BROC Community action, a nonprofit primarily serving Bennington and Rutland counties, has plans to open such a shelter in Rutland this fall, the state directed more significant financial support to that project.
Eric Maguire, the project director for the new BROC Community Action shelter, said the facility likely will be up and running by November or December. The program expects to house 10 people to start, with high barriers to admission, requiring people to be sober and lack other housing alternatives. Maguire said having a sober, overnight shelter in the city is critical given the community’s current housing and substance use needs.
Companions in Wholeness does not allow entry to people who are disruptive or visibly under the influence, but McGarry said she welcomes people whom she knows to be dealing with substance use disorders. 
Brooke Kurutza — a 31-year-old from Barre who has been coming to Companions in Wholeness for four years and had substance use disorders at various points in her life — said she has been experiencing homelessness since she was 18. 
“This place is everything to me,” she said.
Kurutza said a new shelter would greatly help the community, as Rutland’s Open Door Mission, where she currently stays, is full.
Both services are necessary, she said. Overnight shelters often require people staying there to leave fairly early in the morning, while places like Companions in Wholeness allow people to eat, rest and seek shelter from the elements during the day.
Ronald Jones has been going to Companions in Wholeness since it opened in 2018 and said he eats all his meals there. He said he is worried what restricted hours and resources will mean for people who rely on the organization.
“It’s going to do damaging things,” he said.
Companions in Wholeness plans to host a bowling event in Rutland on Sept. 14 to fundraise the necessary resources to continue operations, according to a statement Friday.
“It’s taken me 39 years to find people like this,” Melvin said through tears. “I don’t want to lose it.”

Through June, at least 92 children had died or nearly died, according to the state’s Office of the Family and Children’s Ombuds. That’s up from 78 in the first six months of 2024. These incidents stem from causes such as drug exposure, abuse and neglect. They also include expected medical deaths if the family had some involvement with child welfare.
The figures only capture cases the state Department of Children, Youth and Families is aware of. The agency oversees Washington’s child welfare system.
Some Republicans have blamed a recent state law for putting kids at greater risk. But state officials say there isn’t a definite link between that law and many of the incidents.
The highly potent opioid fentanyl has driven increases in fatalities and near-fatalities for the state’s children in recent years. Last year, over two-fifths of the episodes were tied to accidental drug ingestion and overdose. Such incidents were very rare in 2017 and 2018.
So far this year, 20 of the cases involving children ages 0 to 3 stemmed from accidental fentanyl exposure, according to the ombuds data. There were 33 such cases in all of 2024.
“These are the ones where, usually, it’s a younger child accidentally picks up some foil and puts it in their mouth or a tablet and ingests it,” Patrick Dowd, the head of the agency watchdog, told the Department of Children, Youth and Families oversight board Thursday.
In light of this spike, state lawmakers in 2024 passed legislation requiring courts to more strongly weigh the presence of opioids in the home when deciding whether a child should be removed and placed into foster care.
State officials also point to increased economic stress over the past few years as a contributor to the incidents, and say that may only increase as the impacts of tariffs and cuts to social safety net programs are felt.
“It is not necessarily going to be better before it’s worse,” said Sen. Claire Wilson, D-Federal Way, the co-chair of the oversight board, “and so we really have to think about what that looks like and how we leverage resources and support.”
Growing frustrations
The 2021 Keeping Families Together Act raised the bar for taking children away from their parents and favored placing them with other relatives over foster care. The idea was that removal from their homes can cause them major problems later in life. 
The legislation passed with strong bipartisan support in the Legislature. But now Republican lawmakers in particular are souring on the law.
Rep. Chris Corry, R-Yakima, said if he could take back any of his votes since joining the state House in 2019, this would be it. 
“It’s either being completely misapplied or when the law was passed, it was misrepresented to myself and members of the Legislature because this was not ever in my mind where we keep children with drug-addled parents,” said Corry, who has fostered children.
But the ombuds office didn’t recommend changes to the Keeping Families Together Act, enshrined in House Bill 1227, to the oversight board.
“We did not find in many cases a certain point where, if only 1227 had not been enacted, then the department would have filed” for removal, Dowd said.
Instead, the ombuds suggested the state expand treatment services for pregnant women and mothers, increase efforts to engage fathers and look into allowing children to stay in their guardians’ homes under court-ordered state supervision.
The agency has taken steps to respond to the alarming trend. 
For example, the state now requires “safe child consults” for all child welfare cases involving opioid use and a child younger than 3. These reviews help determine whether officials will allow a child to go home or petition a judge for care elsewhere. The department has also increased training for caseworkers on neglect and medically complex cases.
Republicans have also been frustrated over the state’s defunding of the only medical facility in western Washington focused on caring for drug-exposed newborns. Most of the babies cared for at the Pediatric Interim Care Center in Kent were exposed to fentanyl or methamphetamine before birth. 
The Department of Children, Youth and Families, in a statement Friday, said it’s “not possible or appropriate” to point to a single cause driving this year’s rise in child fatalities.
The agency attributed the increase largely to synthetic opioids like fentanyl, parental stress, “an increase of families with high needs, and the complexities of cases and the systems involved.”
Last year saw a slight decline in the overall number of fatal and near-fatal incidents, with 140 child deaths and near deaths compared to 147 in 2022. 
Of those whose deaths last year were related to maltreatment, like abuse or neglect, 42% were part of an open case with the Department of Children, Youth and Families at the time of their death. Another nearly 40% had a case closed in the prior 12 months. 
Of the 38 maltreatment deaths in 2024, more than half of the children were under one year old.

There are nine radio stations affiliated with National Public Radio and four television stations that are part of the Public Broadcasting Service in Missouri media markets, along with some smaller community radio stations, that receive funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Funding from Congress goes to the corporation, which then distributes money to the stations.
Those broadcasters received about $7.6 million in community service grants in federal fiscal year 2024, the most recent completed year, according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
“This vote weakens one of the most trusted civic institutions in America,” Kyle Felling, general manager of KBIA in Columbia, said in a news release. “Stripping away already-approved funding puts the work we do every day at risk — reporting trusted facts, delivering emergency alerts, and connecting our community.”




 Emergency fund drives


KBIA, the NPR station operated by the University of Missouri Journalism School, launched a drive for a “Resiliency Fund” to raise $500,000.
KCUR, the NPR station in the Kansas City market, will run a drive through Monday, and perhaps beyond, to raise $500,000
Community radio station KOPN in Columbia, which is not an NPR affiliate, launched an emergency drive with a goal of $40,000.
KCPT, the Kansas City public television station, also launched an emergency drive but did not state a goal on its website.





Missouri U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, who handled the rescission bill in the Senate, said on Fox News Friday that he was proud to be the one leading the fight to eliminate public broadcaster funding.
“We got the federal government out of the business of subsidizing NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Schmitt said. “They are woke, biased, and ideologically captured. They don’t deserve tax dollars.”
Since President Donald Trump sent a request for cuts of $9.4 billion from current spending to Congress in June, the stations have been using their websites and airwaves to seek extra donations and mobilize listeners.
The final 216-213 House vote came Friday morning, just after midnight. Every Republican member of the Missouri delegation voted for the cuts except U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison of Springfield, who was absent. The state’s two Democratic House members voted against it.
The Trump administration’s well-telegraphed intent to cut funding for public broadcasting had boosted station fundraising even before the vote, Felling said. An annual May fund drive, he said, raised more than three times the amount it did a year ago.
“After the cuts overnight, I’ve seen my inbox flooded with messages of support and contributions,” Felling said via email. “The community recognizes the importance of what we do, the value of independent and trusted reporting.”
At KCUR, the emergency fund drive began at 7 a.m. Friday and will continue at least through Monday, Karen Campbell, director of institutional giving and communications, said in an email. Along with the direct cash grant the station lost, it will have to pick up costs previously covered by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, she wrote.
The response so far, she said, has been very positive.
“While we are buoyed by this support and the kind words that accompany these gifts, we know that we have a long road ahead,” Campbell wrote.
Dylan Martin, executive director of community radio station KOPN in Columbia, said the lost federal funding is about 40% of the station’s cash budget. The station has always been lean, he said, with two paid staff currently.
In addition to lost cash, there are new costs, he said.
“In addition to grant funds, CPB had negotiated and paid for music licensing fees for broadcast and internet streaming for qualified CPB recipients,” Martin said. “As a station that broadcasts a significant amount of diverse music, KOPN will have to cover this in addition to the shortfall of grant funds.”
At Ozarks Public Broadcasting in Springfield, which combines operations for KSMU radio and KOZK-TV in Springfield, General Manager Rachel Knight went on the air Friday morning to explain the impact. The cut is about $1.3 million total, she said, approximately 10% of the radio station budget and one-third of the television budget.
“Like we’ve been saying over the last several months as we knew this was looming, these won’t be invisible cuts,” Knight told the audience. “I mean, we operate so efficiently right now that there’s nothing easy to cut.”
The stations have not launched formal emergency fundraising campaigns, Knight said in an email to The Independent, but the public is calling to give.
“Our phones have stayed busy this morning and web pledges are coming in fast,” Knight said. “We’re hearing frustration and disappointment from our audience in Congress’ decision to defund public media. They want to see our services continue and are stepping up with additional support.”
St. Louis Public Radio, operating with the call letters KWMU, will lose about $575,000 —  about 6% of its annual revenue — and face the same increased costs for pooled programming and services previously provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the station said in a news release.
“Public media has always served as a pillar of democracy, with broad support that transcends party lines,” interim General Manager Jess Luther said in the release. “Our elected leaders’ decision to rescind this funding dangerously diminishes the free flow of information, especially to communities that have few other sources of news and emergency alerts. When we say this is dangerous, we mean it literally.”
In addition to KOZK in Springfield, the PBS stations in Missouri are KMOS in Warrensburg, KCPT in Kansas City and KETC in St. Louis.
KMOS is an important resource for a region where 70% of the audience is rural and 17% have no internet access, General Manager Josh Tomlinson said.
“First and foremost, while the federal funding for public media is gone KMOS is not,” he said.
The federal funding represents about 40% of the station budget, he said.
“I can’t rule out the loss of programming or other services but we are not taking a panicked approach. Instead we are looking at everything strategically,” he said. “The community’s response has been remarkable.  We have heard from hundreds of viewers who have offered support and many more have contacted lawmakers on our behalf.”
For KCPT, the loss is about 13% of the station budget, according to an online statement about its emergency fund drive.
“For nearly 60 years, Kansas City PBS has been a trusted source of education, culture, and connection,” Kliff Kuehl, president and CEO of Kansas City PBS said in the online statement. “This loss of funding is a significant challenge, but we have always been powered by the people we serve and we will continue to inform, inspire and connect.”  
In a message to viewers on its website, KETC President and CEO Amy Shaw thanked viewers for donations and advocating for the station with messages to Congress. The cut is about $1.8 million, she said, about 13% of the budget.
“This was not the outcome we hoped for and fought for,” Shaw said. “However, Nine PBS’s commitment to serve the St. Louis region remains stronger than ever.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-18 22:58:14+00:00,CT Mirror,"Diquat among most commonly used aquatic herbicides in CT, documents show",John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/18/ct-diquat-hydrilla/,Recent plan to use diquat on hydrilla in the Connecticut River set off viral opposition campaign. But its use is common across the state.,"Before it became a flash point in a viral debate over the use of herbicides on the Connecticut River, the chemical diquat was widely used for years to treat lakes and ponds across the state, public records show.
The vocal criticism of diquat dibromide began earlier this summer when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced plans to renew and expand its studies using the herbicide at several points along the river to combat the invasive weed hydrilla, which has alarmed both officials and environmental advocates with its rapid spread throughout the river’s watershed.
Those plans quickly became the subject of social media posts accusing public officials of planning to “poison” the river and acting in secrecy to avoid public scrutiny. Many critics noted that diquat is banned in the European Union and the United Kingdom, and questioned why it appeared to be suddenly under consideration for use in Connecticut.
But a review of hundreds of permits issued by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection in recent years shows that diquat is among the most common herbicides used to treat lakes and ponds for invasive species such as hydrilla, water chestnut and Eurasian watermilfoil.
This year alone, the state agency has issued 188 permits authorizing the use of diquat, the records show. That amounted to roughly two-thirds of all permits issued by the agency this year for aquatic herbicide treatments. Over the previous three years, more than 765 permits were issued. 
In addition, diquat is commercially available as an ingredient in several household landscaping products, including Roundup.
In statement this week, DEEP said the permits “reflect common, permitted, regulated aquatic vegetation management practices, performed by licensed third parties.”
“DEEP evaluates each application based on site-specific ecological and public health considerations, ensuring that permitted treatments align with best practices for protecting water quality, aquatic ecosystems, wildlife, and human health,” the statement read.
The chemical’s widespread use, however, hasn’t tempered the blowback aimed at the Army Corps of Engineers and other public agencies over planned treatments on the Connecticut River. Chris Webby, a self-described conspiracy theorist and rapper from Norwalk, roused much of the current opposition by sharing videos about the plans with his more than 100,000 followers.
In response, multiple officials this week described being inundated with angry phone calls, emails and voicemails from people demanding a halt to the use of diquat — as well more threatening messages.
“The vast majority are people letting us know they saw this online, mostly from social media posts, and they’re angry,” said one recipient of the messages, who did not want to be identified for fear drawing more hostility. “A few are using more direct language that has crossed some lines.”
Webby did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Residents expressed anger about the use of diquat in the Connecticut River at a press conference in Deep River on July 18. “There’s no expert here. It’s a bunch of political bullshit,” the man said. “I want to know if you’re gonna keep spraying diquat without us knowing,” the woman said. Both declined to give their names, citing dissatisfaction with the Connecticut Mirror’s reporting on this issue. Credit: Dana Edwards / CT Mirror
In a previous interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Webby acknowledged his own lack of expertise on the subject but said he became passionate about the issue after watching videos on social media purporting to show the harmful effects of diquat spraying on a lake in Texas. Others critics have pointed to recently published research suggesting that exposure to diquat can damage the digestive system, particularly from consuming food grown using the herbicide.
Longtime environmental advocates who are supportive of the Army Corps’ efforts along the Connecticut River say they, too, share a skepticism over the use of herbicides in many instances. But, they said, the Army Corps leaders assuaged their concerns through a careful study of the river and the methods used to deploy the chemicals.
“Concerns about diquat are valid,” Alicea Charamut, executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut, said. “It’s a powerful chemical, but like most chemicals, the way it’s used makes all the difference, especially when comparing its use in agriculture to aquatic settings.”
Charamut attempted to alleviate some of the public’s concerns about the specific use of diquat to combat hydrilla in the river at a press conference hosted by state and federal officials in Deep River on Friday. She was joined by U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal — who helped secure $5 million in federal funding for the Army Corps’ project last year.
“I welcome different points of view on this topic, but right now we are deluged with a lot of misinformation from people who have suspicions and doubts,” Blumenthal said. “We’re here to dispel those doubts and say we must stop hydrilla before it kills other wildlife, habitat, environmental and ecological life.”
After hearing from all the speakers, several protesters began to shout questions and insults at Blumenthal and other officials, accusing them of ignoring studies on the health effects of diquat. Others said they wanted to hear directly from the Army Corps, which was not present at the press conference.
One woman, who gave her name only as Katherine M., pushed around a toddler in a stroller as she asked whether it would be safe for the child to swim in water that had been treated with diquat. 
Mason Trumble, deputy commissioner of environmental conservation at DEEP, responded that the agency requires any users of aquatic herbicides to post signs nearby letting people know when it is safe to swim, fish or use the water for irrigation purposes.
“They don’t really know exactly how unsafe it is,” the woman told reporters afterward. “If you read the studies and you look at the information out there, it’s not secret.”

Prior to the press conference, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it had no immediate plans to resume its studies using diquat in the river despite having permits in place to do so at three locations. A spokeswoman, Beth Gosselin, said the agency would wait until the end of an extended public comment period in mid-August to determine its next steps and would provide additional public notice before beginning any herbicide treatments.
“We remain committed to transparency and will continue to proactively engage with the public and our stakeholders,” Gosselin said in statement. 
While the Army Corps’ project is on hold, many Connecticut communities and property owners are still able to deploy the herbicide — with permits from DEEP, which require periodic reapplication. 
Sightings of those treatments, however, may have spurred some of the recent backlash. 
Earlier this week, Webby and others shared a video of two men in a fanboat spraying chemicals across a small pond. Webby said the video was taken in the town of Berlin, and he used it to accuse officials of lying about about their plans to delay the use of herbicides.
The Corps’ publicly-available plans, however, make no mention of any treatments in Berlin, which is not located along the river. In addition, officials have said the Corps’ methods involve injecting liquid diquat underneath the water, rather than spraying it above the surface. 
An analysis of the video by CT Mirror determined that it was filmed in Berlin at Paper Goods Pond, one of two areas where the town had previously notified residents of its plans to spray diquat and other herbicides.
The treatment, which was permitted by DEEP, took place on July 11 and was not associated with the Army Corps’ studies.
Officials in Berlin did not respond to a request for comment this week, but in a subsequent Facebook post responding to “recent comments and concern,” town officials provided more information about the project, which began several years ago following surveys, water tests and research into different treatment options.
“The project has been ongoing for several years and conditions are improving,” the post said. “An increase in fish and wildlife has been documented as a result of the management program… We are aware that false and out of context information is being shared online, but is important to rely on factual information, data collection, state and federal agencies, and expert scientists.”
At Paper Goods Pond on Thursday, Berlin resident Bill Grem III said he’d been fishing at that spot for years with his grandson. He said he’d noticed crews in the past spraying herbicides, and he’d seen posted signs stating when it was safe to resume fishing. He said he trusted the public advisories, and had not noticed any adverse ecological effects. 
As if to prove the point, he showed off a photo of his grandson proudly holding a large bass he had caught from the same pond.
“The fish aren’t dying,” he said. “It’s just something they have to do.”

(Getty Images)Increased scams aimed at defrauding food assistance recipients prompted the Arkansas Department of Human Services to create a new fraud prevention section of its website, the agency said Friday.
Available at ar.gov/snapfraud, the web section includes a series of preventive tips that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients should follow to help protect their accounts as well as a new form where victims of SNAP fraud can report stolen benefits to DHS.
“We are continuing to support all efforts to bring the perpetrators of this fraud to justice and to ensure that SNAP accounts are secure,” said Mary Franklin, director of the Division of County Operations within DHS, said in a press release.
While the department cannot replace lost or stolen SNAP benefits, the new centralized resource for submitting fraud reports will help officials identify trends that might help investigations into these crimes. Victims are encouraged to also report any fraud to law enforcement.
DHS is working with state and federal partners as well as the current Arkansas Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card vendor, Conduent, to explore ways that SNAP accounts can be protected from future fraud attempts.
“We need Arkansans who receive SNAP benefits to take steps to prevent this unauthorized access,” Franklin said. “Most importantly, they should immediately set a new four-digit PIN that only they know, and continue to change the PIN every month. This simple step goes a long way in locking scammers out.”
SNAP recipients can reset their pins by calling the EBT Customer Service line at 1-800-997-9999 and follow the prompts to reset their PIN. This is an important step to take before new benefits are added to cards, which typically occurs beginning around the 4th of each month.
DHS offered SNAP recipients tips on protection themselves from scammers:

Set a PIN known only to them and not commonly used
Keep the PIN secret; do not share with anyone outside the household.
Check EBT account regularly for unauthorized charges. Change the PIN immediately if any are found.
Check card readers to make sure nothing is overlayed or attached to the swiper or keypad to avoid “skimming.”
Never reveal the PIN to anyone. DHS will not reach out via email, social media or text to ask for a PIN.
Avoid saving an EBT card as a payment method for online shopping.

SNAP provides food assistance to eligible households to cover a portion of a household’s food budget, and benefits are distributed through an EBT card. SNAP benefits can be used to buy eligible food items for eating at home. Additional information about the program is available at humanservices.arkansas.gov/u/snap

(City of Oakdale)One of four Central Louisiana law enforcement leaders arrested this week for their alleged involvement in an immigration fraud scheme is still on the job, our news partners at KPLC-TV report. 
Oakdale Police Chief Chad Doyle has not submitted his resignation, according to city officials . He is alleged to have created false police reports for Chandrakant “Lala” Patel, a local businessman who federal investigators said paid police $5,000 for each foreign national they would add to the reports as a crime victim. 
That status would make them eligible for a U-visa, which are available to immigrants who are victims of crime or can assist in the prosecutions of criminals.
Along with Doyle, an indictment from the U.S. attorney for Louisiana’s Western District implicates Oakdale City Marshal Michael Slaney, Forest Hill Police Chief Glynn Dixon and Glenmora Police Chief Tebo Onishea in the scheme that prosecutors say put U-visas in the hands of 25 immigrants. 
Louisiana State Police have also arrested Alison Doyle, the police chief’s wife and an Oakdale city employee, charging her with two felony counts of malfeasance in office. It stemmed from an investigation into “unethical conduct in the municipal property bidding process.” 
In a social media post, state police said they obtained information from federal investigators involved in the Patel investigation. It revealed that Alison Doyle reportedly conspired with Patel to “manipulate the bidding process for two city-owned properties.” 
Alison Doyle is not mentioned in the federal indictment, which includes a sizable list of personal property, bank accounts and vehicles belonging to the five defendants that are eligible for forfeiture should they be tied to the offenses detailed.
According to KPLC, Alison Doyle left her job with the city in May. The police chief has not responded to calls from the station.

(Photo courtesy of Ørsted)The Maryland Department of the Environment is defending the permit it issued to a wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City, after a challenge from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Thursday letter from Maryland Secretary of the Environment Serena McIlwain also said the state would not be reissuing the permit, as the EPA requested, because the state had not made a mistake that needed correcting.
The EPA had contended that when Maryland issued the permit to Baltimore-based company US Wind, it identified the wrong process for citizens to file appeals.
Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey, EPA administrator for Region 3, which includes Maryland and other mid-Atlantic states, contended in a July 7 letter that any appeals challenging the air pollution permit issued to US Wind should be filed to the clerk of the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board.
But Maryland argues that its permit would need to be appealed through the state courts, which would involve filing a challenge at the appropriate circuit court — in this case in Worcester County.
Notably, the due date for a state court challenge has already passed. It was set for July 14 — about a month after MDE issued the permit, according to MDE’s website.
“Long-settled procedure dictates that state-issued permits are appealed under State law, not Federal law,” McIlwain’s letter says.

That letter also cites written decisions issued by the EPA’s appeals board, including one that stated that the board “lacked jurisdiction” to evaluate this type of permit.
“MDE will not re-issue the permit and will continue to follow the proper state procedures to consider appeals,” McIlwain concluded, near the end of the roughly two-page letter.
In an emailed response, the EPA stuck to its guns. An EPA spokesperson said the agency had notified MDE that the final permit decision “contains an error, with clear guidance on next steps. But they don’t seem to care about complying with legal requirements.”
The MDE website for the US Wind project originally referenced both the state appeals procedure and the EPA process, but McIlwain said that information had been “included at EPA’s request. It has been removed, and language has been added clarifying that the Federal appeals process does not apply.”
Authority to issue Clean Air Act permits like the one for US Wind is delegated to the state from the EPA — the basis of the federal agency’s claim for jurisdiction for appeals. That authority, specifically for permits on the outer continental shelf, was re-certified in early 2024 under the Biden administration.
The US Wind project, which is planned about 10 miles from Ocean City’s shoreline, is the wind project that is closest to construction in this region. The company, which leased the area in 2014, received a key permit from President Joe Biden’s (D) Department of the Interior at the end of 2024.
Final buildout of the project is still years away, but it calls for construction of 121 wind turbines, up to four offshore substations and one meteorological tower, according to the state’s website. When complete, the project could generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power up to 718,000 homes, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
Practically since its inception, the project has faced fierce opposition from local officials in the resort town, who cite concerns that beachgoers would lose a pristine ocean view if the turbines were visible from shore.

Since President Donald Trump (R) took office for his second term, offshore wind projects have landed in his crosshairs. Earlier this week, Trump announced that wind and solar projects would undergo increased scrutiny under his administration.  Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” also rescinds tax credits for renewable energy projects that do not begin construction by next July.
In April, Trump appointed Blarcom-Lackey to lead the EPA’s Mid-Atlantic office. She succeeded Marylander Adam Ortiz, who moved to a deputy secretary role at MDE.
Two other companies have offshore leases in the vicinity of Ocean City and the Delaware beaches — Ørsted and Equinor. While Ørsted received its first lease area around the same time as US Wind, Equinor won its auction last year. Neither project have received its federal permits from the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

Article Summary

The Cook County Democratic Party, one of the most powerful political organizations in the state, chose to back Rep. Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, in her bid to be the next state comptroller.
The comptroller endorsement sparked an intraparty fight, with House Speaker Chris Welch on one side and Senate President Don Harmon on the other.
The party made no endorsement in the race for U.S. Senate.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


CHICAGO — At a union hall on Chicago’s South Side, a powerful Democratic Party organization decided who to endorse in the March 17 primary in one key statewide race.

The Cook County Democratic Party Central Committee decided Friday to back Rep. Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, in her bid for Illinois comptroller, the state’s chief financial officer.

That decision sparked conflict between Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and Senate President Don Harmon, who backed different candidates.

In the race for U.S. senate however, the party declined to endorse. It’s the first open Senate election in the state since 2010.

“I think the party made the correct decision in making no endorsement in the U.S. Senate race,” Harmon told Capitol News Illinois. “It’s a marquee race with terrific candidates and I’m sure the voters will be able to make an informed decision without an endorsement.”

But Harmon objected to the party’s endorsement in the comptroller’s race, sparking a protracted closed-door debate.

Ultimately, Croke bested a list of competitors that included state Sen. Karina Villa, a member of Harmon’s caucus in Springfield.

While an endorsement from the Cook County Democrats does not guarantee a win, it is a major step for a campaign in Illinois.

Cook County has about 40% of the state’s population, and its Democratic Party has been a dominant political force for decades. Beyond the potential for turning out votes in the state’s most populous county, an endorsement from the Cook County Democrats can be a litmus test for support from state-level Democrats.

The group of party insiders considering who to endorse includes Welch and Harmon — both from suburban Cook County — and the committee that oversees statewide endorsements is chaired by state Rep. Bob Rita, D-Blue Island.

Additionally, influential Democrats in the General Assembly, like Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago; Sen. Laura Murphy, D-Des Planes, and Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, were all present for the meeting.

Party backs Croke for comptroller  

The race for comptroller, which opened up this week after sitting comptroller Susana Mendoza announced she was not seeking reelection, sparked a clash between several of the state’s most powerful politicians.

Five candidates asked for the party’s backing. Croke, Lake County Treasurer Holly Kim and Villa, D-West Chicago, were the favored candidates going into the meeting. Champaign County Auditor George Danos and former state Sen. Rickey Hendon also presented at the meeting.

Welch spoke at length in favor of Croke during the slating meeting, adding that he was “very happy to support” Croke. Croke is close to Gov. JB Pritzker, having worked in the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and on his first campaign.

Meanwhile, Harmon backed Villa.

During discussions over comptroller candidates, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle also noted she believed it is “really important for this party to support a Latino for statewide office.”

In a private session and on a very narrow vote, the subcommittee that recommends statewide endorsements backed Croke. Back in the public session, Harmon fought to try and reject the recommendation.

“We have a slate that does not have any representation from the Latino Caucus, no representation from the Asian Caucus, no one from outside the city of Chicago. I think this is the problem,” Harmon said.

This sparked another closed-door debate after which Croke emerged with the ultimate endorsement, something that “disappointed” Harmon.

“I worry that the party was more divided than evidenced by the final outcome,” he said. “But it’ll be up to the voters.”

No endorsement for U.S. Senate 

After Dick Durbin, Illinois’ current senior U.S. senator, announced his retirement, several candidates quickly popped up to replace him at the end of his final term.

The three frontrunners so far are Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly.

Several other candidates are in the race and three spoke to party insiders Friday: Christopher Swan, Kevin Ryan and Jump Shepherd. Kelly did not appear at Friday’s meeting, instead having an ally speak on her behalf following travel issues after a late night of voting in Washington.

In the end, the Cook County Democrats didn’t endorse any of them, setting up a contentious primary fight between a current statewide office holder, the one-time state party chair and a man who has nearly 10-to-1 funding advantage.

Durbin, meanwhile, plans on mostly staying out of the race. The retiring senator said Friday that there are three good candidates in the race. While he said he hasn’t “ruled out completely” endorsing someone, he probably won’t.

“I’m not likely to endorse in the race,” Durbin said. “I may in some other races but not that one.”

Governor, other endorsements 

The governor couldn’t make the meeting due to a family commitment. In his stead, Pritzker’s running mate Christian Mitchell addressed the collection of party insiders. In a brief speech, Mitchell echoed many of Pritzker campaign talking points.

But when the floor was opened to questions, Mitchell started taking heat.

Mitchell, who oversaw Pritzker’s cannabis legalization efforts early in the governor’s first term, once tweeted that he was “stunned at the level of ignorance” at a Chicago City Council meeting, something that multiple alderpeople in attendance on Friday took exception to.

“I don’t recall using that term, but if I did, I apologize,” Mitchell said when questioned by Chicago Ald. David Moore.

Mitchell also faced heat from Chicago Ald. Raymond Lopez, who pressed him on the administration’s relationship to the Latino community. Several Chicago alderpeople also interrogated Mitchell over the administration’s plans on Chicagoland transit, Chicago Public Schools and the closure of manufacturing plants on Chicago’s South Side.

But Mitchell did have his fans in the audience, with one committee member noting that Mitchell’s appearance at a fundraiser helped increase donations, something Mitchell said he wanted to replicate.

“I want to go everywhere, I want to be everywhere,” he said.

The party voted to endorse the Pritzker-Mitchell ticket, which faces no serious challengers within the Democratic party.

Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Treasurer Michael Frerichs and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias also received endorsements.

Lujan Grisham floats idea of protecting state lands in state law, while celebrating year one of a conservation legacy fund.","A coalition released a report on and celebrated the first year of New Mexico's Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund. (Courtesy photo)New Mexico officials and conservation groups gathered in Silver City earlier this week to celebrate investments in projects they say will address conservation, watershed issues and mitigate climate change — despite federal cuts to environmental programs.
In 2023, lawmakers approved Senate Bill 9 creating the “Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund,” an investment fund to provide recurring revenues for land, water, agriculture and outdoor recreation projects. The fund now sits at $382.9 million, and provides $12.5 million to 10 state agencies as grants.
July marked the first year of the fund’s payout, supporting 185 projects in New Mexico’s 33 counties and 10 tribal communities. Some of the projects included: addressing soil issues in Socorro; planting crop cover in Taos; and building trails in Carlsbad. Other priorities that received funds: agricultural programs to counter noxious weeds; wildlife surveys in every county; and watershed restoration from fire damage and historic buildings protections. View an interactive map of all the projects here.
New Mexico conservation groups issued a report on the fund’s inaugural year that totaled its positive impact on 64,905 acres of public and private land, but also noted that all of the projects included a  federal funding match, and all of the state agencies faced challenges as a result of federal funding upheaval. “While most grants are secure, some still face uncertainty,” the report said.
While celebrating the fund’s achievements at an appearance in Silver City, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also referenced the potential threats public lands in New Mexico could face under the current federal administration.
A previous version of the GOP’s spending bill in the Senate would have allowed the sale of 21,000 square miles of public lands in New Mexico to private buyers, sparking protests at the Western Governor’s association. The proposal was later scrapped on procedural grounds, but members of the New Mexico Congressional delegation say the fight isn’t over.
As such, Lujan Grisham in her comments floated enshrining protections from selling federal public lands in a special session, saying that while Republicans “didn’t achieve it, but they’ll do it again.” 
“I think we ought to have a special session and just put in state law: ‘No, thank you. We can’t do it here,’” she told the crowd.  And if somehow they can, we get every right of first refusal.”
In a written statement, the governor’s Director of Communications Michael Coleman clarified that the governor would not call a special session exclusively for public lands.
“She is strongly considering calling a special session to deal with Trump administration budget cuts and public safety concerns,” Coleman wrote. “Public lands could be placed on a call with those other issues.”
Coleman said Friday the timing for a prospective special session “remains unclear.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TTR30893-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-19 23:06:07.323182

(Photo courtesy of DNR's YouTube channel)The Iowa Department of Natural Resources participates in a global network that uses small tags and antenna receivers to track migratory patterns of birds, bats and insects, and it has recorded 607 detections of 340 individuals from 39 bird species in the state since 2021. 
These figures come from the department’s annual report, which shows the Motus Wildlife Tracking Network continues to expand each year in Iowa.
According to a DNR annual report, Iowa is an “important” migratory corridor and has some of the highest numbers of migrating birds – up to 1 billion in some years – during the fall season. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The “vision” for the program in Iowa is to have a 42-station, Motus “fence” from the Missouri River to the Mississippi River to “maximize” detection of north-south migrating species through the state. 
The DNR report said Motus stations in any location provide valuable insight into migratory patterns. 
Right now, there are 32 Motus stations in Iowa and more than 2,200 stations across the globe.  

Motus tags weigh 3% or less of the bird’s body weight and have a battery lifespan of around 400 days, which means both fall and spring migrations are tracked with a single tag. 
The tags emit a signal that is detected by the Motus stations when a bird flies near the station. 

DNR also expanded the program in 2024 by tagging birds that breed in Iowa, including 27 wood thrushes. 
Wood thrush is considered a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Iowa and in 25 other states because the population has declined across North America by more than 50% in the past 50 years. 
DNR tagged the birds at nine different sites as part of a regional Motus collaboration to track the birds and gain important knowledge on wood thrush habits that could help with their conservation. 
According to a press release from DNR, the project showed two wood thrushes from Iowa and a number from other states, were detected at the same Motus station in Belize this winter.
“This high detection rate indicates that this particular area of Belize is an important migratory corridor for the species at large, and that habitat conservation efforts in this region are necessary and valuable to Wood Thrush no matter where they breed,” the release said. 



Of the 27 tagged in Iowa last summer, 14 returned to the state during spring migration, according to the data.  
Some birds fly over a number of Motus stations during their migrations, like wood thrush 88620, which DNR reported was tagged at Brown’s Woods park in Des Moines before traveling through Missouri, down to José Cardel in Mexico. The bird then returned to Brown’s Woods park via Texas and then Missouri. 
DNR has tagged 10 more wood thrushes this year and hopes to continue the work to further understand the birds and “improve conservation efforts.” 
Individuals can support the Motus project by donating to cover the cost and maintenance of the antennae, or by hosting a Motus on their property. Information on applying to host can be found on the Motus website. 
Protect birds from reflective windows 
As fall migration season starts up in August, Iowans can take a couple of steps, some as simple as turning off the kitchen light at night, to keep birds from hitting windows. 

Cats and windows are the top human-related causes of mortality to birds in North America. And it’s not just skyscrapers that take out birds as they fly through a region. 
The Bird Collision Prevention Alliance reports more than 1 billion birds die from window collisions annually, and the American Bird Conservancy reported 44% of collisions occur with homes and buildings three stories tall or shorter. 
Birds can’t see windows, so reflections on a window, or a light on inside a window at night  can make it look like a habitat the bird can fly through. 
The best way to give birds a heads up? Decals, parachute-cord curtains, screens and even tempera paint can all be used to deter birds from trying to fly through a window.

Bottom left: cord added to the outside of a window. Bottom right: the view from inside the treated window. (Photo illustration courtesy of DNR)
DNR suggests placing decals or cords about 2 inches apart on a window to make sure the birds don’t try to squeeze through any perceived gaps. Curtains and blinds inside can help, but the best solutions are placed outside of the glass to ensure the birds can see them. 
A large majority of bird migration happens at night, which is why turning the lights off at night can significantly reduce bird collisions. 
DNR recommends going dark between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. during peak migration months, which are April and May in spring and August through October in the fall. 
BirdCast also offers location specific, night migration forecasts and alerts for those more interested in knowing when, where and how many birds are flying overhead.

U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich on Thursday announced that he and U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, along with 24 other senators, have introduced the Protect DREAMer Confidentiality Act, which would prohibit the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security from divulging to immigration authorities information disclosed in someone’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) application.
“I call on Congress to quickly take up and pass my legislation to make sure Dreamers are able to stay in school, keep working and contribute to our economy, and remain in their homes and neighborhoods,” Heinrich said in a statement.
The bill would also block DHS from referring anyone with deferred enforcement protections under DACA to any law enforcement.
Under the legislation, DHS could still share the information with national security and police agencies in order to identify or prevent fraud, and to investigate felony crimes, as long as they aren’t related to the applicant’s immigration status or for “particularized national security purposes.”
Approximately 825,000 people have received protection from deportation under DACA since 2021, according to Heinrich’s office.
“We need to ensure that Dreamers’ private information is not weaponized against them and is protected — full stop,” Heinrich said. 
In a news release, Heinrich’s office noted that DACA recipients have contributed an estimated $140 billion to the U.S. economy and $40 billion in federal, state and local taxes.
The bill’s introduction comes as the federal Internal Revenue Service is building a database of taxpayer records, including home addresses, to help ICE find and deport people, ProPublica reports. The Trump administration has also provided immigration authorities with Medicaid enrollees’ personal data.
Earlier this year, New Mexico enacted a new state law that prohibits the state Motor Vehicle Division employees from disclosing driver’s license data to any entity that would use it to enforce federal civil immigration laws, among other data protections.
“Dreamers in New Mexico and across the country are frontline health care workers, teachers, firefighters, police officers and scientists,” Heinrich said. “These inspiring young people are Americans in every sense of the word except on paper, and they want nothing more than to be productive members of their communities. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration doesn’t care about any of that and is indiscriminately sharing the private information of Dreamers.”

(Photo by Katherine Kealey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s public broadcasting networks are considering downsizing as they prepare for millions in lost funding included in the rescissions bill sent to President Donald Trump just after midnight Friday.
Every member of Iowa’s all-GOP federal delegation in the U.S. House and Senate voted in favor of the package, which cancels $9 billion in total previously approved spending, as it went through Congress this week to meet a Friday deadline. The cuts included in the bill are for foreign aid, including for projects through the now-closed U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in addition to public broadcasting.
The measure cuts $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service as well as hundreds of local public stations throughout the country. Iowa Public Radio expects to lose roughly $1 million and Iowa PBS $3.5 million because of the rescissions bill, which covers the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 as well as the following year.

Myrna Johnson, executive director of IPR, said the state’s public radio service is looking at “a steep hill to climb in order to fill that gap” from the federal funding cuts. That funding will mean IPR will be asking its listeners and the community for more donations and assistance, but will also mean budget cuts.
The loss of $1 million, roughly 10% of IPR’s budget, will mean the radio network likely cannot fill open positions — including a reporter and music production position — and may have to consider “downsizing our office and studio footprints” of the four offices currently throughout the state, Johnson said.
“It just takes away the richness of what we have to offer to our listeners in terms of coverage of the state, (and) in the live music opportunities that we can share with our listeners,” she said.
The reduction will also mean taking out funding from critical infrastructure maintenance, Johnson said. While IPR typically sets aside a portion of its budget each for maintenance and updates of infrastructure, like transmitters, antennas and transmission lines at the state’s 27 stations, she said that funding will be reduced this year.
Iowa PBS General Manager Andrew Batt said the $3.5 million cut will be “the largest one time cut in public money to Iowa PBS in our 55-year history.”
While specific programs and services at will be impacted by the rescission cuts have not yet been determined, he said these federal funds have historically helped Iowa PBS maintain its statewide network of nine broadcast towers and pay for local programming including coverage of the state fair, high school state championship spots as well as acquiring national science, nature and children’s programming.
Batt said it’s difficult to know the full impact the funding cuts will have on “a half-century system when it is rescinded 60 days before the federal fiscal year,” but that the budget shortfalls will be “challenging.” Many of the difficulties caused by the lost funding may not be immediately seen by Iowa PBS viewers, he said, but will have limit the public broadcasting system’s ability to create and air programs that viewers care about.
“It could be six months, nine months before that programming starts to dry up,” Batt said. “So a lot of this work is that this federal defunding is immediate in the next 60 days, but the ramifications have cascading effects for six months, two years down the line, in some cases, before some people see them.”
Volunteer reading service also may be affected
The cuts may also have an impact on other organizations that work with the state’s public broadcasting networks, including the Iowa Radio Reading Information Service. The nonprofit, known as IRIS, is a service of volunteers who read aloud news published in newspapers and other written outlets so that Iowans with visual impairments can access their local news. IRIS broadcasts are transmitted throughout the state using the Iowa Public Radio and PBS broadcast systems — a service that could be affected by the cuts to these public broadcasting networks, Maryfrances Evans, the IRIS director, said.
Iowa Public Radio charges IRIS a “minimum fee” to carry its signal, Evans said — a relationship that allows IRIS to continue reaching Iowans, she said, as the organization is a small nonprofit with little budget and only one full-time employee, herself.
“Increasing those costs to us to carry our signal would be understandable, but it would be very difficult for us,” Evans said. She also added that reduced funding for maintenance could mean Iowans who rely on IRIS may face difficulties accessing the news, saying “if they are not able to keep their infrastructure up to speed, then they go down, we go down.”
IRIS provides an important service for thousands of Iowans with impairments and disabilities that affect their ability to read, Evans said — many of whom are elderly, or who live in areas without an internet connection.
“For a lot of people, they ask, ‘why can’t people just, you know, use their computer? Why can’t you just get text to speech on your computer and listen to articles that way?’ Well, again, we forget people who don’t have internet, or can’t afford it if they had it, or don’t have a computer, or whatever,” Evans said. “There is a large population of our elder brothers and sisters who would not be able to access the news without IRIS. The newspaper remains the best way to get hyper-local information in these small towns, — it’s your paper. … So absolutely, we are the only way for people who can’t see the paper to hear about the local things happening in their town.”
IPR is unlikely to have to make changes to its relationship with IRIS, Johnson said, but added that this service is one example of why public broadcasting systems are vital to the state. Another, she said, is managing the state’s emergency alerting system.
“We manage the system, the testing system, for the state of Iowa, so other stations then sort of pick up that signal,” Johnson said. “There are ways that we serve the public that are kind of behind the scenes, but that we’re very proud of.”
Some of Iowa’s federal delegation made statements in support of the funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson said in a statement she was proud to support Trump’s effort to “end the culture of unchecked wasteful spending in Washington” by cutting funding going toward certain foreign aid efforts and for “Left-wing propaganda at NPR and PBS.”
Speaking on the U.S. Senate floor, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also spoke in support of the cuts to public broadcasting. She said “too often, these programs are partisan propaganda” on public broadcasting stations like NPR and PBS.
“NPR and PBS have a right to say whatever the heck they want, but they don’t have a right to force hardworking Americans to pay for their political propaganda being masked as a public service,” Ernst said.
Johnson said she believes NPR and public broadcasting stations throughout the country have “great editorial integrity” and report on stories that present both sides of an issue.
“I think everyone is trying to put media in buckets of sorts, of points of view,” she said. “And our goal is not to fit in any of those buckets.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)After months of tense negotiations as well as the possibility of a strike, nurses and health care workers at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital voted Thursday evening to OK a new, three-year contract with their employer Brown University Health.
From 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, members of United Nurses and Allied Professionals (UNAP) Local 5098 —w hich represents roughly 2,500 nurses, case managers and technical and support staff at the two hospitals — voted to ratify the agreement. 
“After a difficult series of negotiations, we are pleased to have reached an agreement that provides our members with a better contract,” Frank Sims, a registered nurse and president of Local 5098, said in a statement Thursday night.
The parties began to discuss a new contract in January, and talks stretched to 30 sessions in all. The previous contract expired on March 31.
Sims said the new deal includes wage increases, a lump-sum bonus, enhanced job security, and stronger rules around employee safety and workplace violence. He added that the union was “pleased” to approve the agreement after having rejected Brown Health’s “last, best, and final” offer when it arrived on June 6.  
“While this contract agreement is a step in the right direction, the future of health care in Rhode Island remains uncertain,” Sim said. “Our union will continue fighting every day to ensure the hard working nurses and health professionals at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital are protected and treated fairly, so we can retain and attract qualified nurses and health care professionals to care for our patients.”
The union voted to authorize a strike on June 23. But the strike never materialized, and the two parties forged a memorandum of understanding on July 3. That cleared the way for the successful ratification vote on Thursday. 
The hospital was also “pleased” with the deal, according to a statement issued Thursday night, about an hour and a half after the union released their own.  
“This outcome reflects the dedication and hard work of both bargaining teams and reaffirms our shared commitment to supporting our caregivers, advancing patient care, and strengthening our hospital for the communities we serve,” wrote Sarah Frost, chief of hospital operations and president at Rhode Island and Hasbro.
The hospital said Thursday it offered a market-competitive proposal that includes cost-of-living adjustments and competitive benefits plus other perks, for a package totaling $50 million over three years. 
The new contract will expire on March 31, 2028.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator.)The long-controversial Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project was officially canceled Thursday, bringing to an end the battle over the largest and most expensive effort to build land along Louisiana’s sinking coastline. 
The Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority confirmed the project would no longer be moving forward in a statement on Thursday. CPRA chairman Gordon Dove, in a phone call Friday, added that while CPRA “remains committed to coastal restoration,” the keystone project would be ended in its current form.   
Proponents of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion emphasised the wealth of scientific research that went into the planning for the axed project, as well as the urgency of stemming Louisiana’s rapid wetlands loss with the nearly 20 square miles of land the project expected to build over the next 50 years. 
Political battles over the increasing cost of the nearly $3 billion plan and its impact on industries such as oyster harvesting were key elements that led to the eventual death of the project. Those in the oyster industry laud it as a victory for their livelihoods, while environmentalists and scientists lament the loss as a massive backwards step for coastal restoration. 
“ We needed Mid-Barataria, frankly, many decades ago. It was a really big deal that it was under construction finally, and we had the resources to do it. And now all of that is cast aside,” said Amanda Moore, senior director of the Gulf Program at the National Wildlife Federation. 
Over a football field of land is lost along the coast every 100 minutes, attributed to a wide variety of factors including sea level rise, subsidence and overengineering of sediment-carrying rivers such as the Mississippi. Sediment diversions aim to reconnect the river with wetlands and mimic the way it naturally used to build land. 
“The need has not changed. There’s only one thing that has changed and that is the political landscape, so that is what ended this project,” said James Karst of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. 
For Karst and many others, the cancellation of the project didn’t come as a surprise. Gov. Jeff Landry openly opposed the project, saying its impact on Louisiana fisheries would “break our culture,” as his administration took steps to slow its progress. 
“We kind of knew it was going to get canceled,” said Peter Vujnovich, a third-generation oyster harvester based in Port Sulphur, adding that he’s “glad” for fewer “negative impacts on people that make a living out and about on the water.”
Vujnovich said his hopes for the success of future coastal restoration projects “depends on how they move forward. He added that he wants to see the forces who planned the Mid-Barataria project more actively involve communities and “include everybody,” like oyster harvesters, in future efforts. 
The project’s budget did set aside $400 million to mitigate impacts to local communities, including the oyster industry, though many opponents felt it wasn’t enough. 
“Hopefully, they’ll learn from this,” Vujnovich said. 
Mitch Jurisich, chairman of Louisiana’s Oyster Task Force, gave a “hallelujah” in response to the project’s death. He credits Landry’s involvement as a turning point in the effort to sink the Mid-Barataria coastal restoration plan. 
“Gov. Landry and chairman Gordy Dove with CPRA, they joined forces with us,” he said. “They basically turned the tide by stepping in with us.”
In a statement announcing the cancellation, the Trustees Implementation Group responsible for overseeing the funds provided for the project said CPRA determined “the project is no longer viable due to multiple factors, including the suspension of a federal permit by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and ongoing litigation.” 
Construction of the project started in 2023, but it faces lawsuits from Plaquemines Parish and oystermen trying to halt it. In April, Dove ordered a pause on all work related to the project. A few weeks later, the Army Corps of Engineers suspended one of its permits. 
In a letter to CPRA, the corps said it suspended the permit for a variety of reasons, including a shift in the state’s commitment to the project, the ongoing lawsuits and claiming the state “deliberately withheld” information the corps needed for its environmental impact statement. 
The last factor instigated a social media firefight between Landry and former Gov. John Bel Edwards, with an X post from Landry harkening the issue to a real-life “John Grisham” novel exposé and balking at the high cost. 
The project was already funded with $3 billion set aside in the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust, which came from the settlement from the BP oil spill disaster that devastated the Gulf Coast and the industries it supports in 2010. 
In the past, Dove has suggested a smaller, cheaper version of the diversion, which could include channeling the Mississippi’s sediment and fresh water at a rate anywhere from 5 to 30 times less than the 75,000 cubic feet per second called for in the Mid-Barataria plans.
“We haven’t heard any complete replacement plan … I think when you’ve got a problem of this magnitude, going with a smaller, less effective tool to do the work, you gotta think about whether that makes sense,” Karst said.
Jurisich said he is in favor of a smaller diversion. 
“We may look at a small freshwater diversion here or there, just to kind of nourish the newly created land. But you know, we killed the beast that was going to kill us, and that’s the best,” he said. 
The state has already authorized more than $600,000 for the Mid-Barataria diversion, and the remainder will now be used to close out the project. The rest of the money will return to the Deepwater Horizon trust to be used for future coastal restoration projects, which will need to go through a new approval process. 
Moore, with the National Wildlife Federation, said by canceling the Mid-Barataria project, the state is not only losing arguably the most important project in its Coastal Master Plan to fight land loss, but also the decades of planning and resources that went into it. 
 ”Time is something that is really worrisome to us because it took us decades to get a project like this moving forward,” she said. “And for Louisiana’s coast, I think you’re gonna be looking at least a decade or more if you’re gonna see something else come through.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8626-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-18 17:58:06.323537

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Public Broadcasting is bracing for potential cuts and layoffs after Congress canceled $1.1 billion in previously approved nationwide funding for public media.
The federal funding went to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes money to local stations. SDPB depends on $2.2 million in annual funding from the corporation, which is about 20% of SDPB’s budget. State funds account for a little more than half of SDPB’s budget, while fundraising, private donations and other sources make up the rest.
Because the federal funding was previously approved, SDPB was counting on it to arrive in the months ahead.
“I don’t think it’s realistic to raise an additional $2.2 million on 75 days’ notice,” said Ryan Howlett, CEO of Friends of SDPB, a nonprofit that raises money for SDPB. He added that donor support increased in recent weeks.
US House sends bill to Trump yanking funding for NPR, PBS, foreign aid; SD congressman votes yes

SDPB provides non-commercial public radio and television across South Dakota. In addition to news coverage, the organization provides live video and audio feeds of legislative and state government meetings, educational content, cultural programming, high school activities broadcasts, and emergency alerts across the state.
The congressional legislation, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law, also cancels $8 billion in foreign aid. It’s the second time in more than three decades that Congress approved a presidential recission request. 
Julie Overgaard, SDPB executive director, said if funding isn’t replaced, the organization will reduce staff by 20 to 25%. South Dakota Public Broadcasting employs about 60 people, meaning up to 15 people could lose their jobs.
Overgaard said she was raised on “Sesame Street” and “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” in a “poor rural household” in northwest Iowa. She said public broadcasting is what readied her for school, since she didn’t have access to the same resources as more affluent, urban areas of the state.
Overgaard said the cuts will have “real, long-lasting, damaging impacts” on South Dakota. Trump and some congressional Republicans have accused National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service of bias in their news coverage. 
“I don’t think this is about bias in media,” Overgaard said in an SDPB interview. “I think this is about trying to shutter and change people’s access to information, to public safety, to education, to things that make a big, big difference.”
Rounds, Johnson explain support for recission
The three members of Congress from South Dakota, who are all Republicans, each voted in favor of rescinding the funding for public broadcasting.
Sen. Mike Rounds announced his support after securing a handshake deal earlier this week with the White House budget director to transfer $9.4 million to Native American radio stations in rural areas across 11 states.
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Rounds said SDPB and tribal stations both provide critical alerts and public safety information for the state. But he said tribal radio stations receive up to 92% of their operating budgets from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
“These rural tribal stations that provide potentially lifesaving alerts would not survive without assistance from the federal government,” Rounds said. “SDPB receives financial support through donations to Friends of SDPB that assist with their operating costs.


Let us know what you think...


 

Rounds also said in a press release that with “nearly $37 trillion in federal debt, we must preserve essential services but also take meaningful steps to reduce wasteful spending.”
Overgaard said she was surprised to see Rounds rally funding for tribal radio stations but not other rural broadcasters.
Native Public Media CEO Loris Taylor wrote in an editorial that the organization is grateful for Sen. Rounds proposing alternatives, but said the solution found “is neither administratively feasible nor fiscally sustainable in the short term.”
Rep. Dusty Johnson “understands the importance of public broadcasting in South Dakota,” said spokesperson Kristen Blakely, and he applauded Rounds’ effort to help tribes. Johnson said in an interview with C-SPAN this week that he had concerns about the impact on rural and reservation areas of the state. Rounds’ deal made adjustments regarding those concerns, he said. 
The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SDPB doesn’t expect state to fill funding gap
SDPB escaped then-Gov. Kristi Noem’s proposed $3.6 million cut in state funding this winter. State dollars pay for the infrastructure and engineering of the public media network. Friends of SDPB largely pays for national programming, while grants from the corporation support local programming.
Lawmakers on budget committee reject Noem’s public broadcasting cut

Overgaard said there was resounding support from the public and Legislature for SDPB during the legislative session.
“If you take away one leg of our three-legged stool, it puts a lot of pressure on the other two legs to pick up the slack,” Overgaard said.
State Rep. Jack Kolbeck, R-Sioux Falls, sits on the legislative budget committee and fought against the proposed state cut. The committee will meet next week, where Kolbeck hopes to hear more about how the federal cuts will affect SDPB.
“I listen to SDPB a lot,” Kolbeck said. “I’m not in favor of them getting to the point where they can’t operate.”
Overgaard doesn’t expect the state or its taxpayers to “be forced or make up for the decisions our congressional delegation made.” She plans to advocate for public media funding in the upcoming federal budget process and seek other funding sources, such as donations and grants.
“I know it’s going to be another tight budget year. I will not be asking or expecting them to come up with $2 million,” Overgaard said of legislators. “We will have to solve that ourselves.”

(Photo by Anna Paige/Fargo Forum pool photo)A jury of nine men and three women on Friday convicted Democratic Sen. Nicole Mitchell of felony burglary and possession of burglary tools, concluding a case that has roiled the closely divided Minnesota Senate for over a year.
The jury deliberated for just over three hours Friday and asked no questions of the judge.
Mitchell faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the burglary charge. She faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison for the burglary tools conviction.
The verdict will almost certainly change the makeup of the state Senate, where Democrats currently hold a 34-33 majority. If Mitchell resigns, she’ll be replaced in a special election in what has been a solidly blue district in the past decade. If not, the Senate can expel her with a two-thirds vote, but they are not scheduled to come into session until next year. Only Gov. Tim Walz can call a special session.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, called on Mitchell to resign, for the first time, once the verdict was reached Friday: “Sen. Mitchell has told colleagues that she intended to resign if found guilty of this crime, and I expect her to follow through on that pledge. Our caucus remains focused on the issues that matter to Minnesotan families and communities.”
Carol Mitchell, whose house Nicole Mitchell entered without permission and is the stepmother of the accused, was in the courtroom Friday to witness the verdict, her first presence since she testified Tuesday. She hugged her son after the verdict was read.
Throughout the five-day trial, the state asserted that Mitchell, a first term senator, was intent on stealing her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into Detroit Lakes the home in April 2024. Prosecutors’ main evidence was that she told police officers as much during her arrest.
The senator said on the witness stand that she drove the 220 miles from her home in Woodbury to her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check. Mitchell testified in her own defense Thursday, saying she has witnessed her stepmother’s mental decline because of Alzheimer’s disease, and that she she was concerned that Carol Mitchell wasn’t receiving the attention and care she needed.
Mitchell said she lied to police about her intentions — and made up wanting to steal her father’s possessions — to allay her stepmother’s paranoia.
“The defense has repeatedly classified this as a welfare check. You’ve seen all the evidence, the time of night, the outfit, the tools. What does your reason and common sense tell you?” Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald asked the jury in his closing statement.
Mitchell’s explanation of lying to police to refrain from exacerbating Carol’s paranoia defied common sense, McDonald said.
Mitchell has admitted she entered the home without permission her defense said she would have pleaded guilty to a trespassing charge. But she has unequivocally denied stealing anything from the home, and multiple police officers testified that they didn’t find anything in Mitchell’s possession that was stolen property.
Under Minnesota law, a person doesn’t need to steal anything to be convicted of burglary, however. The law requires that a person enter a dwelling without permission with the intent to commit a crime of theft.
McDonald argued that Nicole Mitchell would have stolen her father’s flannel shirt and other possessions, but she was accosted by police.
“Of course she didn’t have anything on her. She got interrupted,” McDonald told the jury.

Carol Mitchell was in the courtroom Friday to witness the verdict, her first presence since she testified Tuesday. She hugged her son after the verdict was read.
Dane DeKrey, Mitchell’s defense attorney, told reporters he had “no idea” whether Mitchell will resign from the Senate. DeKrey said the biggest hurdle for the defense during the trial was the footage from police officers’ body-worn cameras and what Nicole Mitchell told police during her arrest. When asked if Mitchell’s attorneys will appeal the verdict, DeKrey said, “I imagine the answer is yes.”

(Senate webcast)TOPEKA — The federal government has renewed efforts to gather personal data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients in Kansas, giving the state a July 30 deadline to respond.
The Kansas Department for Children and Families received the request on July 9, said spokeswoman Jenalea Randall. 
“We are still reviewing the published notice in order to understand the intent behind this request and how the data will be used,” she said. “Our obligation to maintain these records in confidence is paramount, and they may only be disclosed to the USDA for specific program-related reasons.” 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins sent the letter to states, once again demanding private information about SNAP recipients, including Social Security numbers and home addresses, to be turned over by July 30. 
The information was necessary to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order that each federal agency access data from all state programs that receive federal funding, Rollins said in the letter. 
Nationally, the demand is being challenged in court by students, SNAP recipients, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger. On Thursday, the group filed a motion asking for a restraining order to stop the latest attempt at data collection while the lawsuit is pending, according to a press release. 
The Trump administration initially asked for the data in May, and DCF denied it. In a letter to a third-party data provider, DCF’s Carla Whiteside-Hicks, director of economic and employment services, said the agency has an obligation to maintain the records in confidence. 
“At this time, we are unsure as to the reason for the USDA’s request. As such, we are unable to consent to your turning the information over,” she wrote.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that in a sworn declaration dated May 30, a top USDA official at the agency promised it would not move forward without following federal laws.
Instead, the agency made this new demand, which the plaintiffs in the case said violates the Privacy Act, Paperwork Reduction Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.
“This Administration is trying to work the system,” said Madeline Wiseman, counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, in a press release. “After promising in court to follow proper procedures, USDA’s actions out of the courtroom continue to demonstrate a disregard for the legal requirements that limit its ability to collect and use this data. This lawlessness must be stopped.”
Randall said a hearing in the lawsuit is set for July 23, 2025, to address the temporary restraining order the plaintiffs have requested.
The Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, also is attempting to access other sensitive data from voter registrations, according to Stateline. 
So far, no requests have been made in Kansas, said Whitney Tempel, spokeswoman for Secretary of State Scott Schwab.

Both of New Jersey’s U.S. senators and all nine New Jersey House Democrats oppose the move to house detained immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, with most of them signing a statement Friday calling the plan an “inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources.”
“Using our country’s military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful,” the statement reads.
The news surfaced this week via a letter U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent to Rep. Herb Conaway (D-03), whose district includes the base, commonly known as Fort Dix. The letter was first reported by NJ Spotlight News.
Hegseth’s letter says detaining immigrants at Fort Dix will not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or other military requirements. The federal government also intends to house detained immigrants at an Army camp in Indiana.
The move could represent a massive expansion of immigrant detention in New Jersey. Earlier this year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began housing detained immigrants at a 1,000-bed facility in Newark. Immigrants picked up by ICE are also held at a private jail in Elizabeth.
A new federal spending bill signed into law by President Trump earlier this month increases funding to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda, with $45 million alone for new detention facilities.
It’s not clear how many detainees the federal government intends to house at Fort Dix. More than 11,000 Afghan refugees lived there temporarily four years ago after their chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan.
Immigration advocates have expressed concerns about the conditions inside ICE detention centers, and say the Fort Dix plan is part of a strategy to remove public oversight of Trump’s deportation push.
“Unlike New Jersey’s two private detention centers, Fort Dix will operate entirely under federal control, shielding it from accountability and making it nearly impossible for advocates, attorneys, and families to monitor conditions or support detained individuals,” the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said in a statement.
New Jersey officials also raised opposition to a reported Biden administration plan in 2023 to relocate some of the tens of thousands of asylum seekers living in New York City to the Atlantic City airport.

Susan Valdés speaking at the Cuban Club in Tampa's Ybor City on July 18, 2025. (Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Although it’s been more than seven months since Hillsborough County state Rep. Susan Valdés flipped to the Republican Party, that departure remains raw with some of her former Democratic colleagues, as emotions spilled out Friday during a discussion of the just concluded Florida legislative session.
“The thing is, unfortunately, the Democratic Party left me a long time ago,” she said when asked by a member of the audience at the Tampa Tiger Bay meeting whether she would have left the Democratic Party if it had held the majority in Tallahassee — something that hasn’t been the case in nearly three decades.
What Valdés didn’t say, though, was that her conversion to the Republican Party in Demember, shortly following the 2024 elections, came just a week after she lost a bid to chair the Hillsborough County Democratic Executive Committee.
The New York City-born daughter of Cuban immigrants who has represented an Hispanic-leaning district in western Hillsborough County since 2018, Valdés alleged that Hispanics were “always an afterthought” in the Florida Democratic Party. Right now, only two Hispanics serve in the Democratic caucus: Osceola County Rep. Jose Alvarez and Orange County Rep. Johanna López.
 No regrets
“If the Democratic Party were in the majority, and they would still be behaving the way that they were behaving without paying attention to the needs of the Hispanic community, yes, I’d change as well,” she maintained. 
Valdés boasted that by switching to the Republican Party of Florida, she was able to accomplish “in four months what I was not able to accomplish in seven years.” She referred specifically to her ability as a member of the majority to pass a bill (HB 1105) ending the certificate of completion given to lower-performing students in place of a diploma — a longtime goal for her going back to her years serving on the Hillsborough County School Board.
Valdes called it a “participation trophy” that essentially told students “Thank you — and you have no future.”
Democratic House Leader Fentrice Driskell, sitting to the immediate right of Valdés during the discussion, fired back immediately.
“I think it’s very unfair to voters to have asked for their vote one week to be a member of the Democratic Party and the next week or two to switch that,” Driskell said. “I think regardless of how it felt to me personally as a friend and a leader, it’s about what’s fair to the voters, and I think just also, you know, the Democratic Party is a broad coalition, and I just want to reject the sentiment that the Hispanic community was an afterthought. Absolutely not.”
Driskell added that she had worked with Valdés to build up a Spanish language media and communications strategy. Valdés countered that since she left the party, that communications program no longer exists.
She added that, as a Republican, she was able to bring “millions of dollars back to the district.” That comment triggered Tampa Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart.
“If you’re in the Democratic Party and you’re in the superminority and you have an opportunity to move over to the majority, of course you get more money,” she said. “Do you have any idea what kind of money Democrats were able to bring home from Tallahassee? Darn near nothing.”
Hart mentioned that Valdés had worked with her on criminal justice reform over the years, saying she would have hoped that with Valdés now a Republican she could have helped influence the governor when it came to a measure Hart sponsored (HB 181) that passed unanimously this session. It would have allowed a limited number of state inmates to receive early release from prison. DeSantis vetoed the proposal, saying that it “would likely result in making Florida’s parole system more lenient.”
“Not a single time did you even reach out to try and see if you can help, but you were in that position [as] vice chair as a member of the Budget Committee,” Hart said.
Staying above the fray
The two other Democrats on the dais, Tampa Bay area Rep. Michele Rayner and Sen. Darryl Rouson, opted not to engage directly on Valdés’ party switch.
“I think that the conversation can become unhelpful when we begin to personalize it, because, at the end of the day, there is an affordability crisis in the state of Florida,” Rayner said.
“I believe that when the voters elected me, they elected me to be effective. They elected me to bring results, and not just go up and run my mouth,” said Rouson, who has served in the Legislature since 2008. “I have found a way to remain a Democrat but work both sides of the aisle.”
Valdés’ flip to the Republican Party was followed just a few weeks later by another House Democrat, Rep. Hillary Cassel, jettisoning the party and reducing the number of Democrats in the 120-member to just 33. Cassel will face the voters for the first time next year in her district as a Republican, but Valdés is term-limited in her House District 64 seat. She has not said publicly whether she is considering another run for office in 2026.

Crawford County and County Judge Chris Keith filed a notice of appeal and a request to stay the monetary judgment on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. Keith and the county were among the defendants, along with Arkansas’ 26 prosecuting attorneys, in 18 plaintiffs’ challenge of two sections of Act 372 of 2023.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks permanently blocked the challenged sections in December, determining they violated the First Amendment. In addition to giving city and county governing bodies authority over library content, Act 372 would also have altered libraries’ material reconsideration processes and created criminal liability for librarians who distribute content that some consider “obscene” or “harmful to minors.”

Crawford County Library will foot the bill for lawsuit over segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books

 

Crawford County and Keith were among the defendants that lost a separate lawsuit over library content in September. U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes ruled in favor of three parents who claimed the Crawford County Library’s segregation of LGBTQ+ children’s books into separate “social sections” violated the First Amendment.
The case was reassigned from Holmes to Brooks, who ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs nearly $113,000. The Crawford County Quorum Court voted unanimously in April to accept the library’s governing board’s offer to pay the fees. The board was among the defendants along with Keith, the county, the quorum court and county library director Charlene McDonnough.
In May, Brooks ordered the defendants in the Act 372 case to reimburse the plaintiffs $441,646.49 in total.
“At this time, the Plaintiffs and Crawford County have been unable to reach a settlement for the fees and costs,” the county’s attorneys wrote in Thursday’s motion to stay the execution of the payment. “Therefore, Crawford County will appeal the award of attorney fees and costs.”

Crawford County stay 
Twice last year, the Crawford County defendants asked Brooks to dismiss them from the Act 372 lawsuit. Brooks denied the motions, ruling that the county and Keith would be responsible for implementing Act 372 if it went into effect and if appeals of challenged material reached the county government.
Attorney General Tim Griffin appealed the ruling on behalf of the rest of the Act 372 defendants in January.
Crawford County officials cited Act 372 as a reason to maintain the library’s “social sections” of LGBTQ+ children’s books that only adults could access. McDonnough’s predecessor, Deidre Grzymala, created the sections as a “compromise” after public outcry between December 2022 and January 2023, a few months before Act 372 became law.
In May, Grzymala sued Crawford County and a member of the library board, alleging defamation and breach of contract over her February 2023 resignation and severance package.

The incursion of parasitic fly into Mexico has interrupted livestock border trade for the last several months and is poised to continue. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)The nation’s largest border crossing for livestock between the U.S. and Mexico — in Santa Teresa, New Mexico — will not reopen as planned Monday, and is indefinitely delayed after further detection this month of the parasitic New World screwworm.
The crossing has been closed since May 11 when U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the immediate suspension of live cattle, horse and bison imports through the U.S., following the detection of the pest in southern Mexico states of Oaxaca and Veracruz, about 700 miles from the border. After the May closures, the USDA released a plan in early July to pursue staggered reopenings of livestock border crossings, which would have opened Santa Teresa on July 21.
However, unexplained cases detected further north in Mexico than expected re-closed all border crossings, New Mexico Department of Agriculture Secretary Jeff Witte told Source NM. While the ongoing closure’s direct impact on New Mexico agriculture is small, it has big implications for beef nationwide.
“Most of the cattle that come in through Santa Teresa end up going to other states’ feed lots or pastures, destined for places like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska,” Witte said via a telephone interview. “At one time there were trucks from 17 different states picking cattle up.”
The movement of the parasitic fly, previously eradicated from the U.S. for the last several decades, has disrupted international cattle trade through New Mexico, Arizona and Texas in the last several months. The screwworm’s name references the maggot’s behavior of burrowing into the flesh of a living animal, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage to livestock, wildlife and pets. Human cases, while rare, have been documented.
The USDA also announced the construction of an $8.5 million facility to raise sterilized flies to prevent further breeding in the wild, located at Moore Air Base in Mission, Texas and an additional $21 million for producing more sterile files at a facility in Metapa, Mexico. USDA also said it would further increase monitoring and data-sharing with Mexico officials along the border.
However, Mexico’s agricultural agents detected a new case farther north in Veracruz, just 370 miles away from the border on July 7, prompting USDA to scrap the reopening plan.
“The United States has promised to be vigilant — and after detecting this new NWS case, we are pausing the planned port reopening to further quarantine and target this deadly pest in Mexico,” Rollins said in a written July 9 statement. “We must see additional progress combating NWS in Veracruz and other nearby Mexican states in order to reopen livestock ports along the Southern border.”
Daniel Manzanares, the director of the Santa Teresa international crossing, told Source NM that USDA has not said when the reopening will happen.
The crossing is privately owned by the Unión Ganadera Regional De Chihuhua Co-op, often moving cattle from Northern Mexico — in Chihuahua and Sonora — into U.S. feed lots. The pest has not been detected in the northern portion of Mexico, but cattle still can’t cross.
In prior years, about 270,000 animals would have crossed through the border by now, Manzanares said. This year, with the closures, only one third, or 74,000 have made it across, necessitating lay offs of half of the 32 hired hands for transporting cattle.
“It’s just severely impacted all kinds of industry down here, from the truckers that drive to the buyers, the cattle brokers, we’ve laid off employees that won’t come back,” he said. “It’s just breaking a lot of people.”

More than two weeks since the attempted rollout, VTBuys, a digital platform intended to radically simplify how the state contracts and pays bills, is not yet live.

The launch of a sweeping new system for Vermont government contracting stumbled earlier this month when state IT staff discovered “security-related issues” and other bugs during its rollout, internal emails reviewed by VTDigger indicate. 
The botched debut means state employees are left managing day-to-day operations using a contingency plan. The staff team implementing VTBuys has urged workers across departments to hold off on non-urgent invoices, stop working with new suppliers if possible, and delay new contracts, according to the emails. The stopgap protocols require documenting a variety of processes that will need to be re-input once the new system rolls out.  
VTBuys is a joint project of the Vermont Department of Buildings and General Services — which houses the state’s Office of Purchasing and Contracting — and the Vermont Agency of Digital Services, which takes a leadership role on state IT projects. 
The new digital platform is intended to modernize the way Vermont state government works with vendors, creating a single streamlined interface for bids, contracts and payments. The system “will be a single-stop shop for businesses to register as suppliers, submit all paperwork, sign up for bid notifications, and complete all of their transactions with the state,” as described by the department on its website 
In an interview, Wanda Minoli, commissioner of the Department of Buildings and General Services, called the initiative “a radical change in how we pay bills and do contracts.”
She described this month’s hiccups as routine. 
 “You’ll have that with every project,” Minoli said. “This is a good thing, not a bad thing.”
The massive redesign of how the state works with vendors began in 2019. The state inked a $6.4 million contract with multinational company KPMG for the project, with an additional “software solution service” contract valued at $595,000 per year, Minoli said. 
The Agency of Digital Services maintains a public-facing dashboard with details about state IT initiatives. The interface had listed the VTBuys implementation cost at about $17.2 million. But when VTDigger inquired, an agency spokesperson said the implementation cost was actually half that, and the dashboard has since been changed. The project is listed as 17 months behind an “initial completion date.” 
The House Committee on Energy and Digital Services crafted a law this year requiring more detailed information on ongoing projects moving forward.

Early on, the VTBuys project hit a number of delays as BGS responded to emergencies, first related to the Covid-19 pandemic and then the 2023 flooding, which damaged 22 state buildings in Montpelier. Repairs to those buildings have been a top priority for Buildings and General Services, according to Minoli. 
As the combined Building and General Services and Agency of Digital Services team got closer to launch this year, they set a July 1 target. The idea was that by coinciding with the new fiscal year, the change would be less disruptive, Minoli said. 
But the day of the rollout, the implementation team discovered immediate problems. 
“Due to a technical issue, the VTBuys rolling ‘go live’ will not begin today,” the team wrote to state employees on July 1. “We will share the revised timeline for our rolling launch as soon as possible.”
More than two weeks later, the timeline still isn’t clear. Minoli declined to share when the new system might go live. 
On July 11, the project team conveyed additional issues about the launch to employees across state government. 
“After careful consideration of the ongoing challenges with the deployment and delays in achieving a successful go-live of the VTBuys system, the State executive leadership has made the decision to discontinue all efforts related to the production deployment of the system,” wrote Stacy Gibson-Grandfield, director of the Agency of Digital Service’s enterprise project management office. 
The new goal was restoring the previous financial management system called VISION.
“State IT staff are now directed to focus on reverting functionality back to VISION without delay,” the email said. “Restoring VISION to its normal function is our top priority, ensuring that business offices can operate seamlessly … to avoid any financial impacts.”
On July 14, state IT leaders said security issues had been resolved, but bugs remained. Minoli said Wednesday that seven out of 12 bugs identified had been fixed. 
Despite the rocky start, Minoli remains optimistic about VTBuys. She said once the system is operational, vendors will no longer have to re-input the same information over and over, and disparate processes will be consolidated into one platform.
“It is going to change how we can do business,” the commissioner said.

With a June unemployment rate of 2.8%, unchanged from last month, Montana has now seen nine straight years of rates under 3%, and four years below 3.4%.
The governor’s office and Department of Labor and Industry continue to laud the low seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, as it had only dropped below 3% on three occasions since the rate started being measured in the 1970s.
The statewide rate is a full 1.3% below the U.S. average for June.
“With more Montanans working now than ever before and historically low unemployment, we’re seeing the results of our pro-jobs policies,” Gov. Gianforte said. “This month marks a new record stretch of four years of low unemployment and reinforces Montana’s reputation as one of the nation’s best places to live, work, and raise a family.”
Gianforte first took office in January 2021, a month that saw unemployment at 4% statewide — down from a COVID-pandemic high of 11.9% in April 2020, but higher than pre-pandemic numbers. Unemployment dropped for nine consecutive months, and has remained below 3.4% since July 2021.
The state said the labor force in Montana decreased by 752 workers last month. Data shows the state has lost 500 jobs during the month with losses in retail and wholesale trade, private education, healthcare, administrative and support services, and federal government employment.
Fifty of the state’s counties currently have unemployment rates below 4%, but only six of them have seen net job gains during the last year year, according to data from the Department of Labor and Industry.

Chuck Grassley is second from the right. (Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)This week in the nation’s capital, President Donald Trump signed a fentanyl reclassification act led by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa legislators cheered the passing of a federal rescission bill through Congress and House members helped send a $832 billion defense appropriations bill through the GOP-led chamber.
The Grassley-led HALT Act permanently reclassifies fentanyl-related substances as a Schedule 1 drug. In February 2020, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration issued a temporary scheduling order reclassifying fentanyl-related substances to Schedule 1. Congress has since extended this order a total of 10 times. 
The act has received criticism from advocacy groups such as the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights stating that classwide drug rescheduling may exacerbate incarceration rates and sentencing. 
The president’s signing of the HALT Act Wednesday was attended by several Iowa officials including Grassley, Attorney General Brenna Bird and Rep. Randy Feenstra. 
“The HALT Fentanyl Act is now the law of the land, marking a major victory in America’s fight against fentanyl,” Grassley said in a press release. “By permanently classifying fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I, the HALT Fentanyl Act will save American lives and prevent deadly fentanyl knockoffs from making their way into Iowa communities.”
“This bill is a huge win for Iowa and the entire country,” Bird said in a press release. “As a mom and prosecutor, I am deeply aware of the devastating effects fentanyl has had on our communities. And as Attorney General, I hear about this issue from Iowans regularly.  
“I applaud President Trump for signing into law the HALT Fentanyl Act and taking decisive action to keep fentanyl and other poisonous substances out of our country.” Feenstra stated. “In conjunction with our work to secure the border, this legislation will help law enforcement confiscate dangerous drugs, combat the drug cartels, and save lives.”
Rep. Ashley Hinson stated: “This bill will help end the scourge of the opioid epidemic that has taken too many American lives — we will continue working together to get dangerous drugs off our streets & ensure dealers are punished for their crimes.” 
Rep. Zach Nunn also stated he “proudly cosigned” the HALT act for its ability to “crack down on traffickers,” keep “deadly substances off our streets” and ensure consistent penalties for fentanyl distributors. 
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks stated in a press release: “As an original cosponsor in the House, I was proud to help lead the fight to get this bill across the finish line. With this law in place, we’re going on offense. We’re giving law enforcement what they need to crack down, take control, and stop this poison from claiming more lives.”

All of Iowa’s delegates voted in favor of Trump’s rescission bill to axe $9 billion in previously approved funding for programs including the U.S. Agency for International Aid, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and National Public Radio.
The rescission bill passed both chambers of Congress Friday with a vote of 51-48 in the Senate and 216-213 in the House. This marks the second time in over three decades Congress has approved a presidential rescission request.
Ernst praised the cuts to USAID, citing “abuses” such as an alleged $148,000 sent to a pickle-maker in Ukraine through USAID and $20 million spent on Sesame Street programming in Iraq.
“If we are ever going to get serious about our debt crisis, Congress needs to pass a rescissions bill like this every single week,” she stated in a press release.
Hinson responded to the bill with a statement on X: “President Trump is the first president to actually deliver on real savings for the American people and end the culture of wasteful spending in Washington.”
Grassley took to X as well to state “Fed govt is $36 TRILLION in debt Last night Sen Republicans voted to roll back DC’s out of control spending.” He added that Republicans plan to build on the provisions in the “big, beautiful bill” going forward. 
Miller-Meeks called the rescission cuts a one of two “big wins for the American people” in an X post. She also cheered the passing of a defense appropriations bill increasing military spending. 
Democrats in both the House and Senate voted against passing the rescission bill. Several Democratic legislators criticized the rescission bill for cutting funding from public broadcasting that will impact rural news sources and withdrawing U.S. support from countries in need.
Ernst spearheads amendment to defense appropriations bill
Ernst led an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to require all defense spending be posted on the public website USAspending.gov. 
This amendment will directly target “Other Transaction Agreements” which are flexible spending agreements not subject to standard acquisition laws and requirements.
“I am ending Pentagon bureaucrats’ game of hide and seek with your tax dollars,” Ernst stated in a press release. “Americans have a right to know where their hard-earned dollars are going. I’ve long been working to make the Pentagon more transparent and accountable and will continue to work to review the hidden receipts.” 
The expansive defense bill passed through the House with a split vote of 221-209 on Friday. It allocates nearly $832 billion for provisions such as: 

Basic pay increase for all military members by 3.8% starting 2026
Codifies Trump’s executive order to end military diversity, equity and inclusion programs
$13 billion for missile defense and space programs
$7 billion for “classified space superiority programs.”
$2.6 billion for hypersonic missiles.
$1.15 billion for counterdrug programs
$500 million for Israeli Missile Defense
$500 million for Taiwan Security Operative 

Miller-Meeks responded to the provisions in a press release stating: “This bill gives our troops the pay raise they deserve and the resources they need to defend this country.” 
The bill moves to the Senate for reconciliation.
Cedar Rapids to receive infrastructure funding from Grassley-backed bill
Cedar Rapids is set to receive $25 million in federal funding through the Grassley-backed Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021. 
The funding is allocated for a “flood resiliency project” and road improvements on highway I-380.
“I’m happy to announce that the City of Cedar Rapids is receiving a $25 million award to improve its flood resilience and infrastructure,” Grassley said in a press release. “You can imagine how important this funding is for Cedar Rapids, after the city has been hit by devastating floods. These federal dollars will be put to good use to strengthen the Cedar Rapids community.”

(Screenshot via KET)Cuts to public broadcasting that cleared Congress early Friday morning will cost KET funding for most of its original programming and a fourth of its workforce, said the head of Kentucky’s statewide public television network.
 “KET has begun the difficult process of determining what must be reduced, suspended or ended due to the significant loss of CPB funding,” said Shae Hopkins, KET executive director and CEO, in a release Friday afternoon.
Republican President Donald Trump pushed Congress to end funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or CPB, including rescinding more than $1 billion that Congress already had approved.
Hopkins said $4.2 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has paid for “the majority of KET’s productions and 25% of KET’s total workforce.”
“For nearly 55 years, CPB funding has been the primary source of support for KET’s local productions and related services,” said the release.
Kentucky’s lone Democrat in Congress, U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville, was the only member of the state’s delegation to vote against the measure. 
Republican U.S. Reps. Andy Barr, James Comer, Brett Guthrie, Thomas Massie and Hal Rogers voted in favor of $9 billion in cuts, most of which came from foreign aid.
U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul approved the bill when the Senate passed the rescissions package Thursday, ahead of a Friday deadline.
One cost-cutting step KET already has taken is canceling its coverage of this year’s annual Fancy Farm Picnic in West Kentucky next month. The gathering typically brings the state’s high-profile elected officials and candidates together in front of a crowd. KET’s coverage included broadcasting their speeches statewide.

The network is not covering Kentucky’s most famous political event this year because federal funding cuts have wiped out its budget for original programming.

KET’s Hopkins said: “While extremely disappointed, we are heartened by the outpouring of support from across the Commonwealth. And although we know there are changes to come, KET remains steadfastly committed to the people of Kentucky and providing trusted, educational programs and services.”  come
The federal funding cuts will also affect public radio stations across the country. Louisville Public Media sent an email to supporters Friday morning that said the bill cuts “$376,000 from our budget TODAY.” The money funded local journalism, emergency alert systems during storms and cultural programming. 
“This final vote effectively ends federal funding for LPM, our sister stations throughout Kentucky and the public media system nationwide – after bipartisan support for almost 60 years,” the email said. “But this will not be the end of Louisville Public Media.” 
LPM and its sister outlets are collecting donations from supporters in hopes of making up for the loss of the federal funding. 
Some Kentucky Democrats slammed the public media cuts. McGarvey said on X ahead of the House vote that “public broadcasting saves lives.” 
“I’m voting no, and every House Republican who’s ever claimed to care about rural Americans should too,” he said. 
Cherlynn Stevenson, a candidate in the 6th Congressional District, said in a statement that the decision by Republicans in Congress to cut public media is “a shameful and reckless move that will leave rural Kentuckians across our Commonwealth in the literal dark.” Stevenson is a former Kentucky House Democratic caucus chair. 
“When natural disasters strike — like the devastating floods and tornadoes that have wreaked havoc on our communities — Kentucky families rely on life-saving weather alerts through public radio,” Stevenson said. “And when private radio towers are unusable, first responders depend on public radio towers to communicate with one another.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/comer2024ket-1024x570.png,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

That’s the general advice from state officials when it comes to enjoying New Hampshire’s beaches.

That’s the general advice from state officials when it comes to enjoying New Hampshire’s beaches. The state provides resources for summer swimmers looking to avoid unscenic surprises from bacteria and toxic algae, but with hundreds of waterbodies, officials often rely on residents to report problems.
The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services maintains an online tool, updated daily, called the Healthy Swimming Mapper, which tracks advisories for fecal bacteria at public beaches and harmful algal blooms across state waters.
The system’s flagged active fecal bacteria advisories collected from sampling at the following spots:

Ellacoya RV State Park Beach in Gilford since July 16
Northwood Town Beach since July 17
Corcoran’s Pond Beach in Waterville Valley since July 17

Bacterial contamination from sources like stormwater runoff or failing septic systems triggers advisories when levels exceed state safety standards. Meanwhile, toxic cyanobacteria blooms pose more serious health threats.
“A bloom can manifest in minutes,” said Amy Smagula, chief aquatic biologist at NHDES. “That’s why we really rely on that ‘look, check, report.’ Because there are so many more eyes out there than we have staff biologists.”
This year’s bloom activity appears typical for mid-July, with the department having received about 50 reports of harmful algal blooms statewide, according to Smagula.
“We’re normal from that standpoint,” she said. “It seems quieter this year because Lake Winnipesaukee didn’t have that early season bloom like they did in 2024.”
The state takes a measured approach to issuing warnings, reserving them for significant lake-wide events rather than isolated bloom reports that appear on the swimming map online.
“A lot of times we receive a notice of a possible bloom from a shoreline resident where they’re observing a little bit of material in front of their dock or beach, and that’s not necessarily representative of the whole lake,” Smagula explained. “Rather than raising an alarm when there’s no need for alarm, because blooms can be very isolated, we put out a message to the lake residents that say we’ve observed a bloom and let us know if you start to see it in other places.”
For beach bacteria issues, daily retesting continues until levels drop back to safe standards. Cyanobacteria bloom warnings typically last about a month but can range from a week to several months depending on conditions, according to the department.
The mapping system allows folks to search for specific locations, check current conditions, and sign up for email alerts for particular waterbodies and statewide updates. Weekly resampling continues from May 15 until Oct. 15 for any lakes under cyanobacteria warnings.
Those blooms are popping up in New Hampshire and in other states more often these days, especially during the summer, due to climate change-driven warming and pollution.
Another cause for blooms? Boat wakes that erode the shoreline and disturb the lake bottom, especially when done too close to shore and in too shallow of water, according to Andrea LaMoreaux, president and policy advocate for NH LAKES.
Trouble signs to spot for: weird/unusual discoloration, floating mats of algae, or scummy surface films.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warns cyanobacteria can cause a range of problems for humans, including headaches, fevers, skin rashes, respiratory symptoms, upset stomachs, seizures, liver and kidney damage, and even death. Cyanobacteria can also be fatal for dogs that drink contaminated water or lick themselves after a good swim, according to NHDES.
When in doubt, maybe find another swimming spot. To report potential water issues, people are urged to fill out a form on the department’s website or call the Harmful Algal Bloom Program at 603-848-8094. 
If you or your pets get sick, you can submit an illness report to help the state track waterborne sicknesses (after seeing a doctor or veterinarian, of course).",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cyanobacterianew-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)South Dakota lawmakers will gather in September to decide whether to replace the state penitentiary. 
On Friday, Gov. Larry Rhoden issued an executive proclamation calling a special session of the Legislature for Sept. 23.
The news comes a little over a week after the governor’s Project Prison Reset task force voted to endorse a 1,500-bed complex on undeveloped land in northeastern Sioux Falls. 
Prison task force picks Sioux Falls, caps price at $650 million for 1,500 beds

The group recommended a price cap of $650 million, which is roughly the amount that has been set aside for prison construction over the past three years, potentially allowing the state to pay cash for the project rather than taking on debt. 
The cap is around $75 million less than consultants and work managers said would be necessary for a project of that size during the task force’s final meeting on July 8, but the group decided that a higher price wouldn’t earn legislative support. 
Spending bills require the support of two-thirds of lawmakers. The final spending push for an $825 million prison on a controversial Lincoln County site failed to clear that hurdle in February.
In a letter to Rhoden requesting the special session, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, who leads the prison task force, said compromises were necessary to find an answer that would appeal to the Legislature and ease overcrowding in the state’s Department of Corrections facilities.
“The task force’s unanimous vote for its recommendation demonstrates that we have found a good site for a new penitentiary and a strong path forward,” Venhuizen wrote.
The new prison, if approved by lawmakers, would replace the oldest parts of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls. That building was initially constructed in 1881, prior to statehood.

(Photo by Aaron Bolton for KFF Health News) The Montana Legislature voted to override Gov. Greg Gianforte’s veto of a bill that would use state funds to reimburse counties some of the cost of holding inmates in local detention facilities while awaiting mental health evaluations or treatments. 
House Bill 643, brought by Rep. Tracy Sharp, R-Polson, was seen by many as a stop-gap measure to address rising costs to counties that have seen increased mental health issues arising in civil and criminal cases. 
The law provides a one-time appropriation of $6 million for the Department of Public Health and Human Services to reimburse counties for holding individuals awaiting a DPHHS evaluation, or have been committed to DPHHS and are awaiting an open bed at a mental health facility. The reimbursement rate from DPHHS would be $133.88 per day in fiscal year 2026.  
Gianforte vetoed the bill, citing its cost to Montana taxpayers and lack of long-term solution. 
“This issue requires a permanent, comprehensive solution, but House Bill 643 only applies an expensive Band-Aid,” Gianforte wrote in his veto letter. 
But the Legislature, which voted overwhelmingly 99-1 and 48-2 in the House and Senate respectively during the session, disagreed with the governor. 
A veto override poll sent to lawmakers closed on July 14 with 67 representatives and 34 senators voting for the legislation — the exact number required to usurp the veto pen. 
“This was a very bipartisan bill, it had support across the entire state,” Sharp told the Daily Montanan. “It was intended to help all the counties in the state dealing with the issue of having to hold people for the Department of Public Health and Human Services.”
Sharp said that commissioners from various counties had approached him before the legislative session and pointed out that the state makes similar reimbursements through the Department of Corrections, if there is a waiting list to get into a state-run prison, but not for mental health services. 
According to the bill’s fiscal note, DPHHS said the waitlist for individuals who need DPHHS evaluations or beds at state facilities averages between 100 and 125 — a number not projected to decrease in the next few years. Those individuals are held in county detention centers, sometimes for several months. 
Travis Ahner, the Flathead County Attorney, told the Daily Montanan that one inmate currently housed in the county detention center had been sentenced to DPHHS custody in mid-October, but had yet to leave the county. 
In the more than 270 days since his sentencing, the county would be owed more than $37,000 in reimbursements were HB 643 currently in effect. The same inmate had also waited for several months for a DPHHS evaluation — spending even more time in the county jail at the expense of the county. 
Ahner said that there are several inmates in the county’s detention facility awaiting evaluations by DPHHS, and “a couple” who have been committed, but have yet to be transported to new facilities.
“It would free up a lot of money,” Ahner said. “The county’s other expenses are still being accrued. It takes money that we have been spending on these particular inmates, and we won’t have those expenses on the books.”
But Ahner, and Sharp, both acknowledge that while the funding will help counties short-term, it doesn’t address the state-wide problem of limited facilities for inmates who need mental health services. 
“There’s nothing in this that specifically says you’re going to get evaluations faster, or that you’re going to get a placement faster or additional beds,” Ahner said. 
Sharp told the Daily Montanan that he hopes the interim period will allow DPHHS and lawmakers to gather data that can be used next legislative session to determine the best path forward. 
“The Governor isn’t incorrect when he says it’s kind of a temporary fix,” Sharp said. “But it will allow us to return in 2027 and see where we are, what we need and see if we will need to take money from the general fund in future to support counties while DPHHS continues to work on long-term solutions with the state’s mental health facilities.” 
“This is me saying, ‘Hey, while we’re working on fixing this, let’s do something to pay for the situation counties are dealing with,’” he added.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In a swing through Nashville to highlight immigration crackdowns, Kristi Noem called the city’s mayor undeserving of office, accused a local university of obstructing justice and pledged a more visible immigration enforcement presence on the city’s streets.
Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, spoke to reporters Friday to highlight what Trump administration officials are calling the “worst of the worst” among immigrants with criminal histories.
She spotlighted the arrests of four unnamed men in Tennessee whom, she said, are illegal immigrants tied to gangs or terrorism and accused of crimes that include homicide, promoting prostitution and child rape. 
“President Trump has been focused ever since he’s been in office on making America safe again,” Noem said. The president, she said, promised “to make sure we’re going after the worst of the worst every single day, to get the murderers, the rapists, the child pedophiles and pornographers off of our streets and out of the country.”
Noem then pivoted to take aim at Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell.

O’Connell updated a longstanding policy requiring city personnel to report interactions with federal immigration agents to the mayor’s office, requiring notice within 24 hours instead of three days required under the previous policy. O’Connell implemented the policy update after immigration raids swept up nearly 200 people in May.
Nashville, like the majority of Tennessee jurisdictions, has also not opted into formal cooperation agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a point of contention with state Republicans leaders, who have offered incentives to enter into the agreements, and Trump administration officials, who have encouraged more such local partnerships.
“I’m specifically calling out the mayor of Nashville,” Noem said. 
“By his rhetoric and by what he is requiring his city employees to do, and by not having the backs of these ICE officers, he is allowing more children to be trafficked, more children to be victimized and more families to suffer because of his actions and politics,” she said.
“He doesn’t deserve to be mayor. He doesn’t deserve to be in office,” said Noem, who also called O’Connell’s actions “shameful.”
Noem also took aim at Belmont University, a private Christian institution in Nashville with about 9000 students.
Townhall, a conservative website, this week accused the school of sheltering undocumented students and subverting a Trump administration ban on campus diversity initiatives. 
“We’re seeing obstruction against federal immigration law by Belmont University,” Noem said Friday.
“As you know, they’ve openly said that they will house illegal immigrants on their campus and do that in defiance of the federal government,” she said.
A Belmont spokesperson on Friday said, “we are aware of comments from government officials and maintain that the university is in compliance with federal laws.”
O’Connell’s office did not immediately respond to questions about Noem’s remarks.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to remain jailed in Tennessee as judge weighs arguments on release

Noem also weighed in on the criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was brought to Nashville to face two human smuggling charges after a Trump administration attorney admitted the Maryland father of three had wrongly been deported to El Salvador. 
Calling Abrego a “monster,” Noem said the case against him was “overwhelming” and said she hopes the federal judge presiding over the case, Waverly Crenshaw, Jr. “does the right thing and brings this man to justice.”
Crenshaw is currently weighing a motion by federal prosecutors to keep Abrego, a Salvadoran national, detained pending trial while Abrego’s attorneys in a separate case are fighting the Trump administration over its plans to deport him to a “third country.”
Noem promised Nashville residents they could soon see more immigration enforcement, pledging “dozens” of new agents now that Trump has signed into law the “big beautiful bill,” which includes substantial increases in the budget of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
“What the people of Nashville will see is obviously more individuals and agents, but they’ll also see more training and equipment,” she said without detailing what types of equipment.

“Dozens more officers and agents will be here in the Nashville area,” she said.
The media also served as a target for Noem’s criticism on Friday for promoting what she characterized as “false narratives” about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement activities. 
Asked by a journalist about the targeting of immigrants based on “skin color,” Noem sharply snapped back:
“That has been another false narrative that has been put out there in the media that I absolutely want to throw back at you and say that is absolutely false, and don’t you dare say that again,” she said.

Article Summary

A new study shows there are barriers to upward mobility in Illinois, especially for women and people of color.
People who grow up in lower-income families tend to earn less as adults than those from wealthier families, even after earning similar degrees and going to work in similar fields.
Educational attainment and career choices are still the biggest factors that influence future earnings.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.



For generations, America has been thought of as the land of opportunity, a place where anyone who worked and studied hard could grow up to achieve any goal they set for themselves.

That idea has had especially strong roots in Illinois, the “Land of Lincoln,” where a young man born in a log cabin on America’s frontier rose from rail-splitter to self-taught lawyer and president of the United States.

But a new study suggests that the American dream is still more elusive for some people in Illinois than for others, and that the pathway up the economic ladder is not easily scaled.

The study, entitled “Precarious Prospects,” tracked a cohort of millennials from Illinois – more than 340,000 students from the senior classes of 2008-2012 – from graduation, through their post-secondary careers and into young adulthood.

The study was a joint project conducted by the Illinois Workforce and Education Research Collaborative, or IWERC, the Discovery Partners Institute, the University of Illinois, and the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research.

It found that educational attainment is still a strong predicter of a person’s future earnings as an adult. So too is the industry that a person chooses for a career.

Other factors can also influence a person’s ability to complete a higher education degree, including their race, ethnicity and gender.

Class-based barriers

The study also found that a person’s own economic background – whether they grew up rich or poor – also strongly influences their future earnings. Students who grew up in higher-income households tended to earn more than those who grew up in lower-income families, in part because students from higher-income families were more likely to complete a college degree than lower-income students.

But perhaps most surprisingly, the study found that even among those who earn similar degrees and go to work in similar industries, a student’s own economic background influenced their future earnings. That is, students from lower-income families tend to earn less than those from wealthier families, even after they went on to earn similar credentials.

Further, the study found, among students from lower-income families, Black and Latino students and women tended to earn less than their white and male counterparts.

“The racial and gender disparities obviously are real, and there's a lot of research showing that, but I don't think it's all that's going on,” Sarah Cashdollar, associate director of IWERC and a lead author of the report, said in a podcast interview with Capitol News Illinois.





“One thing is that the same degree, such as a bachelor's degree, can have a very different payoff depending on the college that the student went to,” she said. “And there's research that's found students from higher income families are more likely to go to colleges that have things like many internship opportunities or other work-based learning. More advising, more networking opportunities. And for some fields, those things are essential to landing a good job.”

“There's also research showing that higher income students have greater access to social networks in general that can provide those connections,” she said.

Education and career choice

Among all the factors the study examined, educational attainment had by far the largest impact on a person’s future earnings. It found there was a gap of nearly $40,000 a year in earnings for someone with an advanced degree compared to someone with only a high school diploma.

The study also found that regardless of what type of degree or credential a person earns, the industry in which they work has a big impact on their future earnings.

“For certificates and associate’s degrees, we see higher earnings for construction, for mechanic and repair technologies,” Cashdollar said. “So these are things like auto mechanics, HVAC techs, electricians, and also precision production. … These are all areas that tend to have unions, and they also have been experiencing higher demand due to lower supply in recent years, and so there's some upward wage pressure in those in those occupations.”

“And then for the bachelor's, there are many, many industries that offer higher earnings,” she said. “Two of the highest earnings were engineering and computer and information sciences.”

But the gaps between people with similar degrees from different economic backgrounds was still significant – $3,753 annually for those with less than a bachelor’s degree, and $5,028 for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher.

Still to come

The Precarious Prospects study was the first of a two-part research project made possible through a data sharing partnership between the Illinois Department of Employment Security, the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, the Illinois State Board of Education and Illinois State University.

Cashdollar said the second phase of the project, due to be published later this year, will focus on those students who manage to succeed in climbing the economic ladder, despite the barriers they face.

“To give a preview, we found that there were pathways at all levels of education toward higher earning careers, but they were predominantly concentrated in bachelor's degree pathways and even higher masters and doctoral and professional (programs).”

,DC,2025-07-18 20:02:17+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Some frozen federal funds for schools released to states by Trump administration,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/some-frozen-federal-funds-schools-released-states-trump-administration,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Friday that it’s releasing funds that support before- and after-school programs as well as summer programs, a portion of the $6.8 billion in withheld funds for K-12 schools that were supposed to be sent out two weeks ago.The administration has faced bipartisan backlash over its decision to freeze billions of dollars that also go toward migrant education, English-language learning, adult education and literacy programs, among other initiatives. Those other funds apparently remained stalled on Friday, and Democrats, a key Republican appropriator and school leaders called for them to be released as well.The funds that will be released total $1.3 billion, according to Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and are intended for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative.The Education Department says the program “supports the creation of community learning centers that provide academic enrichment opportunities during non-school hours for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low-performing schools.”A senior administration official said the programmatic review for 21st Century Community Learning Centers has concluded and funds “will be released to the states.”“Guardrails have been put in place to ensure these funds are not used in violation of Executive Orders,” the official added. Pressure from GOP senatorsThe announcement came after 10 Republican senators sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought on July 16 urging him to release the $6.8 billion in funds to states.West Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who led the letter, said in a statement Friday that “21st Century Community Learning Centers offer important services that many West Virginians rely on.”“This program supports states in providing quality after-school and summer learning programs for students while enabling their parents to work and contribute to local economies,” said Capito, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who leads the broader Senate Appropriations panel, also signed the July 16 letter, along with: Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Boozman of Arkansas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Jim Justice of West Virginia.While Collins said in a Friday statement she is glad she and her colleagues were able to work together to “effectively urge the Administration to get these funds released,” she noted that “there is more funding that still needs to be disbursed.”“I will continue to work to ensure it is delivered swiftly so educators can prepare for the upcoming academic year with certainty and Maine students and families have the resources they need to succeed,” she said.July 1 notificationThe Education Department notified states of the freeze just a day before July 1, when these funds are typically sent out as educators plan for the school year, saying the funds were under review.A slew of congressional Democrats and one independent pushed back on the funding freeze.Thirty-two senators and 150 House Democrats urged Vought and Education Secretary Linda McMahon in two letters dated July 10 to immediately release the funds they say are being withheld “illegally.”A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia also sued the administration over the withheld funds.The rest of the school moneySen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate spending panel, called on the Trump administration to release the rest of the frozen funds.“After we spoke up — and after weeks of needless chaos — the Trump administration is now releasing funding for after school programs while continuing to block billions more in funding for our students, teachers, and schools,” Murray said in a statement Friday.“Every penny of this funding must flow immediately,” she said. “Whether or not parents know the afterschool program they depend on will exist should not depend on whether Republicans will push back against Trump’s lawlessness — he should simply get the funding out, just as the law requires him to do. I am going to keep pushing until every dollar goes.”David Schuler, executive director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association, expressed similar concerns in a statement Friday.“While we’re pleased to see crucial dollars going to afterschool programs which are vital for students across the nation, the bottom line is this: Districts should not be in this impossible position where the Administration is denying funds that had already been appropriated to our public schools, by Congress,” said Schuler, whose organization helps to ensure every child has access to a high quality public education.“The remaining funds must be released immediately — America’s children are counting on it.”",,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

In a news release, Democrats Charlie Cavell and Kristen Nelson said they were withdrawing from participation in the majority caucus, and called it a significant step for realigning the board’s focus on ethical leadership, transparency and public accountability.
A spokesperson for Oakland County deferred comment to the board and its chair, David Woodward.
Woodward did not respond to a message seeking comment on Friday.
The board has 19 seats representing the county and 12 of those seats are occupied by Democrats. Cavell was first elected to the board in 2020, while Nelson has served since 2018. Both said they do not plan to leave the Democratic Party, as their values have not changed.
In a statement, Nelson said she and Cavell could no longer remain part of the caucus structure, one that “resists reform and enables centralized control at the expense of good governance.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The public expects honesty and accountability from its elected officials, not political maneuvering behind closed doors,” Nelson said.
The release noted that there has been a months-long internal effort to strengthen ethics oversight, increase transparency in decision-making and to expand inclusion within the board’s leadership process.
“This is about standing up for democratic principles and creating a government residents can trust,” Cavell said in a statement. “We’re choosing to act on our values – and to build a healthier, more accountable government from the ground up.”
The pair elaborated that there has been growing public concern about the concentration of decision-making power with the board and a perceived lack of openness in the handling of public funds and appointments. The board recently spent as much as $300 million on two new buildings while cuts to appropriations for basic needs were on the horizon, and Cavell and Nelson said there were increases of 100% or higher, in some cases, to assessing contracts with local cities and townships.
Additionally, there was a recent scandal that involved a three-year, $450,000 technology staffing contract, which was canceled after it was revealed that the company was owned by a current Oakland County employee – raising conflict of interest concerns – The Oakland Press reported this week.
Both Cavell and Nelson said it was their intention to collaborate more with like-minded colleagues on both sides of the aisle and to continue serving on committee assignments.
“This is not a break from our values. It is a return to them,” Nelson said. “Oakland County residents deserve a commission that works for them, not for itself. In the weeks ahead, we’ll be increasing the pressure on County leaders to advance blocked ethics, financial disclosure and transparency policies introduced months ago.”
Their decision to leave also comes on the heels of Coulter putting forth the county’s 2026 fiscal year budget, which proposes $1.08 billion for the county. It was less than what county officials had initially estimated and was in line with the county’s current budget, which was around $1.08 billion, The Detroit News reported.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/oakland_county_commissioners_auditiorium_via_oakland_county-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over $7.5 million in federal grants were not distributed to Oklahoma CareerTech at the beginning of the fiscal year to fund adult education programs, the agency’s director said.
The Trump administration froze the funding amid concerns that it was going toward educating undocumented immigrants, Brent Haken, director of Oklahoma CareerTech, said during a meeting Thursday.
The freeze affects Adult Education and Family Literacy programs offered by 30 providers at 119 sites across Oklahoma. These programs help adults earn their high school diploma equivalency, among other services. CareerTech had previously taken steps to make sure those utilizing the grant money are not undocumented, he said. He hopes the funding will be unfrozen. 
“These programs serve as a lifeline for thousands of Oklahomans who are seeking to improve their education and employment opportunities,” Haken said in a statement Friday. “Without access to these funds, we risk leaving our most vulnerable learners behind and weakening the state’s workforce pipeline. We urge federal officials to act swiftly to release these funds and protect educational opportunities for adult learners across Oklahoma.”
Over 500 teachers, employed outside the agency, would be impacted by a loss of the funding.
While most of the programs have paused operation until funding is worked out, some have continued to serve Oklahomans despite the freeze, according to a statement. 
Oklahoma doesn’t pay for high school equivalency education in any other ways, the director said. Around 300,000 adults in the state don’t have a high school diploma and these programs, paid for by federal grants, are the only way to get them “caught up,” Haken said Thursday. 
Haken said he’s communicated with the state Legislature about the funding issue. 
More “definite answers” about whether funding will be restored should come by Aug. 9, Haken told his board Thursday. 
Oklahoma CareerTech also receives $18.4 million in federal funding through the Carl D. Perkins grant, which is awarded annually to states for career and technical education programs. This funding is not affected by the freeze, according to a statement.

U.S. District Court Chief Judge David G. Estudillo granted a preliminary injunction sought by three Catholic bishops, temporarily blocking enforcement of a controversial element in a new state law set to take effect July 27. 
Estudillo ruled that requiring disclosure of information priests hear in the confessional infringes on their First Amendment right to practice religion and will force them to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
The decision means clergy will be added to the state’s roster of professions that must report to law enforcement when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.”
But the state cannot require Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima and Bishop Thomas Daly of Spokane — the three who filed the suit — or any Catholic priest in Washington under their direction to disclose such information they hear in confession.
“There is no question that SB 5375 burdens Plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion,” Estudillo wrote in a 25-page ruling issued four days after a court hearing in Tacoma.
The legislation “places them in the position of either complying with the requirements of their faith or violating the law. The consequences for violating the law are serious and, as Plaintiffs assert, the implications of violating the Sacramental Seal are more serious still,” he wrote.
Attorney General Nick Brown’s office emphasized that the ruling only applies to “the Sacrament of Confession” and that, if clergy learn about abuse in any other setting, the injunction does not change that they will be mandated reporters. Brown did not provide any further comment.
The ruling drew praise from Catholic Church leaders and attorneys who brought the suit.
“By protecting the seal of confession, the court has also safeguarded the basic principle that people of all faiths should be free to practice their beliefs without government interference,” Mark Rienzi, president and CEO of Becket, one of the legal teams, said in a statement.
Jean Hill, executive director of the Washington State Catholic Conference, said Catholic faithful have sought reconciliation with God through the sacrament of confession for centuries.
“This ruling protects that sacred space and ensures that Washingtonians of all religious stripes can live out their beliefs in peace,” she said in a statement.
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson signed the legislation in early May. Ferguson, a Catholic, has said requiring disclosures about information learned in confession did not give him pause and he was disappointed his church was suing “to protect individuals who abuse kids.”
The law adds clergy to a list that includes school personnel, nurses, social service counselors, psychologists, and many others, who must report suspected abuse or neglect.
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
Violations of the law carry potential penalties of up to 364 days in jail, a $5,000 fine, and civil liability.
The three bishops filed their lawsuit May 29, naming Ferguson, Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties as defendants.
Prosecutors for the counties did not take sides in this dispute. Collectively, they agreed to accept a preliminary injunction as long as the plaintiffs did not seek attorney fees from them.
This basically put the counties on the sidelines, said Geoff Enns, a Snohomish County deputy prosecuting attorney.
State attorneys have argued the law can survive a First Amendment challenge because it was tailored to serve the compelling government interest of prosecuting perpetrators of child abuse.
But in his ruling, Estudillo said the state “arguably could have chosen a less restrictive means of advancing its interest” by adding members of the clergy to the list of mandated reporters and providing a narrow exception for the confessional, as other states do.
Attorneys for the bishops have argued the law treats Catholic priests, and the religious activity of confession, differently than other professions that involve confidential conversations. They pointed to House Bill 1171, which also takes effect July 27. 
That law exempts attorneys employed by public or private higher education institutions, and employees under their supervision, from their mandatory reporting obligations if the information obtained is related to the representation of a client.
Estudillo agreed, ruling this undermined the state’s argument that it was not singling out the church practice.
“The government interest at issue in both statutes — protecting children from abuse and neglect — is the same. Nevertheless, one law eliminates the privilege for clergy while the other expands the privileges available to secular professionals,” he wrote.
“Ultimately, Washington’s failure to demonstrate why it has an interest of the highest order in denying an exemption to clergy while making such exemptions available to other professionals who work with underserved children … is likely fatal” to the law, the judge added.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice sought to join the legal fight as an intervening party on the side of the bishops. Estudillo granted the request. The Trump Administration also filed a separate request for a preliminary injunction. It is slated for a hearing next week.
Meanwhile, a similar legal battle is unfolding in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Washington. The Orthodox Church of America, along with other churches and individual priests, has sued state officials and county prosecutors, contending the law violates the First Amendment right to practice one’s religion.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)WEST COLUMBIA — The state education department will take over the finances of a rural Pee Dee school district, pausing a plan to consolidate schools to make up a hole in the budget, the state Board of Education decided Friday.
The decision comes a week after the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division launched an investigation into another district under state financial control following an inspector general investigation that found evidence of potential fraud and criminal activity.
The state board’s unanimous decision to take control of Marlboro County School District’s finances Friday means any decisions on contracts, hiring and other financial transactions must first go through state Department of Education staff. A team of financial and operational managers will help the district come up with a plan to address its funding issues, according to the department.
SC seeks control of Pee Dee school district’s finances

“My hope is that no district in the state of South Carolina does not have the finances, the leadership and the expertise to move forward so that we can better educate the students of South Carolina,” said Rita Allison, chair of the state board. “At the end of the day, that’s what it’s all about are those students and how they’re being served in their academics.”
The 3,200-student district has been under fiscal watch, the lowest of three escalating tiers of concern, since 2022, state attorney Henry Gunter told the state board Friday. The state escalated its status to fiscal emergency in February over concerns with its most recent financial audit.
Superintendent Ellen Weaver recommended taking full control of the district’s finances in a letter to the board last week. Her suggestion came soon after the district’s school board passed a budget that would deplete its financial reserves and consolidate schools in an effort to fill a nearly $7 million deficit.
Whether consolidating schools would actually save the district money in the long run was unclear from the district’s budget, which the board adopted more than a week after the state-imposed deadline of July 1. The logistics of trying to consolidate schools in the weeks before the school year starts would also pose a problem, she said.
“It is simply untenable to consolidate schools in the short window of time that they were seeking to do it, and that is not fair to the communities, to the teachers and to the students of those schools,” Weaver said.
The state has already sent experts in finances and school district operations to help sort out the district’s financial problems, Weaver said. With the board’s approval Friday, the experts will take a closer look at how the district can address its financial woes and make suggestions for the local school board to adopt, she said.
Until then, the existing budget will remain in place, aside from the school consolidation plan, which the state has told the district to put on pause, Weaver said.
If the local school board doesn’t agree to follow the state’s suggestions, the state board can take further action, including removing the local board if necessary, Weaver said. District Superintendent Helena Tillar and board chair Michael Coachman said in a joint statement Friday they welcomed the state’s help.
“Together — as the School Board, administrative team, employees, families, and community partners — we share one vision, one mission, and one goal: to deliver a high quality education to every child, every day in Marlboro County,” the statement read.
The priority for the time being will be to get schools open July 28, the district’s scheduled back to school date, with as little impact on students and teachers as possible, Weaver said.
After that, staff from the state education department will focus on finding ways to cover the funding shortfall in the district. One possible way of doing so could be reexamining the ratio of staff to students, especially at a district level, Weaver said.
Since the 2021-2022 school year, the number of students in the district has decreased by 10%, while the number of teachers rose 22% and staff members increased 37%, according to a letter from state officials to the district.
Weaver also requested the inspector general investigate claims of mismanaged purchasing cards, without providing more details on her concerns. That request is still pending, according to the department.
Jasper County investigation
A similar request to investigate Jasper County School District turned up potential fraud and criminal activity, according to a report released by the inspector general’s office last week.
The state Board of Education agreed to take financial control of the 2,600-student district in December, after years of missed deadlines for audits and reports of misspending. By that point, the inspector general’s office was already looking into claims of mismanagement following a request from Weaver in August of last year, according to the report.
Inspector General Brian Lamkin found that, along with failing to file completed audits, the district’s “financial records were in disarray, lacking a fully functional financial department with experienced staff,” according to the report.
The district failed to follow its own procurement policies when hiring vendors, and some employees received “questionable payments” in the forms of bonuses and payments for dual roles, according to the report. Lamkin recommended the state education department use its financial control to take a closer look at those issues.
Also in question was the relationship between former Superintendent Rechel Anderson and the district’s accreditation agency, Cognia. While working as the district’s superintendent from 2018 until February of this year, Anderson also received payments and filled out employee tax forms for Cognia, which would constitute a conflict of interest, according to the report.
Over the course of those seven years, Anderson received about $48,000 from the accreditation agency, which she failed to report on her state-required financial statements, according to the investigation.
At one point, Anderson used her role with Cognia to file a complaint against her own board, launching an investigation through the accreditation agency that cost the district nearly $4,600 in legal fees, the report found.
Anderson’s employment with Cognia was one of several outside jobs she pursued while superintendent, violating a clause in her contract that said she could have another job only if it didn’t interfere with her work running the school district, according to the report.
SC takes control of rural school district’s finances

During her time as superintendent, for which she was hired at $145,000 per year, Anderson started two separate businesses that claimed to operate group homes for children, opened a Caribbean cafe and wrote a book, according to the report. Anderson was rarely in her office or on district property during work hours, and she sometimes used district time and resources on her other business ventures, staff and board members told investigators.
“Writing a book, starting a restaurant (not in Jasper County), multiple for-profit ‘boys homes’ (not in Jasper County), as well as substantial outside employment/contracting as a paid agent for Cognia, diluted the attention and availability of Dr. Anderson to adequately perform the duties required by her employment contract,” Lamkin wrote.
The investigation also raised questions as to whether Anderson improperly took out loans to start one of her group homes and submitted fraudulent certifications to found another, according to the report. And it pointed to evidence that Anderson didn’t live in the school district, which her contract required, and claims that she forged a lease when asked to prove her residency in the county.
All the while, the school board failed to supervise Anderson or fire her despite knowing she violated parts of her contract, according to the report. The district conducted its own investigation into Anderson in 2024 but never followed up with SLED, despite finding evidence of potential criminal violations, the report found.
The board voted in October 2024, to fire Anderson but failed to finish the termination process, only officially breaking ties with her after reaching a settlement agreement in February, according to the report.
After reviewing the report, SLED launched an investigation into Anderson and the district on Thursday, spokeswoman Renée Wunderlich said.
The district did not respond to a request for comment Friday. Anderson, when reached by phone, hung up on a reporter, then did not respond to a follow-up email requesting comment.
Jasper County School District remains under financial control from the state. State officials are reviewing the inspector general’s findings and watching the district closely, Allison said.
“I am sure, at the end of the day, the state Department of Education, with the OK of the state board, will do all that they can to make sure that Jasper continues to move well,” Allison said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3269-copy-scaled-e1752864476652-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Silence can speak louder than words.
Just ask Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore, who as of Friday afternoon had yet to respond to a U.S. Department of Justice request for information about registered voters. Rhode Island is among a growing number of mostly Democratic states facing federal probes into voter rolls, ranging from basic lists of registrants to massive documentation requests including ballots cast and voting equipment used in the 2024 election.
The July 8 email Amore’s office received from Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, is far less expansive and detailed than requests made to other states. Laragy asked Amore for a phone meeting to discuss a “potential information-sharing agreement,” that would give the DOJ information on state registered voters who lack eligibility, have falsified documents or “may otherwise have engaged in unlawful conduct relevant to the election process.” 
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

Eight days later, Amore had not responded to Laragy — Amore’s office was still reviewing the request, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for Amore, confirmed in an email. Chybowski was unsure when, or if, Amore plans to answer the DOJ.
But the Democrat and former high school history teacher is not keeping mum on his feelings about the probe.
“This is a highly unusual request as the States are Constitutionally empowered to manage all aspects of elections that are not otherwise mandated by federal law,” Amore said in an emailed statement. “It appears this is a continued attempt to promote the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen and to undermine confidence in our elections—pretty consistent playbook from the Trump people.”
John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, backed Amore’s approach.
“It’s right for Secretary Amore to be both cautious and skeptical of the request given the history of this administration’s propagation of lies about voter fraud,” Marion said in an interview.
Trump has continued to promote claims that the 2020 election in which he lost to Joe Biden was rigged. Since returning to office, he has turned the magnifying glass back on state and local election administrators. In March, Trump issued an executive order directing U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to scour states in search of election-related crimes, authorizing her to cut off federal funding to states that refused to cooperate.
Voter rolls already public 
State voter records in Rhode Island are public — available upon request to anybody who fills out an online form and pays a $25 fee. But the information the DOJ has asked for in other states includes sensitive personal data like Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, which are protected under federal and state law, and typically redacted in fulfilling public records requests. 
Laragy’s email to Amore did not indicate what information he wanted regarding Rhode Island voters. However, the information-sharing agreements referred to in both the email and Trump’s executive order single out voters who are registered, or have voted, despite being ineligible; those who have committed election fraud; and those who have intimidated or threatened voters or election officials, among other targeted groups.
This information is likely also public record, as anyone who threatens elections officials, falsifies information on registration forms or commits election fraud would be charged with a crime, Marion said.
In 2017, Rhode Island was asked to supply Trump’s Election Integrity Commission with personal information from its voter rolls, including the last four digits of Social Security numbers for voters dating back to 2006. Then-Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and Gov. Gina Raimondo refused to comply with handing over any sensitive information not normally included in a standard public records request, according to news reports.
While the 2017 probe was sent to all 50 states, the latest set of requests center on Democratic and swing states, with at least nine states receiving formal written requests for information, according to Stateline.
Responses have been varied. In Colorado, which faces the most sweeping set of data requests, the Secretary of State’s office provided the DOJ with the same master voter file and voting history available to other members of the public. Wisconsin’s Secretary of State referred federal attorneys to the information on how to request public voter data, while Republicans in Indiana and Alabama inked deals with the Trump administration authorizing access to citizenship information for state voters. 
Laragy said in his email to Amore that the information would be used to “protect the integrity of federal elections.” But Marion countered not that none of the information being sought would improve elections integrity.
“Instead, it could very well put information at risk,” Marion said, noting that Trump’s executive order also requires sensitive, personal voter data be shared with the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency.
State level protections needed 
Marion says the Trump administration has already proven its disregard for voting protections, including crucial provisions codified under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which aims to prevent race-based discrimination in voting access and provide access to voters with limited English proficiency. As the U.S. Supreme Court considers arguments in a case that could further degrade the once-powerful voting rights statute, Marion is looking to erect state-level safeguards via passage of a state Voting Rights Act.
“We are going to need state-level protections in the absence of federal protections,” Marion said. “The federal Voting Rights Act isn’t going to be enforced by the DOJ.”
A state statute would ensure that Spanish-speaking voters in Pawtucket can access ballots in their native language — a provision originally required under a May 2024 federal consent agreement following a yearslong investigation that showed the city had failed to provide required accommodations to Spanish-speaking voters. Marion worried that without continued federal oversight, those voters, and others throughout the state, could see their access diminished.
Nine other states, including Connecticut, have enacted similar state-level voting rights protections.
Marion publicly pitched the idea during a public speech at a “Good Trouble” rally in Newport Thursday night, taking Amore, who was also a scheduled speaker at the event, by surprise, Marion said.

The freeze, announced by the Trump administration earlier this month, affects programs like 21st Century Community Learning Centers, a federal program that supports afterschool programs for low-income students in North Carolina.
State education advocates had warned that about 11,000 students and 125 programs across North Carolina were at risk. The freeze on the $35 million grant, part of a broader $165 million allotment in congressionally approved education funds for North Carolina, threatened to eliminate academic enrichment, nutritional support, and safe, supervised environments for children while their parents are at work.
“This outcome was the result of a collective effort from parents, program leaders, youth advocates, and community champions that came together to speak up for what matters. It has shown us how many people across North Carolina and across the country support these important programs, and how important it will be to maintain and expand this funding moving forward into FY 26,” said Elizabeth Anderson, director of the NC Center for Afterschool Programs — a project of the Public School Forum of North Carolina.
Anderson said the organization will wait until the funds are released on Monday to make a full statement.
“After a careful review of the circumstances, the Department has determined that it will release a portion of the impacted grant funds while the litigation proceeds,” the department said in a statement reported by the Associated Press.
The rest of the withheld grants, close to $5 billion, which funds adult literacy and English language instruction, continues to be withheld.
North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, along with 24 other state attorneys general, sued the U.S. Department of Education this week over the withholding of the funds. The money, which was due to be delivered by July 1, was suddenly paused on the evening of June 30 with little explanation.
“In communities all across this country, people are tremendously relieved that the Trump Administration will release the FY25 after-school and summer learning program funds it had withheld,” said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance in a released statement. “Working parents in particular are breathing an enormous sigh of relief.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2533-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-18 17:02:01.836250

(Photo by Anna Paige/Fargo Forum pool photo)The prosecution and defense put the fate of Minnesota state Sen. Nicole Mitchell in the hands of a jury Friday, as both sides gave closing arguments on felony burglary charges that could hold political consequences as well as criminal.
Throughout the five-day trial, the state asserted that Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, was intent on stealing her late father’s possessions from her stepmother when she broke into her home in April 2024. Prosecutors’ main evidence was that she told police officers as much during her arrest.
But the senator would later say on the witness stand that she drove the 220 miles from her home in Woodbury to her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home to conduct a welfare check. Mitchell testified in her own defense Thursday, saying she has witnessed her stepmother’s mental decline because of Alzheimer’s disease and that she wasn’t receiving the attention and care she needed.
Mitchell said she lied to police about her intentions — and made up wanting to steal her father’s possessions — to allay her stepmother’s paranoia.
“The defense has repeatedly classified this as a welfare check. You’ve seen all the evidence, the time of night, the outfit, the tools. What does your reason and common sense tell you?” Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald asked the jury in his closing statement.
Mitchell’s explanation of lying to police to refrain from exacerbating Carol’s paranoia defies common sense, McDonald said.
Mitchell has been charged with first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools.
Mitchell’s defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reason she was in the home was to steal.
“The state needs you to believe that Nicole Mitchell would throw away everything. That she would throw away her career, that she would throw away her family, that she would throw away her ability to be a foster parent,” Bruce Ringstrom Jr., Mitchell’s attorney, said in his closing argument. “Unless the state’s evidence can rule out that Nicole Mitchell entered just to check on Carol, then the verdict must be not guilty.”
Mitchell has admitted she entered the home without permission and her defense has said she would have pleaded guilty to a trespassing charge. But she has unequivocally denied stealing anything from the home, and multiple police officers testified that they didn’t find anything in Mitchell’s possession that was stolen property.
Under Minnesota law, a person doesn’t need to steal anything to be convicted of burglary. The law requires that a person enter a dwelling without permission with the intent to commit a crime of theft. The intent aspect of the law is the key issue in this case.
McDonald argued that Nicole Mitchell would have stolen her father’s flannel shirt and other possessions but she was accosted by police.
“Of course she didn’t have anything on her. She got interrupted,” McDonald told the jury.
When Mitchell was first arrested last year, police alleged that Nicole Mitchell was in the Detroit Lakes home to steal her father’s ashes, flannel shirt and other mementos. Testimony this week revealed that the ashes of Nicole Mitchell’s father were already interred and Carol had already mailed Nicole Mitchell some of the ashes prior to the break-in.
Throughout the trial, numerous police officers, investigators, family members and friends testified about Mitchell’s arrest and what they observed in her relationship with her stepmother, Carol Mitchell, which they say declined after Mitchell’s father died in 2023.
The police made several mistakes in the investigation, including failing to maintain several pieces of evidence.
Republicans in the thinly divided Senate have attempted to oust Nicole Mitchell multiple times because of the felony charge alone, but Democrats stopped them. Democrats hold a one-seat majority, 34-33, in the Minnesota Senate.
If Mitchell is convicted, her fellow Democrats may be less inclined to vote in her favor and she could be expelled. It’s unclear when that would happen, however, as Gov. Tim Walz would need to call a special session to do so. The Legislature will begin its 2026 session in February.

(LAI photo)A veteran state employee has been tapped as the next leader of Louisiana’s child welfare agency, replacing the former juvenile judge who’s held the role for the past 18 months.
Gov. Jeff Landry announced Friday that Rebecca Harris, who was named deputy secretary of Department of Children and Family Services last month, will take over from David Matlock, effective Aug. 1. Moving forward, Matlock will hold the title of confidential assistant to the DCFS secretary, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
Harris began her career with DCFS more than 20 years ago as a social services analyst, according to the governor’s office. She also worked with the Louisiana Department of Health for eight years before returning to DCFS in February 2024, according to her LinkedIn work history.
“Rebecca has consistently demonstrated the kind of steady, thoughtful leadership Louisiana families need,” the governor said in a statement. “Her experience in operational improvement and her commitment to protecting our most vulnerable children make her the right choice to lead DCFS. I have full confidence she will strengthen this department and deliver positive outcomes for our most vulnerable citizens.”
Landry credited Harris with leading the development of the state’s summer food assistance program at DCFS. Originally a COVID-19 pandemic program, the Biden administration moved to make the additional resources available permanently to help qualifying families feed their children through the months when school meals aren’t available. 
Although Landry and Matlock initially declined to take part in the summer EBT program, bipartisan pressure from state lawmakers led the administration to change its stance.   
The governor also praised Harris for critical upgrades to the state’s child welfare hotline and creating real-time dashboards to support child welfare decision-making.
“I am honored and excited to serve as Secretary during this great time of opportunity and transformation, focusing on strategic commitments to improve outcomes for those we serve. I’m proud to lead this team of dedicated and courageous professionals who show up every day for Louisiana’s children and families,” Harris said in a statement.
The governor’s office did not explain why Matlock was being replaced or immediately respond to questions about his compensation levels as a confidential assistant.
“It was an honor to serve as Secretary of DCFS, and I’m proud of the progress we’ve made together for Louisiana’s children and families,” Matlock said in a statement. “This next chapter is deeply personal to me. Advocacy and foster care have always been my passion, and I’d like to thank Governor Landry for allowing me to pursue this. I look forward to focusing my energy on building strong, supportive environments for the children who need us most.”

Soon-to-be Senate President Matt Regier looks on. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)While Congress was debating the “big, beautiful budget bill,” Montana Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, was sending texts to the state’s delegation about out-of-control spending.
Among the most controversial aspects of the federal bill was a budget-busting provision that would add trillions of dollars in debt to pay for tax breaks mostly aimed at the wealthy, something Montana’s senior Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican, said was essential in order to garner his support.
“Congress just has no ability to rein itself in,” McGillvray said. “So, it falls to the states to do it.”
McGillvray was once a state lawmaker who helped to clear Montana’s legislative decks of any proposal to hold a convention of the states or constitutional convention on any particular subject. Now, he believes a convention of the states, something mentioned in Article V of the U.S. Constitution, may be the only hope to righting the federal government.
It’s an idea he’s supported for the past couple of legislative sessions, but one that has not gained enough traction in Helena, with skeptics on both sides of the political spectrum. Part of that hesitancy stems from the convention of states itself: Of the 27 amendments to the U.S. Constitution, all of them have been passed by the same process: Congress proposing new amendments and states voting to ratify them.
Using the “convention of the states” model, which the founders of the republic had seen as a failsafe against Congressional dysfunction or tyranny, if two-thirds of the states apply for a convention — so far 19 have passed legislation to do so — then Congress would be obligated to convene the convention, but proposing new amendments would fall to delegates from the states. From there, though, opinions vary widely on what could happen next because the clause in the Constitution has not been tried.
The Constitution itself says that any proposed amendments could be passed if ratified by three-quarters of the states — or 38. Another interpretation of the article also suggests that three-quarters of the delegates at the convention of the states could ratify the amendments, leading to concerns of what is commonly called a “runaway” convention in which an unlimited number of amendments could be pushed through by a small number of state delegates.
But in Montana, and in many other states, the idea continues to bubble up occasionally and find supporters. It gains traction as frustrations with Congress seep down to the state level, often with lawmakers like McGillvray being tasked to clean up the confusion and unfunded mandates created by directives and legislation from D.C.
“Congress is out of control,” McGillvray said. “The (Department of Governmental Efficiency) is a perfect example. DOGE is doing the job of Congress, including finding waste, abuse and fraud and getting rid of it.”
He believes the political differences that separate Democrats and Republicans on most issues pale in comparison to an increasingly money hungry federal government which threatens the country’s stability.
“No matter which party is in control, Democrats or Republicans, no matter who is in control of Congress or the presidency, the entitlements continue to advance and they’re consuming the entire state,” McGillvray said.
He worries about a day when America’s economy craters under the weight of its debt.
“It’s the only solution to force fiscal constraints. Congress won’t do it. It’s too far gone with big money,” McGillvray said. “But states have been given an option and solution when Congress either cannot or will not.”
McGillvray, who spent his entire career in the finance sector, said that there are several options available to the states, including a balanced-budget amendment, something which is used by 49 states. He reasons that the federal government should have to live by some of the same financial rules as the states. Or, because balanced budgets can rob governments of the flexibility of needing to spend more heavily at certain times, McGillvray suggests a European style of “circuit breaker” for debt that forces budgets into a spending-taxing balance based upon a several-year period.
  2025 session 

In 2023, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum visited the Capitol to advocate for a balanced-budget and a convention of the states. This year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a one-time presidential hopeful, paired up with Montana Greg Gianforte to urge the Legislature to pass a resolution calling for a convention of states for the purpose of adding a balanced-budget amendment. Gianforte is no stranger to the concept, proposing as his first piece of legislation when he served in the U.S. House a bill that would have not paid members of Congress unless a balanced budget was passed. That idea was panned by Republicans and Democrats.
During a tour of states, which also included a similar pitch in Idaho, DeSantis urged support of some type of constitutional fix to Congress’ spending problem.

“People have gravitated to Montana. They have fled states that have performed poorly as a matter of policy, and they’ve gravitated to states like Florida and Montana, and I expect that to continue into the future,” said DeSantis. “… But ultimately the states are not going to be successful if federal spending and the Congress does not get under control.”
As in other sessions, though, efforts for both a convention of the states or a balanced-budget amendment through the more traditional constitutional amendment process fell short of much meaningful action.
In 2025, SJ4, a resolution considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, narrowly passed 5-to-4,  but stalled on the floor of the Senate and was not voted upon before its deadline had expired. That resolution called for a convention of the states with the “sole purpose” to pass a balanced-budget amendment.
Later in the session, the Legislature supported SJ 9, a weaker statement which did not call for a convention, but rather urged Congress to pass a balanced-budget amendment, but didn’t call for any specific convention. It expressed alarm at the growing national debt and was sponsored by McGillvray.
  A ‘runaway’ convention 

Because a convention, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution, has never been tried, many scholars and some politicians worry about what has often been referred to as a “runaway” convention. The concern is that since there are so few rules about the convention, and no precedent, it could wind up making huge changes, upending the Constitutional republic. One of the concerns, for example, is that a convention may propose eliminating the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. Another concern, unrelated, is that there could be a movement to repeal the 17th amendment which allows for direct election of U.S. Senators, which opponents fear would be handed back to the Legislatures of each state respectively.
That particular concern is well-suited to Montana, which was largely responsible for the amendment, after bribery in the Montana Legislature led to the U.S. Senate refusing to seat Copper King and Sen. William Andrews Clark.
Other fears about “a runaway convention” swirl around how the amendments could be proposed: Would delegates be required to vote a certain way on certain amendments? Some states have laws that require a delegates to vote in accordance with their Legislatures; other states do not. And what happens if the convention proposes a topic that wasn’t planned? For example, what happens if states convene to discuss U.S. Senator elections and then drifts into abortion?
David Super, a Georgetown Law Professor, who recently spoke to journalists about this, noted that there are few guardrails specified by the sparse wording of the Constitution.
“Once a convention is called there’s nothing that really limits them,” Super said.
Anthony Gutierrez, the Executive Director of Common Cause in Texas, said that the idea of a convention gained traction, but has recently fallen out of favor with some conservatives in Texas, including the John Birch Society, which has historically opposed the idea.
“That conservative grassroots organizations are against this is a big deal,” he said.
Meanwhile, Jenny Guzman, Common Cause Program Director in Arizona, gave a recent example. Many in the Grand Canyon State want Congressional term limits. However, the idea for a convention of states has faced a cool public reception for one reason, she said.
“Once it’s called, there’s no guarantee that’s what they do, and then what happens when we pass other things and there are no term limits?” she asked.
However, McGillvray said that he believes the fears about a runaway convention are being made by people who support, and in some cases, even profit off the status quo. He said after researching the subject for years that the U.S. Constitution’s threshold for approval of amendments, requiring in this case three-quarters of the state, is an exceedingly high bar to clear. He can’t imagine controversial topics like repealing gun rights or even abortion garnering the support of that many states.
“You would never say it’s impossible,” McGillvray said. “But I’d say it would be next to impossible.”
He said that’s borne out by the various applications for constitutional amendments and convention of the states. Some states have passed resolutions to repeal the Roe vs. Wade decision, but that number has languished in the 20-states range for years. Even the balanced budget proposals are still short by a handful of states. And McGillvray points out that some states have even codified into law that their delegates couldn’t go beyond the scope of their application — even though it’s unclear if such a law would conflict with the Constitution itself.
For now, McGillvray remains a staunch support of such an idea because, as he sees it, there’s just no way that Congress will control itself, which has led him to support the idea of a balanced-budget tool and term limits that are more generous than previously, but would end the near-lifetime appointments, especially in the U.S. Senate.
“Until you control the money, you can’t control the power. You have to ask yourself why would anyone spend more than $200 million on a U.S. Senate seat in Montana? It’s about the power and the money,” McGillvray said.
Even in Montana, McGillvray admits calling a convention gets some press coverage, but often dies with other ideas at the Legislature. But, he’s noticed a warming on both side of the political aisle as things like finance, education and personal freedom become more threatened.
He said that many of his fellow lawmakers have experienced “political whiplash” where the executive branch rules by executive order, Congress is mired in gridlock, and businesses struggle with the uncertainty.
“I don’t like being ruled by executive order, I don’t care whether that’s Biden or Trump. It’s like every four years we get whiplash. That’s not good,” he said.
For a man who has spent his life in finance, he says most Americans don’t realize the debt level and what will happen even as the new Trump “big, beautiful bill” added trillions to it. He said a financial collapse is not theoretical, we can look to Europe — Spain, Italy and Greece — for what happens.
“You fear a runaway convention, but you don’t understand the threat that’s facing you,” McGillvray said, pointing to what could happen in the case of a default, meaning that America would not be able to pay its debt. “I don’t know if making this government work is possible. I guess the question is whether there is still honor among legislators.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — The University of Kansas is negotiating contracts for management of Jayhawk sports venues and the Gateway retail district adjacent to renovated Memorial Stadium with a company whose CEO was indicted for allegedly rigging bids to operate a University of Texas arena.
The U.S. Department of Justice says a grand jury returned the indictment against Tim Leiweke, co-founder of Oak View Group. It’s a Denver company that develops and provides services to entertainment venues. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to restrain trade.
Leiweke resigned as Oak View Group’s CEO after announcement of the indictment July 9. He could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $1 million. The Department of Justice said Oak View Group agreed to pay a $15 million penalty.
Abigail Slater, assistant U.S. attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said the case illustrated a commitment to holding accountable “executives who cheat to avoid competition.”
“The defendant rigged a bidding process to benefit his own company and deprived a public university and taxpayers of the benefits of competitive bidding,” Slater said.
 
KU’s ties to Oak View
Joe Monaco, associate vice chancellor for public affairs at KU, said the university hadn’t signed a final contract with Oak View Group but had been working with the company through a series of temporary agreements. In April 2024, KU announced a partnership with Oak View Group that established a framework for negotiating a multiyear deal.
At this point, Monaco said, KU had a short-term agreement with Oak View Group for food and beverage services at sports events. KU had yet to sign a preliminary agreement with Oak View Group to operate Memorial Stadium and the Gateway District, he said.
Monaco said university officials started a review of its procurement process for projects associated with Oak View Group.
“We have been in communication with OVG and expect to meet with the OVG leadership team in the days ahead,” Monaco said. “That said, at this time, there is no indication of any irregularities related to our procurement process that would affect our ongoing negotiations with OVG.”
The Gateway project could include a conference facility, hotel, retail space and entertainment areas to create a year-round economic hub at the renovated football stadium. KU chancellor Doug Girod said the Gateway development would enable KU to host large meetings and events while providing the football program with resources to “compete at the highest level.”
When the initial agreement with Oak View Group was announced by KU, athletics director Travis Goff said he was excited to partner with the “proven and innovative team” at Oak View Group.
“A generational project like this requires best-in-class partnerships, and that is what this relationship reflects,” Goff said.
 
Alleged collusion
The Department of Justice alleged Leiweke orchestrated a conspiracy in 2017 and 2018 to collude with a business rival to land the contract to develop, manage and operate UT’s basketball and entertainment arena in Austin.
Federal prosecutors said Leiweke’s goal was to convince Legends Hospitality not to submit a bid on UT’s Moody Center contract in exchange for Oak View Group steering lucrative subcontracts to Legends. In 2018, the indictment said, Leiweke ultimately reached an agreement in which Legends would stand down and neither submit nor join a competing bid for the UT arena project.
Oak View Group ended up the lone qualified bidder and won the UT contract. Oak View Group and Legends later clashed about implementation of their secret arrangement.
In 2019, court documents show, an executive at Legends sent Oak View Group an email that said Oak View Group was unfairly demanding Legends perform premium seating and concessions services at UT at “well-below-market rates.”
“We expect to get what we bargained for by standing down on pursuing the (UT arena project) based on your representations,” the Legends email to Oak View Group said. “If you subsequently choose to go another route with one of our competitors, then we will have relied on your representations to our detriment.”
While Legends was squeezed out at UT, Oak View Group has continued to receive significant revenue from the university arena that opened in 2022.
The Justice Department entered a “non-prosecution” agreement with Legends in June. The pact says the federal government wouldn’t pursue criminal or civil actions against the company or its employees in exchange for “full cooperation in the investigation.”
Legends consented to pay a $1.5 million penalty for involvement in allegedly illegal acts leading to Leiweke’s indictment, the Justice Department said.
 
‘Did nothing wrong’
Justin Simmons, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, said prosecution of bid-rigging cases was important to making a level playing field for awarding public contracts.
“Unfair business practices, like those employed here, make it very difficult for the American people to pursue prosperity like our founders intended,” Simmons said.
However, Sports Business Journal published a statement issued on Leiweke’s personal behalf that said: “Mr. Leiweke has done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend himself and his well-deserved reputation for fairness and integrity.”
The statement said the Justice Department’s antitrust division was “wrong on the law and the facts, and the case should never have been brought.”
“The law is clear. Vertical, complementary business partnerships, like the one contemplated between OVG and Legends, are legal,” the statement said. “These allegations blatantly ignore established legal precedent and seek to criminalize common teaming efforts that are proven to enhance competition and benefit the public.”
Documents released in conjunction with Leiweke’s indictment indicated Oak View Group’s venue-management arm, OVG360, received $20 million in 2022 and $7.5 million annual payments from Live Nation Entertainment-owned Ticketmaster in exchange for urging its venue clients to sign exclusive ticket contracts with Ticketmaster.
“As a fiduciary to the owners of certain venues it manages, OVG360 was required to disclose material information, including potential conflicts of interest,” the Justice Department document said.
In 2024, the Justice Department and dozens of state and district attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation and Ticketmaster alleging “monopolization and other unlawful conduct that thwarts competition in markets across the live entertainment industry.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KU-Memorial-Stadium-5-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-07-18 15:33:50.828572

(Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s latest nominee for the federal panel that oversees power generation in the U.S. has ties to Louisiana. 
David LaCerte has been submitted for addition to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He’s currently the White House liaison with the U.S. Office for Personnel Management, where he was on the staff for the final year of Trump’s first term in office. 
A Marine Corps veteran, LaCerte was secretary of the state’s Department of Veterans Affairs under former Gov. Bobby Jindal from 2015-16. Afterwards, he practiced law in New Orleans before joining the Trump administration in 2020.
Between Trump’s terms, LaCerte worked with the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for two years, and he practiced energy sector litigation with a Houston law firm from 2023-25, according to his LinkedIn page.
LaCerte is also credited as a contributor to Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation policy treatise that’s become a guidestar for the Trump administration. He is a graduate of Nicholls State and LSU’s law school.  
The addition of LaCerte would swing the five-member FERC to a Republican majority. The commission’s bylaws limit political parties to no more than three members, and LaCerte would take the place of Democrat Willie Phillips, who resigned his FERC post in April at Trump’s request.

Ron DeSantis met on Tuesday, July 1, at the state's new deportation facility in the middle of the Everglades. (Via governor's X feed)Gov. Ron DeSantis this week has been promoting his commitment to Everglades restoration amid the backlash and legal challenges to his construction of an immigrant detention center on an airstrip in the wetland ecosystem.
The governor signed a new agreement with the federal government on Friday, portraying it as Florida taking the lead on Everglades restoration projects, a goal DeSantis has been pursuing for years and has emphasized recently. Earlier this week, he marked a major milestone in the largest environmental restoration project ever: completion of a reservoir designed to prevent toxic algal blooms from polluting rivers in the state.
But his promotion of restoration efforts comes as he continues insisting the tent and trailer facility, meant to hold thousands of immigrants awaiting deportation, won’t harm the Everglades. His administration, the federal government, and Miami-Dade County officials are trying to ward off a legal battle from environmental groups over the speedy construction of the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
State leaders are calling the facility “Alligator Alcatraz,” arguing dangerous reptiles would deter escape attempts.
24/7 detention center operation
“This is an existing airport,” DeSantis said Friday morning, answering questions from reporters about the notorious detention center. “It’s existing concrete. They’re not doing anything outside of that footprint.”
Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity submitted in their plea to a federal court images of newly paved areas and light brightening the night sky from the detention center visible from approximately 15 miles away.
Tania Galloni, one of the attorneys representing Friends of the Everglades in the suit to halt the detention center, called laughable the notion that the 24/7 operation of a detention center in the Big Cypress National Preserve wouldn’t disrupt the habitat.
“He can’t claim to be the Everglades governor on one hand, and then plunk down this mass facility in the heart of the Everglades on the other hand,” she said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
Although DeSantis denied new construction at the site during his press conference, the state has a $37 million contract with LTS Inc. that includes funding for permanent and temporary fencing and roadway construction, according to a copy of the contract obtained by NOTUS before state officials seemingly deleted dozens of contracts from a database.
Kevin Guthrie, head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which is in charge of the detention center, defended “minor paving projects” in response to the lawsuit.
“It is simply implausible that small-scale paving on previously developed land will cause irreparable environmental harm when the paving is next to a nearly two-mile-long paved runway,”  the agency argued in a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

Governor’s quest for power over Everglades restoration
DeSantis’ announcement of a new agreement with the federal government also came after the governor asked President Donald Trump to grant the state authority to finish the 10,100-acre Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir on its own rather than continuing its partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The governor has brought up the matter in press conferences throughout the year, stating that Florida could finish the project at a much quicker pace.
“I would do that. Okay, let me ask myself: Permission granted,” Trump said during a July 1 roundtable at the detention center.
But it appears that DeSantis didn’t get exactly what he asked for.
While he wanted the Army Corps cut out of the process and for the federal government to block grant Florida the funds to complete the project, the new agreement still leaves the feds in charge of the main reservoir. However, Florida will handle the inflow and outflow pump stations and auxiliary features, a change that DeSantis said would speed completion by five years, to 2029.

The ruling comes in a rare lawsuit pitting one elected statewide officeholder against another.

The Vermont Supreme Court issued its ruling earlier this month on a legal dispute between Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffer and Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, with the two sides viewing the decision in different ways.
Hoffer, a Democrat/Progressive, brought a lawsuit against Clark, a Democrat, and her office more than a year ago. 
The dispute centered on a bid by Hoffer to get answers from the Vermont’s Attorney General’s Office to questions that his office posed when conducting an audit related to a tax-increment financing project in Burlington.
The attorney general responded to the questions by referring Hoffer to other entities for answers.

Clark hailed the unanimous high court ruling as victory for the attorney general’s office, while Hoffer saw it another way.
“We are pleased with the decision. This is the outcome we predicted when we were first threatened by a lawsuit from the auditor, so no surprise in that respect,” Clark said Thursday. “The Supreme Court found we had done our job and we won the case.” 
When the lawsuit was filed more than a year ago, Clark called it “ill advised” and “unfortunate.” 
Hoffer on Thursday referred to the ruling in different terms.
“The ruling by the court was a split decision,” he said, highlighting a part of the ruling that affirmed his right to bring the lawsuit. That’s important, Hoffer said, in ensuring that there is a checks and balance system in place. 
“From the very beginning,” Hoffer added, “the attorney general claimed we didn’t even have the authority to sue her.” 
Hoffer argued in the lawsuit that the attorney general’s office did not provide him with legal opinions he had asked for regarding an audit he was conducting related to a Burlington tax increment financing development, also known as a TIF.
The Vermont attorney general’s office, in court filings, contended that they did respond to the auditor’s request by referring him to other entities responsible for implementing TIF law. 
As part of his legal action, the auditor said he wanted the justices to rule that he had a right to bring the lawsuit against the attorney general’s office, In addition, the auditor wanted the Vermont Supreme Court to compel the attorney general’s office to answer specific questions that were posed. 
The high court in its ruling last week decided that Hoffer had the right to bring a lawsuit against the Vermont attorney general’s office, but he lost on the matter of the specific questions.
Justice Nancy Waples, who authored the 30-page opinion, noted in the opening line how rare this type of case was for the high court.
“This appeal calls us to settle an unusual dispute between Vermont’s Auditor of Accounts and Attorney General, two statewide elected officials,” Waples wrote. 
“The Auditor sued the Attorney General, alleging that she has failed to comply with her statutory obligation to provide legal advice,” the justice added. “The Auditor seeks a declaratory judgment that he has the right to retain counsel to sue the Attorney General and that the Attorney General must advise the Auditor on questions of law pursuant to statute.”
And, according to Waples, the auditor was seeking a court order compelling the attorney general to answer two specific questions. 
Washington County Superior Court Judge Timothy Tomasi dismissed the auditor’s claims at the trial court level leading to the appeal before the Vermont Supreme Court. 
Waples, in the high court’s ruling, wrote, “We affirm in part and reverse in part.” 
Vermont Law and Graduate School Professor Peter Teachout, who specializes in constitutional law, said Thursday the high court determined that the attorney general was required to give legal advice. 
“But not required to provide legal answers,” Teachout added. “In this case, in fact, the Attorney General has complied with the statute because with these two questions to which it has not provided definitive answers it has provided the auditor with legal advice, and the advice is see how these other institutions interpret these terms.”
Teachout added that he believed that Clark and Hoffer each had merits in their views of the high court’s decision.
“I think they both are right,” Teachout said. “The attorney general prevails in this specific case because the attorney general is not required to do what the auditor was asking the court to compel the attorney general to do, which is to provide answers to the two questions that it didn’t provide answers to.” 
On the other hand, Teachout said, “the attorney general’s office did not prevail on the question of whether the attorney general can ever be compelled by a court to perform legal duties.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)WAUWATOSA — Continuing Senate Democrats’ effort to flip control of the state Senate next year, Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) announced her campaign late Thursday afternoon for Wisconsin’s 5th Senate District, which is currently represented by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield). 
At the location of the future Moss Universal Park, surrounded by about 50 people, including Democratic lawmakers and community members, Vining focused her remarks on creating a world where everyone can thrive.
“It’s going to take some construction — just like at this park,” Vining said, referring to the playground, which is designed to be accessible to children with disabilities and open to everyone in the community. “If we want a world that works for everyone, we need a government that works for everyone — not the few and the connected, but for everyone. That is the world I want to fight for. That is the world that we all deserve, and when we flip this seat and when we win the majority, we will work hard to create that world. We will move closer to a government that works for everyone.” 
November 2026 will be the first time new, more competitive legislative maps adopted in 2024 will be in effect for the 17 odd-numbered Senate seats up for election. All the seats in the  state Assembly and the governor’s office will also be up for election.
“We’re going to have a trifecta,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) told reporters. “We’re finally going to be able to get things done for the very first time in a very long time. We’re going to be able to fund K-12 education, higher education, child care and all the priorities that we’ve been fighting for for over a decade.”
Whether Democrats achieve “trifecta” control of both houses of the Legislature and the executive branch of state government hinges in part on a Democrat holding the governor’s seat. Gov. Tony Evers has not yet announced whether he’ll seek a third term in office, but the decision could come any day. 
“It’s my understanding that Gov. Evers is going to make up his mind in the next week and a half,” Hesselbein said. “If the governor wants to run again, we’re behind him all the way.” 
“It’s either going to be him or it’s going to be someone from the absolutely fabulous bench that we have, so we’re not worried,” Vining said. 
The path to the Senate majority, Vining and Hesselbein said, runs through Senate District 5. Republican lawmakers currently hold an 18-15 Senate majority, meaning Democrats need to flip two seats and hold all of their current seats to win the majority for the first time in more than 15 years. Two other competitive seats include Senate District 17, where Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) is up for reelection and Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon) announced her candidacy last week, and Senate District 21, where Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) is up for reelection. 
Senate District 5 includes portions of Milwaukee County, encompassing West Allis and Wauwatosa, and Waukesha County, including Pewaukee, Brookfield and Elm Grove. 
According to data from the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, the current 5th Senate District went for former Vice President Kamala Harris by 6 percentage points and Sen. Tammy Baldwin by 5 percentage points. The three Assembly districts that make up the Senate District are split — represented by Vining, Rep. Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis) and Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee).
“We see this as like a 50-51-ish… race where we’re favored ever so slightly,” Vining told reporters. “I mean, that’s the challenge.”
Vining is not the first Democrat in the race. Sarah Harrison, a Brookfield small business owner who ran a failed campaign for the Assembly in 2024, launched her campaign for the seat last month.
The incumbent, Hutton, hasn’t said whether he will run for another term in office. 
Hutton was first elected to the seat in 2022. In the Senate, he currently serves as the chair of the Senate Universities and Technical Colleges Committee and vice-chair of the Senate Transportation and Local Government Committee and has introduced legislation related to transgender Wisconsinites, including banning transgender girls from sports teams that align with their gender and allowing for civil action against medical professionals who provide gender affirming care, and some criminal justice bills, including some related to parole revocation and Wisconsin’s John Doe law.
Prior to the Senate, Hutton served in the Assembly from 2012 to 2018 and on the Waukesha County Board of Supervisors from 2005 to 2012.

Vining said of Hutton that constituents are “frustrated because they don’t know where he stands” on many issues, adding that education funding should be one of the top priorities for lawmakers. 
“What’s the special ed reimbursement rate that he supports? What is it? He’s not going to tell you. There’s going to be issue after issue where you really don’t know where he stands because he’s not going to tell you. I’m going to tell you, I support a 90% special ed reimbursement [rate], I’m going to tell you where I stand on issues,” Vining said. 
Vining has some experience running in competitive races. She flipped Assembly District 14 in 2018, beating out Matt Adamczyk, a former Wisconsin State Treasurer, by slightly more than 130 votes — less than half of 1 percentage point. In her reelection campaign in 2020 with Republicans targeting the seat, Vining beat the Republican candidate by 8 percentage points. In 2024 with new legislative maps in place, Vining ousted one of her Republican colleagues with whom she shared the new district.
“I’ve been the same person in politics the whole time — fighting for families as if they’re my own, fighting for affordable health care. I’m fighting for the things that people care about. People care that you A) listen to them and B) act on it,” Vining said. “I want to continue being the person that hears that you want a 90% special ed reimbursement rate and write the bill to do it and when your EpiPen is too expensive, I’m going to write a bill to try to make that better.”
Showing up to talk to constituents helps win tough districts, Vining said. She has represented about two-thirds of the new Senate district and said she is excited to get out and meet voters in areas she is less familiar with. 
“We have events. We talk with people. We listen. We build relationships,” Vining said.
“Democrats want to take the majority, and we can now spend the next 16 months casting vision for what it would mean to Wisconsinites for us to be in the majority,” Vining said. “It’s our job to cast vision so that people can latch onto it.” 
Vining’s vision focuses on finding the best way to serve people. She listed a number of issues that would be her priority to work on if she were elected and Democrats won the majority, including boosting education funding, improving child care, finally passing postpartum Medicaid expansion and addressing gun violence. She also said she wants to finally pass some of the bills she has proposed over the years while in the Assembly minority, including mental health related measures and a bill that would mandate universal adult-sized changing stations in restrooms in public buildings and encourage businesses to install them as well to help ensure accessibility for those who need it. 
“What we do as representatives is we need to see what we’re missing, and then make sure that we’re talking about those things,” Vining said. In the Assembly, Vining currently serves on the Children and Families Committee, the Health, Aging and Long-Term Care Committee, the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention committee and the Small Business Development Committee. 
Constituents brought the issue of universal changing stations to her attention, she says  — something that other states across the country, including Alabama, have taken action on. A voter named Sarah and her son Matthew, who is disabled, had trouble going to public events because he would have to be changed on the floor of restrooms, she said. 
“Sarah came into my first office hours in February of 2019, right after I was elected, with Matthew [her son]. I met them, then she told me about the problem,” Vining said. “We wrote the legislation. We introduced the legislation and I’ve introduced it every cycle since.” 
Vining said she plans to introduce the legislation again next week. 
“Getting the majority also means making Wisconsin more accessible,” Vining said.

One person camping in the small park said about eight to 12 twelve people had been staying there, at least some of whom arrived in the wake of the July 1 motel evictions.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Montpelier city officials have ordered the removal of a downtown encampment that had grown in recent weeks.
Elizabeth Byam, 44, had set up camp in a small park near Montpelier’s riverfront bus station after her state voucher expired at a motel in nearby Barre on July 1, she said on Thursday afternoon. 
On Wednesday, Montpelier City Police officers arrived at the encampment with notices indicating that the campers would need to leave within 24 hours, Byam said. If they didn’t vacate, their belongings would be taken and stored off-site, out of town, Byam recalled the notice saying.

The next morning, Byam packed up her things before city officials arrived to clear the area. She remained at the site shortly after officials had left, along with a handful of other campers. Her family’s belongings were piled into shopping carts.
Byam estimated that about eight to 12 people had been staying at the encampment recently. She had been living there with her sons and her pregnant daughter-in-law.
“We have a bunch of stuff because she’s got to get ready for a baby,” Byam said. “But we don’t want her outside, either. We want her into a place.”
Montpelier’s acting city manager, Kelly Murphy, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. The Montpelier City Police Department also did not respond to multiple interview requests. (Meredith Warner, deputy director of local homelessness nonprofit Good Samaritan Haven, confirmed the timeline of events relayed by Byam.)
Camping overnight at public parks is prohibited in Montpelier, though city leaders said last summer that they generally look the other way as long as campers haven’t caused issues. 
The city has a separate policy that guides how it handles encampments on other property, focused on diverting camping away from “highly sensitive areas” like grounds near a school or cemetery. The policy also lays out public health and safety issues that can prompt officials to ask campers to leave, including criminal activity and excessive amounts of waste, among others. Montpelier City Council plans to revisit its encampment policy next month, according to recent reporting by WCAX.

The area where the encampment was located, dubbed Confluence Park, garnered half a dozen calls to the police between June 30 and July 6, according to the Montpelier Police Department’s most recent call log.
One log, dated July 2, noted that an encampment was being set up at the location, along with “persons with open containers of alcohol.” Another log the following day noted: “community member very unhappy with homeless people on the bike path at Confluence Park.” An assault in the area last week impacted members of Byam’s family, she said.
The encampment removal is not the first undertaken by the city in recent memory. Last August, Montpelier officials ordered the removal of an encampment at a former country club after a pattern of “threatening behavior” developed. The move prompted a protest led by one of the unhoused people displaced from the site, demanding city officials indicate where people could camp safely.
The city’s move this month comes in the wake of the most recent round of evictions from the state’s motel voucher program, which Gov. Phil Scott has sought to cut back since its pandemic-era expansion. The July 1 exits primarily impacted families with children and people with acute medical needs who had been shielded by an executive order that expired on that date.
In the past, the Scott administration has set up temporary shelters in the wake of evictions from the state’s motel system. This time, however, the Republican’s administration has not indicated it will take such a step.
In the meantime, people living outdoors in Montpelier have few other options. Local service provider Good Samaritan Haven plans to open a long-awaited year-round shelter in the city later this year.
But that won’t come soon enough for Byam. As of Thursday afternoon, she had packed up her camping gear. She planned to sleep outside a nearby church, where she’d heard she would be allowed to stay.
“That’s probably where we’ll be tonight,” Byam said. “And then focus tomorrow on if we’re going to stay there again tomorrow night, or if we’re going to find a spot.”
Warner, from Good Sam, said small municipalities and nonprofits alike are strained by the impact of rising homelessness in Vermont – particularly as both state and federal resources retreat.
“I’m honestly just tired of talking about camping as if it’s a reasonable solution to this problem,” she said. “It is an inhumane response to a person who needs a place to live.”

One volunteer, wiping sweat from his brow, was Errick L. Greene, superintendent of Jackson Public Schools.
Jackson Public Schools held its annual Beautification Day on Friday. The event brings community members into schools to help prepare them for the first day, just days away. Greene joined hundreds of volunteers across the city.
After all, he was the one who established the event when he arrived at the district in 2018 — a district that was facing a potential state takeover and had lost some trust from its community. 
“There’s no way to revitalize a district and do the heavy lifting that we needed to do without some kind of spark,” he said. “We were looking for those sparks — painting a mural or planting some flowers or helping a teacher to set up a classroom. This was an effort to create some shared ownership in our schools.
“You want families to feel like this is their school, because it is.”

That shared responsibility is essential, especially as federal education funding wavers, Greene said. 
Voters had just approved a $65 million bond issue to pay for repairs and new classrooms in the district when Greene arrived in 2018. But he quickly realized Jackson Public Schools, which has many decades-old buildings, needed “two, three, maybe even four times more than that.”
“While I’m thankful, we’ve seen over time, the needs were just much, much, much greater,” he said. 
As the district focuses on taking its schools to the next level, Greene said, the state needs to continue consistently and fully funding education, and the community needs to keep supporting its schools at events like Beautification Day. 
Bailey in particular was humming with excitement on Friday morning. This year, students will be returning to the school’s original location where it was built in 1938. The school was closed for a few years while undergoing renovations, but in a few days, it will reopen as a 4th to 8th grade school after absorbing Wells APAC Elementary School.
For Rose Wright, a longtime history teacher at Bailey, it’s a homecoming.
“What I love about Beautification Day is that these are their children, and these parents are coming to help us help them,” she said, cutting decorations for her classroom. “I am just really excited to be at home.”
Outside in the sultry July heat, a group of dads dug up dead vines. Though it’s not his first time helping out during Beautification Day, Justin Cook, an attorney at the Mississippi Office of the State Public Defender, took off work this year to help prepare the school. He’s got two kids, a 5th grader and an 8th grader, who will learn in the new building.
“I thought it was important to do everything I could to make the transition easier,” he said. “Obviously, there’s going to be hiccups, and whatever we can do as parents and stakeholders to have that growing pains be as minimal as possible is essential.”
Events like Beautification Day, Greene said, don’t just deepen the relationship between the community and the district. They also show students that the community is invested in them, which is integral to their success. 
“I grew up in Flint, Michigan, and so I know what it means to be in a community that is kind of dismissed,” he said. “I’ve found that here, there’s a great deal of pride — even where we as a school district had not delivered. The fact that we even have this kind of activity absolutely signals to young people that people care about you.”
Students roamed the school grounds and hallways, stepping around wood planks and cardboard boxes, peering into their new classrooms.
Kayley Willis, who will be in the 5th grade at Bailey this year, saw her school for the first time on Friday morning and explored the building with friends Anasia Hunter and Farah Malembeka, both rising 6th graders. 
“It makes us feel proud that we actually have people who care about the school enough to come down here and help out,” Hunter said. “It really feels like they care.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/18114707/3X0A8660.jpg,,,2025-07-18 15:33:50.828572

Medical students enrolled at DMU — under the supervision of clinicians and faculty — will conduct the exams, the release stated, which are meant to help students prepare for the semester and fulfill medical requirements for fall sports. Students will also receive a free backpack.
“The event is open to all students, especially those from uninsured and underinsured families,” the release stated. “No appointment or insurance is needed, and interpreters and interpretation services will be available.”
In the more than 10 years of DMU offering the free clinic, the release stated it serves more than 150 students annually.
Sarah Parrott, a professor and physician at the family medicine clinic, said in the release she is proud to offer this service to students so they have a good start to the school year. The free physicals are also an opportunity for DMU staff to better connect with the community, she said.
“Getting an annual physical is an important way to protect one’s health and detect any health problems early,” Parrott said in the release. “Our goal is to make it easy for families to get their children ready for school and fall sports without the added stress of appointments or insurance concerns.”

A Madison County supervisor is suing the sheriff over a criminal referral the law enforcement official allegedly made regarding the supervisor’s comments about potential cuts in the county budget.
Heather Stancil, who is one of three members of the Madison County Board of Supervisors, is suing Madison County Sheriff Jason Barnes in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Stancil alleges that on May 6, 2025, she and the other members of the county board were informed by Madison County Auditor Teri Kaczinski, who had begun a four-year term in January 2025, that she intended to resign effective July 4, 2025.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Because the board is charged with the responsibility of filling a vacancy in the office of auditor, either through an appointment or a special election, the supervisors discussed the potential unplanned expense of such an election, the lawsuit claims.
Stancil publicly advocated for filling the vacancy by appointment to avoid the unbudgeted expense of an election, the lawsuit alleges, and on July 3, Stancil and one other member of the board voted to appoint Matthew Schwarz, a former police officer, to the post. On July 7, Schwarz took the oath of office and assumed possession of the books, records, and office space of the Madison County auditor.
According to the lawsuit, several Madison County residents then used the social media site Facebook to express their disagreement with the board’s decision to fill the vacancy by appointment and also took issue with the selection of Schwarz.
“Stancil, as is her normal practice as an elected official, used Facebook to express her views on the decision,” the lawsuit states, and “explained that if the board was required to expend funds for a special election because of a successful petition, ‘I will then work to find ways to offset that additional cost to taxpayers by shrinking government.’”
In response to Stancil’s statement, Barnes issued a press release on July 14, 2025, stating that his office was “aware of a recent online public statement allegedly made by a member of the Madison County Board of Supervisors. The statement is in regard to a petition being sought by some residents of Madison County who are seeking a special election to choose their county auditor.”
The release went on to suggest that Stancil’s comment was a violation of the Iowa law concerning voter intimidation, and stated that a copy of Stancil’s Facebook comment and a preliminary investigation of the matter had been forwarded to the Iowa Attorney General’s Office for review.
The law in question states that anyone who willingly attempts to “intimidate, threaten or coerce a person” to sign, or refrain from signing, an election petition is guilty of a felony offense.
Lawsuit: Sheriff wanted to ‘score a cheap political point’ 
The lawsuit argues that “no reasonable law enforcement officer could find an elected official’s statement about offsetting unexpected expenses for a special election” to be in violation of the law and calls the sheriff’s position on the matter “preposterous.”
Barnes’ interpretation of the law would “criminalize everything that elected officials regularly do,” the lawsuit claims, since “any action by an elected official could ultimately be connected to a claim it was done to influence the public’s participation in elections.”
The lawsuit also claims Barnes ignored his statutory obligation to investigate allegations of election misconduct only at the direction of the attorney general and to then ensure that any resulting report would remain confidential, adding that “he ignored these duties to score a cheap political point and harm a political adversary.”
The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, as well as court costs and attorney fees, for the alleged violations of Stancil’s constitutional right of free speech.
The sheriff has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday.
In her lawsuit, Stancil is represented by former Muscatine County Attorney Alan Ostergren, who runs an organization called the Kirkwood Institute. The institute, which describes itself as “nonpartisan,” has been recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt public charity — although the institute also calls itself a “conservative public-interest law firm.”
State records indicate Schwarz, the new county auditor, is currently a board member for the Kirkwood Institute. Ostergren was once the director of operations for Schwarz Forensic Enterprises, which is a consulting company run by Schwarz.
Former county treasurer charged
The lawsuit is just one of several issues facing Madison County, which been rocked by turmoil in recent months. In January, Madison County Treasurer Amanda DeVos was criminally charged with felonious misconduct in office, tampering with records and theft. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. After several delays, a pretrial conference in the case is now scheduled for Sept. 2, 2025.
A hearing on a petition calling for DeVos’ removal from office was scheduled for this week, but was preempted by DeVos’ resignation on July 14.
Police records indicate DeVos is accused of obtaining her vehicle registration plates through her office without paying for them and then altering public records to indicate she had paid for them.
Prior to the criminal charges being filed, DeVos’ office was the subject of several complaints alleging citizens’ payments to the county weren’t being processed in a timely manner and payments from the treasurer to various taxing entities in Madison County, such as the Winterset public schools, were not being distributed in a timely manner.
DeVos is a Republican who had served as the county treasurer since January 2023.

A 2025 survey of local election officials found concern about federal cuts to election security. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Local election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.

And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)Since taking office Jan. 20, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders that forced businesses, schools, universities and state and federal agencies to dismantle all diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
Describing Black America as in a “state of emergency,” the National Urban League said the directives show the federal government is “determined to sacrifice its founding principles—equality, liberty, and justice—rather than accept the truth of a diversifying nation and deliver equitable opportunity for all.’’
The National Urban League, a civil rights and advocacy organization focused on economic empowerment of Black and other underserved communities, released its annual State of Black America 2025 report Thursday morning at its conference in Cleveland.
In an executive summary, it credits the Voting Rights Act of 1965 with the “true birth of American democracy.” But the federal government under Trump has “set fire to policies and entire departments dedicated to protecting civil and human rights, providing access to an equal education, fair housing, safe and effective healthcare, and ensuring that our democratic process is adhered to across the nation,” the executive summary said.
Yet despite those actions, Americans bolstered by the civil rights community are pushing back. The group pointed to lawsuits filed across the country by state attorneys general, governors and civil rights groups, including the National Urban League, NAACP Legal Defense Funds and Lambda Legal. As of May 23, 247 cases challenging Trump administration policies had been filed in federal courts.
“There is a state of emergency in Black America, and our report this year is a warning and rallying cry as civil rights protections are being unraveled,” said Marc Morial, National Urban League president and CEO, during a briefing ahead of the report’s release. “Democracy is under siege. What began as what we thought were fringe attacks on racial equity has now become national policy.”

Since 2013, U.S. Supreme Court decisions have struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act that required federal preclearance in communities with a history of racial discrimination before making changes to voting practices, the report notes. And after a 2023 decision that declared affirmative action unconstitutional in college admissions, the National Urban League said the ruling threatens the ability to sue over racial discrimination in voting and to challenge district maps. Other voting-related practices from mail-in ballots and early voting to requirements to provide voting materials in languages other than English are at risk, the group said.
The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, once a protection against discriminatory practices, is now seen as a threat to enforcement of civil rights laws that could become a “tool of retribution,” the report summary said. Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump attorney and election denier, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in April to serve as assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, one of the largest at Justice. Dhillon also opposed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act Amendment in an op-ed which would have restored the landmark law, the executive summary said.
The group defended the value of diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that it “protects and advances democratic ideals.” But the Trump administration has targeted colleges, universities and businesses “for simply having the words diversity and inclusion as part of their mission,’’ adding that Michigan and Columbia universities were forced to end their programs.
“In short, DEI policies don’t just level the playing field in education and employment; they fortify democracy itself. By expanding opportunities, ensuring equitable access to information, and creating leadership pipelines, DEI helps guarantee that every American—not just the privileged few— can contribute to the nation’s future,’’ the group said in the summary.
 ‘Dividing America’

The report also notes how hate and extremist views are more prevalent on social media that began to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic and the acquisition of Twitter (now X) in 2022 by billionaire Elon Musk. The summary said that a day later, right-wing accounts on the platform jumped while those with progressive views dropped. And two years later during the election, accounts of progressive candidates were “banned without explanation.”










In short, DEI policies don’t just level the playing field in education and employment; they fortify democracy itself ... DEI helps guarantee that every American — not just the privileged few — can contribute to the nation’s future.


– National Urban League


A study published in February by researchers from the University of Southern California’s Viterbi Information Sciences Institute showed that general hate speech increased by 50% and transphobic slurs increased by 260%. The study analyzed posts between January 2022 and June 2023.
“People have become very adept at misinformation, disinformation. But my mother called it something different: She said it was lying,” Morial said.
One way to counter that, he said, is increasing voter turnout in next year’s midterm elections and in local elections this year such as mayoral races in Atlanta, New York City and New Orleans.
“I think people should host town hall meetings. I think people should make their voices known on social media,” Morial said. “All of this is important to building a bulwark of resistance. What are we resisting? We’re resisting [a] dividing America. We’re resisting an America where the agenda is white supremacy or white nationalism. But it also is the fight for a multiracial American democracy.”
The report includes nearly two dozen contributors such as congressional officials, attorneys and civil rights activists with a focus on the official name of this year’s report: “State of Emergency: Civil Rights, Democracy & Progress Under Attack.”
Beth Lynk, executive director of the When We All Vote initiative established by former first lady Michelle Obama in 2018, wrote an essay in the report entitled, “A Revised Movement for Democracy – On the Ground and in the Culture.”
“Voting rights is the foundation of all other rights in this country,” she said in an interview Monday. “This essay is really a call to action understanding that we can empower Black Americans to shape the next chapter of our democracy, as we always have from the ground up, by reimagining voter education and registration.”
Lynk noted how Maryland has crafted policies to protect voting rights, crediting Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Maryland), chair of the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, who worked with other caucus leaders.
One topic missing from the National Urban League’s executive summary this year: reparations.
For the first time, the Maryland caucus officially endorsed the creation of a Reparations Commission in a bill that passed this year. Maryland became one of the few states in the nation to assess “appropriate benefits” for those affected by “historical inequity.”
But Gov. Wes Moore (D), the nation’s only Black governor, vetoed the bill in May. With the caucus’s backing and a Democratic majority in the General Assembly, legislators and advocates are confident that a veto override will take place when the legislature returns in session.
“We strongly believe that it’s essential to see this commission through [and] bring it to fruition, especially at a time like this as we’re seeing the most grave attacks and threats to our freedoms since Reconstruction,” Wilkins said. “Now is the time for us to boldly go forward here in the state of Maryland around repairing harms, while we continue to fight back around the present attacks on our freedoms.”

July 17, 2025. | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceEnvironmental activists, community members and local leaders on Thursday gathered in Southwest Detroit to speak out against the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken or outright eliminate key pollution protections.
In Kemeny Park, just a short distance away from the Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s Detroit refinery, speakers slammed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin’s work to roll back rules on mercury and air pollution, end the good neighbor rule – intended to limit smog in communities located downwind from power plants and industrial facilities – and offer exemptions to Clean Air Act regulations.
Southwest Detroit is home to more than 150 manufacturing facilities, and its residents have long suffered from the impacts of air pollution with significantly higher rates for cancer, asthma and respiratory illness than the rest of the state.
According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is strongly tied to stroke and heart disease with some evidence linking pollution to diabetes, cognitive impairment, neurological diseases and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But rather than strengthening pollution protections, the Trump administration is rolling them back, with environmentalists arguing the government is putting polluters first.
“This isn’t just policy, it’s personal, and these rollbacks are literally going to cost lives,” said Meghan Richards, the assistant director of climate equity for Detroit’s Eastside Community Network.
While Southwest Detroit makes headlines for its exposure to pollution, residents of the city’s eastside share many of the same burdens, Richards said.

“We have neighborhoods where folks can’t open their windows in the summer, extreme heat meets poor air quality, and where people are suffering silently, and it’s not just because they’re passive, but it’s because it’s really just a matter of survival for almost all of us,” Richards said.
These issues are only intensified by climate change, Richards said, with residents already suffering from systematic disinvestment, old infrastructure and environmental neglect.
“As temperature rises, so does the threat of pollution. Heat doesn’t just make us uncomfortable, it intensifies ground level ozone, triggering more asthma attacks, heart issues and emergency room visits. That’s especially dangerous for elders, children and people with chronic illnesses,” Richards said.
While Detroiters are resilient, resilience should not be code for abandonment, Richards said, arguing that giving big polluters the opportunity to opt out of regulations is sanctioning harm.
“We deserve more than survival. We deserve justice. We deserve to be able to live and enjoy and have peace and happiness. We need climate standards that protect – not punish – Black, brown and low-income communities who’ve historically borne the brunt of environmental racism. And I want to be very clear that the communities who are harmed the most have done the very least to cause the harm” Richards said.

Gabriela Santiago-Romero, Detroit city councilmember for the city’s sixth district, which includes Southwest Detroit, emphasized that behind every rollback is a child who will need to miss school, an elder struggling to breathe in the summer and families forced to choose between paying for medicine or paying for clean water.
While Santiago-Romero successfully pressed for a dust ordinance to require polluters to control the dust and particulate matter their facilities release, she stressed that the ordinance came directly from listening to residents.
“Environmental Justice is not just a policy fight. It’s a people’s movement. We are a community who is going to continue to organize, and we need your voices at City Hall. We need you to speak to your neighbors, to your schools, to let your folks know, your friends know, about the issues. With corporate polluters and now climate change roaring through our world, everyone’s fights in this movement is critical,” Santiago-Romero stressed.
In addition to strong federal regulations, Detroiters need support for clean energy to cut down on fossil fuel emissions, alongside bold local leadership to stand up for the people.

As part of Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill,” Congress approved cuts to key clean energy provisions within former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, slashing tax incentives for solar and wind generation.
While Congress works to roll back progress and CEOs seek exemptions on pollution, Detroiters need to present a united front, Santiago-Romero said.
“This is the moment to fight back against the rollback, against the lies, against the idea that some communities are disposable. Detroit is not disposable. The people of Michigan are not disposable,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7173741-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-18 15:33:50.828572

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Leavenworth District Court judge finalized his decision to bar CoreCivic from housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement prisoners at its closed facility, rejecting the private prison company’s appeal to reconsider.
Judge John Bryant on Friday approved the language for the injunction that will be in place while the two parties fight out their disagreement in court. Bryant cited potential damages to Leavenworth if CoreCivic is allowed to skip the city’s development process.
“The Court also believes that the balance of harms in this case favors the City,” Bryant wrote. “While CoreCivic now has the ability to increase revenue that it has lacked since 2021, it also has had other remedies available to it in order to move this process further along toward a resolution.”
Those “other remedies” refer to going through the city’s development process to get a special use permit, which is what started the disagreement between the two parties. When CoreCivic announced it would reopen the facility, which closed in 2021, as the Midwest Regional Reception Center, the city in March demanded the company apply for the permit.
In court documents, attorneys for Leavenworth said the company needed a special use permit and indicated the city wanted to address problems with the prison management. One judge had called the former prison a “hell hole,” and the city cited numerous instances of CoreCivic prison officials refusing to cooperate with local law enforcement.
CoreCivic pushed back against the need for a special use permit in a new petition filed July 7, saying the city didn’t follow its own development process and maintaining its argument that a special use permit is unnecessary because the company previously operated the site as a prison.
The petition said CoreCivic anticipates about $50 million in annual revenue from its ICE contract to house “1,000 nondetained noncitizens” and laid out the benefits to the community from an annual payroll of $30 million, plus $10 million for local spending by the plant.
“Regarding last week’s hearing and any other court documents that have been filed, we do not have any updates to share beyond the fact that we are pursuing all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” said CoreCivic spokesman Brian Todd in an email. “We maintain the position that our facility, which we’ve operated for almost 30 years, does not require a Special Use Permit to care for detainees in partnership with ICE.”
A hearing has not been scheduled for CoreCivic’s latest petition.

“The organizers of Utah50501 are not aware of anyone having such a conversation with DPS in which they were ‘warned’ against having a volunteer safety team at events,” the statement added. “At no time did Utah50501 request or require any safety and de-escalation volunteers to carry weapons. No organizers in Utah50501 ever said to DPS, ‘we think it’s a good idea’ for our safety volunteers to carry weapons, and any claim to the contrary is false.”
The statement, however went on to say that “Utah50501 spoke with the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP) regarding protests at the Utah State Capitol when we asked whether people carrying weapons could be asked to leave the protest.” 
The Utah Highway Patrol is a division of the Utah Department of Public Safety. 
Utah Gov. Cox says state warned ‘No Kings’ organizers it was a ‘bad idea’ to use ‘peacekeepers’

“UHP advised us that individuals have a constitutional right to ‘open carry’ or to carry a concealed weapon, and Utah50501 could not lawfully prohibit anyone from doing so at our events,” the organizers’ statement said. 
While they said “we respect” the Second Amendment rights of protesters and Utah’s laws, “at no time did Utah50501 or any of its organizers encourage or request any participant carry a weapon to the protest.”
“The Governor is misinterpreting the law if he says Utah50501 had any lawful authority to prevent participants, whether volunteers or protestors, from carrying a weapon to a protest on public streets or in public spaces,” the statement continued. 
Cox on Thursday did not say protest organizers should have restricted people from legally open or concealed carrying of firearms. He called himself a “big believer of the Second Amendment,” but also said he believed there were “a lot of good people that made mistakes” leading up to the shooting. 
According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting during the June 14 protest happened after two men, who described themselves to police as “peacekeepers,” confronted 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15-style rifle during the protest. 
One of the men, reportedly part of the event organizer’s volunteer security team, told police he thought Gamboa was acting suspiciously, which led him to fire three shots from a handgun, hitting Gamboa in the back but also inadvertently striking innocent bystander Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Gamboa — the man who had openly carried the rifle during the protest but did not fire a shot — was arrested shortly after the shooting but was conditionally released from jail six days later, on June 20.

In the wake of the shooting, the national 50501 group that has organized “No Kings” protests across the country disowned the Utah chapter that organized the Salt Lake City protest, citing a strict “no-weapons policy” and saying the chapter had disregarded “our nonnegotiable values.” 
The “peacekeeper” who was involved in the shooting was a military veteran, the protest organizers said last month. Neither police nor the organizers have publicly named him. 
In their statement issued Thursday night, Utah50501 organizers said they coordinated with the Salt Lake City Police Department “to inform them of plans” per their event permit. 
“Communications with law enforcement, whether it was UHP from previous events at the Capitol or SLCPD, have always been centered around crowd safety, and communication with SLCPD was continued throughout the protest on June 14th,” their statement concluded. 
In response for more information about the communications between state public safety officials and the “No Kings” protest organizers, the Utah Department of Public Safety issued a statement to Utah News Dispatch Friday morning that DPS officials “communicated with the 50501 group from February through May to support public safety and property protection during their various events at the State Capitol.” 
“During this time, the group requested that the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP) remove counter-protesters from their gatherings,” the DPS statement said. “We informed them that such action is not permissible, as all individuals have a constitutional right to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.”
State public safety officials added that “the group also expressed interest in utilizing private security or safety volunteers.”
“We made clear that while they may designate individuals to assist with basic support, such as offering aid in cases of dehydration or minor medical issues, or helping de-escalate conversations, they do not have law enforcement authority and therefore cannot take enforcement actions or attempt to remove individuals from public spaces,” DPS said.

DPS added: “When the group raised the idea of their private security personnel being armed, we did not tell them they were prohibited from doing so. However, we cautioned against it, explaining the risks and implications of individuals carrying firearms without law enforcement authority. DPS remains committed to ensuring the safety of all individuals exercising their rights at the Capitol.”
Cox’s comments Thursday came after reporters asked him during a PBS Utah news conference if there’s anything the state can or should do to prevent similar tragedies like the shooting that left Ah Loo dead. 
“I don’t know that there’s more that we can do,” the governor said, noting state officials “work very closely with organizations across the state,” including the ‘No Kings’ protesters. 
“That was an absolute tragedy,” Cox continued. “I can tell you that they were warned months and months and months ago that it was a bad idea to have these peacekeepers to be a part of what they were attempting to do, that it could lead to something like this, and sadly, it did.” 
Asked to give more details about those warnings, Cox said “the leaders of the event were warned many months ago when they first started doing this, and they were warned by our Department of Public Safety.” 
“Our DPS said, ‘It’s a bad idea. You can do it, it’s not illegal, there’s nothing illegal about it, it’s just a bad idea,’” Cox said. “‘They said, ‘Well, we think it’s a good idea.’ End of conversation.” 
Pressed on who he believed was responsible for Ah Loo’s death, Cox said, “That’s a good question, and the (Salt Lake County) district attorney will eventually make that decision as it goes forward.” 
Cox added there were “a lot of good people who made mistakes.” 
“I don’t know who’s ultimately responsible, but I think a lot of people are responsible for what happened,” the governor said. “It’s a terrible tragedy. My heart goes out to his family. I think, again, mistakes were made by the organizers, by the peacekeepers, by the protester who brought his rifle. Lots of mistakes were made.” 
No charges have been filed in relation to the shooting. It’s up to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office to decide whether anyone involved will be charged with a crime.

As Source’s Patrick Lohmann reported, the man was Deivi Jose Molina-Pena, 33, whose friends and family say arrived in the United States legally under Temporary Protected Status about two years ago from Venezuela.
Watching videos of police violence has never been my thing, so as the 20-second clip ran, I found my eyes focusing on the other officer on the scene, a balaclava covering her face, who seemed intent on protecting a shelf of cheap blenders nearby from falling over, even while the victim, Mr. Molina Peña, collapsed and slammed his head on the tiled floor. 
ICE’s spokespeople will tell us that their actions like this one– tasing an unarmed man in a shopping center– occur for our protection. They will tell us about non-citizens who are drug traffickers or, worse, sex traffickers. They will say some non-citizens are members of gangs like Tren de Aragua. They will tell us that any immigrant’s existence in our community is the real threat and that we are safer from drugs and sexual exploitation and gangs only if every last non-citizen is punished. We are meant to shrug and see a violent tasing in a public market as important collateral damage for the mission of Making America Safe Again. 
But ICE is the real public safety threat in our communities. Evidence is piling up in our cities and towns and in the media of the violent, lawless and inhumane tactics ICE employs to fulfill arrest quotas and the president’s mission of mass deportation. I listened to an NPR report the other day that included the sound clip of an ICE agent smashing a window of a truck while the person inside, a U.S. citizen (as if that should matter), screamed for their life. I contemplated the inchoate and speculative threat of violence I am told to fear because I live and work among non-citizens versus the very plain violence I can see and hear and feel coming from ICE. 
I live in Santa Fe where our mayoral race and city council races are heating up. Albuquerque is also electing its mayor this year. One of the questions I have for people vying to lead our cities is how they plan to protect our communities from ICE. Many New Mexico municipalities have robust sanctuary policies, which are commendable and go a long way to prohibit the use of local resources in supporting ICE operations. But sanctuary policies do not restrict ICE agents from entering a city. They are here among us threatening the peace in our neighborhoods. Congressional Democrats are proposing legislation to ban ICE agents from wearing masks and require them to identify themselves. Attorneys general across the country — including New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez — back such measures. I want to challenge people running for local office to explore how municipal resources can also be proactively used to protect us from this public safety threat. 
I recently shared the stage with Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller at an Indivisible Albuquerque event at which I was speaking and I asked him that very question: How could he creatively deploy the power of the Albuquerque Police Department to protect Burqueños? In the moment he didn’t really have an answer. While I understood why — because it’s a complicated question and he was put on the spot — I still felt a bit frustrated. I have been seeing politicians all over the country using very strong language to condemn ICE’s actions but when asked what they were going to do to intervene, they claim there isn’t much they can do to interfere with federal law enforcement. When people in elected office tell me they simply don’t have the power to change things, I always wonder if someone with an office, a title, a platform, a budget and, in this case, a police force at their disposal, has no power, what on earth am I expected to do as someone with none of those things?
So I was impressed this week to hear that Keller’s team is now thinking about how to creatively deploy city resources to protect people in Albuquerque from ICE. Keller announced this past weekend that the public can now contact APD to verify if ICE is operating in Albuquerque. Is it a perfect solution? No. But it is an acknowledgement that a city can and should do more to protect its people from the exact sort of incident that recently occurred at Walmart.
And thankfully it is generating more debate about what we can do at the local level. Alexander Uballez, another Albuquerque mayoral candidate, responded to Keller’s  announcement with an 11-point plan to strengthen the city’s response to ICE’s presence. These are the exact conversations we need to be having as a community and I, for one,  will be paying attention and participating as I decide who I am going to vote for.  The election season is heating up and we need to continue to challenge candidates to explain how they plan to flex their power to protect our communities from ICE and the incredible threat it poses to our communal safety.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ICE-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-18 15:33:50.828572

Esther Ngoy Tekele — a 23-year-old Congolese woman who has been held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody for over a week — was ordered to be released on bond on Thursday.
Tekele is a lawful permanent resident and has been living in Vermont for four years, according to her brother and her attorney. 
At the time of her arrest on July 6, Tekele was crossing the Canadian border with her family to re-enter Vermont after attending a wedding in Canada. Coco Ngoy, Tekele’s brother, said they were stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents at the Highgate Springs border crossing and waited for about three hours. When he asked for an explanation, an officer told him they were free to go except for Tekele. 
Ngoy said he left briefly to get food after hours of waiting, and when he came back, he was told his sister was no longer there, so he reached out to the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, or AALV, for help.
Nathan Virag, the attorney representing Tekele, said he wasn’t able to get in touch with his client for about two days. He said Tekele was questioned by Customs and Border Protection agents for hours before being transferred to ICE custody. “They were not giving us information, they were not letting her call us, none of that,” he said.
The first time Virag was able to speak with his client was July 8 when he visited her at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility. 
“We were successful in getting a temporary restraining order to prevent ICE from being able to transfer out of state because that’s what ICE has been doing,” Virag said.
Tekele is a green card holder with no criminal record, according to Virag and Ngoy. She has a 2-year-old child and also takes care of her mother. Ngoy said they had crossed the Canadian border many times and never had any problems before.
Federal immigration officers had alleged that Tekele lied about her marital status and entered the country declaring to be unmarried, but instead she got married a few days earlier.
At a bond and master hearing in Chelmsford Immigration Court on Thursday, Virag denied the allegations and asked for his client to be released on bond, claiming she doesn’t have any criminal charges, has stable employment, and she plans to stay in the U.S. and apply for citizenship.
Judge Natalie Smith ordered Tekele be released on a $7,500 bond. An attorney for the federal government waived the right to appeal the judge’s decision. 
“It’s a relief for us,” said Ngoy. “At least Esther will be able to see her son and take care of my mom.” 
“Wrongly detaining lawful permanent residents at a standard crossing speaks to the lawless and inhumane immigration agenda coming from the White House,” U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., who helped locate Tekele after her arrest, wrote in a statement to VTDigger. “I’m so happy to hear Ms. Tekele is headed back with her family at home in Vermont but nobody with legal status in this country should have to live in fear of being held in a jail cell at any moment.” 
The government must submit evidence for Tekele’s removal by July 31, when the next hearing is scheduled. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment. Customs and Border Protection did not to respond to VTDigger’s emailed questions by the time of publication.
“She’s a great mother. She loves her child. She’s helpful in the Congolese community here in Vermont,” Virag said, “This is just a hardworking mother that’s fallen victim to a messed-up immigration system.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-07-18 17:38:08+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,GOP sues New Jersey for voter registration records,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/07/18/gop-sues-new-jersey-for-voter-registration-records/,The Republican National Committee alleges state officials violated the Open Public Records Act by delaying or denying their requests for voter registration documents.,"The Republican National Committee alleges state officials violated the Open Public Records Act by delaying or denying their requests for voter registration documents. (Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)The Republican National Committee is suing New Jersey, alleging state officials violated the Open Public Records Act in denying its requests for voting machine seal audit logs and unduly delayed a response to its request for a trove of voter registration data.
The GOP alleges that officials within the state elections division violated the records law by failing to return documents within the required seven-business-day response period and by declining to release documents created and maintained by county election officials and shared with the state office.
“State officials are slow-walking access to records about voting machines and voter roll maintenance,” Michael Whatley, the committee’s chair, said in a statement. “The RNC is taking legal action because the people of New Jersey have a right to know that their elections are being run fairly, securely, and in full compliance with the law.”
A spokesperson for the New Jersey secretary of state, who oversees state elections, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The state has not yet filed a response to the complaint, which was lodged Thursday in Superior Court in Mercer County.
Though New Jersey law largely requires records custodians to fill records requests within seven business days, custodians rarely meet those timelines. Delays to one of the GOP’s requests stretch long even by normal standards.
The committee’s first request, which sought a raft of documents related to voter registration and voter list maintenance, was submitted on March 25 and received its first tranche of responsive documents on July 11, some 75 business days later.
Donna Barber, the election division’s executive director, in a June 18 email attached to the lawsuit told GOP attorneys that the state’s June 10 primary had delayed its processing of the request.
“I apologize for the delayed response but New Jersey’s June 10, 2025 statewide primary election has required almost all of our time. The Division of Elections is currently reviewing your request,” she said in the email.
Though records custodians are afforded the ability to seek extensions to public record request deadlines, it’s not clear the elections division requested an extension within seven business days of receiving the committee’s request, as the law requires.
Barber’s email did not include a deadline for the extension.
The Republicans’ request for voter registration documents was voluminous, seeking disclosure of four classes of records of communications with federal agencies spanning two years, every record relating to five national databases over that period, and two years of communications between state and local election officials, among a host of other voter registration-related records.
The division provided the GOP with a list of voters removed from the rolls and a list of inactive voters last week, but has returned no other responsive documents.
At least some portions of the GOP’s requests appear deficient under New Jersey’s public records law. Its request for communications about voter roll inaccuracies, for example, does not list specific email addresses or accounts, as required by 2024 amendments to the Open Public Records Act that narrowed the scope of the transparency law.
It’s unclear whether a judge will consider the Republicans’ request for documents spanning two years “reasonable,” another requirement for the release of documents like emails, text messages, and other correspondence.
The Republican committee has said it is seeking records required to be made available under the National Voter Registration Act, which requires officials to make records relating to the maintenance of voter rolls available for public inspection.
Federal courts have ruled, including last year, that the federal law’s disclosure requirements can supersede conflicting state law, though those cases are typically filed in federal rather than state courts.
The division’s denial of a GOP request filed separately on July 3 — for audit logs of seals placed on voting machines outside of polling hours to prevent tampering — doesn’t face the same preemption risks because those documents are not related to the maintenance of voter rolls.
State officials denied that request on multiple grounds. They said they were not required to disclose those documents because they were created and primarily maintained by counties. Under the changes made to the state records law in 2024, agencies are not required to disclose documents they possess that were drafted by a separate public entity.
The division also denied those requests under two exemptions on computer and data security.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/heminghaus_early-voting_016-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-07-18 13:42:18.317981
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-18 17:02:40+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s reentry centers say lack of funding could force them to cut back — or close,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/18/ct-reentry-centers-funding/,"The centers, which help people released from prison, are running on 'prayer and duct tape' as grants run out and COVID-19 dollars expire.","Nonprofits that help people released from prison find employment, housing and other services say they may need to pare back their work, or shutter completely, if more funding doesn’t arrive soon. 
Reentry Welcome Centers have historically kept themselves afloat through a combination of local funding, federal grants and philanthropic donations. Now, they’re finding themselves strapped for cash as grants run out and federal coronavirus dollars, which some of them received from their municipalities, are expiring.
Beth Hines, the executive director of Community Partners in Action, told the state’s Criminal Justice Advisory Committee last week that her organization has paused referrals from the Department of Correction in both its Hartford and Waterbury locations while funding remains unclear. 
Connecticut lawmakers had originally allocated $1.5 million in the state budget for reentry centers each of the next two years, which Hines said made her “ecstatic.” But by the time the final state budget was approved, the centers’ funding for fiscal year 2026 had disappeared. 
Todd Murphy, spokesman for the House Democrats, said the funding was one of several items removed from the budget in an effort to remain within the state’s spending limits.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the reentry centers had previously been funded through coronavirus relief dollars, and that lawmakers hoped to revisit the funding during a special session.
Reentry center leaders have faced this uncertainty before.
Scott Wildeman, president of Career Resources Inc., which helps people returning from incarceration with job training, said the centers have been asking the state for funding for years. 
“ This is a service that the state uses, and that they should, in theory, be paying for,” he said. 
The six reentry centers that operate in some of the state’s largest urban centers serve as hubs connecting people who were recently incarcerated with things like finding housing or a job, getting clothes and basic toiletries, and addressing health care needs.
According to a report released in April, 72% of clients of reentry welcome centers across the state between June 2023 and May 2024 reported having unstable housing situations. Sixty-five percent of the roughly 1,000 people whose sentences ended between June and December of last year did not have a high school diploma. About half had a “serious or extremely serious” problem with substance abuse and about a third had a mental health disorder classified as “moderate or serious.”
The Hartford-based center serves about 400 people each year, and the Waterbury center serves 350. Without additional funding, Hines said, she estimates they’ll be able to serve 120 people in Hartford and 80 people in Waterbury, and she said even that 120 would be tough. 
“If that state funding doesn’t come through … there’s going to be hundreds of people turned away in Hartford and hundreds turned away in Waterbury. We won’t be able to serve halfway house participants anymore. We won’t be able to serve people on probation,” she said.

Staff at CPA told The Connecticut Mirror that their partner organizations set up shop at the Hartford location on a weekly or biweekly basis, offering things like health screenings, help with taxes and resume preparation, or what are known as “harm reduction services” like clean needles or fentanyl test strips. The organization has a computer lab for people to use, and Career Resources, Inc. — which is one of its partners — helps people find entry-level jobs. 
“ Many of the people coming to the center have been incarcerated for a significant period of time. They’ve unfortunately burnt bridges with family and friends, and so oftentimes the center and our case management teams are the only help that they have,” Hines explained. 
Community Partners in Action currently receives funding from both the city of Hartford and the nonprofit Hartford Foundation for Public Giving. Hines said the organization has applied for a grant from an organization in California, and that she’s not sure what will happen if it doesn’t come through. 
CPA received three years of federal COVID-19 relief funding through the City of Hartford, which expired in 2023. This year, two additional grants from the federal government — one for substance abuse and mental health services, and one from the Department of Justice — are also reaching their preordained end dates. 
Wildeman said the center he operates in Bridgeport, which serves about 400 people annually, will remain open until Oct. 1 with the hope that state lawmakers will call a special session. If Career Resources, Inc. doesn’t receive state funding, he said, the center will close. “ We’ve cut way back. I’ve only got one staff on it right now. I have very minimal support dollars,” he said. 
“ Just the other day, we had two individuals that were coming to the center that were homeless, coming directly out of incarceration,” he said. “If that center’s not there, these individuals would literally end up on the streets.”
Pastor Dana Smith, who runs New Life II in New Britain, which offers recovery housing and peer support as well as reentry services, described his budget as held together with “a lot of prayer and duct tape.” 
Smith said New Life relies on churches and donations, as well as funding from the recovery center, to support reentry services. Smith said staff members are doing everything possible to keep the center running, but money is tight. State funding, he said, would go toward purchasing backpacks, supplies and bus passes, which they provide to clients.
New Life is currently working with about 100 people, he said, who staff check in with once a month. He said they also encourage people as they struggle with the challenges of reentry, like the difficulty of getting a job with a criminal record. 
“If that center’s not there, these individuals would literally end up on the streets.”Scott Wildeman, Career Resources Inc.
Nichelle Hilton, the director of the Project M.O.R.E. Reentry Welcome Center in New Haven, said the center will likely close its doors by the end of the year without additional funds. 
Unlike other reentry centers, Project M.O.R.E. doesn’t have private donors. Hilton said that’s left the organization with almost no funding, aside from donated clothes and some support from Career Resources that allows them to assist clients with applying for jobs. In the wintertime, she said, she lets homeless people stay in the warmth of the center until it closes for the evening. She can also direct them to places where they can get food or showers in the city.
The center was previously funded by the City of New Haven, but, according to Hilton, city leaders cut funding due to an issue with the nonprofit’s former leadership.
Mayor Justin Elicker said in a statement to CT Mirror that the city was committed to supporting people returning from incarceration, and that leaders recognized the importance of having a reentry welcome center to assist with housing, employment and other services. Elicker said the city planned to issue a Request for Proposals for a reentry welcome center, and would consider an application from Project M.O.R.E., calling the organization “an important partner in this work.” 
Without the reentry centers, Hilton said, people often don’t know what resources exist in the city. And without the support that her center offers for people trying to get on their feet, she said, people will be more likely to turn to crime.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s Supreme Court on Friday denied Attorney General Todd Rokita’s call to dismiss a second disciplinary action against him — both stemming from public comments made three years ago about his investigation of an Indianapolis abortion provider.
“It is exceptionally rare for respondents to file motions to dismiss disciplinary complaints, and even rarer that we grant them,” Justice Derek Molter wrote in the unanimous opinion.
The high court’s denial came without prejudice — allowing Rokita to potentially refile — “because we conclude the arguments he makes in his motion are better addressed through the hearing process and our subsequent review,” Molter continued.
The court appointed a three-member hearing panel instead of its typical lone hearing officer, accommodating a proposal from Rokita.
“Appointing three distinguished members of the bench and bar to serve as hearing officers is particularly appropriate in this case, which involves conduct at the intersection of law and politics,” a concurring opinion from Justice Christopher Goff said.
He noted that the political role assumed by many state attorneys general in contemporary America creates tension with licensing obligations that they assume as members of their state’s bar.
“When a licensed attorney, entrusted with the full legal power of a state, advocates (or legally implements) divisive policies advocated by national partisans, their statements and actions can, in some circumstances, be both politically popular within their state and violative of its rules of professional conduct for attorneys,” Goff said.
“And because the legal power of a state attorney general is so great, such popular but unprofessional conduct can hurt real people and impede official processes. When that happens, people harmed by such conduct will look to the attorney-discipline process for relief,” he continued.
Indiana taxpayers have covered more than $491,000 in legal bills defending Rokita in multiple disciplinary investigations and formal ethics cases, according to records obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Case’s background
In a 2022 interview with Fox News commentator Jesse Watters, Rokita called Indianapolis doctor Caitlin Bernard an “activist acting as a doctor” and said his office would be investigating her conduct. Bernard, an OB-GYN, oversaw a medication abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio in 2022.
That November, in a split decision and public reprimand, the high court justices found that he had violated two of the Rules of Professional Conduct for lawyers:
  Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita speaks to the media on Friday, March 21, 2025, at his office in Indianapolis. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)

They said Rokita’s comments constituted an “extrajudicial statement” that he knew — or reasonably should have known — would be publicly disseminated and would prejudice related legal proceedings.
They also said his statements had “no substantial purpose” other than to embarrass or burden Bernard.

Rokita and Indiana’s Discplinary Commission disputed over a third charge — engaging in conduct “that is prejudicial to the administration of justice” — which the commission agreed to dismiss in exchange for “admission to misconduct” on the others.
In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to the two violations and acknowledged he couldn’t have defended himself successfully on the charges if the matter were tried.
But the same day the reprimand was handed down, Rokita called the dispute a “failed attempt to derail our work” in a lengthy and unrepentant news release. He said he had “evidence and explanation” for what he said on air, but chose not to fight the complaint any further to save “taxpayer money and distraction.”
The Disciplinary Commission filed a new round of charges against him in January, alleging he wasn’t being truthful when he told the court he was accepting responsibility for his actions.
Rokita attempted to dismiss the new complaint in February, which the Disciplinary Commission opposing his motion.
“We reach no judgment at this stage about those allegations or defenses because it is premature to evaluate them through a motion to dismiss where the parties are arguing over competing inferences that may depend on evidence outside the current record,” Molter wrote in the court’s opinion.
Process continues
The case will now move before a three-judge hearing panel. Members were picked from the northern, central, and southern regions of Indiana to “protect against a public perception that political considerations could unduly influence a single officer,” according to the opinion.
They include Indiana Court of Appeals Judges Cale J. Bradford and Nancy H. Vaidik, and attorney William G. Hussman.

Bradford and Vaidik are currently serve on the Indiana Court of Appeals, and both have been elected by their colleagues to serve as their court’s Chief Judge in the past.
Hussmann is a practicing attorney whose public and private sector experience Indiana Supreme Court includes serving as a U.S. Magistrate Judge, as a deputy attorney general, and as a staff attorney with the Indiana Disciplinary Commission.
The court also encouraged the hearing panel to discuss mediation with Rokita and the commission.
“While we are only at the pleadings stage, the parties’ discussion of the claims through their early filings is already voluminous,” Molter wrote. “And up to this point, their submissions, though extensive, reveal very little factual disagreement. That disagreement is vehement, but it also seems narrow, so there may not be much to litigate through a hearing.”
The panel will submit a report, and the court will review the evidence and evaluate the law. Molter noted the court doesn’t defer to the report but does give it more emphasis because of the direct observation of witnesses included.
Possible sanctions include a private or public reprimand; suspension from practice for a set period of time; suspension from practice with reinstatement only after the lawyer proves fitness; and permanent disbarment.

,DC,2025-07-18 16:47:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration deal to house deportees at El Salvador prison probed by Dems,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-deal-house-deportees-el-salvador-prison-probed-dems,,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats sent a letter Thursday to the heads of Homeland Security and the State Department seeking more information about the financial agreement between the United States and El Salvador to detain more than 200 men at a notorious megaprison.“Congress has the right and the obligation to conduct oversight over the executive branch and determine what deals our government has struck with a foreign dictator to imprison individuals seized in the United States in an effort to place them beyond the reaches of our court,” according to the letter by California’s Robert Garcia, Maryland’s Jamie Raskin, Mississippi’s Bennie Thompson and New York’s Gregory Meeks.In March, the Trump administration flew several planes to El Salvador containing 238 men removed either under an 18th-century wartime law, known as the Alien Enemies Act, or because they are immigrants who had final orders of removal and are citizens of El Salvador. The men arrived at the notorious prison known as CECOT.The letter challenges the Trump administration's position publicly and in courts that any individuals removed to El Salvador to be detained are no longer in U.S. custody and any court order to facilitate the return of wrongly removed immigrants cannot be fulfilled.According to court documents filed last week, testimony from Salvadoran officials noted that those individuals removed and detained at CECOT were considered in the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.“The actions of the state of El Salvador have been limited to the implementation of a bilateral cooperation mechanism with another state, through which it has facilitated the use of the Salvadoran prison infrastructure for the custody of persons detained within the scope of the justice system and law enforcement of that other state,” according to the court document submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union.That document was submitted in a court case that relates to the Trump administration's use of the wartime law, and whether or not officials violated a federal judge’s order to return the planes to the U.S. The planes still landed in El Salvador.“Court filings last week suggest the Administration misled federal judges, Congress, and the American people about the legal status of individuals the U.S. government has spirited away to El Salvador and who are being held in torture prisons like Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT),” the Democrats wrote. The Democrats addressed the letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, asking to see the agreement between the U.S. and El Salvador to accept non-Salvadoran citizens and information on the men detained at CECOT.“This document indicates that the Department of Justice has misled federal courts in assertions regarding the agreement with El Salvador,” wrote the  Democrats, who sit on House committees on Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs, Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform.$15 million payment to El SalvadorThe State Department is paying up to $15 million to house immigrants removed from the U.S. at CECOT, but the agreement has not been made publicly available. Former State Department officials and foreign policy aides have raised concerns that the State Department payments violate a human rights law.The Leahy Law bars financial assistance to “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations, such as CECOT.The State Department has denied any wrongdoing.The Trump administration has resisted court orders to return wrongfully deported men from CECOT, such as in the high-profile deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and a separate case out of Baltimore, Maryland concerning another wrongly deported man sent to the megaprison. Abrego Garcia detailed how he experienced physical and psychological torture while at CECOT.Noem visited CECOT earlier this year, and said the prison would be one of the Trump administration’s tools amid its aggressive immigration crackdown.",,,,2025-07-18 12:56:53.644943
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-18 16:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Afghan interpreter seized by ICE,Mona Mahadevan | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/18/afghan-interpreter-seized-by-ice/,Federal immigration officials on Wednesday seized an Afghan immigrant — a father of five and former interpreter for the U.S. military.,"Federal immigration officials on Wednesday seized an Afghan immigrant — a father of five and former interpreter for the U.S. military — outside a U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) office, following a routine appointment related to his green card application. 
The arrest of Zia S., 35, took place in East Hartford.
Residents of a New Haven suburb, Zia, his wife, and their five children moved to Connecticut last year with help from New Haven’s Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS).
They had fled Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021, fearing that Zia’s work with U.S. forces made them targets for retribution.
Zia and his family arrived in the U.S. in October 2024 after receiving two-year humanitarian parole and one-time ​“boarding foils” from the U.S. embassy in Islamabad, allowing them to legally enter the country through JFK Airport. Once in the country, their Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applications were approved, granting all seven family members a pathway to permanent residency.
Zia was taken into custody on Wednesday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and transported to a detention facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts, according to his attorney, Lauren Cundick Petersen. 
Petersen said he received a signed order of expedited removal, a process that does not guarantee a hearing in front of an immigration judge. 
“I’d rather someone just kill me in the U.S. than return to Afghanistan,” Zia told Petersen over the phone. 
A media spokesperson for ICE confirmed Thursday that Zia was arrested but declined to comment, saying only that the case ​“is part of a bigger investigation.” 
According to the order for expedited removal, which Zia read to Petersen over the phone, Zia was detained for not entering the country legally. ​“That is just not true,” said Petersen. ​“He hasn’t done anything to violate the terms of parole, and his parole hasn’t been revoked, as far as we know.”
Zia was at the USCIS center on Wednesday to submit biometric information for his green card application. When he exited into the parking lot, six ICE agents, some in balaclavas, surrounded him and forced him into an unmarked van. 
He was accompanied by an IRIS volunteer at the time of his detainment. That volunteer’s daughter first described the incident in a Facebook post, which has since been circulated by IRIS. 
Zia spent around five years as a translator for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a role that placed him and his loved ones at constant risk. According to No One Left Behind, a nonprofit that helps resettle Afghan interpreters, more than 300 translators and their family members were killed between 2014 and 2021.
“Zia has been fearing for his life, not just recently, but for years,” said Petersen. ​“From the time he started assisting U.S. troops, he’s had a target on his back.”
In exchange for their service, the U.S. government promised translators and their relatives the ability to become permanent residents through the SIV program. 
Zia remained in Afghanistan for several years after serving as an interpreter, but once the Taliban returned to power, his living conditions grew too dangerous. He escaped to Pakistan with his wife and five children, and, with Petersen’s help, applied for both SIVs and humanitarian parole: a temporary entry program granted in cases of ​“emergenc[ies],” urgent humanitarian reason[s],” or ​“significant public benefit.” 
IRIS supported the family through their resettlement in a New Haven suburb. 
“We all have to adjust what we think of as undocumented, because people are being made undocumented every day,” IRIS Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem told the Independent on Thursday. She said IRIS plans to fundraise for Zia’s family so they can cover living expenses without their father at home.
She hopes that learning about their plight will help people ​“open their hearts wider” for migrants who are undocumented as well. 
Petersen is weighing next steps, but she hopes that ICE will conduct a credible fear interview since Zia faces threats to his life in Afghanistan.
“The way they grabbed him – picking him up with weapons and with masks, in this violent fashion – has to bring back a lot of bad memories,” said Petersen. ​“He loves the U.S., and he’s so happy to be here. It’s such a betrayal.”

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Maine hospitals are projected to lose more than $66 million per year in revenue because of Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
That’s according to a national nonprofit organization, Third Way, that calculated minimum estimates of how much money health care systems across the country would lose due to thousands of people losing Medicaid coverage because of provisions in the newly signed law.
Nationwide, Third Way estimated that these cuts will result in a $24 billion annual revenue loss for hospitals. That means some of the current revenue Maine hospitals receive from the federal government through Medicaid payments is expected to be cut, primarily because of patients being deemed ineligible to use their federally subsidized health insurance to pay for services, said Darbin Wofford, the think tank’s deputy director of health care.
“Cuts to Medicaid don’t only risk the coverage of MaineCare recipients,” said Lily Cohen, press advisor at Third Way. “The decimation of hospital budgets impacts the quality and volume of care they’re able to provide to all patients. And when they see more uninsured patients with less money to cover the costs, many hospitals — especially in rural Maine — may be forced to shut their doors.”
To compile data on estimated revenue losses for hospitals, the organization used data from the National Academy for State Health Policy — which broke down hospital revenues by source — and looked at the percent of money that hospitals make from the Medicaid program as opposed to other programs like Medicare, commercial insurance and other sources of revenue.
Three of Maine’s largest hospitals are projected to lose the most money of any hospital in the state, the analysis found. The hospital expected to see the most is Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, with at least $12.6 million in cuts per year due to lost Medicaid revenue. MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta will lose $8.1 million per year and Maine Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital which is located in Portland, will lose $6.8 million per year. Wofford said these estimates are minimums, so the actual losses could be even higher.
MaineHealth, which owns Maine Medical Center, did not comment on the exact amount of annual losses or the Third Way report. Chief Government Affairs Officer Katie Fullam Harris said in a statement, “MaineHealth is committed to doing its part to find better, more affordable ways to deliver care and reduce its dependency on contract labor and will continue to innovate to keep costs down while maintaining the highest quality of care.”  
However, Fullam Harris said the overall $1 trillion in cuts to heath care in the bill will undoubtedly have significant repercussions for Maine families and the hospitals that support them. 
“The impact of this bill will add significant stress to Maine’s hospitals, which are already struggling to maintain access to care for their communities,” she added 
The other two hospitals did not respond to requests for comment.
Sixteen hospitals across the state will lose more than a million annually due to the cuts, according to the data.


While the largest hospitals are at risk of the greatest losses, rural Maine hospitals face a different threat. 
Some are already operating at losses, or rely heavily on Medicaid because of the patients they serve, which makes them particularly prone to closures, according to two other national reports. 
Last month, reports from Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Families USA listed four hospitals at high risk of having to close because of the Medicaid cuts. 
Maine is far from alone in facing this risk: more than 300 rural hospitals nationwide are at disproportionate risk of closure or service reductions, according to the Sheps Center report.
The Sheps Center named Northern Light A.R. Gould Hospital in Presque Isle and Maine Coast Memorial Hospital in Ellsworth among the 338 high-risk rural hospitals across the country, both for their three-year record of operating on negative margins. 
Families USA also identified Cary Medical Center in Caribou and Calais Community Hospital as at risk because the cuts to Medicaid are expected to lower their operating margins below zero, according to a roundup compiled by the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Despite these reports, Paul Bolin, executive vice president and chief people and administrative officer at Northern Light Health told the Portland Press Herald that the system has no plans of closing these hospitals.

She and others are still waiting for the payments, despite a judge ruling in her favor late last year. (Photo courtesy Marianna Lands)Lawyers at the Federal Emergency Management Agency have not yet decided whether they’ll appeal a judge’s December ruling that orders them to compensate victims of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire for emotional harm. 
Just before Christmas last year, Federal Judge James O. Browning issued a 99-page ruling that determined FEMA had wrongly refused to pay victims of the state’s biggest-ever wildfire for “noneconomic damages,” which are payments aimed at compensating victims for the emotional toll the fire and ensuing floods caused.
Congress in late 2022 enacted the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act, which tasks FEMA with “fully compensating” victims of a wildfire that the United States Forest Service accidentally ignited in spring 2022 in two botched prescribed burns. Congress has given FEMA nearly $5.5 billion for victims, minus about $380 million in expected administrative costs.  
Browning’s ruling came more than a year after wildfire victims sued FEMA for refusing to pay for “noneconomic damages” and nine months after the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office issued a formal opinion saying the payments were allowable under New Mexico state law, which was one element of the lawsuit.
NM AG agrees with law firms’ argument seeking more funds for Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims

Whether thousands of fire victims will receive noneconomic damages anytime soon is an open question nearly eight months since Browning’s ruling and more than three years since the wildfire. 
The lack of clarity has left people like Marianna Lands in limbo, according to her lawyers. Lands’ farm in Mora burned and later flooded. The stress of the disaster caused Lands, who is in her late 70s, to have a stroke, according to her lawyer, Ty Tosdal, “and she has never fully recovered.”
In a letter to Source, Lands writes that in the time since she “was stroked [had a stroke] during the great fire in Northern New Mexico,” she’s had to leave her farm and move to “highly priced Hawaii” with her daughter. She was forced to move there after suffering several falls at her temporary place in Taos, falls that made it clear she couldn’t live alone, she wrote. 



Marianna Lands’ letter to Source New Mexico
 “It is almost two and a half years since I was stroked (had a stroke) during the great fire in Northern New Mexico (Hermits Peak Fire). The first year I had to leave our farm and move to Taos, New Mexico to receive medical attention. I lived alone, with good care from friends. After several falls I realized I couldn’t live alone and had to move to Hawaii to live with my daughter, Ania Roske, who worked extra hard to make ends meet in highly priced Hawaii.  Besides the warm weather, I don’t experience the paradise that Maui is called. I don’t leave my room much, don’t go to the beach, the waterfalls or to the top of mountain.  I am glad to be out of the snow of Northern New Mexico.
In Hawaii I have been diagnosed as disabled… I use a cane to walk and pay close attention not to fall. My speech is better than before, but I can only talk so long before I can’t remember words.  My teeth were pulled out after the stroke as they were seriously affected. The dentures I received no longer fit correctly, so it is necessary that I eat soup and very soft food.  
I am spending what money I have left on medical care. Besides the house cleaning, the cooking and food shopping, I’ve just hired someone to handle the stack of papers from my desk, which I don’t have the where with all to handle. Social Security, taxes, insurance, banking is too much for my mind and words to respond to.”



While she’s glad to be out of the snow, “I don’t experience the paradise that Maui is called. I don’t leave my room much, don’t go to the beach, the waterfalls or to the top of [a] mountain,” she wrote, saying her health and money issues get in the way.
Lands has yet to receive any compensation from FEMA after the wildfire, according to her lawyer. That’s despite being the lead plaintiff in one of two lawsuits regarding “noneconomic” damages and despite filing her claim for all sorts of damages more than a year ago. 
“Ms. Lands has endured many hardships as a result of the fire and flooding, and they are ongoing,” Tosdal said. “She is not a wealthy person,  and she is no longer able to live on her family farm and provide for herself.”
NM fire victims find recourse in court after delays, inaction by Congress, FEMA

After Browning’s ruling, FEMA and the United States Attorney’s Office issued a “motion to correct” it, arguing the judge made significant errors in his legal analysis that concluded FEMA had erroneously excluded the payments. 
The lengthy “motion to correct” is not the same as an appeal, but plaintiffs’ lawyers have told Source they saw it as a precursor. FEMA’s January motion prompted a flurry of filings between plaintiffs and the government. 
About a month ago, according to Tom Tosdal, Ty’s father and another lawyer suing FEMA, Browning told the parties that he would be issuing a ruling on FEMA’s motion to correct “imminently” but that he was largely unmoved in his original conclusion that FEMA needs to pay “noneconomic damages.”
Once Browning issues his ruling, FEMA and federal prosecutors can then move to file an appeal in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Tom Tosdal said. That could delay “noneconomic” compensation for fire victims for two years, he said. 
A spokesperson for FEMA’s Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Claims Office sent an emailed statement to Source New Mexico on Friday morning that the office is “awaiting the release of the Court’s written decision.” In the meantime, it is continuing to compensate claimants for losses it has deemed compensable, including for lost property, reforestation and business losses, among other losses. 
“Claimants do not need to take any new action on their claims regarding non-economic damages with the navigators at the Claims Office,” according to the statement. “After the Agency receives the Court’s Opinion, FEMA will determine next steps and provide further information upon final resolution of the matter.”
In the scar of New Mexico’s largest wildfire, a legal battle is brewing over the cost of suffering

According to the office’s latest update on July 15, it has so far paid out $2.73 billion in nearly 20,000 claims. The amount it could be required to pay in “noneconomic” damages is hard to quantify, plaintiffs’ lawyers have said, but it could be about $545 million, or roughly 10% of the amount Congress awarded.
“The FEMA Claims Office remains committed to compensating New Mexicans who were impacted by the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon fire and subsequent cascading events in a fair manner to the maximum extent permissible by law,” according to the statement. 
The United States Attorney’s Office argues the case in court, with help from FEMA’s lawyers. A spokesperson for the office did not answer Source’s questions about whether it intends to appeal.
The fire victims’ lawyers have said the damages are a necessary piece of the full compensation Congress promised to victims. The payments could serve as lifelines to people who had little to their names before the fire but still saw their lives upended in the blaze, lawyers have said. 
Even though FEMA has not changed its policy to award noneconomic damages, a handful of clients have gotten them by taking their claims directly to Judge Browning. In early May, Browning spent a week and a half listening to about a dozen claimants stories about their experience of the fire and awarded them between $9,000 and $330,000, payments that included “noneconomic damages,” according to their lawyer, Brian Colón.
Tosdal told Source New Mexico on Thursday that he is considering doing the same for Lands, but he does not see individual cases going before Browning as a sustainable solution. It also means only fire victims who hired lawyers would get the compensation they’re owed, he said.

(Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)The Southern University System Board of Supervisors has named Louisiana Sen. Joe Bouie, D-New Orleans, as the next chancellor of its New Orleans campus, a position from which he was once fired. 
The board unanimously voted Friday to give Bouie the job, which will come with a $275,000 salary. Bouie will start in the position Aug. 1, and the contract runs through July 31, 2028. 
Bouie, 78, has served in the state Senate since 2020 and was in the Louisiana House from 2014-20. He is eligible to serve through the end of 2032 if re-elected.
“SUNO raised me. Actually, it saved my life,” Bouie, a SUNO graduate, said in comments to the board. “When you talk about the legacy of SUNO, you’re talking about access, you’re talking about academic excellence and success.”
Bouie has not yet responded to a request for comment as to whether he intends to leave his Senate seat. State law prohibits individuals from being employed or holding office in two separate branches of government, though some have held legislative seats and worked in higher education, which falls under the executive branch. State Rep. Barbara Carpenter, D-Baton Rouge, is currently the dean of international education at Southern University. 
Current Southern University at New Orleans Chancellor James Ammons did not publicly announce he was stepping down before the board meeting Friday and the faculty only heard of his departure about a week before. There was no search for his replacement, as is standard practice for top administrator positions across higher education in the United States.
“Some will say they should be a global search, but why do a search when you have the best person for the job?,” Rep. Jason Hughes, D-New Orleans, said in comments to the board in support of Bouie.
Ammons has not yet responded to a request for comment for this report.
Bouie, a social work professor, was previously the chancellor of the small historically Black university in the early 2000s, but was dismissed from the position in 2002. At the time, Bouie said he believed he was fired because he removed the wife of U.S. Rep. William Jefferson from a top administrative position at SUNO. 
“I was fired … because I refused to participate in political nepotism,” Bouie told the news outlet Diverse Issues in Higher Ed. 
Current Southern board chairman Tony Clayton, the district attorney for Iberville, Pointe Coupee, and West Baton Rouge parishes, was the board member that led the charge to have Bouie dismissed, according to multiple news outlets.
After being removed as chancellor, Bouie returned to his faculty position, later serving as SUNO Faculty Senate president. As a professor and faculty leader, Bouie was frequently critical of the administration and in 2012 called on the system president to remove Chancellor Victor Ukpolo for unethical behavior, dereliction of duty to protect SUNO’s accreditation and a slow response to repair Hurricane Katrina-related damage. 
Ukpolo stepped down from the chancellor position in 2016 after 10 years. Since then, a series of administrators has led the campus. Ammons has held the post since 2021. He held the position on an interim basis after Lisa Mims-Devezin requested her contract not be renewed just months after SUNO was placed on probation by its accreditor. 
While Bouie may continue to serve in the Senate, doing so while holding an intensive administrative job could prove difficult. Many legislators are only able to serve in the statehouse because of flexible job situations. For example, attorney-lawmakers are able to take advantage of legislative continuances to postpone court appearances to handle their legislative duties. 
One of Bouie’s Senate predecessors, Sen. Wesley Bishop, D-New Orleans, was the subject of a federal probe for payroll abuse after a Fox 8 News investigation showed Bishop had been paid for 122 days of sick leave at SUNO, where he was employed in a top administrative position, while attending legislative hearings in Baton Rouge. Bishop was replaced in the Senate by Sen. Jimmy Harris, D-New Orleans.

House Resolution 281, the Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2025, was introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, along with Montana’s two Republican congressmen, Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, and Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minnesota, also cosponsored the legislation.
Feds reject state petitions to delist grizzly bears, reaffirm protected status in Montana, Wyoming

The legislation directs the secretary of the Interior to remove the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population of grizzly bears from the Endangered Species Act, restoring a ruling by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued in 2017 during the first Trump administration.
That rule was later vacated by a federal circuit court, and the agency, under the Biden administration, reversed its stance and recommended the grizzly stay on the list, and under federal jurisdiction.
“The GYE grizzly population has exceeded the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s recovery goals for over two decades,” Hageman said during the committee’s markup hearing. “Since a mere 3% of species listed under the ESA have ever been delisted the ESA desperately needs a success story like the GYE grizzly bear. The grizzly is, in fact, the poster child for how the ESA has failed in terms of what it was intended to do and how it has actually been implemented.”

 House Democrats push back on delisting grizzly bears

But Democrats on the committee pushed back against the bill, arguing that the proposal amounted to a political football and could jeopardize the continued recovery of the species.
The court ruling that vacated the 2017 delisting rule cited the federal government’s “failure to consider long term genetic effects on other populations and concerns that the decision was driven by political pressure … instead of the best available science,” said ranking member Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California.
He said the decision continued the partisan game played with the Endangered Species Act, ignored consultation with Native American tribes on a culturally significant species, and removed public input from the process.
“To legislatively delist the population located around Yellowstone in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, from the ESA and then block judicial review, that is not going to lead us down the path of success,” Huffman added. “That’s going to lead us to some really unfortunate consequences.”
 Different ideas on how to manage grizzly bear populations

Grizzly bears throughout the contiguous states were listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975 when there were only an estimated 300 to 400 animals left in the wild. Currently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates there are roughly 2,314 grizzlies living between Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Washington.
During the last decade, a saga of proposed delisting actions, lawsuits and petitions have left the fate of grizzly bears overshadowed with questions.
Montana previously petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to delist the species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, centered around Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness, but the agency rejected the petition early this year. A similar petition from Wyoming was also rejected in the final weeks of the Biden administration.
Yellowstone grizzly managers — dispersed, reduced by DOGE — shine little light on delisting battle

Instead, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed a new comprehensive approach to federal grizzly management, including consolidating grizzlies living in six distinct recovery zones into a single population. That move would have prevented sub-populations, such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, from being considered for delisting separately from the species as a whole.
Montana officials derided that decision, with Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, saying the administration was embracing a “scorched earth strategy” in its final days. He added that he looked forward to working with the Trump administration on a new path forward.
Rep. Zinke shared similar sentiments at the time: “Thankfully the political hands pulling the strings at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are about to be fired and President Trump will no doubt immediately rescind this train-wreck decision.”
Zinke briefly served as Interior secretary during Trump’s first administration and was in office when the 2017 delisting was announced.
Zinke’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the committee’s vote on the 2025 rule or questions about preventing judicial review.
But Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines praised Tuesday’s vote in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that “delisting the grizzly bear is long overdue.”
 Conservationists remain concerned about grizzly populations, habitat

Ahead of the committee vote, more than 50 conservation organizations signed onto a letter urging representatives to vote against the legislation.
“The grizzly bear populations in those locations are stable and growing, but conservationists remain concerned about the geographic and genetic isolation of those populations, the threat of increased human-induced mortality through hunting or predator control if they were delisted and management returned to the states of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, and the effects of delisting particular populations on grizzly bears in the rest of the lower-48 states,” the letter states.

Chris Servheen, a retired Fish and Wildlife Service grizzly bear recovery coordinator who petitioned the federal government to consider managing grizzlies as a single population — the plan the agency put forth this year — said in a statement that the efforts to delist grizzlies by congressional actions ignored key components of the Endangered Species Act.
“The current administration and Congress are working to defund grizzly bear science and monitoring, dramatically reduce funding for federal land management agencies in grizzly range, increase timber harvest and road building in grizzly habitat, and weaken or eliminate the fundamental laws that grizzly recovery depends on like the ESA, the National Environmental Policy Act and the United States Forest Service Roadless Rule,” Servheen said. “At the same time, recreation pressure on public lands and private land development are accelerating rapidly in grizzly habitat putting even more stress on grizzlies. Congressional delisting while the cumulative impacts of these actions are ongoing is irresponsible and will result in immediate declines in grizzly numbers and range.”
During the committee discussion, Rep. Hageman hammered home her argument that the reason environmental groups and previous administrations had pushed to keep the grizzlies listed was for “controlling large swaths of land and water resources. It’s that simple.”
She said that both individual states, and the federal government, have limited resources to spend on issues like endangered species, and they should be allocated to where the need is highest.
“There are species that truly do need our protection and need the resources to be made available so that we can protect them and recover them,” she said. “When we are wasting money on a recovered species, those are resources that cannot be used for that purpose.”
 House Democrats propose bill amendments

Democrats proposed three amendments to the bill — one to require the Department of the Interior to follow the new 2025 species assessment issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service that considered all grizzlies in the lower 48 to be considered a single population; another to require more tribal consultation in management decisions for grizzlies; and a third that sought to strip out the prohibition on judicial review in the bill.
All three amendments failed on party-line votes.
On the discussion over judicial review, Hageman said the point of the bill is to carry out the purpose and intent of the Endangered Species Act, and removing the legal provision amounted to a “gift to the radical environmental lobby.”
“Until the bear has returned to state control where it belongs, lawsuits and ever shifting recovery standards will stand in the way activist judges have stood in the way of delisting for far too long,” she said.
Hageman added that when the grey wolf was delisted in 2011, during the Obama administration, a similar provision was put into that legislation.
The committee voted 20-19 along party lines to recommend approval by the full House of Representatives.
Huffman gave notice that he intended to file “dissenting or minority views,” on the measure for the full chamber.

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)Steve St. Juliana, the father of Hana St. Juliana, one of the students killed in the Oxford High School mass shooting, was given the green light to sue the state and the Michigan Department of State Police after the Court of Appeals overturned a lower court’s decision to dismiss the case.
In a unanimous decision of the state Court of Appeals in St. Juliana v. Michigan State Police, the panel reversed the Court of Claims’ decision to dismiss the case in March 2024. The lower court ruled that the complaint was not timely filed. 
The Court of Appeals decision, which was issued Thursday but released publicly Friday, ruled otherwise and remanded the case back to the Court of Claims, where the case can continue.
Steve St. Juliana initiated a wrongful death lawsuit against Michigan State Police after details emerged in a separate lawsuit filed by parents against the Oxford Community School District. Those proceedings brought to light information about tips to the OK2SAY tipline, which is facilitated by State Police. The tips involved information of a planned attack at the high school. One of the early tips was forwarded to Oxford High School administrators and the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
St. Juliana’s initial lawsuit claimed that the sheriff’s office determined there was no actual threat and did not take further action. 
In the days leading up to the attack, the shooter, who was 15 years old at the time, made social media posts about the weapon used in the shooting, which was given to him as a gift from his parents. Both he and his mother, Jennfier Crumbley, referenced the gun as a gift in social media posts.
Additional OK2SAY tips were received regarding those posts, with parents, students, staff and other community members expressing concern that there might soon be an attack at the school. Still, law enforcement and school administrators allegedly ignored those threats.
The grieving father sought damages from the state, asserting State Police did not fulfill its duty to address the escalating tips and threats of violence in the leadup to the attack. The lawsuit noted that St. Juliana only became aware of those tips as they emerged in a separate legal battle with the school district.
A notice of intent to sue was filed with the Court of Claims in September 2022, within six months of discovering the tips to State Police.
Attorneys for the state and the department, however, filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that St. Juliana hadn’t complied with the Court of Claims Act’s rule necessitating a lawsuit be filed within six months of Hana St. Juliana’s death.
Court of Claims Judge James Redford dismissed the case on March 6, 2024, noting that Steve St. Juliana’s lawsuit was filed two years after he was appointed as the representative of his daughter’s estate.
Upon appeal, Steve St. Juliana asserted that the Court of Claims erred because a provision in the Revised Judicature Act of 1961 involving wrongful-death savings rendered his complaint as timely filed.
In the 3-0 Court of Appeals decision issued Thursday from Judge Kathleen Feeney, Judge Stephen Borrello and Judge Anica Letica, the court found that the savings provision was intended to safeguard plaintiffs’ rights in wrongful-death actions, particularly when confronting statutory deadlines like those in the Court of Claims Act.
The court further concluded that the provision extended the filing time frame but also adjusted the statutory notice period.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-23-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-18 12:56:53.644943
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-18 16:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Indicted Jackson prosecutor’s latest campaign finance report rife with errors,"Caleb Bedillion, The Marshall Project and Anna Wolfe",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/18/indicted-jackson-prosecutors-latest-campaign-finance-report-rife-with-errors/,The indicted prosecutor's recent campaign finance disclosure reflects a pair of transactions that correspond with key details in the government’s allegation that he took money from undercover informants to pay off a local official’s debt.,"Tangled finances, thousands in personal loans and a political contribution from a supposed investor group made up of undercover FBI informants — this was all contained in a months-late campaign finance report from Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens. 
Owens, a second-term Democrat in Mississippi’s capital city region, is fighting federal bribery charges, to which he’s pleaded not guilty. At the same time, his recent campaign finance disclosure reflects a pair of transactions that correspond with key details in the government’s allegation that Owens took money from undercover informants to pay off a local official’s debt.
Regarding payments from Facility Solutions Team — the company name used in the FBI sting — to former Jackson City Councilwoman Angelique Lee, Owens allegedly stated the need to “clean it out,” according to the indictment, which was unsealed in November.
“[L]ike we always do, we’ll put it in a campaign account, or directly wire it,” he said, the indictment claims. “[T]hat’s the only way I want the paper trail to look.”
Agents recorded hundreds of hours of conversations with Owens and other officials, and after his arraignment last year, Owens responded to the charges, saying, “The cherry-picked statements of drunken locker room banter is not a crime.”
Throughout 2024, a non-election year during which federal authorities allege Owens funneled thousands of dollars in bribes to Jackson’s city officials, Owens loaned his campaign more than $20,000, according to his campaign committee’s finance report. He’d won reelection in late 2023.
Owens and his attorneys did not respond to questions about his campaign finance report.
Owens’ report, filed May 30 – months late and riddled with errors – is the latest example of how Mississippi politicians can ignore the state’s campaign finance transparency laws while avoiding meaningful consequences. It’s a lax legal environment that has led to late and illegible reports, untraceable out-of-state money that defied contribution limits, and, according to federal authorities, public corruption with campaign finance accounts serving as piggy banks. 
Enforcement duties are divided among many government bodies, including the Mississippi Ethics Commission. The commission’s executive director, Tom Hood, has long complained that the state’s campaign finance laws are confusing and ineffective.
“It’s just a mess,” Hood said.
Owens filed the annual report months past the Jan. 31 deadline, after reporting from The Marshall Project – Jackson revealed he had failed to do so. He paid a $500 fine in April.
He was also late filing in previous years, paying fines in some years and failing to pay the penalties in other years, according to records provided by the Ethics Commission.
The report, which Owens signed, is full of omissions or miscalculations, with no way to tell which is which. The cover sheet of the report provides the total amount of itemized contributions and disbursements for the year — $44,000 in and $36,500 out. But the body of the report lists the line-by-line itemizations for each, and when the Marshall Project – Jackson and Mississippi Today summed the individual itemizations, the totals didn’t match those on the cover sheet.
Based on the itemized spending detailed in the body of the report, Owens’ campaign should have thousands more in cash on hand than reported. In the report’s cover sheet, Owens also reported that he received more in itemized contributions during the year than he received in total contributions, which would be impossible to do.
While the secretary of state receives and maintains campaign finance reports, it has no obligation to review the reports and no authority to investigate their accuracy. Under state law, willfully filing a false campaign finance report is a misdemeanor. Charges, however, are rare.
Owens is the only local official in the federal bribery probe — which is set to go to trial next summer — who remains in office. The government alleged that Owens accepted $125,000 to split between him and two associates in late 2023 from a group of men he believed were vying for a development project in downtown Jackson. Owens accepted several thousand dollars more to funnel to public officials for their support of the project, the indictment alleges. The use of campaign accounts was an important feature of the alleged scheme, according to the indictment.
Owens divvied up $50,000 from Facility Solutions Team, or FST, into checks from various individuals or companies — allegedly meant to conceal the bribe — to former Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba’s reelection campaign, the indictment charged. 
Lumumba accepted the checks during a sunset cruise on a yacht in South Florida, the indictment alleged. His campaign finance report, filed earlier this year, reflected five $10,000 contributions near the date of the trip, with no mention of FST.
Lumumba, who lost reelection in April, has pleaded not guilty. 
While the indictment accused Owens of saying that public officials use campaign accounts to finance their personal lives, state law prohibits the use of political contributions for personal use. 
The indictment alleges Owens accepted $60,000 — some for the purpose of funneling to local politicians — from the men representing themselves as FST in the backroom of Owens’ cigar bar on Feb. 13, 2024. On his campaign finance report, he listed a $12,500 campaign contribution from FST two days later, the same day the indictment alleges he paid off $10,000 of former Councilwoman Lee’s campaign debt. Lee pleaded guilty to charges related to the alleged bribery scheme in 2024. 
Also on Feb. 15, 2024, the campaign finance report Owens filed shows a $10,000 payment to 1Vision, a printing company that used to go by the name A2Z Printing, for the purpose of “debt retirement.” Lee had her city paycheck garnished starting in 2023 to pay off debts to A2Z Printing, according to media reports. No mention of Lee was made in the campaign finance report filed by Owens. The printing company did not respond to requests for comment.
Campaigns are allowed to contribute money to other campaigns or political action committees. If Owens’ committee used campaign funds to pay off debt owed by Lee’s campaign, the transaction should have been structured as a contribution to Lee’s campaign and reported as such by both campaigns, said Sam Begley, a Jackson-based attorney and election law expert who has advised candidates about their financial disclosures.
The alleged debt payoff on behalf of Lee is not the first time Owens has described transactions on his campaign finance filings in ways that may obscure how his campaign is spending money. Confusing or unclear descriptions of spending activity are common on campaign finance reports across the state.
Owens previously reported that in 2023, he paid $1,275 to a staff member in the district attorney’s office who also worked on his campaign. The payment was labeled a reimbursement, which Owens explained in a May email to The Marshall Project – Jackson was for expenditures this person made on behalf of the campaign, “such as meals for volunteers/workers, evening/weekend canvassers, and election day workers.”
State law requires campaigns to itemize all contributions and expenses over $200. Begley said he believes Owens’ committee should have itemized any payments over $200 made by anyone on behalf of the campaign. 
Upfront payments, with the expectation of repayment by the campaign, might also be considered a loan, according to a spokesperson for the secretary of state. Campaigns are barred from spending money to repay undocumented loans.
The state Ethics Commission has addressed undocumented loan repayments in several opinions, outlining the required documentation to make repayments legal.
Since 2018, the Ethics Commission has had the power to issue advisory opinions upon request to help candidates and campaigns sort through laws that Hood, the commission’s executive director, said aren’t always clear.
The commission has issued just six opinions in seven years.
“I was surprised in the first few years that there weren’t more,” Hood said. “But now it seems to be clear that for whatever reason, most people don’t think they need advice.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/18083932/MT-JodyOwens-CampaignFinance-FeatImage-04.jpg,,,2025-07-18 12:56:53.644943
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-18 15:59:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,The Open at Royal Portrush evokes Irish memories,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/18/the-open-royal-portrush/,Column: The Open is being played this week in Northern Ireland at a golf course known as Royal Portrush. A more appropriate name would be Hell on Earth.,"Don’t know about you, but I spent most of Thursday — from well before dawn until mid-afternoon — watching The Open, played this week in Northern Ireland at a golf course known as Royal Portrush.
A more appropriate name for the par-71, 7,300-yard course would be Hell on Earth. Wind, rain, the rugged terrain, narrow fairways, dense, unforgiving rough, deep bunkers and severely undulating greens combine to make the course about as difficult as any imaginable.


One hundred and fifty six of the most accomplished golfers in the world competed Thursday. The golf course was the clear winner. Only 32 — about one in five — broke par. Three did not break 80. Hattiesburg native Davis Riley, an incredibly gifted golfer and the only native Mississippian in the field, shot 77. Brooks Koepka and Colin Morikawa, winners of seven major championships between them, each shot 75.
What would your average 12-handicapper shoot at Royal Portrush? He or she would not break 120. Hell, he or she might not finish.
I write from some experience. Eight years ago, I joined a group of eight Mississippians on a golfing tour of Ireland. We played seven world class golf courses in nine days, six in Ireland and one in Northern Ireland. All were links courses, abutting either the Irish Sea or the Atlantic Ocean. All were brutally hard. Yours truly became all too familiar with a prickly vegetation called gorse, which ate several of my golf balls over the course of nine days.
The hardest of all the courses was the one in Northern Ireland: Royal County Down, just across the border from Ireland in a little village called New Castle. Apparently, an age-old argument in Northern Ireland rages over which course is hardest of all: Royal County Down or Royal Portrush. Most experts side with Royal County Down. My take: Royal County Down is far and away the most difficult golf course I have ever played, and we played it from the member tees (6,400 yards) not the championship tees (about 7,200).
When our two foursomes headed to the first tee at RCD, we decided to have some fun with the starter. When it was our turn to play, we went to the back of the championship tee. 
“What’s the course record?” I asked the starter.
“From those tees?” he asked back, appearing rather astonished. “Sir, you should not play those tees. The course record from the championship tees is 70. Rory McIlroy shot that. But last time Rory played here, he shot 80.”
We immediately marched up to the forward tees. “Any other advice?” I asked the starter, who replied, “Steer clear of the bunkers, my friend. They are very deep and they will break your heart.”

They absolutely did. I must admit my main concern often wasn’t whether or not I could launch my ball out of those bunkers; no, it was whether or not I could climb back out of the bunkers myself. They were that deep – and they were often hidden from sight until, after a search, you located your ball in one. All sand traps have rakes; these needed ladders.
At Royal County Down, about 90 miles south of Royal Portrush, we seemingly experienced all four seasons during one 18-hole round. We were alternately cold, warm, dry, wet, dry and wet again. We changed in our and out of rain suits and sweaters so often we could have used a changing room. And, all the while, the relentless wind blew and blew and blew.
“Is the wind aways like this?” I asked a course ranger at one point after my cap had blown off for what seemed like the 20th time.
“Ah, lad, ’tis but a breeze today,” the ranger said. 
It reached the point that we Mississippians would make our double and triple bogeys, head for the next tee, survey the situation and say, “Ah, lads, what fresh hell have we here?”
Nothing in Mississippi prepares you for links golf. In America, we refer to any golf course as “links” — as in, let’s go hit the links. We are in error. Links comes from the Anglo-Saxon word “hlinc,” which means a ridge. It evolved to refer to the rough, grassy area between the land and the sea. And, yes, there are often ridges and dunes involved. Trees are scarce and sometimes just plain absent. Said McIlroy of Northern Ireland’s rugged terrain, “Many have tried to replicate our bunkers, but it is impossible for man to replicate creations of nature.”

The other six Irish courses we played – Waterville, Tralee, Ballybunion, Old Head, The European and Portmarnock – were all links courses and all really, really hard. None was as brutally difficult as Royal County Down.
And yes, there were times we asked ourselves: “Why did we pay all that money to put ourselves through this wringer?” But then you would hit that one shot, the soaring 5-iron with the wind that left you an eagle putt. That, or you would stop and gaze at one of those amazing vistas over the Atlantic Ocean or the Irish Sea. Or you and your partners would sit in the 19th hole recounting the round over tall pints of Guinness, telling fresh stories and laughing like school kids. 
The famous English golf writer Bernard Darwin called it the kind of golf people play only in their most ecstatic dreams. Yes, but your score, if you can count that high, is often a nightmare.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/18105527/AP25198422714429.jpg,,,2025-07-18 12:56:53.644943

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.











We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association



Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-18 15:51:38+00:00,CT Mirror,What CT school districts would feel federal cuts the most?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/18/ct-school-districts-education-funding-cuts/,"If nothing changes, $53.6 million in federal funds would be withheld from Connecticut schools, disproportionately affecting high-needs areas.","Connecticut is one of 26 states suing the Trump administration over a nearly $7 billion federal education funding freeze; if nothing changes, $53.6 million would be withheld from Connecticut schools, disproportionately affecting high-needs areas. 
The freeze, announced just one day before the funds would have become available for obligation, affects federal grants supporting K-12 students through before- and after-school programs and instruction improvement, and funding for adult literacy programs. Two of the affected K-12 grants support English language learners and migrant students.
Under the freeze, Hartford, New Haven and Waterbury are estimated to lose around $3 million each in federal funding, according to the School and State Finance Project. Bridgeport would lose the most funding — around $3.8 million. 
Michael Morton is deputy executive director of communications at the School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy organization working toward equitable education funding statewide. While the freeze does not target federal funding like the Title I grants for low-income students or IDEA grants for students with disabilities, Morton said high-needs students will still be hit hardest by the freeze.
“We’re talking about multilingual learners. We’re talking about students with special needs. In some instances, we’re talking about community organizations that work with underprivileged or disengaged youth,” Morton said. “It’s taking a situation that is already not good and just exacerbating it.”
Many members of Congress also oppose the freeze. Ten Senate Republicans signed a July 16 letter to Russell Vought, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, urging for the release of funds despite claims from the administration that the money funds a radical left-wing agenda.
“We share your concern about taxpayer money going to fund radical left-wing programs,” the letter read. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.”
In a July 10 letter to Vought and Linda McMahon, the secretary of the Department of Education, 150 House Democrats, including four of the five Connecticut representatives, signed the letter requesting release of the “illegally” withheld funds. 
“This unnecessary delay of education funding, which accounts for at least 10 percent of federal K-12 funding in every state, is alarming parents, local elected officials, and education agencies,” reads the letter. “It is disrupting school and district planning, jeopardizing the education of millions of students, and is already resulting in layoffs as well as program delays and cancellations.”
Morton said that, even if the funding is restored, “the damage will already be done.” 
“Districts will have to cut or stop programs or let individuals go because this grant funding is not there, and they don’t know when it will be there,” Morton said. “If it ever will be.”
The funding freeze came just before the Supreme Court decision allowing President Donald Trump to continue with his plan to dismantle the Department of Education, beginning with the layoffs of well over 1,000 employees.
According to the lawsuit, the Education Department sent an email to states on June 30 warning of the cuts.
“Given the change in Administrations, the Department is reviewing the FY 2025 funding for the [Title I-C, II-A, III-A, IV-A, IV-B] grant program(s), and decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year,” the email reads. “Accordingly, the Department will not be issuing Grant Award Notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review. The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NoF4Q-which-districts-are-losing-the-most-federal-funding--1024x813.png,,,2025-07-18 11:58:27.189478

(Photo provided by ACLU of SC)A former Iowan who spent more than two years in prison over her disruptive behavior and comments to police during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in South Carolina asked the U.S. Supreme Court this week to review her case, raising questions about free speech.
A Sumter, S.C., jury convicted Brittany Martin in May 2022 of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner for her role in the multi-day protests that broke out in South Carolina and across the nation two years earlier following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of police in Minneapolis.
Unlike protests in Columbia and Charleston, where police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as some protesters threw rocks, fired guns, burned police cars, assaulted people and looted businesses, there were no reports of property damage or injuries in Sumter as a group of about 20 people turned out in front of the police station to demonstrate.
Still, Circuit Court Judge Kirk Griffin sentenced Martin to four years in prison, a heavier sentence than those handed down to the majority of people convicted across the Palmetto State, often for violent or destructive acts, according to a review of cases.
A question of free speech
The American Civil Liberties Union, which took on Martin’s case in 2023, argues that the hefty sentence infringes on the mother of five’s First Amendment rights and chills free speech. She petitioned the nation’s highest court this week to take up her case after South Carolina’s Court of Appeals, in a procedural matter, refused to consider First Amendment arguments, ruling her lawyer had not properly raised them during the lower court trial.
Martin was released from prison on Nov. 27, 2024, after serving 2 ½ years of her 4-year sentence. The 37-year-old is living in Mt. Vernon, Illinois. She declined an interview on advice of her attorneys.

Now she and her lawyers are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify that procedural rules — like the one invoked by the state Appeals Court — cannot excuse state appellate courts from “conducting the careful, independent review that the Supreme Court has long required in First Amendment cases,” the ACLU wrote in a statement.
“In 1963, the Supreme Court stepped in to protect the First Amendment rights of Black civil rights protesters who were prosecuted and convicted in South Carolina for the same offense, for doing what Brittany Martin did in 2020,” said ACLU legal director Cecillia Wang. “It’s time for the Supreme Court to reinforce the courts’ role in protecting freedom of speech.”
The landmark case Wang is referring to is Edwards v. South Carolina. In that case, police arrested about 200 students protesting segregation while they marched around the Statehouse, carrying signs and singing hymns. Prosecutors charged them with disturbing the peace.
“I am praying that this case be overturned. This is a battle to exercise and uphold our constitutional rights,” Martin said in a statement. “They’ve got to give us some justice and let us know that we still have our First Amendment right to freedom of speech in this country. My case would be the perfect example of that.”
The protest
Martin moved with her four younger children to Sumter from Iowa in spring 2020. When protests broke out in May of that year, Martin joined in. She told The Associated Press she still grieved the death of her brother-in-law, who was shot 19 times by Sumter police in 2016 after officers said he fired a gun after a stolen car chase.
As the protest stretched out over about five days, the city implemented a curfew. Police arrested Martin and eight others for what prosecutors said was disruptive behavior.
In addition to breaching the peace, Martin faced charges of inciting a riot and threatening police.
In court, prosecutors showed police body camera recordings of Martin. She is not seen touching officers with her hands but she does make statements such as: “Some of us gon’ be hurting and some of y’all gon’ be hurting” and “We ready to die for this. We tired of it. You better be ready to die for the blue. I’m ready to die for the Black.”
News photos of those demonstrations also showed Martin standing chest to chest with officers and shouting in their face.
The jury acquitted Martin of the riot charge and reached no verdict on whether she threatened officers’ lives. She was found guilty of breaching the peace, a crime that is typically a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a $500 fine and 30 days in jail. But prosecutors elevated the charge to a “high and aggravated” crime, which carries up to 10 years imprisonment.
South Carolina case law defines breach of the peace as “a violation of public order, a disturbance of the public tranquility, by any act or conduct inciting to violence.” What makes it “high and aggravated” is more open to interpretation, the South Carolina branch of the ACLU argued in court documents.
High and aggravated
The state’s most high-profile case involved an intoxicated University of Alabama football fan who punched a University of South Carolina fan, knocking him unconscious after a football game in 2010 at Williams-Brice Stadium. The man died after the driver of a vehicle unknowingly ran him over in the bumper-to-bumper traffic. A judge sentenced the Alabama fan to three years in prison with the rest of his 10-year sentence suspended.
Many bystanders in the gameday crowd witnessed the man’s disturbing death and SC Appeals Court judges ruled that the event, the distress it caused to so many, and the public upheaval that followed “exemplify the type of behavior constituting an aggravated breach of the peace.”
Prosecutors in Martin’s case argued Martin and other Black Lives Matter protesters trespassed and disrupted businesses and traffic for days along the busy street in downtown Sumter where the police station is located.
Civil rights attorney and former state Rep. Bakari Sellers unsuccessfully sought to get Martin’s sentence reduced. The judge, in his ruling, pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions across multiple states, including shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun, as contributing to the length of her sentence. The ACLU did not have details of those convictions.
In November 2020, a judge also sentenced Martin to seven years of probation for willful intent to injure and leaving a crime scene during a family dispute in Iowa, where more than a year earlier her teenage son had accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away.
Martin had been on probation at least six times, according to court filings.
“Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Judge Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”
The ACLU disagreed and attempted to appeal the case further. While Martin is now out of prison, spokesman Paul Bowers said it is still important to clear Martin’s name and prevent such sentences from happening in the future.
The group waits to hear whether the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the case.
Other cases
Beyond Martin’s, other Black Lives Matter protest-related cases in the state continue to make their way through the courts.
Most recently, two Midlands men — Brandon Jemar Pickett, 38, and Luis Rosario, 29, both of Columbia — were sentenced in federal court last month for crimes committed during protests held in Columbia.
The May 30, 2020, protest started peacefully at the Statehouse but turned violent as protesters marched to the Columbia Police Department. After some protesters started throwing things, setting fire to police cars, and in a couple cases, assaulting people, the city implemented a curfew. Police in riot gear used tear gas and an armored vehicle to push protesters away from the police station and into the Vista entertainment district. Protesters shattered windows and broke into several businesses along the way, stealing bottles of liquor.
The judge sentenced Pickett to four years in federal prison for throwing a rock at a police officer, chipping the officer’s tibia. Rosario was sentenced to a year in prison for throwing water bottles and a wooden barricade, which hit an officer in the head, requiring seven stitches.
Federal and state prosecutors have secured convictions or plea deals with about a quarter of the roughly 100 people arrested in Columbia, according to a review of court records. Meanwhile, 62 of those charged saw cases dismissed, mostly those involving curfew violations.
Sixteen cases are still pending.
All eight adults arrested and charged in Sumter pleaded guilty or were convicted for mostly minor offenses, receiving mostly fines or 30-day sentences.
And in Charleston, where people looted and burned businesses up and down King Street, 26 people have been convicted, according to the solicitor’s office, out of 82 arrests reported by police. Nearly 30 cases involving curfew violations were dismissed back in 2020. Two cases remain pending, according to court documents.
It is unclear whether the remaining arrests were ever prosecuted. Charleston police could not immediately provide a list of names to be checked against court records.
The toughest sentences, besides Martin’s, was Pickett’s and the one handed down to Shabazz Akeem Isiah Watson, of St. Stephen. He was sentenced to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty to arson for setting fires at multiple Charleston businesses.
Those in Columbia who faced charges similar to Martin’s were given a $200 fine or 30 days in prison.

Read this story in English.
Por segundo año consecutivo, los legisladores de Connecticut decidieron no regular la inteligencia artificial (IA) para las empresas, pero sí aprobaron una ley que penaliza la pornografía vengativa “deepfake” o “falsificación profunda” y proporciona fondos educativos para la inteligencia artificial.
Un proyecto de ley que habría obligado a las empresas a revelar públicamente el uso de IA fue aprobado por el Senado, pero no fue retomado por la Cámara de Representantes después de que el Gobernador Ned Lamont amenazara con vetar la medida. El expresó su preocupación de que perjudicara al sector tecnológico de Connecticut.
A continuación, les presentamos lo que debe saber sobre los proyectos de ley de IA de esta sesión, su situación y cómo se comparan con las leyes de otros estados.
¿Qué proyectos de ley de IA se convirtieron en ley este año?
La mayor parte de la legislación sobre IA promulgada en esta sesión se incluyó en el proyecto de ley del presupuesto, que autorizó $500,000 para la academia de IA en línea de Connecticut, $25,000 para capacitación en IA en el Boys and Girls Club de Milford y $75,000 para tres programas piloto de capacitación en IA de Boys and Girls Clubs en el estado.
También tipificó como delito la difusión de pornografía de venganza “creada artificialmente” a partir del 1 de octubre de 2025. La ley no menciona directamente las imágenes creadas con IA, pero los legisladores buscan abordar el problema de las falsificaciones profundas de pornografía de venganza creada con IA. La ley también podría aplicarse a otras técnicas de creación de imágenes. Penaliza compartir dichas imágenes sin el consentimiento de la persona representada.
Y la nueva legislación sobre privacidad, el Proyecto de Ley 1295 del Senado, exige a quienes recopilan datos sensibles que notifiquen a los consumidores si sus datos personales se utilizarán para entrenar modelos lingüísticos extensos.
También otorga a los consumidores el derecho a optar por no participar en sistemas automatizados, que podrían incluir IA, para evitar que utilicen sus datos personales para tomar decisiones importantes sobre vivienda, seguros, atención médica, educación, justicia penal y empleo. Otorga a los consumidores el derecho a cuestionar las decisiones tomadas con sistemas de decisión automatizados y, si se trata de vivienda, a corregir cualquier información inexacta antes de que se evalúe la decisión.
¿Qué no se aprobó?
El Proyecto de Ley Senatorial 2, una medida que habría obligado a las empresas a divulgar públicamente el uso de IA a los consumidores, fue aprobado por el Senado, pero no se sometió a votación en la Cámara de Representantes al final del periodo de sesiones. Enmiendas de última hora suavizaron los requisitos iniciales de elaborar evaluaciones de impacto anuales y mitigar la discriminación algorítmica, en un intento de hacer el proyecto de ley más aceptable para el gobernador.
Este es el segundo año que este tipo de regulación empresarial de IA se aprueba en el Senado, y al igual que el año pasado, el presidente de la Cámara de Representantes, Matt Ritter, Demócrata por Hartford, se negó a llevarlo al pleno de la Cámara después de que Lamont amenazara con vetarlo.
Otra legislación, el Proyecto de Ley Senatorial 1484, que buscaba prevenir la discriminación algorítmica contra los empleados y exigir la divulgación del papel de la IA en la evaluación de los empleados, fue aprobada por el Comité Judicial, pero no progresó en el proceso legislativo.
¿Por qué Lamont amenazó con vetar el Proyecto de Ley Senatorial 2?
Este es el tercer año que el Senador James Maroney, Demócrata por Milford, presenta un proyecto de ley sobre IA. El primero, que exigía la divulgación del uso de IA por parte del gobierno de Connecticut, fue aprobado sin problemas por el Senado y la Cámara de Representantes antes de ser promulgado por Lamont en 2023.
Si bien Maroney logró el apoyo de líderes clave del Senado, como el presidente pro tempore del Senado, Martin M. Looney, Demócrata por New Haven, y el líder de la mayoría del Senado, Bob Duff, Demócrata por Norwalk, para la S.B. 2, no logró convencer a Lamont.
El gobernador ha disuadido a los legisladores de aprobar regulaciones de IA que, en su opinión, podrían ahuyentar a las empresas de Connecticut.
“El Gobernador sigue preocupado por la rápida evolución de este sector y por la necesidad de asegurarnos de hacerlo bien y no obstaculizar la innovación”, declaró la oficina de Lamont en 2024 sobre un proyecto de ley similar.
Este año, el director de innovación de Lamont, Dan O’Keefe, declaró que la S.B. La Proposición 2 enviaría un mensaje que dice: “Como aún no entendemos esto, no se puede innovar aquí. No se pueden tomar riesgos aquí”.
O’Keefe también expresó su preocupación por la prematura aprobación de dicha legislación en Connecticut y por qué un estado con el 1% de la población estadounidense no debería estar entre los primeros del país en aprobar la regulación de la IA.
Los Senadores John Kissel, Republicano por Enfield, Paul Cicarella, Republicano por North Haven, y Melissa Osborne, Demócrata por Simsbury, quienes se manifestaron en contra del proyecto de ley cuando se sometió a votación en el Comité Judicial, coincidieron con las preocupaciones de O’Keefe. Kissel también mencionó el apoyo de la administración Trump a la tecnología de IA como razón para no aprobar un proyecto de ley regulatorio ahora.
¿Cuáles son las leyes de IA en otros estados?
Varios estados han aprobado leyes de IA en los últimos dos años. Colorado se convirtió en el primer estado en exigir a las empresas la divulgación de sus sistemas de inteligencia artificial y en tipificar como ilegal la discriminación por IA de grupos protegidos en 2024, similar a los objetivos de la ley S.B. 2 de Connecticut.
Utah aprobó una ley en 2024 que exige la divulgación proactiva del uso de IA en ocupaciones reguladas. California y Texas también han aprobado leyes regulatorias para el sector privado.
Connecticut se une a New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts y otros estados en la criminalización de la pornografía de venganza “deepfake”. La ley de New Hampshire va un paso más allá al prohibir cualquier tipo de “deepfake” o “falsificación profunda” que perjudique la reputación, incluyendo las de candidatos políticos.
Los estados han introducido diversos aspectos de la legislación sobre IA, pero no han logrado aprobarse en diferentes etapas del sistema. Una ley con objetivos similares a la S.B. 2 de Connecticut se aprobó en Virginia, pero fue vetada por el Gobernador Glenn Youngkin.
¿Qué hay de la ley federal sobre IA?
Trump firmó la Ley “Take It Down” en mayo, que criminaliza la pornografía “deepfake” a nivel federal.
El proyecto de ley de reconciliación presupuestaria federal, también conocido como el “Gran y Hermoso Proyecto de Ley “, aprobado a principios de este mes, contenía inicialmente una prohibición, respaldada por Trump, para que los estados aplicaran y promulgaran leyes sobre IA durante 10 años. Horas antes de la aprobación del proyecto de ley, los senadores votaron 99 a 1 para eliminar la prohibición.
Queda en manos de los estados trazar su propio camino.

Laura Kelly at a rally for state Democrats on May 29, 2025, in Topeka. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and 17 other democratic governors signed a letter addressed to U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, demanding the relinquishment of nearly $7 billion in school funds.
The U.S. Department of Education told states in June that it intends to delay payments for several federally funded programs while they are under review, resulting in nearly $43 million in delayed payments and a pervasive uncertainty for Kansas schools.
The governors said the decision has “no justification” and creates “unnecessary chaos.”
“This delay is not a matter of administrative discretion,” the letter said. “It is a failure to fulfill the Department’s most basic responsibility to implement the law and distribute Congressionally-appropriated funding.”
Under normal circumstances, the Kansas State Department of Education would have received word by July 1 that federal funds would be trickling down to states for the upcoming school year, said Randy Watson, the state education commissioner, in a July 8 statement. Instead, late in the day on June 30, which also happened to be the final day of the fiscal year, the federal department told Watson the funding wasn’t coming through.
Watson said he was particularly worried about rural schools.
He said that rural school districts will be acutely affected by delays, most significantly by a $15.8 million payment for professional development efforts for educators and administrators and a $8.3 million payment aimed at improving student support and achievement outcomes. Most rural schools are allowed flexibility to spend the dollars from those programs at their discretion.
“We don’t know when the review of these and other programs will be completed or if we will receive the already approved funding,” Watson said.
He said he had no information on a timeline for when funds could be released, if at all. He advised school districts to plan accordingly.
Additional delays included $6.2 million for migrant education, $4.8 million for English language learners and $7.8 million for before- and after-school programs.
Migrant education focuses on supporting students whose families have seasonal jobs that require them to move to different areas, like fishery or food processing jobs.
English language learners are the fastest-growing population of public school students in Kansas, the department said, and school districts are required under civil rights law to ensure English language learners have the same access to education as their English-speaking peers. In the 2023-2024 school year, 9.4% of the nearly 480,000 students in Kansas public schools were English language learners, said Denise Kahler, a spokeswoman for the state education department.
Federal funding for before- and after-school programs often benefits low-performing or low-income schools, offering services to help students meet academic outcomes and involve families in their students’ educations.
In a separate communication, Watson discovered that the adult basic education and literacy programs, which are administered by the Kansas Board of Regents, were also put on pause by the federal education department.
Kelly, who is also the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the Trump administration’s decision to withhold funding harms students and schools.
“This funding is essential to support student learning, teacher training and preparation, and afterschool programs that working parents rely on, especially in rural areas,” she said. “At a time when teachers should be focused on the upcoming school year, the presidential administration’s failure to release Congressionally appropriated funds undermines our shared responsibility to provide every student with a world-class education.”
State agencies have taken major hits under the Trump administration’s directives to cut costs and to gut programs associated with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The federal education department froze more than $22 million in funds earlier this year, which were eventually released.
Amid the fiscal uncertainty, university presidents, state board of education members and state legislators are all set to see increased salaries.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/laurakelly2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-18 11:58:27.189478

You can read more about the section here.


My parents were born in 1945 Tylertown in southwest Mississippi. Despite being raised in rural homes where overt racism was served up as often as turnip greens or buttermilk biscuits, Dad and Mom refused to pass down to their children the generations-old heirlooms of animus and fear. No racist jokes. No slurs. No stray remarks about knowing one’s place and no lamentations about lost traditions or unwelcome changes. And whom do I have to thank for this gift that changed the trajectory of my life?  Uncle Sam and the United States Air Force.
As it did for so many young men from small farms in far-flung rural counties, the military and ROTC provided Dad with a pathway to college and a career after graduation.
Upon graduating from Ole Miss in 1967 with an obligation of active-duty military service (and a two-week-old baby, me), the Air Force sent my father to Texas A&M to obtain a master’s degree in computer science and start down the road toward becoming a military officer. When he left College Station, the next stop was officer training school.
An important thing happened during that period between completing his formal education and being sent off to Vietnam. The Air Force confronted Dad with the hard truth about racism in our country and our military – and they made it crystal clear that it would not be tolerated from Air Force officers.
More times than I can count, Dad has told me the story of a crusty officer barking out, “In the United States Air Force, there is no white, there is no black, there is only Air Force blue!” That same officer told Dad and other young officers from the South that their particular brand of prejudice might be quickly cured by a glimpse at the scores from IQ tests administered to all in attendance.

And as Dad moved through the mandatory “race relations” component of his training, another important thing happened. He got to know the Black officers from his squadron. He ate meals with them. He learned to play handball with them. He figured out that they wanted the same things he did.
As Dad puts it, “They just wanted to marry a pretty girl, get promoted, drink a cold beer once in a while, and maybe take a decent vacation.”
Dad didn’t like everything they said to him in that class, and he admits that he sometimes got angry. But on the handful of occasions when I have discussed with him how it came to be that he and Mom ended the cycle of overt racism in our family, he consistently has credited the fact that the Air Force told him hard truths about who he was and afforded him the opportunity to discover the painful reality that what he was told around the dinner table in Tylertown was a source of pain and oppression for those new friends about whom he cared deeply – and with whom he shared table as an adult soldier.
The training Dad experienced was part of a national effort in the late 1960s and early 70s to address racial division and inequality in our military. On March 5, 1971, the secretary of Defense announced that the effort would be expanded to require every member of the armed forces to attend classes in race relations.
As part of that historic effort, the Defense Race Relations Institute trained 1,400 race relations instructors in a single year. According to the New York Times, a bibliography of “100 of the most important works on the Black man in America” was contributed to the Institute in hopes of educating soldiers on the challenges confronting our country.
As a direct beneficiary of that historic effort, I am deeply disturbed by the fact that the difficult and important lessons the United States Air Force taught my father would be illegal today, 55 years later, if presented in any Mississippi school or university.
Mississippi’s new anti-DEI law prohibits requiring “diversity training” in our schools and universities and defines that term as “any formal or informal education, seminars, workshops or institutional program that focus on increasing awareness or understanding of issues related to race, sex, color, gender identity, sexual orientation or national origin.” (Emphasis added by me).  
In a world where we still are plagued by bias and racism, and at a time when we remain deeply and violently divided, Mississippi politicians have outlawed efforts to increase awareness and understanding of issues that are as complicated today as they were when I was a young boy. They have made illegal conversations and lessons that our armed forces – not Harvard University or the University of Virginia – deemed central to the security, morale and identity of our nation.
Sticking our heads in the sand, or elsewhere, and “protecting” our children from our painful and violent past does them, and Mississippi, no good. It shortchanges and underestimates young people who are fully capable of talking about hard things, fosters the stereotype of Mississippi as a place where ignorance and injustice flourish, and is a slap in the face of all those like Dad who did the hard work of grappling with the truth and fighting for our freedom to tell it.

(Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit’s board in unanimous votes Thursday evening approved a new contract for locomotive engineers and a roughly $3.2 billion spending plan, its first budget since the pandemic that does not include hundreds of millions of dollars in federal relief funds.
The agency’s budget represents a 5.1% increase from the $3 billion it approved last year and, for the first time, includes $788.6 million in revenue from a corporate business tax surcharge, called the corporate transit fee, enacted last year.
“Every penny of increase that we’ve asked for is accounted for, is budgeted in a thoughtful way, but what I want to assure you, mister chairman and the board members, is the budget in front of you has been thought about,” NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri said at the board’s meeting.
The business surcharge, which imposes a 2.5% non-marginal tax on businesses with more than $10 million in profit, is meant to fill the hole left by federal funds drawn down over the past six fiscal years.
The surtax is due to expire at the start of 2029, though lawmakers extended its predecessor before replacing it with the new surcharge, whose revenue is statutorily dedicated to the transportation agency.
Some urged the surtax to be made permanent, which would require legislation.
“Imagine the prosperity New Jersey Transit would bring to New Jersey if it had the permanent funding source that it and its riders deserve. Investing and streamlining service would incentivize more ridership,” said Jannelie Javier, a fellow at the Tristate Transportation Campaign.
The budget includes a 3% fare increase that went into effect at the start of July, and the agency expects farebox collections to reach $980 million in the fiscal year that began on July 1. If those targets hold, the agency will have brought farebox revenue back to prepandemic levels.
Though NJ Transit ridership has clawed out of the nadir it reached during the pandemic, it has not recovered to prepandemic levels — and with remote work now a fixture in the labor market, it’s not clear it will. The agency expects moderate ridership increases the next 12 months.
The agency’s most recent projections show $890.8 million in fare revenue in the last fiscal year, about $56 million less than forecast by that year’s budget. Federal maintenance funds and other reimbursements came in $141.3 million above expectations set last summer.
The agency’s direct state subsidy will fall to $43.9 million under the budget approved Wednesday, from $145 million in the last fiscal year. The agency’s annual diversion from New Jersey’s clean energy fund would roughly double to $140.1 million.
Other commercial revenue — money collected from the sale of property, ad space, and parking fees, among others — is expected to rise 48.7% to $195.9 million.
The remainder of the agency’s funding would flow from the New Jersey Turnpike Authority ($470 million) and reimbursements for preventative maintenance and other projects ($536.9 million).
Labor and benefits were the largest source of cost increases for the new fiscal year. Those are expected to rise $54.7 million, to about $1.8 billion, due mostly to contractual wage increases and bus routes the agency has taken over from private carriers.
Purchased transportation expenses — how much the agency pays private carriers to run buses, some light rail services, and Access Link — are expected to rise $45.4 million, to $334.1 million.
 Board vote caps yearslong contract fight

The new, seven-year contract with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen comes after protracted negotiations left members under an expired contract for five years and spurred the agency’s first strike in more than four decades (it interrupted services for four days in May).
The agreement, approved in a unanimous vote, raises hourly rates to $53 for locomotive engineers, $43.48 for assistant locomotive engineers, and $37.10 for trainees. Those wage rates are set to rise by 3% when the next fiscal year begins in July 2026.
“It was, as you all know, a difficult and contentious negotiation, but what we ended up with did not violate the fundamental principle that the governor and I laid out, which is we wanted something that was fiscally responsible but also met the needs of the union, and I think we’ve gotten an agreement that you’re going to consider today that will do just that,” Kolluri told the board.
Locomotive engineers who worked at the agency between 2020 and the date of the new contract will receive a collective $22.9 million in retroactive pay for the years spent under a lapsed agreement.
The new deal offers engineers an additional sick day and two new holidays, Juneteenth and Veterans Day. In 2023, the union paid $50,000 as part of a settlement agreement over an alleged unauthorized sickout on June 19, 2022. That agreement did not include an admission of guilt.
The agreement shifts out-of-network health reimbursements to a Medicare standard, mirroring provisions in contracts with the agency’s other unions. The change is expected to reduce the agency’s health care spending.
It phases out the engineers’ health management organization insurance plan and transfers employees using it to an exclusive providers organization plan, raises worker health premiums to 3% of base pay, and increases their workday to nine hours, from eight. These provisions are meant to avoid triggering provisions in contracts with the agency’s other unions that would provide them with identical wage increases if the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen had made no concessions.
“No other union that is of any consequence has come to my door and said, ‘I want the same deal.’ What does that tell you? That the givebacks were real. They were consequential, and they gave New Jersey Transit what we had asked for, which is givebacks that had value,” Kolluri said.
The agreement will reduce travel payment allowances by 10% and require engineers who move through NJ Transit’s training program to repay a portion of their training expenses, ranging from $4,650 to $9,300, if they leave the agency in the three years after their training is completed.
The repayment provision does not apply to workers who are laid off or suffer a disability that prevents them from working, and new language allows the agency to terminate workers without cause or hearing within 180 days of their completing training.
Other provisions require engineers to complete 16 hours of training annually on their own time and withdraw grievances filed under a 1982 agreement that required engineers’ hourly pay to be at least 10.4% more than conductors.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NJTbus03-e1649931997965-1024x665.jpg,,,2025-07-18 11:58:27.189478

His clemency was granted by former President Joe Biden (D) in his final days in office.
On Thursday, Mayor Joe Ganim (D) and Police Chief Roderick Porter were at BJ Brown Memorial Park, which is named for Leroy “BJ” Brown Jr. BJ was the eight-year-old murdered alongside his mom, Karen Clarke. They were in disbelief that Peeler had been released, and that they had no information about his whereabouts or plans.
At the time of the murder, an eyewitness identified Peeler as the gunman, but he was only convicted of conspiracy.
Ganim said the release of now 49-year-old Peeler has his city on edge.
“We’ve heard from victims’ advocates, people who know the family,” Ganim said. “And let’s say that there is not only outrage, but certainly concern. You can just imagine. I’m concerned. The chief’s concerned. Anybody who calls Bridgeport home, and beyond, should be concerned.”
Ganim said the details surrounding his clemency and release have been kept from city officials.
“Is there supervised release? Is there parole? Is there probation? Is there somebody to report to, or does this fall in the lap of the city of Bridgeport to deal with?” Ganim said. “Someone who was a hired killer, who killed an eight-year-old child and his mother, and says, ‘Here, Bridgeport, this is what we’re giving you back.’ Thank you, Joe Biden.”

Before he was killed, BJ was set to testify in a case against Peeler’s brother, Russell Peeler Jr. The murders led to the state’s creation of a witness protection program.
Peeler was sentenced to 25 years in prison, but was expected to serve longer on federal drug charges. Biden granted him clemency on those, so his time was considered served.
Connecticut politicians on both sides of the aisle have been critical of Biden’s decision, including whether or not he used the autopen. The autopen is a device that previous presidents have used, but critics argue it suggests Biden did not consider his pardons enough.
“How could this happen? How could the former president, with a clear mind, actually sign this type of pardon for this individual? Unspeakable,” Ganim said. “And then to look at what may have happened. Did he sign away the authority for this? So that needs to be looked at.”
“If Joe Biden wants to release this individual, let him take him to Delaware and let him be released there if he thinks he should be returned to society,” Ganim continued. “But not in Bridgeport.”
Ganim, nicknamed the “second chance mayor” because he was incarcerated between terms, said he believes in second chances.
In this case, perhaps not.
“I can’t see a path, I don’t have any information that leads me to understand how someone who was a hired murderer … is all of a sudden, by the stroke of a pen, put back into the community,” Ganim said.

Santiago/Getty Images)A plan to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to the personal data of all 79 million Medicaid enrollees – including more than 2.6 million Michiganders –  is being condemned by both the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and the Michigan League for Public Policy.
The Associated Press reports the agreement between the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would include the home addresses and ethnicities of enrollees in an effort to track down immigrants who may not be living legally in the United States. The AP obtained a copy of an agreement between the two agencies, which has not been publicly announced. 
Ramis Wadood, an ACLU of Michigan staff attorney, noted the policy change comes on the heels of Congress, at the behest of President Donald Trump, approving nearly $1 trillion in cuts from Medicaid. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Now, this wicked administration intends to terrorize Medicaid enrollees by sending ICE agents to their doors to possibly drag them away from their families in the name of rounding up people believed to be in the country illegally,” Wadood said. 
According to a joint press release by the ACLU and the Michigan League for Public Policy, the agreement is believed to be the first time in Medicaid’s history that comprehensive health data, including names, birthdates, addresses, Social Security numbers, and racial and ethnic information, has been turned over for immigration enforcement. 
“Sending ICE the personal data of 79 million people will put them in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s senseless and dehumanizing mass deportation machine. The attacks on our immigrant friends and neighbors, as well as the millions on Medicaid, are an affront to all of us – our rights and our freedom – and together, we must fight back,” Wadood said.
Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy, called the policy a “direct attack” on public health and civil liberties. She also warned that it will deter families — including those legally eligible — from seeking even emergency treatment out of fear that their enrollment could result in detention or deportation. 
“When a parent brings their child to the ER, they shouldn’t have to weigh whether saving their child’s life will put their entire family at risk of deportation. Weaponizing Medicaid data for immigration enforcement will create a dangerous chilling effect, deterring immigrants and their families from seeking the care they need, while putting entire communities at risk,” Stanton said.
According to the joint press release, Michigan is home to over 157,000 residents living in mixed-status families, including more than 71,000 U.S. citizens. 
“These families already face elevated rates of uninsurance — 10.6% of immigrants in Michigan are uninsured, compared to just 5% of native-born residents. Policies that increase barriers to care will only worsen health disparities and strain emergency services,” the release stated.
Both agencies also say the data-sharing arrangement raises serious legal and ethical concerns, and appears to violate federal medical privacy protections, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA. 
The AP reported that Medicaid officials had fought to prevent the data sharing even as late as Monday.
“They are trying to turn us into immigration agents,” a CMS official, who did not have permission to speak to the media and insisted on anonymity, told the AP.
Stanton said the implications of sharing the data go beyond immigration policy.
“Delays in prenatal and pediatric care could lead to preventable birth complications and childhood illnesses. Avoiding preventive treatment will drive up emergency costs for hospitals and taxpayers. And the mental health toll from fear, trauma and family separation will ripple across generations,” Stanton said. “We cannot allow this betrayal of trust to stand.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-18 11:58:27.189478

(Photo by Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Colorado Letter SoS Griswold
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.

While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
Sweeping Colorado requests
In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.

– David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research


Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.

The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.

The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
Letters to other states
As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
HAVA letter-redacted
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

Glenn Youngkin, left, answered questions from Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann Thursday during the Iowa Republican Party’s Lincoln Dinner fundraiser in Des Moines. (Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Though Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin has not said whether he is planning a run for president in 2028, he said during the Iowa GOP Lincoln Dinner on Thursday that he supports keeping the Iowa caucuses first in the nation.
Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann asked Youngkin during a “fireside chat” at the fundraiser if he likes the current presidential nominating system that starts with the Iowa Republican caucuses — and Youngkin responded he “absolutely” supports the current system.
“Here’s why: The beginning of the nomination process starts with incredibly informed voters,” Youngkin said. “You see, the difference in the way that the caucus system works, and the way a normal primary works. You all know this, is it is a moment to fully understand issues candidates, and what that candidate can do. And so often, primaries are a day when someone shows up and just pulls on a pulls on a lever because a friend whispered in their ear, ‘vote for them.’”
The Lincoln Dinner, an annual event held by the Republican Party of Iowa, has historically hosted presidential candidates and hopefuls who aim to introduce themselves to Iowa caucus voters. In 2023, leading up to the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses, 13 presidential candidates including President Donald Trump spoke at the event.
Though it’s still early in the cycle for candidates to announce their intentions for a bid in 2028, Youngkin has been brought up as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. His trip to Iowa, as well as plans to headline the Silver Elephant Gala in South Carolina, the SC GOP’s biggest fundraiser — both events in early states during the GOP presidential nomination cycle — have fueled speculation that he may be considering a run.
Youngkin gained prominence among Republicans nationally after his initial election to the Virginia governor’s office in 2021, when he defeated Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, becoming the first Republican to hold the office in over a decade. Governors cannot serve consecutive terms in Virginia, meaning he will have to leave the seat after his term ends in 2026.
The Virginia Republican was formerly co-CEO of the Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C. private equity firm. He did not have previous political experience before becoming governor, and spent more than $20 million of his own money to fund his 2021 campaign, according to the Associated Press.
In his gubernatorial campaign, Youngkin focused on “parental rights” issues related to education, opposing allowing sexually explicit material in school curriculum and to mask and vaccine mandates in K-12 schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Youngkin told Iowa Republicans these are the issues that motivated Virginians to vote for him in the 2021 election, despite Democrats having a history of winning the state.
“In a state that was blue, it didn’t matter … whether you’re a Republican parent or a independent parent, or even many Democratic parents, they said my children are the most important thing in my life, and I will decide I do not co-parent with the government,” he said.
He said during his time as governor, he was able to enact many laws allowing parents to have a say in their children’s education — and said his next goal is to create a private school scholarship program in Virginia, similar to Iowa’s Education Savings Account program using public funds for private school tuition and associated costs.
He said passing the “Virginia Opportunity Scholarship” program will be more difficult in Virginia than it was in Iowa, as both chambers have Democratic majorities. He added, “when I hear about these supermajorities (in the Iowa Legislature) I sit back there and go, ‘oh my goodness, wouldn’t that be great?’”
“We’re going to get this done,” Youngkin said. “We’re going to have Virginia opportunity scholarships so that families who couldn’t otherwise send their children to private schools have an opportunity to make that decision and exercise their right to make decisions for their kids.”
The Virginia Republican said his stance on education, as well as on issues like supporting law enforcement, lowering taxes and shrinking government, are positions that most Virginians share — but “they just didn’t know it” before hearing from his campaign in 2021.
“Virginians came together in a way that we couldn’t believe,” he said. “They said no to the left and yes to common sense, conservative values, policies. And it was a moment that made me so proud to be a Virginian. I have to say — it’s the exact same feeling I had when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The exact same feeling that common sense conservative policies not only win, but a vast majority of Americans want them and believe in them.”
Though Youngkin did not discuss future plans following his current term as Virginia governor, Kaufmann told reporters following the event that Youngkin’s stop showed the importance of having the Iowa caucuses lead the nation by providing a platform for potential presidential candidates long before the 2028 campaign season kicks off.
Iowa’s job, Kaufmann said, “is not to pick the president, but to provide an avenue where everybody can see what these candidates, potential candidates, have to say.”
While Iowa Republicans are set to keep their position as first in the nation in 2028, the Democratic presidential nominating calendar for the upcoming election cycle is less clear. Iowa lost its starting position in the 2024 Democratic nominating cycle. While the Democratic National Committee is set to reconsider the early state lineup before the next presidential election season, Iowa has lost its seat on the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee, meaning a return to holding the first-in-the-nation caucuses looks unlikely.
Youngkin said the Democratic Party “made a massive mistake in abandoning Iowa as their first stop and abandoning their process.” Kaufmann echoed this sentiment, adding that he is willing to work with Iowa Democrats to restore their position in the nominating calendar.

(Photo provided by ACLU of SC)A woman who spent more than two years in prison over her disruptive behavior and comments to police during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in South Carolina asked the U.S. Supreme Court this week to review her case, raising questions about free speech.
A Sumter jury convicted Brittany Martin in May 2022 of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner for her role in the multi-day protests that broke out in South Carolina and across the nation two years earlier following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of police in Minneapolis.
Unlike protests in Columbia and Charleston, where police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as some protesters threw rocks, fired guns, burned police cars, assaulted people and looted businesses, there were no reports of property damage or injuries in Sumter as a group of about 20 people turned out in front of the police station to demonstrate.
Still, Circuit Court Judge Kirk Griffin sentenced Martin to four years in prison, a heavier sentence than those handed down to the majority of people convicted across the Palmetto State, often for violent or destructive acts, according to a review of cases.
A question of free speech
The American Civil Liberties Union, which took on Martin’s case in 2023, argues that the hefty sentence infringes on the mother of five’s First Amendment rights and chills free speech. She petitioned the nation’s highest court this week to take up her case after South Carolina’s Court of Appeals, in a procedural matter, refused to consider First Amendment arguments, ruling her lawyer had not properly raised them during the lower court trial.
Martin was released from prison on Nov. 27, 2024, after serving 2 ½ years of her 4-year sentence. The 37-year-old is living in Mt. Vernon, Illinois. She declined an interview on advice of her attorneys.

Now she and her lawyers are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify that procedural rules — like the one invoked by the state Appeals Court — cannot excuse state appellate courts from “conducting the careful, independent review that the Supreme Court has long required in First Amendment cases,” the ACLU wrote in a statement.
“In 1963, the Supreme Court stepped in to protect the First Amendment rights of Black civil rights protesters who were prosecuted and convicted in South Carolina for the same offense, for doing what Brittany Martin did in 2020,” said ACLU legal director Cecillia Wang. “It’s time for the Supreme Court to reinforce the courts’ role in protecting freedom of speech.”
The landmark case Wang is referring to is Edwards v. South Carolina. In that case, police arrested about 200 students protesting segregation while they marched around the Statehouse, carrying signs and singing hymns. Prosecutors charged them with disturbing the peace.
“I am praying that this case be overturned. This is a battle to exercise and uphold our constitutional rights,” Martin said in a statement. “They’ve got to give us some justice and let us know that we still have our First Amendment right to freedom of speech in this country. My case would be the perfect example of that.”
The protest
Martin moved with her four younger children to Sumter from Iowa in spring 2020. When protests broke out in May of that year, Martin joined in. She told The Associated Press she still grieved the death of her brother-in-law, who was shot 19 times by Sumter police in 2016 after officers said he fired a gun after a stolen car chase.
As the protest stretched out over about five days, the city implemented a curfew. Police arrested Martin and eight others for what prosecutors said was disruptive behavior.
In addition to breaching the peace, Martin faced charges of inciting a riot and threatening police.
In court, prosecutors showed police body camera recordings of Martin. She is not seen touching officers with her hands but she does make statements such as: “Some of us gon’ be hurting and some of y’all gon’ be hurting” and “We ready to die for this. We tired of it. You better be ready to die for the blue. I’m ready to die for the Black.”
News photos of those demonstrations also showed Martin standing chest to chest with officers and shouting in their face.
The jury acquitted Martin of the riot charge and reached no verdict on whether she threatened officers’ lives. She was found guilty of breaching the peace, a crime that is typically a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a $500 fine and 30 days in jail. But prosecutors elevated the charge to a “high and aggravated” crime, which carries up to 10 years imprisonment.
South Carolina case law defines breach of the peace as “a violation of public order, a disturbance of the public tranquility, by any act or conduct inciting to violence.” What makes it “high and aggravated” is more open to interpretation, the South Carolina branch of the ACLU argued in court documents.
High and aggravated
The state’s most high-profile case involved an intoxicated University of Alabama football fan who punched a University of South Carolina fan, knocking him unconscious after a football game in 2010 at Williams-Brice Stadium. The man died after the driver of a vehicle unknowingly ran him over in the bumper-to-bumper traffic. A judge sentenced the Alabama fan to three years in prison with the rest of his 10-year sentence suspended.
Many bystanders in the gameday crowd witnessed the man’s disturbing death and SC Appeals Court judges ruled that the event, the distress it caused to so many, and the public upheaval that followed “exemplify the type of behavior constituting an aggravated breach of the peace.”
Prosecutors in Martin’s case argued Martin and other Black Lives Matter protesters trespassed and disrupted businesses and traffic for days along the busy street in downtown Sumter where the police station is located.
Civil rights attorney and former state Rep. Bakari Sellers unsuccessfully sought to get Martin’s sentence reduced. The judge, in his ruling, pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions across multiple states, including shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun, as contributing to the length of her sentence. The ACLU did not have details of those convictions.
In November 2020, a judge also sentenced Martin to seven years of probation for willful intent to injure and leaving a crime scene during a family dispute in Iowa, where more than a year earlier her teenage son had accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away.
Martin had been on probation at least six times, according to court filings.
“Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Judge Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”
The ACLU disagreed and attempted to appeal the case further. While Martin is now out of prison, spokesman Paul Bowers said it is still important to clear Martin’s name and prevent such sentences from happening in the future.
The group waits to hear whether the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the case.
Other cases
Beyond Martin’s, other Black Lives Matter protest-related cases in the state continue to make their way through the courts.
Most recently, two Midlands men — Brandon Jemar Pickett, 38, and Luis Rosario, 29, both of Columbia — were sentenced in federal court last month for crimes committed during protests held in Columbia.
The May 30, 2020, protest started peacefully at the Statehouse but turned violent as protesters marched to the Columbia Police Department. After some protesters started throwing things, setting fire to police cars, and in a couple cases, assaulting people, the city implemented a curfew. Police in riot gear used tear gas and an armored vehicle to push protesters away from the police station and into the Vista entertainment district. Protesters shattered windows and broke into several businesses along the way, stealing bottles of liquor.
The judge sentenced Pickett to four years in federal prison for throwing a rock at a police officer, chipping the officer’s tibia. Rosario was sentenced to a year in prison for throwing water bottles and a wooden barricade, which hit an officer in the head, requiring seven stitches.
Federal and state prosecutors have secured convictions or plea deals with about a quarter of the roughly 100 people arrested in Columbia, according to a review of court records. Meanwhile, 62 of those charged saw cases dismissed, mostly those involving curfew violations.
Sixteen cases are still pending.
All eight adults arrested and charged in Sumter pleaded guilty or were convicted for mostly minor offenses, receiving mostly fines or 30-day sentences.
And in Charleston, where people looted and burned businesses up and down King Street, 26 people have been convicted, according to the solicitor’s office, out of 82 arrests reported by police. Nearly 30 cases involving curfew violations were dismissed back in 2020. Two cases remain pending, according to court documents.
It is unclear whether the remaining arrests were ever prosecuted. Charleston police could not immediately provide a list of names to be checked against court records.
The toughest sentences, besides Martin’s, was Pickett’s and the one handed down to Shabazz Akeem Isiah Watson, of St. Stephen. He was sentenced to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty to arson for setting fires at multiple Charleston businesses.
Those in Columbia who faced charges similar to Martin’s were given a $200 fine or 30 days in prison.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/edited-photo.jpg,,,2025-07-18 10:56:54.796294

ESSEX JUNCTION — The Development Review Board in Essex, after another hours-long meeting Thursday night, nixed Scannell Properties’ proposal to build an Amazon distribution facility in Saxon Hill.
The decision came at 9:08 p.m. when the seven-member volunteer board reconvened in the Essex High School auditorium after an hour-long private session.
Ian Carroll, chair of the board, said a vote to approve the application failed 4-2, with one board member yet to weigh in.

The result came after careful deliberation, he said, and was based solely on the merits of the application and current zoning regulations.
The announcement drew cheers from the remaining members of the public at the late hour. Some of them grouped outside to discuss the matter after the meeting ended.
“It’s an inflection point for Essex in terms of people speaking (out) in wanting to uphold the town plan,” said resident Lorraine Zaloom, who saw the vote as “a victory for Essex and the surrounding communities.” 
Named Project Moose, the site plan outlines a 107,000-square-foot facility and 482 parking spaces at 637 Kimo Drive on 22.94 acres of mostly vacant and wooded land in the Saxon Hill Industrial Park off Thompson Drive. Scannell, the commercial real estate development company headquartered in Indianapolis, is seeking a waiver for the required 50-foot buffer between the property and Kimo Drive.
The hotly debated project has continued to gain public opposition since it was proposed earlier this year. Thursday night, protestors gathered at the entrance of the high school building at 6 p.m. with posters and a song. 
Earlier this week, Phoenix Books announced an open letter to town officials calling for  “whatever measures are necessary to prevent a decision from being made that will have negative and lasting impacts on our regional roads, traffic safety, flood resilience, economy, and job market for the entire state.”
The letter has garnered more than 400 signatures, including area small business owners, according to Joanna Grossman, a Burlington resident and community relations manager at Phoenix Books, which has a store in the Essex Experience mall in Essex Junction.

Grossman was among more than 80 who attended the continued public hearing Thursday, held this time in the high school auditorium, with many others attending remotely online. The majority of them spoke against the proposal at the meeting, which began at 6:30 p.m.
Speakers reiterated concerns of traffic congestion, increased noise and road safety — particularly during school dismissal times — and emphasized the need for multiple access points to the site for fire safety.
The board asked Amazon to present a more realistic traffic study at its previous meeting on July 26.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.
Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

Willie Brewster died after being attacked three days earlier. He was heading home after working at a pipe foundry near Anniston, Alabama, when three white men shot and killed him.  Back home, his two children and his wife, Lestine, now pregnant, were waiting for him. Shots struck his spine as the men passed. 
The men belonged to the National States Rights Party, a violent neo-Nazi group whose members had been involved in church bombings and killings of African Americans. The men had just heard the group’s Connie Lynch declare, “If it takes killing to get the Negroes out of the white man’s streets and to protect our constitutional rights, then I say, yes, kill them!” They did as he told them. 
Months later, jurors sentenced Hubert Damon Strange to 10 years in prison for killing Brewster. It was believed to be the first case in Alabama where an all-white jury convicted a white man of killing a Black man in Alabama. He never served time behind bars.

If you or a loved one are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 74174.
This story was originally published in Uncloseted Media, an LGBTQ-focused investigative news outlet.
When Arden was 16, they called a suicide crisis hotline “thinking their life was over.”
They were in an abusive relationship, regularly self-harming, and felt that nothing was helping. “It was terrifying,” they told Uncloseted Media.
“If it weren’t for the hotline, I would have killed myself.”
Since that day, Arden, now 24 years old and living in Brooklyn, has used various crisis helplines. When the 988 national suicide prevention hotline launched a “Press 3” option in 2022 for LGBTQ+ youth, they immediately started using the resource.
Arden, who identifies as nonbinary, says the LGBTQ+ hotline workers “respected their identity” and were understanding that they are not a woman. “It was really affirming for a very troubling time in my life.”
Since then, Arden has “Pressed 3” more times than they can remember, seeking help for everything from dealing with the loss of their friend, who died by suicide, to “stupid cliquey gay people stuff.”
“I remember when my friend had killed himself and I was dealing with a lot. I called them and they talked to me for over an hour because I was really upset,” they say. “When I called the hotline, it was a last resort. I was really at my wits’ end.”
Arden — whose last call to the lifeline was two weeks ago — is one of 1.3 million callers and chatters the LGBTQ+ youth hotline has served since it launched, according to federal data. The legislation that greenlit the national program, signed by Trump in 2020 during his first term, explicitly recognized that LGBTQ+ youth are more than “4 times more likely to contemplate suicide than their peers, with 1 in 5 LGBTQ+ youth and more than 1 in 3 transgender youth reporting attempting suicide.”
This new option to “Press 3” allowed queer youth in crisis the ability to directly connect with counselors from a set of specialized LGBTQ+ crisis centers. These counselors are trained in cultural competency and often bring lived experience, providing identity‑affirming, empathetic support for challenges like coming out, discrimination or mental health crises.
Despite the hotline’s success, the Trump administration announced last month that they would be shutting it down on July 17, claiming that the service had run out of congressionally directed funding. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said in an email to Uncloseted Media that “continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
There are no plans, however, to shut down the other hotline options, including the Veterans Crisis Line, the Spanish Language Line and the Native and Strong Lifeline. And while Congress spent $33 million on the LGBTQ+ service last year, the cost of continuing it represents merely 0.006 percent of the $510 billion that suicide and self-harm costs the U.S. yearly.
“This is absolutely a mistake,” a suicide prevention call center director told Uncloseted Media. “We are concerned that this will result in increased suicide rates for LGBTQ+ youth.”
 Why we need option 3

The director’s concern is supported by a 2022 research brief that found that queer college students with access to LGBTQ-specific services were 44% less likely to attempt suicide than those without it. Research also shows that a hotline specific to LGBTQ+ services increases the likelihood of queer youth calling.
“It’s true for any direct service,” Harmony Rhoades, associate research professor of sociology at Washington University, told Uncloseted Media. “People who are in substance use recovery want to work with people who’ve gone through recovery themselves because they understand what that experience is. Culturally, there is not a lot of understanding of the specific experiences of someone who is LGBTQ+ and without specific training, a crisis counselor isn’t going to be able to know the language that’s going to feel affirming.”
“Connecting with someone who gets it was really helpful. … Because at home, I was so isolated and I didn’t really interact with other queer people,” says Genna Brown, who used the Trevor Project’s chat function at 10 years old.
“I was an extremely self-loathing, suicidal kid who was under the impression that God hated me and I was gonna burn in hell for eternity,” Brown, now 15 and living in High Point, North Carolina, told Uncloseted Media.
“I only used the chat feature because I was scared my parents would hear me. We shared a wall,” she says. “I was spiraling really bad. I’d just realized I was crushing on girls, and I thought I was going to burn in hell for all eternity because that is what we are taught.”
Raised in a Southern Baptist church, Brown never felt safe at home, where her father would regularly spit slurs like “faggots” and “queers.” At church, every sermon was about Sodom and Gomorrah or about how “real love” only existed between a man and a woman.
“I grew up knowing the number one thing not to be was one of the ‘dirty queers,’” she says. “I kept thinking, I can kill myself now and go to hell, or live longer and still go to hell. I used to have panic attacks at 9, 10 years old, just thinking about burning in hell perpetually.”
Brown remembers Caitlin, the chat counselor who helped her, being the first ever to tell her that queer love was valid.
“She told me she’d been with her girlfriend for seven years. I didn’t even believe queer people could be happy. … It broke my brain in the best possible way,” says Brown, who is now out and proud to her parents, who have come around, and to most of her friends on social media.
Arden had a similar experience. “The queer line is better than the regular line,” they say. “I feel like it’s less like going through a checklist on the queer line.”
As a survivor of sexual assault, Arden says knowing that the counselors on the other line were trained in LGBTQ-specific trauma made it easier to reach out for help. “My voice doesn’t pass per se but they still respected my identity,” they say.
LGBTQ-specific resources for youth are critical, with 41 percent seriously considering suicide in 2024. In addition, queer youth are disproportionately affected by a litany of mental health issues and trauma, including physical and sexual assault, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, bullying and addiction.
“It’s not like we’re cherry-picking some random group,” says Rhoades. “If we are going to fund [suicide prevention], there is no reason we should do it inefficiently by not effectively targeting the people who need it most. So yes, they need specific suicide prevention services.”
While the hotline focuses on LGBTQ+ youth, they don’t turn away adults who need help. Joshua Dial, 36, says that when he called 988, he was often connected to the LGBTQ+ youth hotline after mentioning that he’s gay.
“I always walked away feeling better after I called,” he says. “There have been times when I spoke to the regular 988 crisis people, and they helped too. But they didn’t understand quite as much.”
Dial, a Lutheran who lives in Stillwater, Oklahoma, says he wasn’t always comfortable being open about his sexual orientation to his religious community and that the only way to meet other gay people was on hook-up and dating apps, which he notes are “not for emotional support.”
“I wouldn’t be talking to my pastor about getting on Grindr. I can’t go to my pastor and tell them what I did last weekend,” he says.
Dial, who was raised to believe that homosexuality is a sin, has experienced depression since the age of 16 and has also struggled with bipolar disorder, addiction and PTSD. “My addiction was getting worse, and the only constant was that the line was always available,” he says. “I didn’t have any other options, but I knew that if I called the hotline, I would get help.”
Dial says the emotional support he received through these phone calls kept him from self-harm and suicide. “There are times when I called that number and was this close to taking a handful of pills, this close to slitting my wrist, this close to buying a gun to shoot myself. And I talked to those people, and they not only understood, but they gave me the empowerment of knowing that someone had my back.”
 How cutting option 3 affects the whole system

While the cuts are only meant to affect the hotline’s support for LGBTQ+ youth, crisis center employees say they’ll impact the entire 988 network.
“This being rifted does very much mean less capacity for 988 as a whole,” says the suicide prevention call center director. “Everyone will be affected.”
“When the LGBTQ+ hotline opened up, it really lowered the volume on the mainstream counselors,” a 988 hotline counselor in Washington state told Uncloseted Media. “It seemed really helpful, and I didn’t get a lot of LGBTQ+ chats after that point.”
The counselor at the Washington state center says they are about to lay off 42 counselors from their LGBTQ+ hotline. They say these roles won’t be replaced on the main 988 line due to a hiring freeze. Because of this, counselors expect the number of calls they receive to double, which could dramatically increase wait times. The Washington state center did not respond to a request for comment.
Even without the cuts, wait times are an issue. A 17-year-old caller from Virginia says that even the 10 minutes they had to wait for their call to be answered were painful. “I was worried that nobody would want to talk to me. I was just feeling hopeless,” they say. “There’s this one resource that I’m supposed to be able to have access to 24/7, but it just isn’t as accessible as it should be. For some people, those 10 minutes are crucial.”
In a 2009 study of 82 patients referred to a psychiatric university hospital after a suicide attempt, nearly half reported that the period between their first thought of suicide and their actual attempt had lasted 10 minutes or less, underscoring how shorter wait times can be a matter of life and death.
“If we are not able to catch someone during the time that suicidal thoughts have appeared and intervene as quickly as possible, they could start figuring out how they’re going to kill themselves and make it happen,” says the suicide prevention call center director. “And a lot of folks have access to means that can result in instant death like firearms.”
 What can be done?

With the “Press 3” option gone, Rhoades worries that the current spate of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and hateful rhetoric toward the community will affect how counselors without queer-specific training will provide care.
“We’re living in an unprecedented time where anti-LGBTQ+ hatred is being normalized,” she says. “It absolutely affects how young people are treated. And it filters down to crisis counselors.”
As Congress and the Trump administration prepare to shut down “Press 3” on July 17 in an effort to save money, many believe that it will have the reverse effect.
“They just want these people to die. … That’s the message I got,” says a hotline operator in Washington state, adding that the administration is “not looking at the bigger picture.”
Representatives and advocates are fighting for more LGBTQ+ mental health services. Kansas Rep. Sharice Davids reintroduced a bill last month dedicated to LGBTQ+ mental health resources. “By increasing access to mental health support for our children and teens, we can save lives,” Davids said in a press release. And last weekend, hundreds of people protested in front of Trump Tower in an effort to save the hotline.
Arden says they wouldn’t be here today without the line’s support. “I’ve been struggling for a long time in my life [with] self-harm and I’ve been clean almost two years now,” they say. “I would definitely not be clean if it weren’t for the hotline and I would probably hurt myself again.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lgbtq-hands-rainbow-getty-1024x576-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-18 10:56:54.796294

(CPW)Colorado’s voter-mandated program to reintroduce gray wolves took a big step forward in 2025 with the births of an unknown number new wolf pups in the spring, state wildlife officials confirmed this week.
Three new breeding pairs means the addition of three officially designated wolf packs — the One Ear pack in Jackson County, the King Mountain pack in Routt County, and the Three Creeks pack in Rio Blanco County — to Pitkin County’s Copper Creek pack, the only one established in the reintroduction program’s first year.
Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have been monitoring the four wolf dens, but haven’t yet been able to confirm the exact number of pups born this year, they told agency commissioners Thursday. Movement tracking of collared wolves showed the den activity, and trail cameras placed near the den sites have captured photos and video of some of the pups. Wolf litters on average consist of about four or five pups, and half of those typically survive their first year of life.

“This reproduction is a really key point in the restoration of wolves to the state,” said Eric Odell, CPW’s wolf conservation program manager. “Despite some things that you may hear, not all aspects of wolf management have have been a failure.”
The Copper Creek pack was the first to be established after CPW began relocating gray wolves to the state in December 2023, but soon caused controversy with a series of livestock killings in Grand County. The pack was captured and relocated to Pitkin County last year, where one wolf, a yearling, was killed by wildlife agents in May after livestock depredations continued.
With the deaths of at least eight of the 25 wolves relocated to Colorado in the program’s first two years, survival rates fell below the 70% benchmark targeted by the state’s official restoration plan. Because of that, CPW officials said last month that the agency would review its “translocation protocols,” pending determinations of causes of death for each animal. But Odell told CPW commissioners Thursday not to expect big changes or the suspension of relocation efforts.
“What we can say is that none of those mortalities are due to any of the protocols from our capture efforts, from our transport from the source … or from our releases,” he said. “Importantly, there’s no reason justifiably to use this wolf mortality as a suggestion for pausing reintroduction.”
 Compensation claims
CPW commissioners also held a lengthy hearing Thursday to settle two claims for compensation from livestock producers who suffered wolf depredations in 2024.
Farrell Livestock of Grand County and the Coberly Creek Ranch in Routt County were due to receive $287,407 and $66,807, respectively, in compensation for confirmed livestock deaths and reduced weights and conception rates. But the producers sought additional payments of $100,045 and $30,860, respectively, under an interpretation of state law that CPW’s legal counsel rejected.
Despite CPW’s recommendation that the additional claims be denied, commissioners voted 6-5 against denial, and then voted to settle with both producers for the full amount. Several commissioners said the body should move forward with a new rulemaking to provide clarity to the compensation structure moving forward.
Jeff Davis, CPW’s director, implied that awarding the full compensation claims would allow the agency to “keep (people) at the table and figure this out.”
“We have people that are losing hope. And when people lose hope, in my experience, they get desperate, and desperate things start to happen,” Davis told commissioners. “What I need is — and I’m not saying whatever decision you guys have to make, you’re the policymakers in this space — but I need to make sure that we’re delivering stuff that keeps people at the table, or we all will lose in this deal.”
Wildlife managers said problems with the Copper Creek pack in 2024 and 2025 are the exception rather than the rule, with most reintroduced wolves preying on native ungulates as they spread across the landscape on the Western Slope. As the new wolf packs establish well-defined territories, management and conflict mitigation will become easier, they said.
“It was never a supposition that wolves and livestock are going to get along great,” Odell said. “We knew that there was going to be conflict, we knew that there would be dead wolves, and we knew that there would be wolf reproduction. So these are all landmarks that are, that are important parts in the whole effort of wolf restoration.”
“Dealing with it certainly has proven challenging for producers, for CPW staff, for a variety of others, but it is a success,” he added. “I think we’re working towards success in many different ways, not just from a wolf population side of things, but from a producer perspective as well.”

Greg Gianforte on Wednesday attended a ribbon cutting event on a new provider’s entrance into Montana.
Visionary Broadband recently completed a connectivity project in Hardin and is beginning another near Whitehall. Another nearly $2 million Visionary project is planned near Butte, according to state project recommendation documents. Montana is spending over $300 million as part of the ConnectMT project to increase internet access to rural corners of the state.
According to a press release from Visionary Broadband, about $119 million of ConnectMT funding is coming from American Rescue Plan Act funds dating back to 2021. The federal government ranks Montana poorly in high-speed internet access and has looked to invest heavily in building that infrastructure statewide.
“For years, our residents and small businesses have needed better internet,” Whitehall mayor Mary Hensleigh said in the press release. “This project gives Whitehall the infrastructure to support growth and stay connected.”
In Hardin, 2,077 more homes and businesses can now connect to high-speed fiber internet, while the Whitehall broadband project will connect 543 more. In Butte, 10 homes and businesses will be added.
“Expanding reliable, high-speed connections and bridging the digital divide has been a top priority in Montana,” Gianforte said in a press release. “By working with partners like Visionary Broadband and supporting projects like this, we’re ensuring reliable connection for our rural communities and creating greater access to good-paying jobs, high-quality education, and affordable health care.”
Visionary had a small presence in Butte and Red Lodge prior to this year’s expansion, the release said. As part of that expansion, the company acquired MTWeb.
“Homes have a need for reliable broadband. Businesses have a need for reliable broadband. Visionary saw this need in Butte, Hardin and Whitehall, and we stepped up, matching funds for the projects,” Brian Worthen, CEO of Visionary Broadband said in a press release. “I hope to continue our efforts to create an even playing field for communities through newly built broadband.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Montana-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-18 10:56:54.796294

We could have 200,000 people come off the rolls.","(Getty Images)This is an abbreviated transcript of a July 16 interview with Jeff Reynolds, executive director of the Rural Hospital Coalition of Louisiana, which represents 49 rural hospitals in 41 parishes. 

Reynolds also worked for 30 years at the Louisiana Department of Health, including five years as the agency’s undersecretary and chief financial officer for Govs. Bobby Jindal and John Bel Edwards. In that role, he oversaw the state’s Medicaid budget, including after Edwards’ adopted Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016. 

He is considered one of the state’s foremost experts on federal and state health care financing in Louisiana. 

This interview has been edited for clarity. 
Q. The One Big Beautiful Bill passed in Washington, and there’s been a lot of interest in what it does. What do you wish people knew about the bill and the changes that it would implement to Medicaid? 
A. The changes that we see in the big beautiful bill are really in three broad categories. 
There’s changes to Medicaid eligibility that will start in the spring of 2027. Some of those would be the work requirements.
You’ve also got changes to the financing of the program – capping or freezing the provider taxes, and then ultimately reducing them in about 2028.  
You also have a new rural health transformation program where I expect about $150 million to $200 million of new money in Louisiana, starting in 2026.
Q. Do you have any estimates – or has the state produced any estimates – about what type of change we might see in the Medicaid program? 
A. The eligibility changes are sort of phased in depending on which one it is. They start in the spring of 2027 and some start as late as December of 2029. 

With those changes, I do expect there to be some reduction in the Medicaid expansion rolls of anywhere from 50,000 to maybe 150,000. 
When you start getting into the address verification and a little closer to 2030, there could be another potential 100,000 people coming off the rolls. 

Right now, we’ve got about 1.6 million people on the rolls. We could have 200,000 people come off the rolls and bring Medicaid enrollment down to about 1.4 million. But I really do not expect us to see the full impact of all these changes until we get closer to 2030. 

And of course, that’s five years out and it’s hard to project that far out. But based on my experience and how eligibility works in Medicaid, that is the potential impact. 
Q. Are we going to see a change in funding for the Medicaid program that comes from the federal government? 

A. The hospital program and the physician program are absolutely affected by the Big Beautiful Bill. But right now those programs are capped at their 2026 levels. 

So for 2026, the hospitals are fully funded based on the appropriations act that the state legislature passed in the spring legislative session. So for 2026 through 2028, there is no really no reduction in funding to those hospitals, but those supplemental payments are capped at the 2026 amounts.
Then, we start seeing a 10% reduction based on the language in the Big Beautiful bill starting in 2029. And that 10% reduction would occur right now, based on the numbers I’m seeing, through fiscal year 2035. So it is a case where the funding reductions are very much in the out years – not immediate.
We are really sort of stabilized for the next four to five years. Then, we’ll start seeing reductions, and that’s why I’ve been telling people, for the short term, we’re absolutely fine. But yes, we’re going to need to work with our federal legislators and our state legislators to help try to address these future reductions.
  Jeff Reynolds
 
Q. Why is the Medicaid program so important to rural hospitals and healthcare providers in rural areas? 

A. In Louisiana, you’ve gotta remember there’s 4.6 million people in the state.
Right now, we’ve got 1.6 million people enrolled in the Medicaid program. We’ve got about 300,000 people uninsured, and that represents about 41% of the state’s total population. 

So it’s just a huge portion of the population is covered by Medicaid or is in the uninsured bucket. When you look at some of the rural parishes that my rural hospitals serve, those population amounts are even greater. 

Medicaid is a big funder of health care services in those rural communities. And if you start adjusting or reducing what Medicaid pays, then it does affect the ability of those rural hospitals to continue to provide services – not only to the Medicare clients but also to the private insurance clients. 
Q. I want to make sure that I understand what you’re saying there, which is that changes to the Medicaid program would not just affect Medicaid patients, but it would affect other people with private insurance.
A. If you’ve got close to 50% of your clients as Medicaid clients, as it pays less, then those health care providers in those rural communities have less resources to run their operations, run their outpatient clinics and provide services to everybody in the community.
In a lot of these rural communities, where these rural hospitals serve, they are sort of the cornerstone of those communities. It is a big economic driver, big economic engine for those rural communities. 
Q. Why do you think it’s important to have rural health care?

A. If you were a businessman and you’re looking to open a new business or something, you’re gonna want to know, where are my employees gonna get health care?
If [a community] does not have a rural hospital, then you’re going to probably look at a community that does have a hospital, does have a robust health care system so your employees can get health care. 

If a community loses its rural hospital, it sort of begins the death spiral of that community because that is that economic driver, that attraction to that community goes away.
Q. [The Big Beautiful Bill] requires some co-payments for certain types of doctor visits for Medicaid recipients. When you worked for the Louisiana Department of Health, I believe they implemented a co-payment program for Medicaid recipients under Gov. Bobby Jindal. Can you talk about the state’s experience with that policy? 

A. Provider fees are in the Big Beautiful Bill, and right now it requires a $35 copay. That would start Oct. 1, 2028. It would only apply to the [Medicaid] expansion adults that have income from 100% to 138% of federal poverty [level].
A single adult [that meets those qualifications] makes $15,000 a year to $21,000 a year.

We implemented co-pays in the Medicaid program [during the Jindal administration], and the health care providers really hate them. 

If you’re a specialist doctor doing a knee replacement and you get a thousand dollars from Medicaid to provide that service, they’re gonna cut your rate from a thousand dollars down to $965. So they reduce your rate by that $35. 

So it’s a rate cut to that provider, and then those providers are expected to collect that $35 from the client. If your client is making $20,000 a year, it’s gonna be – I’m not gonna say none of them are gonna pay – but there’s gonna be a large percentage of them that simply say they do not have the resources to make that copayment. And the providers end up having to eat that cost.
So in essence, copays become a rate cut to the providers, and I saw that numerous times under the Jindal administration. 
Q. Prior to the vote on the Big Beautiful Bill, there were concerns that we were going to see rural hospitals and maybe rural health care providers close or shut down. Can you explain whether that’s something we should still be concerned about? 
A. As I said earlier, we are fully funded for 2026. I do not see any reductions or anything that would cause a rural hospital to shut down here in 2026, and I really don’t see that occurring in 2027 or 2028 either.
Once we get past 2030, we are gonna need some help in order to avoid any, you know, issues with reduction of services and those types of things.
When you get five years out, I’m very hesitant to predict what will happen because I know there will be a lot of changes. So that is why, right now I’m saying between now and 2030, I do not foresee any rural hospitals closing because of the Big, Beautiful Bill.
Q. Do you expect the health care community in Louisiana to try to lobby for changes between now and 2027 when some of the [reductions] start taking effect?

A. I do. I think part of my job is to make sure our elected officials understand the impact of this piece of legislation and what will happen.
I think everybody, at least from the rural provider community in Louisiana, would absolutely be working with their elected officials to see what changes or tweaks could happen between now and 2029. 
It is a case where we do have some time to work with everybody, and I’m optimistic that we’ll get there and get this resolved, and keep providing those services that are so important to our citizens.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-1178748290-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-18 10:56:54.796294

Freelance Journalist,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/18/a-food-growing-tradition-finds-new-roots-in-the-mississippi-delta/,"In the Mississippi Delta farming region where most crops get shipped elsewhere, a growing group of farmers is cultivating produce that makes it to local plates.","This story from Reasons to be Cheerful is  one in a series about the confluence of capitalism, conservation and cultural identity in the Mississippi River Basin. It is part of Waterline and is sponsored by the Walton Family Foundation.
Dorothy Grady pulled at a tuft of green fronds sprouting from one of an array of soil-filled buckets sitting in the driveway of her house. A plump carrot, five inches long and brilliant orange, popped out.
Nearby, a sage shrub grew from another bucket, and scallions crowded a squat grow bag. In about three weeks, Grady would kick off the spring growing season on the land she cultivates around Shelby, Mississippi, including two plots at the now-closed middle school across the street, a small grove of peach and pear trees up the road, and five acres outside of town. She was ready to start planting eggplants, melons, tomatoes and a cornucopia of other produce that would soon end up in the homes of 127 nearby residents.

Shelby, a few miles east of the Mississippi River, is surrounded by flat, fertile farmland. But Grady’s vegetables and fruit are some of the only crops around that make it to local plates. The vast majority of Mississippi Delta farms are devoted to commodity crops like soy and corn.
Grady is one of almost a dozen local growers supplying produce to Delta GREENS, a collaborative research project that is delivering fresh ingredients to residents of Bolivar, Sunflower and Washington counties with diabetes and monitoring the health impacts. This “food is medicine” project is one of a number of initiatives that are supporting farmers and expanding the market for locally grown produce in this western Mississippi region. The benefits run in both directions: At the same time that community members are getting access to these nutritious ingredients, the small-scale farmers who grow them are getting a leg up.
“What we’re trying to do is build cooperative development amongst the farms,” says Julian Miller, founding director for the Reuben V. Anderson Institute for Social Justice in Jackson, a co-principal investigator for Delta GREENS, and a long-time local food advocate in the Delta region. “Ultimately, we want to be able to give them the capacity to scale and capture the broader market.”
The 200-mile-long Delta region, on the fertile floodplain sandwiched between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers, has a rich agricultural history. Once known for growing cotton, today the area is dominated by ridged fields growing commodities that will be processed into animal feed or ethanol.
In the past, many Delta residents cultivated fruits and vegetables, says Miller, yet over time, pressures like farming mechanization and loss of land eroded the practice. Miller, a fifth-generation Delta resident who grew up a few miles away from Shelby, never saw anyone with a vegetable garden. “That tradition was lost, as far as growing your food,” he says. 
Today, despite the abundance of fertile land, very little of it is dedicated to edible crops. About 90 percent of the food people eat in this region is grown elsewhere and imported. “That’s the irony,” Miller says.
And even imported fresh food can be hard to access. As of 2021, 63 of Mississippi’s 82 counties were classified as food deserts, meaning there is no grocery store or option to buy fresh ingredients in the immediate area.
Significant health and economic inequities overlay this region. In Bolivar, Sunflower and Washington counties — where the Delta GREENS study is focused — almost a third of residents live at or below the poverty level. Meanwhile, the rate of diabetes is twice the national average.
This confluence of public health disparities, economic inequity and lack of food sovereignty has fueled an effort to reestablish food-growing traditions, led by growers like Grady. A child of sharecroppers, Grady recalls her family always kept a garden when she was growing up, exchanging veggies and fruits with neighbors.
She has been involved with growing the local food movement in the Delta since the 1990s, when she first started working on farm-to-school garden projects.
In addition to helping establish hundreds of community gardens at schools and churches around the region, she’s also expanded her own growing operation, now supplying her harvests to residents in and around Bolivar County. Last year, the peach and pear trees she keeps yielded about 30 bushels of fruit, which went to local schools and was distributed through produce boxes for participants in the Delta GREENS study.
These weekly produce boxes are helping to address one of the structural challenges of developing the local food system in the Delta, explains Miller: the lack of a consistent market. While many residents are interested in eating more local produce, growers don’t have a reliable pathway to sell to the public. But nutrition- and food-security projects that source produce from local farmers are helping those agricultural businesses scale up.
About 40 miles northeast of Shelby, Robbie Pollard is busy planting and tending to more than 10 acres of fruit and vegetable plants. 
Pollard grew up around farming — his grandfather grew commodity crops. But he says he didn’t know anything about cultivating food until he tried growing his own in his backyard. It turned out to be a calling, he says, and he soon left his job in IT to pursue it full time.
Farming fruits and vegetables is more complex than commodity crops, explains Pollard. For one, it’s more labor intensive — weeding, tending and harvesting by hand. Unlike commodity farmers, who deliver their crops directly to local co-ops, distribution is harder for fruits and vegetables, Pollard says: “We have to find our own markets.”

Pollard has found a range of ways to distribute his produce through his farm, Start 2 Finish, and his associated healthy foods initiative Happy Foods Project. Today, he is one of the main growers supplying for Delta GREENS, as well as similar projects that provide households with regular local food boxes, including another food prescription project, Northern Mississippi FoodRx, in conjunction with the University of Mississippi. This summer, he’ll also be distributing through a mobile market, and he recently started selling through a grocery store with a focus on local products that opened in the city of Clarksdale in May.
Produce prescription boxes have given him a way to steadily expand his farm by reinvesting each year in incremental upgrades. He’s progressed from doing all his work by hand, to having a tiller, then a small tractor. He’s now leasing 46 acres of cropland. Last year, he grew four acres. This season, he put in more than 10, with plans in the works to expand hydroponic and aquaponic capacity. Soon, he hopes to work with other local growers to try a range of different techniques across the acreage.
Tyler Yarbrough, Mississippi Delta project manager for the nationwide organization Partnership for a Healthier America, has worked alongside Pollard on a range of projects building out the region’s local food movement, including some that provide households with produce for a limited amount of time — like Good Food at Home, which has supplied about 500,000 servings of produce to local families through weekly boxes, each household eligible for 12 weeks at a time. Through these shorter-term projects, growers are able to take steps to become more stable, while building a demand for local produce among consumers.
“You can leverage it to bring on the consistency, and to further bring those markets into your orbit,” Yarbrough says.
While produce box models have yielded success, they have the most impact for farmers when they’re paired with other initiatives, according to Yarbrough. What’s key is to give growers flexibility with funding so they can build up over time.
“It can’t just be one thing,” Yarbrough says. “It needs to be coupled with funds for these farmers to actually build their capacity on their farm. It needs to be coupled with connecting all the dots with the market. It has to be a holistic approach.”
Within the Delta region, the local food movement still faces many barriers, according to Natalie Minton, a University of Mississippi researcher who is working with Pollard to study the local food market, and on North Mississippi Food Rx. Growers struggle to find — and afford — workers. And without a reliable market, growing their business is very difficult.
There are also environmental factors. Beyond extreme weather, like drought and severe storms, growers face challenges related to the dominant commodity cropland. Pesticides and chemicals routinely used on commodity crops drift, harming food crops.

Yet, Minton says the roots of change in the local food system are taking hold. The success of farmers like Pollard is showing how specialty farming can be a viable career.
For projects that rely on grants and outside funding like Mississippi Fresh, another major challenge is working with federal programs, according to Miller. Trump administration cuts, including to subsidies that support buying from local producers, are straining local food systems. Delta GREENS is funded through the National Institutes of Health, and Miller says there is uncertainty around whether support will continue. 
Despite the uncertainty, the local food movement in the Mississippi Delta is notable because it is so locally driven, says Marlene Manzo, of HEAL Food Alliance, a food justice coalition that works with groups across the country, including Mississippi Fresh. Manzo says that the growth of the local food supply within the Mississippi Delta shows the power of working at a small scale to make changes that really respond to the community.
“What we do know is building collective power within our communities and in regional systems can really make a large, lasting impact,” she says.
Grady sees a shift happening in the community. She knows more people, including her family members, who are starting to grow some of their own food. One former student is now a chef in a nearby school district. He’s keeping a garden and using the ingredients in the school kitchen.
“The interest of other people wanting to do this kind of work was the greatest reward of it all,” she says.

Hegseth outlined the plan in a July 15 letter to Congressional members, naming Camp Atterbury and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey as two sites available “for temporary use by the Department of Homeland Security to house illegal aliens.” The letter was first published late Thursday by NJ Spotlight News.
The defense secretary additionally noted that holding detainees at the bases “will not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or other military requirements, including National Guard and Reserve readiness.”

The letter confirmed the Trump administration’s plans to utilize military bases amid a capacity crisis in federal immigration facilities. Federal officials have cited overcrowding in Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities as the reason for seeking additional space. 
The Indiana Capital Chronicle reported in May that Camp Atterbury had been floated as a possible location under consideration, but federal officials declined to confirm it at the time. 
It remains unclear when detainees might begin arriving at the Indiana facility or how many individuals could be housed there. Camp Atterbury, located about 40 miles south of Indianapolis, is a federally owned facility that is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard.
The base provides full logistical and training support for up to two brigade-sized elements simultaneously on more than 34,000 acres, according to the guard website.
Carson demands answers on potential migrant detention at Indiana’s Camp Atterbury

The Indiana National Guard did not immediately respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment.
Democrat U.S. Rep. André Carson demanded answers from federal officials in June about the potential use of the base for detentions. He said the use of Camp Atterbury for immigration purposes raises “serious questions” and flagged concerns about legal rights, humane treatment and national security. 
DHS had not responded publicly to the letter as of Friday.
ICE detainees are typically held pending immigration court proceedings or deportation. Advocates have raised concerns over conditions in detention centers and the prolonged nature of some detentions. 
Critics of the Trump administration’s policy warn, too, that prolonged detention could violate civil liberties and strain local infrastructure.
“This kind of mass detention always results in significant rights abuses for the people being detained,” said Chris Daley, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana. “The ACLU of Indiana is very concerned about the dignity and safety of the hundreds of our hard working neighbors who are likely to be held at Camp Atterbury if this poorly conceived plan goes forward as described.”
Camp Atterbury has previously been used to house Afghan evacuees and Ukrainian refugees, but not immigration detainees held under enforcement authority.
During Operation Allies Welcome, the base accommodated over 7,000 Afghan evacuees in 82 lodging buildings across six neighborhoods, complete with dining facilities and medical centers. The infrastructure includes dorm-style housing for families and open bay barracks for individuals, all equipped with heating, air conditioning and plumbing.
Just last month, actor Gary Sinise played a concert at Camp Atterbury for the Indiana National Guard.

State regulators found the company, C&C Manufacturing LLC, created a distillate — or THC concentrate that produces a high in edibles and vape pens — using unregulated THC.
Other manufacturers statewide bought the distillate and used it to make numerous brands of vapes, edibles or pre-rolled joints, including Rove, Zen and Packarillos. A total of 135,000 products were recalled last year.
With Missouri regulations in flux, what’s the difference between hemp and marijuana?

After the state issued the company a notice of pending revocation in January,  regulators discovered C&C had “removed or destroyed all of the marijuana product in its facility as well as its video records,” according to the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation’s Thursday press release announcing the revocation. 
“C&C’s use of unregulated THC to create marijuana products, numerous violations of rule, and destruction of product and records in direct violation of DCR orders demonstrates clear disregard for law at the expense of health and safety and has no place in Missouri’s regulated market,” said Amy Moore, the division’s director.
Matt Cummins, CEO of GOAT Extracts, is listed as the designated contact for the facility and a number of GOAT products are on the list. The Independent reached out to the designated contact number listed on the state’s facility database for comment and did not receive a response.
Some of the unregulated THC involved using “chemical modification,” the release states. That could mean C&C bought a THC concentrate that had been made by converting hemp-derived CBD into THC using a chemical conversion process. Then the company used that to make its distillate, a process that had been used in another major recall case involving the company Delta Extraction.
The recall time frame is quite wide. It goes back to last year when companies were trying to ramp up for recreational marijuana sales.
Nick Rinella, CEO of Hippos Cannabis, told The Independent last year that his company unknowingly bought some of C&C’s distillate in 2023 when Hippos’ own supply was low at its grow and manufacturing facilities. 
But he emphasized that this recall is not because of lack of testing. Once Rinella and other manufacturers got the distillate and made products with it, those were “properly tested” before they went on the shelves, he said.
“We can feel confident that those products were safe,” he said last August. “They passed all the tests, and we have some of the most stringent tests in the country.”
During the recall announcement last year, the division said no adverse reactions involving recalled products have been reported.
The division’s Thursday release states that the violations leading to C&C’s license revocation are “numerous.” 
It states the company violated state and federal law by transporting Missouri marijuana outside of the state. C&C also sold marijuana products in Missouri that did not originate from Missouri marijuana and “failed to preserve records and marijuana products as directed by DCR’s prior directives.”
“The department enforces its regulations to uphold the Missouri Constitution,” Moore said, “and ensure safe access to marijuana product at our licensed facilities.”

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Glen Mawr is a tiny community of 130 people and a smattering of homes next to Muncy Creek in Lycoming County. 
On Monday, a flash flood led to mandatory evacuation orders, as waters from the creek rose almost seven feet in 45 minutes, according to Alan Little, fire chief of Picture Rocks Volunteer Fire Company. 
“We were all trapped in that little town surrounded by water, so we just had to go to higher ground until the water receded,” he said.
Some people weren’t caught off-guard by the flooding, since it is a perennial hazard in the county, as well as a major issue across Pennsylvania, according to Stacey Folk, Lycoming County’s emergency management coordinator.
But to many leaders, flooding doesn’t look the way it used to — not in Lycoming, and not in other parts of the country suffering from more aggressive inland flooding due to the effects of climate change. 
“We are seeing an increase in flooding caused by these isolated thunderstorms that are dumping six, seven, sometimes 12 inches of rain in just a few hours. And then we’re seeing our streams and rivers and things raised drastically in a very short period of time, similar to what just happened in Texas,” said Kelsey Green, the county’s hazard reduction planner.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Guadalupe River in Texas rose 20 feet in 90 minutes and took at least 134 lives during a flash flood on July 4. The tragedy looms large over a slew of flash floods that have hit Pennsylvania this month.
The deadly flooding raised questions about how the Trump administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) led to decreased response times in the wake of the Texas Hill Country floods. 
Those questions have local government officials, like Green, and elected leaders concerned about keeping their communities as safe as possible during natural disasters. 
At the same time, Pennsylvania lawmakers say heightened concern about flooding could generate more political will to accelerate efforts to improve and raise awareness about flood insurance policies for homeowners in at-risk areas around the state.

Rep. Perry Warren (D-Bucks) introduced his bill to require disclosure of past flood events near the properties on sale, as well as disclosure about whether the owner of the property is required to obtain and maintain flood insurance, just four days after the Texas floods.
“When that tragic flood happened in Texas, we said, let’s see what’s ready to go,” Warren said. 
Warren hopes to raise awareness about flood insurance with this bill, which is modelled after a 2024 New Jersey law to enhance transparency around flood risks. Flood insurance requires a separate policy from homeowners insurance, and property owners often realize the policies are separate only after their home is flooded, Warren said.
He is well acquainted with growing flood risks around the state, as his district suffered a devastating flash flood in 2023 when a wall of water swept away vehicles and killed seven people in Hughes Creek, Upper Mayfield Twp. 
“The tragic flood event that caused the deaths of those seven people was just so localized,” he said. “In one place, it’s fine, and a couple hundred yards away, it’s fatal.” 
Warren and Sen. Steven Santarsiero (D-Bucks) launched the Flood Insurance Premium Assistance Task Force after Gov. Josh Shapiro signed enabling legislation in 2023 to make recommendations about laws and policy to strengthen flood insurance. 
The task force recommended lawmakers introduce bills allowing flood insurance premium deductions from state income taxes, as well as tax credits for homeowner spending on flood mitigation, according to a July 2024 final report. Members also recommended requiring earlier disclosures from homesellers about property flood risks and requiring insurance providers include flood risk in their continuing education curricula. 
The disclosure bill is now being considered in the House, and was last re-committed from the Insurance Committee to the Rules Committee. 
Lawmakers have also introduced other recent natural disaster-related legislations, such as Rep. Emily Kinkead’s (D, Allegheny County) bill to protect Pennsylvanians from landslides, which can be caused by flooding and heavy rainfall.
According to her, improvements to mitigate landslide, erosion and flooding risks would likely result in lower insurance costs.

Flooding in focus: Lycoming County 
Heavy rain led to flooding and evacuations across Lycoming and Luzerne counties this week. Glen Mawr evacuated 25 people at 2:30 a.m., who were able to return to their homes less than four hours later. 
No injuries or deaths have been reported, and it is still too early to assess the damage from the flooding, said Folk, the county’s emergency management coordinator. 
Flooding is a major issue in the county because a good portion of its residential property was built in flood plains on low-lying plots of land adjacent to rivers, streams and creeks, said Green, the county’s hazard reduction planner.
Glen Mawr is in a special flood hazard area in the southern part of the county, meaning it lies below the 100-year flood level, an inundation whose odds stand at 1% each year, according to FEMA’s flood map service.
First Street, a non-profit tracking climate risks, calculates a “major risk of flooding”  around Glen Mawr exacerbated by climate change, which would affect a third of all properties in the town over the next three decades. 
Heavy rains, which cause inland surges, are lasting longer and growing more intense, especially in the northeast, as global warming progresses. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) now estimates 90% of natural disasters in the U.S. involve flooding. 
As a result, Lycoming has boasted some of the highest national flood insurance claims in the state over the last 40 years, and had the third-largest share filed among all counties in 2024, just behind Allegheny and Washington counties.
Since 1980, NFIP has spent more than $57 million to pay roughly 3,000 claims in Lycoming, which generally spike during years with hurricane events, according to NFIP claims data. 
Most lenders require flood insurance for homes located in the one percent flood plain or the floodway. Additionally, homeowners with government-backed mortgages in special flood hazard areas, like Glen Mawr, are required to purchase flood insurance, which can be done through the NFIP or private insurers.
Congress is required to periodically renew the NFIP and President Donald Trump signed legislation in March that extends the program until Sept. 30. If Congress allows NFIP to lapse, as has happened four times in the past, it could lead to the cancelation or delay of thousands of residential real estate sales, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Green said people who live in Lycoming County generally use NFIP insurance. The program has consistent rates and cannot cancel insurance when policyholders experience a flood, she noted, whereas private insurers often cancel policies or drastically raise rates after a flood event.
NFIP recorded 718 policyholders in the county, more than the state average of 491, according to the latest data on the cost of insurance through NFIP for single family homes in 2023. This insurance from NFIP costs an average of $1091 a year in Lycoming, while the state average through the program was $940 in 2023.
As the cost of flood insurance increases, Green has watched people on a fixed income, the elderly and people living on retirement savings struggle to afford flood insurance. 
“Flood insurance can be completely detrimental to them staying in their home that they’ve lived in, you know, sometimes their whole lives,” she said.
The aftermath of flooding continues to be a major challenge for the county, which is still recovering from last August’s Hurricane Debby. Like this week’s flooding in Glen Mawr, Hurricane Debby hit isolated areas hard, destroying a fire hall and displacing homeowners who are still waiting to move back a year later, according to Green. 
Flood recovery for residential properties without insurance takes an average of two years, and often takes longer for those balancing recovery on top of full-time work, she said. For those with insurance, the process is still lengthy, but the financial support provides a leg up.
Recovery includes mucking out flooded basements, replacing utilities, removing debris and mold remediation, along with other repairs that can require special permitting for properties in flood plains.
Green agrees that flood disasters in other states, as well as recent ones in Pennsylvania, are building more political will from local and state politicians to invest in flood mitigation. 
Lycoming County is already seeing some positive movement. After years of ongoing talks, Green told Pennlive the county would begin efforts to recertify the Williamsport area levee, Pennsylvania’s second largest flood control system. FEMA first discovered issues with the levee in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina. The project kicked off the day after Glen Mawr evacuated the town for flooding.

A fishing trip to offshore waters turned historic for Logan Smith of Dover, who landed a massive 56-pound, 3.2-ounce Golden Tilefish—setting a new Delaware state record.
“When it bit, I had no idea what it was, because it was pulling drag like crazy,” Smith said. “When me and my buddies finally saw some color from the fish and brought it into the boat, we thought it could be a state record.” Smith, who was surprised at pulling the massive fish aboard, said that as an angler, the state record has been his biggest fishing accomplishment so far.
Smith called the catch the biggest accomplishment of his fishing career to date.
The catch, verified by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), surpasses the previous state record set in 2020 by then-13-year-old Dylan Baker by nearly 3.5 pounds.
Smith made the catch while fishing roughly 60 miles off the coast at Poormans Canyon, aboard the Blue Betty II captained by Austin Decker.
Fishing in 650 feet of water, Smith used whole squid as bait when he hooked the record-setting fish.
The fish, which measured 42.5 inches in length, was later certified by Delaware Natural Resources Police at Hook ‘em & Cook ‘em bait and tackle shop in South Bethany.
The new record is now listed on DNREC’s Fishing Records page, which tracks both freshwater and saltwater state records.

(Photo by Valeriya/Getty Images Plus)Health insurers must provide speedier responses to prior authorization requests for certain medical treatments and services, under a bill that went into law on Monday without Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s signature.
The measure, Senate Bill 133, requires insurers to notify patients within 72 hours whether the requested services are authorized in cases when requests are sent by fax or by other routine means. In cases of expedited requests, the insurer must provide answers within 24 hours, under the bill.
The bill, which passed unanimously in both the Senate and House, is intended to prevent delays in patient treatment, said the main sponsor, Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski.
“Alaskans should not have to fight with their insurance company to get the care they need,” Bjorkman said in a statement. “This bill makes the process quicker, clearer, and fairer for everyone.”
The bill was officially sponsored by the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee, which Bjorkman chairs.
It was supported by medical organizations, including the Alaska Hospital and Healthcare Association, the Alaska State Medical Association and the Alaska Native Health Board.
It also got some qualified support from Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, the state’s largest health insurer.
In a March 25 letter to Bjorkman and members of the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee, Premera said that the version that emerged through the committee process had “some reasonable sideboards as well as incentives that will help plans modernize and improve their prior authorization systems so that these systems optimally serve providers, patients and plans alike.”
Premera said in its letter that it requires prior authorizations for care in only about 2% of cases, unlike insurers that “have been exceedingly aggressive in this space,” requiring prior authorization for up to 20% of all claims.
The bill has some exceptions, caveats and special provisions. For example, it does not prevent insurers from requiring generic versions of medicines prescribed by providers. It also has a section giving guidelines for insurers to grant exceptions for cancer patients who are covered by “step therapy” protocols. Those protocols provide patients with the least expensive medications first before advancing to more expensive medications.
Additionally, the bill gives insurers up to 14 working days to obtain more information from providers if they determine that there is a lack of sufficient information for decisions on prior authorization requests.

Dominic Tangen of Black Hawk County is suing Trooper Bryce Bilharz, alleging he’s guilty of “humiliating and bullying” citizens, and Trooper Michelle Beck of the Iowa State Patrol in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
In his lawsuit, Tangen alleges that on the afternoon of July 12, 2023, he was northbound on Highway 63 in Bremer County when he was pulled over by Bilharz, who correctly suspected Tangen’s car windows were tinted darker than allowed by Iowa law.
  Iowa State Patrol Trooper Bryce Bilharz. (Photo courtesy of the Iowa State Patrol)
During the stop, Bilharz allegedly asked Tangen “about the red tint inside his mouth,” and Tangen replied that he had acetaminophen tablets dissolving on his tongue, adding that he often used the pain reliever to help manage pain related to sciatica in his legs. A bottle of acetaminophen tablets was sitting in plain view in the passenger seat, the lawsuit claims.
At that point, the lawsuit alleges, Bilharz frisked Tangen, searched him, placed him in his patrol car and asked him to submit to field sobriety tests. Tangen agreed but allegedly told Bilharz he might be unable to keep his balance due to his sciatica.
In his police report, Bilharz said he observed indicators of impairment during Tangen’s performance of the “walk and turn test” and the “one-leg stand test” — although, the lawsuit claims, a preliminary breathalyzer test administered at the scene indicated Tangen had a blood-alcohol level of 0.000.
Bilharz allegedly handcuffed Tangen and transported him to the Bremer County Sheriff’s Department for a urine test. At the sheriff’s department, Tangen consented to a second blood-alcohol test that allegedly indicated a blood-alcohol level of 0.000.
While being detained for roughly three hours, Tangen alleges, he was only allowed to use the bathroom once, when Bilharz and Beck collected a urine sample for a drug test. Tangen alleges he was then arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated, was stripped and placed in a holding cell. “Tangen was released after 9 p.m., after being held for almost six hours, and was given his keys and a note as to where he could find his truck,” the lawsuit claims.
Court records show that on Sept. 28, 2023, the Bremer County Attorney’s Office filed a motion to dismiss the OWI charge against Tangen, informing the court the state lacked “sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution.”
According to the criminal court file, county prosecutors acknowledged the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation’s laboratory had “made three examinations or evaluations” of Tangen’s urine and “all three resulted in a determination that no detectable level of controlled substances was present in the defendant’s body when the sample was taken.”
The records also indicate Bilharz’s decision to arrest Tangen was based in part on Bilharz’s status as a drug recognition expert and his alleged observations of Tangen being talkative, “constantly sniffling his nose,” and displaying body tremors during the traffic stop.
Throughout Tangen’s encounter with Bilharz, the lawsuit states, the trooper “bullied” Tangen and behaved in a “condescending” manner.
“Bilharz has a history of unlawfully detaining citizens without probable cause and humiliating and bullying them,” the lawsuit adds. “On at least two other occasions, Bilharz initiated traffic stops which led to unreasonable searches and seizures of citizens who Bilharz suspected of illegal activity without any probable cause … Bilharz humiliated and bullied these citizens during his illegal seizure.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for unlawful search and seizure, false arrest and abuse of process.
The two defendants and the Iowa State Patrol have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The patrol’s spokesperson referred Iowa Capital Dispatch to the Iowa Attorney General’s office, which did not return messages seeking comment Thursday afternoon.
According to the Iowa State Patrol’s Facebook page, Bilharz graduated from the Iowa Department of Public Safety Academy in 2020, has worked with the patrol’s District 10 team in Oelwein, and is a field training officer and defensive tactics instructor.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ISP.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

From CalMatters Digital Democracy reporter Ryan Sabalow:
California’s court reporter shortage has gotten so bad that thousands of people, including alleged domestic violence victims, no longer have a written record of their civil cases, making it harder for them to exercise their constitutional right to appeal.
But it appears controversial legislation that court reporters were pushing is dead in the Legislature for the year, giving the California Supreme Court time to rule on a pending case that could decide whether California’s law prohibiting recording in many types of cases is unconstitutional.
Last month, CalMatters reported on how the court reporter shortage has soured to the point that legal aid associations petitioned the state Supreme Court to invalidate California’s law banning recording in certain civil cases. 
The petitioners argued that the ban creates a “two-tiered” justice system where wealthy litigants have the option of hiring private court reporters to type up a written record. But people who can’t afford the more than $3,000 a day to hire a contract reporter are at the mercy of an understaffed court system.
After the petition had been filed, the court reporters union sponsored legislation that critics feared could conflict with the court’s decision and make the problem worse. 
But earlier this week, the union’s Assembly Bill 882 was suddenly pulled off the Senate Judiciary Committee calendar. The bill, which would have lifted a recording ban on court proceedings for three years, needed to pass the committee to advance, making it likely dead for the year. Assemblymember Diane Papan, a San Mateo Democrat and bill author, didn’t return messages. 
The bill’s apparent death comes after California Attorney General Rob Bonta last month took the unusual step of weighing in on the Supreme Court case, siding with petitioners. 
Bonta wrote that many low-income litigants can’t get a record of their court hearings, “including proceedings that affect some of the most significant aspects of their lives.” He said the situation has become untenable for both litigants and the courts.

Trump guts high-speed rail, AmeriCorps funding

Let’s dive into two endeavors President Donald Trump’s administration is cutting federal funding for:

California’s High-Speed Rail project: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday said the state is suing the Trump administration over its termination of $4 billion in funding for the state’s high-speed rail project. The day before, the U.S. Transportation Secretary said it was “time for this boondoggle to die.” The massive infrastructure undertaking is intended to connect San Francisco to Los Angeles and boost local economies along the way, such as Central Valley’s Fresno. But it also has had a ballooning budget and missed deadlines. Though Trump and Republican lawmakers have been among the project’s most vocal critics, support among Californians has remained relatively steady over the years. 


AmeriCorps: After Trump’s order in April to cut funding for the public service program, California lost over 5,600 Americorps workers and $60 million. California and 23 other states are suing the administration, and in June a federal judge granted a temporary injunction to reinstate Calfiornia’s grants and allow AmericaCorps workers to return to work. But many of the workers aren’t coming back, and Trump’s recent federal budget does not include money for the program after 2026. This would lead to hundreds of California schools that have Americorps staffing facing severe worker shortages in tutoring, mentorship and after-school programs.

And lastly: Security or secrecy?

After the June shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers, the California Legislature is advancing a bill that would hinder journalists from accessing public officials’ contact information. Press freedom advocates say the measure would deny reporters information that would help keep officials accountable. Find out more from CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: As the Legislature advances a bill that would require the state Board of Education to adopt phonics-based instructional materials, the dream of one renowned expert who pushed for the adoption of phonics but died in 2022, gets closer to being realized.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Though Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin has not said whether he is planning a run for president in 2028, he said during the Iowa GOP Lincoln Dinner on Thursday that he supports keeping the Iowa caucuses first in the nation.
Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann asked Youngkin during a “fireside chat” at the fundraiser if he likes the current presidential nominating system that starts with the Iowa Republican caucuses — and Youngkin responded he “absolutely” supports the current system.
“Here’s why: The beginning of the nomination process starts with incredibly informed voters,” Youngkin said. “You see, the difference in the way that the caucus system works, and the way a normal primary works. You all know this, is it is a moment to fully understand issues candidates, and what that candidate can do. And so often, primaries are a day when someone shows up and just pulls on a pulls on a lever because a friend whispered in their ear, ‘vote for them.’”
The Lincoln Dinner, an annual event held by the Republican Party of Iowa, has historically hosted presidential candidates and hopefuls who aim to introduce themselves to Iowa caucus voters. In 2023, leading up to the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses, 13 presidential candidates including President Donald Trump spoke at the event.
Though it’s still early in the cycle for candidates to announce their intentions for a bid in 2028, Youngkin has been brought up as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. His trip to Iowa, as well as plans to headline the Silver Elephant Gala in South Carolina, the SC GOP’s biggest fundraiser — both events in early states during the GOP presidential nomination cycle — have fueled speculation that he may be considering a run.
Youngkin gained prominence among Republicans nationally after his initial election to the Virginia governor’s office in 2021, when he defeated Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, becoming the first Republican to hold the office in over a decade. Governors cannot serve consecutive terms in Virginia, meaning he will have to leave the seat after his term ends in 2026.
The Virginia Republican was formerly co-CEO of the Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C. private equity firm. He did not have previous political experience before becoming governor, and spent more than $20 million of his own money to fund his 2021 campaign, according to the Associated Press.
In his gubernatorial campaign, Youngkin focused on “parental rights” issues related to education, opposing allowing sexually explicit material in school curriculum and to mask and vaccine mandates in K-12 schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Youngkin told Iowa Republicans these are the issues that motivated Virginians to vote for him in the 2021 election, despite Democrats having a history of winning the state.
“In a state that was blue, it didn’t matter … whether you’re a Republican parent or a independent parent, or even many Democratic parents, they said my children are the most important thing in my life, and I will decide I do not co-parent with the government,” he said.
He said during his time as governor, he was able to enact many laws allowing parents to have a say in their children’s education — and said his next goal is to create a private school scholarship program in Virginia, similar to Iowa’s Education Savings Account program using public funds for private school tuition and associated costs.
He said passing the “Virginia Opportunity Scholarship” program will be more difficult in Virginia than it was in Iowa, as both chambers have Democratic majorities. He added, “when I hear about these supermajorities (in the Iowa Legislature) I sit back there and go, ‘oh my goodness, wouldn’t that be great?’”
“We’re going to get this done,” Youngkin said. “We’re going to have Virginia opportunity scholarships so that families who couldn’t otherwise send their children to private schools have an opportunity to make that decision and exercise their right to make decisions for their kids.”
The Virginia Republican said his stance on education, as well as on issues like supporting law enforcement, lowering taxes and shrinking government, are positions that most Virginians share — but “they just didn’t know it” before hearing from his campaign in 2021.
“Virginians came together in a way that we couldn’t believe,” he said. “They said no to the left and yes to common sense, conservative values, policies. And it was a moment that made me so proud to be a Virginian. I have to say — it’s the exact same feeling I had when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The exact same feeling that common sense conservative policies not only win, but a vast majority of Americans want them and believe in them.”
Though Youngkin did not discuss future plans following his current term as Virginia governor, Kaufmann told reporters following the event that Youngkin’s stop showed the importance of having the Iowa caucuses lead the nation by providing a platform for potential presidential candidates long before the 2028 campaign season kicks off.
Iowa’s job, Kaufmann said, “is not to pick the president, but to provide an avenue where everybody can see what these candidates, potential candidates, have to say.”
While Iowa Republicans are set to keep their position as first in the nation in 2028, the Democratic presidential nominating calendar for the upcoming election cycle is less clear. Iowa lost its starting position in the 2024 Democratic nominating cycle. While the Democratic National Committee is set to reconsider the early state lineup before the next presidential election season, Iowa has lost its seat on the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee, meaning a return to holding the first-in-the-nation caucuses looks unlikely.
Youngkin said the Democratic Party “made a massive mistake in abandoning Iowa as their first stop and abandoning their process.” Kaufmann echoed this sentiment, adding that he is willing to work with Iowa Democrats to restore their position in the nominating calendar.

(Photo courtesy Patrick Donnelly, Center for Biological Diversity)Federal land managers are seeking to fast-track a geothermal project that would be built adjacent to the sole habitat of an endangered toad, a move conservation groups said they intend to challenge in court.
The “Dixie Meadows Geothermal Utilization Project” is one of nine geothermal projects in Nevada by developer Ormat Technologies that could soon be approved under the Trump administration’s new emergency permitting procedures, according to state records. 
Three of those projects have already been approved under the new expedited rules, which aim to cut permitting timelines by up to a year or more for energy developments on public land.
Once approved, the Dixie Meadows geothermal project would be built directly adjacent to the only known habitat of the endangered Dixie Valley toad – a 760-acres of wetland habitat fed by hot springs in the remote Dixie Valley northeast of Fallon. 
According to state records from the Nevada Department of Wildlife obtained by the Center for Biological Diversity, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management plans to authorize the Dixie Meadows geothermal project under “emergency” permitting procedures within the next two months.
Federal wildlife managers have previously stated the project would likely adversely impact the Dixie Valley toad by altering groundwater at Dixie Meadows, a finding that led to the toad’s listing under the Endangered Species Act.
The Center for Biological Diversity sent a formal notice to the Bureau of Land Management last week announcing its intent to sue the Trump administration for violating the Endangered Species Act through the emergency permitting process. 
During his first month in office President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” as grounds for fast-tracking lengthy environmental reviews and permitting processes for energy projects deemed critical to national security.
The Center for Biological Diversity said their formal notice was one of the first challenges to Trump’s executive order declaring an “energy emergency” as a means to expedite energy projects on public lands. 
In their lawsuit notice, the conservation group said an emergency approval of the Dixie Meadows geothermal project would bypass required actions under the Endangered Species Act, including full consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
The Center for Biological Diversity also disputed the existence of an energy emergency and Trump’s authority to declare one under federal law.
“This fake energy emergency is being used to justify extinction, but in this country laws mean something and presidents can’t act with impunity,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
“Presidents don’t have unilateral authority to declare an emergency where one doesn’t exist so they can do whatever they want,” he added.
Energy production in the U.S. hit an all-time high in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Several energy sources—natural gas, crude oil, natural gas plant liquids, biofuels, solar, and wind—each set domestic production records last year.
Ormat did not respond to requests for comment on the possibility of the project’s approval under the new emergency permitting process.
Ormat has been locked in a legal battle over the Dixie Valley geothermal project since 2021, when the Center for Biological Diversity and the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe sued the federal government for approving the project.
The Bureau of Land Management initially approved the geothermal project in 2021, but the agency withdrew their approval after the Dixie Valley toad was listed as an endangered species following a federal review that determined the planned geothermal plant would likely threaten the toad’s survival.
“Since we successfully got the toad protected under the Endangered Species Act and BLM withdrew the project approval our lawsuit has been in suspended animation ever since,” Donnelly said. 
Ormat responded to the toad’s endangered species listing by submitting a plan to significantly reduce the size of the project. Ormat also sued the Biden administration over its decision to list the Dixie Valley toad as endangered.
Geothermal power plants draw on wells drilled deep in the earth’s crust, pumping up steam and hot water to power giant turbines that generate electricity. Opponents of the Dixie Valley geothermal project and federal wildlife officials have emphasized research showing the negative effects of other geothermal plants on groundwater-dependent springs in Nevada.
One such plant is the McGinnis Hills geothermal power plant, managed by Ormat, where water flows in the Jersey Valley Hot Springs began declining not long after commercial power production started in 2012.
Ormat has repeatedly argued that newer technology pioneered by the company would eliminate the groundwater depletion attributed to older, outdated geothermal plants the company has since phased out.
Ormat has also argued that federal wildlife officials used faulty data based on older geothermal technology when they determined the Dixie Valley geothermal project was a possible risk to the Dixie Valley toad. 
Geothermal is one the few renewable energy sources the Trump administration is promoting as part of its “American Energy Dominance” plan. 
That could draw more geothermal development to Nevada, which is home to some of the largest undeveloped geothermal resources in the country. 
Nevada is second only to California in geothermal electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Nevada produces about 26% of total geothermal energy in the nation, and has the potential to grow.
A recent report released by the U.S. Geological Survey found that untapped geothermal energy in the Great Basin — which covers most of Nevada — could produce electricity equivalent to 10% of the current U.S. power supply. Geothermal currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. electricity generation, according to the EIA.
Nevada was also the first state to get geothermal projects approved under Trump’s new emergency permitting process after the three geothermal projects were fast-tracked in the state last month. 
Those projects include the Diamond Flat Geothermal Project near Fallon; the McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project in Lander County; and the Pinto Geothermal Project along the Oregon-Nevada border.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hot-spring-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

(Photo: iStock/Getty Images)For housing voucher recipients in Nevada, the average cost of rent is far higher than their monthly income, meaning cuts to the voucher program would almost certainly result in them losing their housing, according to a new analysis.
The average monthly income for Nevadans participating in the Housing Choice Voucher program, commonly known as Section 8, is $1,442 while the average rent is $1,742, according to a report released Thursday by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley.
The report comes amid uncertainty about the future of federal housing assistance funding. President Donald Trump’s 2026 fiscal budget proposed steep cuts across various agencies, including slashing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development budget by more than 40%.
Housing vouchers, already scarce, would be even harder to get under Trump’s budget bill

Those who successfully qualify for housing vouchers pay about 30% of their income toward rent, and the voucher covers the remaining proportion of the rent, including utilities.
Nevada was among the top five states where rents are drastically outpacing monthly income for voucher recipients. California, Florida, Arizona and Colorado were the other states in the top five.
“If a voucher were to disappear out from under them there is really no way to feasibly continue living in that apartment for the average household,” said Ryan Finnigan, deputy director of research at the Terner Center.
Even if federal funding is not cut, there could still be problems, Finnigan said.
“Without an increase in the budget, the program’s resources are going to fall behind and there may be a situation where folks might lose assistance because the rents are outpacing the growth of the program’s budget,” he said. “There is a need to proactively push for the expansion of the program if we want to keep the same number of people supported as there are today.”
An estimated 2.4 million households nationwide rely on housing vouchers, including 17,137 households with vouchers throughout Nevada, according to the report. 
The analysis also found that a quarter of those households in Nevada earn an income from wages, a quarter include people with disabilities, 39% of the households have children, and 34% are headed by a person 62 years or older. 
Thousands more are estimated to be on the waiting list for a voucher in Nevada, similar to long waits across the country. 
“The average household nationwide waits almost 2.5 years between applying for a voucher and leasing a home with one; and in many places, the average wait exceeds five or more years,” the report says. 
In most of the country, without a voucher, people would not be able to afford the places they live.
Nationwide, the average housing recipients’ total monthly rent, including utilities, is “over 100 percent of their monthly household income,” the report found, and “the average rent-to-income ratio for voucher holders was 1.1.”.

The report also broke down voucher recipients in nine Nevada counties and found Clark and Nye counties have the highest rent-to-income discrepancies 
Voucher recipients in Clark earn about $1,465 a month while their rents are on average $1,875 a month. Nye voucher holders on average earn $1,164 a month and pay $1,445 on rent each month. 
Washoe and Humboldt are the only two counties where rent for housing voucher holders is lower than their monthly income.
The average monthly income in Washoe is $1,404 while rent is $1,215 on average. In Humboldt average rent is $1,538 and monthly income is $1,613.  
The ratio for the two counties is similar to Wyoming, the state with the lowest rent-to-income ratio among voucher holders: average monthly income for a recipient is $1,438 while the average rent is $1,026.
While lower than most states, having 71% of monthly income go toward the total cost of rent, which would happen without a voucher, isn’t sustainable, Finnigan said.
“What we’re seeing even in the states where we think of as somewhat affordable like Wyoming where the gap is the smallest, without the voucher the average incomes for the households that have a voucher just would not be able to afford (rent),” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1455654374-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

Because of a lawsuit, the state’s program can restart, at least temporarily, but schools and disaster relief sites are still reeling from staffing shortages.","In summary
Trump cut AmeriCorps, laying off over 5,600 of California’s public service workers. Because of a lawsuit, the state’s program can restart, at least temporarily, but schools and disaster relief sites are still reeling from staffing shortages.


AmeriCorps may have won a temporary legal reprieve to keep operating, but the long-term future looks bleak for the popular program that sends thousands of workers to California schools, food banks, health clinics, and disaster relief sites.
In an effort to rein in government spending, President Donald Trump cut funding for the program in April, prompting California and 23 other states to sue in a Maryland district court. In June, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction, reinstating California’s grants and allowing its AmeriCorps workers to return to their jobs. But many workers who are eligible to return have found other employment. 
Congress has already approved funding for AmeriCorps for the next fiscal year, which begins Aug. 1. The Trump administration has yet to release the money, which normally arrives earlier this summer. Josh Fryday, director of the state’s Office of Service and Community Engagement, said he didn’t know when the money would be available — or if it would get released at all. 
“The administration does not communicate with us,” he said in an interview. “Instead they make rash decisions that hurt our communities.” 
Even if the money does arrive this year, Trump’s recent budget proposal does not include money for AmeriCorps after 2026, which means the 32-year-old program may end unless another funding source comes through.
The loss of the program would have a deep impact on hundreds of California schools, particularly those serving low-income students, where AmeriCorps staffs tutoring, mentorship and after-school programs.
“The negative impact of these illegal DOGE cuts hurts our communities. It has nothing to do with efficiency or cutting bureaucracy — it makes us weaker,” Fryday said last week during a visit to an AmeriCorps program in Napa. “But California is not backing down.” 
Following April orders from Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, California lost over 5,600 AmeriCorps public service workers and over $60 million in funding. 
The 24 states suing the federal government say that the money had been appropriated by Congress to provide crucial government service and that the Trump administration lacked the legal power to cut it. The injunction will remain in place until the court makes a final ruling. States that didn’t sue are exempt from the injunction and any future rulings.
The deadline for the California’s AmeriCorps workers to return was last week, but about half of them didn’t come back — often because they found other opportunities — leaving dire staffing shortages in programs that thousands of people rely on.
‘Like having a hand cut off’
In Napa County, school officials have been scrambling to fill dozens of vacancies and find money to create permanent jobs for AmeriCorps staffers. It’s been especially challenging with the slew of other education cuts schools are facing: the end of pandemic relief grants as well as White House cuts to after-school programs, migrant education and other programs.
AmeriCorps has been “invaluable,” said Napa County Superintendent Barbara Nemko. “They don’t earn a lot of money but they provide an incredible service. Losing them was like having a hand cut off.”

Maria Lopez, a psychology student at Napa Valley College, spent last year as an AmeriCorps worker at the after-school program at Northwood Elementary in Napa. She choked up when she described her experiences in the program. 
She developed close relationships with the children and felt she could help them through their social and emotional challenges. When students had tough days, she would encourage them to talk about it, “laugh, cry, be angry … basically, understand that it’s OK to show emotions,” she said.
“Some of these kids were special to me because I’d see them have a hard time, but then see how they grew,” Lopez said. “They’d say, ‘Miss M, thank you for helping me, you were here for me when my parents weren’t here or when I doubted myself.’ … Those moments I had with those kids are always here in my heart.”
She was among those who were laid off when the White House slashed funding. She dreaded telling her students.
“It was tragic,” Lopez said. “There was a lot of crying. Some were devastated. … These kids need this support. It changes lives.”
In the end, Lopez was lucky. Napa County Office of Education found money — at least for now — to hire her as a regular after-school program worker, and she hopes to continue working there after school reopens this fall.
Alexis Lopez got involved with AmeriCorps in part because she knows what life is like for kids with no place to go after school.
When she was younger, she and her brother would wait for hours outside their Napa elementary school for their mother’s shift at a local senior facility to end. They’d watch the secretary lock up and go home, and just keep on waiting, hour after hour.
“I know first-hand how much kids need after-school programming,” Lopez said. 
As a student at San Francisco State, Lopez thought she wanted to be a teacher, but changed her mind after she signed up for AmeriCorps and was assigned to work in the after-school program at Napa Unified. 
She immediately fell in love with it, and decided to make it her career. She’s now the site coordinator for the after-school program at Phillips Elementary. And her years of AmeriCorps service allowed her to pay off her student loans.
She was shocked when she heard the program had been cut.
“My heart sank,” Lopez said. “This program has such a huge impact on kids. It just feels horrible because it’s beyond your control.”
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has his own history with AmeriCorps. Just after he graduated from Yale in the early 1990s, he worked for a community organization in New Haven, Conn., that later became part of AmeriCorps. He worked for more than a year as a mentor and tutor in an after-school and summer program in a public housing facility.
He recalled students confiding in him about their struggles, fears and goals. He also got a glimpse of the difficult — and sometimes dangerous — circumstances his students navigated, and how much they benefited from positive role models.
“It was one of the most meaningful and impactful experiences of my life,” Bonta said during a visit to Bel Aire Park Elementary in Napa last week. “It sparked my passion for public service.”
Sudden layoffs put Los Angeles fire relief on hold 
President Bill Clinton started AmeriCorps in 1993, based loosely on the Peace Corps and 1960s-era War on Poverty programs intended to bolster community service and volunteerism and help those in need.  
AmeriCorps workers in California — typically, college students and recent graduates — earn a small stipend, plus up to $10,000 in grants to offset tuition and student loans. Older Americans are also eligible and can pass their education grants to their children or grandchildren.
The cuts caught workers and program directors off guard and left roughly 50 California projects in sudden limbo. Even state-funded public service projects are at risk because they rely on the federal government to provide education grants to their staff. 
“We were not given really any information,” said Amber Gibson, who runs an AmeriCorps program for the Red Cross. At the time of the cuts, she was overseeing about 20 service workers who were providing assistance to victims of Los Angeles’ Palisades and Eaton fires. Another organization, California Emergency Response Corps, had assigned over 50 members of its AmeriCorps team to provide additional disaster relief. 
Together, AmeriCorps workers from the two groups assisted YMCA centers manage donations while helping thousands of victims apply for and ultimately access federal disaster relief. Often, they worked 10-12 hour shifts, said Nadia Rodriguez, the program director of the California Emergency Response Corps.
By the last week in April, the AmeriCorps disaster relief work suddenly stopped. “We had people flying home and driving home within 48 hours of that notice,” Rodriguez said
Using state money, the California Emergency Response Corps was able to rehire its AmeriCorps workers in different positions, though they were no longer able to work on rebuilding efforts in Los Angeles. That kind of relief work is more expensive, said Rodriguez, so without federal funds, it wasn’t feasible anymore. 
The Red Cross has less state money available and decided to close its program entirely soon after Trump announced the cuts in April, Gibson said. 
“I worry with these programs getting cut what happens to future humanitarians,” she said. “Disasters are increasing in frequency. We’re in a state of continuous response, and we were building the next generation of leaders who are responding to these threats.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/091214_AmeriCorp_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

In our first decade, CalMatters journalism has brought communities together, inspired lawmakers to create a better California and made the state more accountable to Californians. 


Today marks 10 years of CalMatters’ nonpartisan, independent journalism that Californians depend on to build a better future.
It also marks a decade of Californians using CalMatters journalism to spark real, demonstrable change: Lawmakers cracked down on private colleges profiteering on students. Communities came together to save Christmas for families facing eviction. State law has expanded worker compensation for first responders experiencing post traumatic stress. The state launched a “robust statewide” mental health hotline. Federal courts said Border Patrol actions in the Central Valley were likely unconstitutional. Republicans and Democrats called for an investigation into financial aid fraud at California’s community colleges, and so much more.
CalMatters is a member-supported nonprofit newsroom. We exist because we believe journalism keeps our government transparent and our leaders accountable. We also believe that our journalism gives Californians — community members,  businesses, nonprofits, regulators and lawmakers — the information they need to make critical decisions.
Here are a few ways that CalMatters’ journalism has made a difference, and is still making a difference, for people in California and beyond.
Through our work with you:

We bring people together, literally.
We make the state more accountable to Californians.
We make local government more accountable to Californians.
We inspire lawmakers to create a better California.
We also hold lawmakers accountable for their actions.
We make the federal government more accountable for how it impacts Californians.
We make companies and nonprofits more accountable to the people they serve.
We generate more government transparency.

Two California families were reunited in 2025 after seeing loved ones who are homeless quoted in CalMatters articles.
One woman found her sister after losing contact with her in 2019. Another woman found her father, who she’d been searching for without luck. In addition to sharing the stories of these two families, CalMatters also created a resource on what to do if your loved one is homeless.
At CalMatters’ voter guide events, Californians with polar opposite views listened to one another and some even changed their minds.
During a series of events CalMatters hosted to help community members connect and debate the many propositions on the ballot during the 2024 elections, we saw: community members with polar opposite views passionately and respectfully argue for what they believe; community college students say they changed their minds (and how they’re going to vote) on a proposition after listening to each other’s experiences; and neighbors who had been arguing for months on social media meet each other in-person and walk away with mutual respect. One community member described the conversations as: “Democracy at its best.”
Evictions in several parts of California were cancelled, and local communities helped families that CalMatters profiled.
After CalMatters’ pandemic-related series on the more than 2 million Californians who were behind on rent and subject to eviction without the temporary moratorium, evictions in several areas in the state were canceled and communities started helping the families we profiled by paying their rent and sending them gift cards to buy Christmas presents.

Nearly 200 drivers, who had all been convicted of killing someone with their vehicle, have had their driving privileges suspended or revoked.
In 2025, CalMatters reporters had identified about 400 cases from 2019 to 2024 in which the drivers’ convictions weren’t listed on their driving records, largely because the courts failed to report that information. After reporters asked county courts across the state about these cases, 32 courts so far have reported more than 275 missing convictions to the DMV. Afterward, nearly 200 drivers who’ve killed had their license suspended or revoked, according to updated DMV reports. Our now-published story reveals that California courts have failed to report hundreds of vehicular manslaughter convictions to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles over the past five years, allowing deadly drivers to improperly keep their licenses.
Class action lawsuit filed against California’s health insurance exchange website. California Congressman asks HHS to investigate the site for HIPAA violations.
After our forensic testing in 2025 found that Covered California shared with LinkedIn visitors answers to sensitive questions, such as whether they were pregnant, blind or disabled, or used a high number of prescription medications, the organization said it has now removed all advertising tags across its site. The website removed its LinkedIn trackers as we reported our article. Days after publication, the website admitted that it also shared the last four digits of people’s social security numbers, a class action lawsuit was filed, and Rep. Kevin Kiley, citing our story, asked the Department of Health and Human Services to launch an investigation into whether Covered California violated HIPAA.
Fraud in California community colleges triggered call for a Trump investigation.
Citing CalMatters reporting, in 2025, nine Republican U.S. representatives called on U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate financial aid fraud at California’s community colleges. In a separate letter, state Assemblymember Blanca Rubio, a West Covina Democrat, asked the state to conduct its own audit on the matter. This rare moment of bipartisan concern came soon after CalMatters reported that fake community college students have stolen more than $10 million in federal financial aid and more than $3 million in state aid in the last 12 months. That’s more than double what they stole in the previous year.
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a proposal to make an under-utilitized financial aid program more accessible for students.
A CalMatters report in 2023 showed that thousands of Californians are missing out on federal student aid and that even though several other states pushed to fix the issue, the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office didn’t make such a push, even after education advocates put forward a proposal five years ago. Soon after our story, state leaders decided it was time to look into that proposal again, and Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sonya Christina, the new chancellor Newsom appointed, announced financial aid reforms. Newsom’s office estimated that “four million Californians without a high school diploma will have access to federal financial aid to attend college classes.”
After repeated questions from CalMatters, California Department of Social Services announced $95 million in emergency aid to flood victims.
The money will go to flood victims in a long-awaited program to assist undocumented residents suffering hardship and damage from months of storms. The 2023 announcement followed weeks of enquiries from CalMatters and others about assistance to undocumented residents affected by the storms. Two months earlier, Gov. Gavin Newsom promised flood victims that help would come from the state’s Rapid Response Fund, however, his office had provided few details despite repeated queries and criticism.
California Secretary of State reversed course and will no longer reduce the number of languages in which election ballots are required to be translated.
One week after a CalMatter’s story that California was reducing the number of languages for translation of ballots and voter information, the Secretary of State reversed that decision, expanding the number of languages from 10 back to 27 for the 2022 election, starting with the June 7 primary.
State Department of Health Care Services found $20 million to help pay for new crisis hotline.
After a CalMatters story in 2021 on the state’s inability to fund the newly created 9-8-8 mental health hotline system, the state Department of Health Care Services announced that it would spend $20 million to help support the 9-8-8 network, a move that surprised even those advocating for the funding. The 9-8-8 network is billed as a “robust statewide call center” designed to be an alternative to 9-1-1 calls.
The state’s largest pension board lowered its expected rate of investment return three months after an investigation about the exploding debt levels.
A 13-part series done in collaboration with the Los Angeles Times in 2016, found that the state’s unfunded liability in its largest pension fund had grown to $241 billion, requiring annual payments exceeding the cost of environmental protection, wildfire suppression and drought response combined. The stories traced the gap to a 1999 bill that was supposed to expand pension benefits at no additional cost to the state. Former Gov. Gray Davis acknowledged for the first time in the series that he should not have signed the bill. Lowering the expected rate of return forced state and local governments to increase their pension contributions, but reduced the likelihood that the gap would continue to grow.

Fremont backed down after proposing a ban on ‘aiding and abetting’ homeless encampments.
In 2025, Fremont’s city council revised a new city camping ordinance, removing what had become a controversial clause — first reported on by CalMatters — that could have punished those “aiding and abetting” encampments. The ordinance makes it illegal to camp on streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public property, but what separated it from other efforts was explicit language that would make anyone “causing, permitting, aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal encampment guilty of a misdemeanor. Local homeless advocates feared this could be enforced against  workers and volunteers providing aid to unhoused people in Fremont.
Los Angeles worked with the LA Black Worker Center to get 88 people waiting for employment hired quickly.
With many Black workers retiring and a high city-job vacancy rate, Los Angeles promised to hire 200 Black trainees through a partnership with the L.A. Black Worker Center. After CalMatters reported in 2024 that the partnership was failing short of its goal, Mayor Karen Bass’s office appointed Deputy Mayor Brenda Shockley to work with the center to get 88 people waiting for employment hired quickly. 
After being contacted by CalMatters, a local water agency admitted its lobbying reports had inaccuracies and bills that did not exist that session, and corrected the errors.
CalMatters’ story and analysis in 2023 revealed that local governments, using taxpayers’s money to lobby the Legislature and state agencies, are not subject to disclosure requirements for why a city lobbies on a particular bill or what position it’s taking. Instead, they are only required to file reports with the Secretary of State’s office each quarter when they spend money on lobbying.

Lawmakers advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight, citing our reporting as the catalyst for action.
Under the new proposal, local governments would be required to perform annual inspections of taxpayer-funded shelters, and cities and counties could lose state funding if they fail to correct code violations or keep neglecting to file mandatory reports. The bill has passed the assembly and is on to the senate. The 2025 proposal followed a CalMatters exposé on homeless shelter failures, and our 2024 investigation revealing that cities and counties have been ignoring a state law requiring basic safety and sanitation checks in shelters. Watch lawmakers discuss this bill, and our reporting. 
Lawmakers proposed bills to address worker wage theft.
After a 2022 CalMatters series documenting long waits and low payouts for workers who claim their employers have shorted them on wages, California lawmakers proposed bills in 2025 to try to ease the backlogs. One measure, Senate Bill 310 by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, would allow workers to recoup more money through private lawsuits instead of filing claims through a heavily delayed system at the Labor Commissioner’s Office. Another bill, by Fremont Democratic Sen. Aisha Wahab, aims to push employers to pay up faster after workers have won their claims. SB 261 would require the Labor Commissioner’s Office to publicly post all its decisions against employers who have not yet paid claims. It would also allow the office to seek more fines against employers who do not pay within six months.
Lawmakers introduced a bill to protect a patient’s health insurance eligibility during the first 28 days of treatment.
Following a CalMatters investigation, Assembly Bill 669 was introduced in 2025 to keep health insurance plans from reviewing a patient’s eligibility for continuing substance use treatment until at least 28 days after they’ve been approved. Matt Haney, a Democratic state assemblymember from San Francisco who authored the bill, said his interest in the bill was inspired by the story of Ryan Matlock, whose story was featured in CalMatters in October 2024. 
Lawmakers passed legislation requiring hospitals to notify county government 120 days before closing a labor and delivery or psychiatric unit.
When Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat from Campbell, first introduced the bill in 2024, he cited CalMatters’ reporting on the alarming rate of maternity ward closures. CalMatters found at least 56 maternity wards have closed across California since 2012. The closures have happened in both rural and urban areas, resulting in long drive times for patients and overwhelmed obstetrics departments in neighboring communities. At the same time, rates of maternal mortality and complications were increasing.
Lawmakers passed a bill expanding workers’ compensation coverage for California first responders experiencing post traumatic stress.
Following CalMatters’ series on the mental health crisis facing California’s firefighters, Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat, introduced a bill in 2023 that would expand workers’ compensation coverage for first responders experiencing post-traumatic stress. Laird said the CalMatters series “set the context” for his bill and other efforts to address the mental health crisis among first responders. The bill was signed into law later that year.
Lawmakers passed legislation requiring employers to disclose COVID-19 outbreaks.
Companies fearful about slowing production were failing to notify public officials or even their own employees about COVID-19 outbreaks. The CalMatters investigation in 2020 found six outbreaks at seven companies that were not properly disclosed, contributing to the sickening of more than 350 workers. Assemblymember Eloise Gomez Reyes credited CalMatters for revealing the severity of the problem, and introduced a bill that would require California employers to notify their employees of COVID-19 cases, as well as alert county public health departments. The bill was signed into law later that year.
Lawmakers introduced a package of seven bills to crack down on private colleges profiteering on students.
After a CalMatters investigation, in collaboration with the Sacramento Bee, found a backlog of more than 1,200 complaints about fraud at private colleges and a more than a year long delay in responding to problems, in 2019, Assemblyman David Chiu said he was inspired to work with colleagues on a package of bills to regulate for-profit colleges. CalMatters’ investigation had detailed promises made by colleges of lucrative jobs that never materialized, leaving students thousands of dollars in debt. Later that year, multiple bills, such as AB 1340 and AB 1344, were signed into law.

We also hold lawmakers accountable for their actions.

California’s political watchdog fined a former lawmaker $106,000, after CalMatters reporting.
A five-year Fair Political Practices Commission investigation into former Democratic Assemblymember Evan Low found that Low used his technology-focused nonprofit to pay actor Alec Baldwin more than $227,000 to appear at a tech event and a separate fundraiser for Low, then deliberately tried to conceal the payments. The FPPC opened its investigation in 2020, on the same day that CalMatters reported that he had stopped disclosing donors to a nonprofit organization affiliated with the Legislature’s technology caucus, which he chaired.
Grieving moms discovered that California lawmakers killed a popular fentanyl bill by not voting.
As a part of a 2024 CalMatters and CBS News investigation into how California democrats kill bills without voting against them, a group of grieving moms who fought for fentanyl legislation learned that a popular bill with 22 bipartisan senators signed as coauthors died in committee because four Democrat Senators opposed the bill and chose not to vote. Of the 1 million votes cast by current legislators since 2017, CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database revealed that Democrats vote “no” less than 1% of the time.
The Fair Political Practices Commission to update the regulations and laws that govern donations made to charities at a politician’s request.
Commission chairman Richard Miadich particularly cited CalMatters’ Sweet Charity series, which revealed that the amount of money flowing to nonprofits controlled by California legislators or their staff has skyrocketed over the last decade — from $105,000 in 2011 to $2.9 million in 2019 — and showed that much of the money comes from corporations and unions that lobby the Legislature.

Federal courts said Border Patrol actions in the Central Valley were likely unconstitutional.
After Border Patrol agents swept through the Central Valley on a surprise immigration raid, CalMatters exposed as false the Border Patrol leader’s statements that the raids were targeted at criminals. In response to an ACLU lawsuit, the Department of Homeland Security told a federal court it will retrain more than 900 California-based Border Patrol agents on how to comply with the Constitution. Still, a federal court forced the Border Patrol to stop conducting warrantless immigration stops throughout a wide swath of California, including in its ruling reporting from CalMatters.
A judge stopped the immigration raids sweeping across Los Angeles.
With aggressive, masked agents upending life across Los Angeles, CalMatters’ reporting drew the clear connection between the Central Valley raids. Our reporters showed how people were being taken from the streets without warrants and not being allowed to speak with attorneys. Again civil rights groups sued, citing CalMatters reporting, and in July 2025, a judge ordered a halt to the immigration operations.
Trump administration restored the UC Davis dementia research it gutted as part of its DEI purge.
The National Institutes of Health reversed its termination of a $36 million grant to a UC Davis researcher studying dementia, one day after CalMatters reported on the cancelled grant and the researcher filed an appeal. The NIH cancelled the grant in March 2025, following the federal spending ban on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The research in question focuses on the role vascular health plays in causing dementia, such as injury to blood vessels in the brain and how that could relate to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Bank of America sued over EDD unemployment debit card fraud.
Citing CalMatters reporting, a 2021 class-action lawsuit accused Bank of America of exposing unemployed California workers to large-scale fraud and cutting off access to jobless benefits during the pandemic. A few months prior, CalMatters broke the story on how confusion over mass unemployment fraud during the pandemic led to finger pointing between the state and Bank of America, which has been contracted since 2010 to electronically pay out unemployment benefits.

In 2025, Los Angeles officials began releasing thousands of internal records related to conditions inside homeless shelters in response to a CalMatters lawsuit challenging their repeated public records denials. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, better known as LAHSA committed to releasing at least 175 incident reports every other week until the public records request is fulfilled. The agency estimated there are 5,000 such reports.

Advocacy group threatens to sue for access,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/san-mateo-sheriff-removal-complaint/,The First Amendment Coalition is urging San Mateo County to open to the public its deliberations on removing embattled Sheriff Christina Corpus.,"In summary
The First Amendment Coalition is urging San Mateo County to open to the public its deliberations on removing embattled Sheriff Christina Corpus.


An open government advocacy group is threatening to sue a California county that is preparing to discuss firing its elected sheriff behind closed doors. 
San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus, who serves one of the wealthiest communities in the country, has faced calls for her removal since an explosive November report from a retired judge found that she likely violated the county’s policy on nepotism and conflicting relationships. 
The report alleged that, by 2024, Corpus had “relinquished control” of the department to a subordinate. That led to a ballot measure last year that voters passed to empower the county Board of Supervisors to remove her from office, which they voted to do in June. Corpus appealed, leading to the scheduled August evidentiary hearing.
As part of the removal proceedings, Corpus’ legal team asked that the removal hearing take place behind closed doors. 
“The county should decline,” wrote First Amendment Coalition attorney Aaron Field in a letter to the county Board of Supervisors. “Barring the press and public from the removal hearing as Sheriff Corpus has requested would violate the First Amendment right of access to public proceedings, undermine a panoply of compelling public interests in administering the removal hearing transparently and needlessly shut San Mateo citizens out of a key phase of a process.” 
The hearing is scheduled to begin Aug. 18 and is expected to last about 10 days. 
CalMatters originally filed a request to open the June removal hearing to the public, a request that was denied. The First Amendment Coalition is making the same request for the August removal hearing.
Corpus’ removal – and her fight against it, including unsuccessfully filing for a restraining order to stop the proceedings – have roiled her department and the community for nearly a year. Several cities in her county have given her administration no-confidence votes, and the unions representing both her deputies and her sergeants have called for her removal.  
A San Mateo County spokesperson said the county had received the First Amendment Coalition’s letter and would announce a decision next week. 
“The county has consistently expressed its view that this should be a fully transparent process, including having the August appeal hearing for her removal from office be open,” said San Mateo County spokesperson Effie Milionis Verducci. “However, the sheriff has blocked it.”
The sheriff’s department is still in turmoil, most recently when Corpus put a San Mateo County sheriff’s sergeant on leave. That sergeant had testified extensively in (a second county investigation into Corpus). The union representing San Mateo County Sheriff’s sergeants objected, alleging the sergeant was put on leave as retaliation for his testimony.
Corpus denied that her actions had anything to do with the report in a statement posted to the sheriff’s office website on Monday. 
“His temporary administrative leave is entirely unrelated to any comments or cooperation he may have provided in the Keker report,” Corpus said in the statement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/111324_Christina-Corpus_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

Seth Jason, an Edgewater resident, was arrested early Thursday by U.S. Capitol Police and the Anne Arundel Police Department, according to a statement issued by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.
Jason faces one count each of influencing a federal official by threatening a family member, influencing a federal official by threat, interstate communications with a threat to kidnap or injure and anonymous telecommunications harassment, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday in federal court in the District of Columbia.
Federal investigators said Jason repeatedly threatened to assault and murder members of Greene’s family between Jan. 26, 2024, and Jan. 8, 2025.
Additionally, Jason is accused of making threats directly against Greene between Oct. 11, 2023, and Jan. 21, 2025. Prosecutors allege in the indictment that Jason made the threats by telephone and attempted to hide his identity.
Greene is a MAGA conservative and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump.
An investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police found the phone calls were made from various phone lines connected to studios and control rooms at Voice of America headquarters, where Jason had was a longtime employee. In eight calls made over 15 months, Jason threatened the use of firearms to kill Greene, her staff, and their families, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office.
Jason is represented by Annapolis attorney J. Dennis Murphy, according to online court records. Murphy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.
Anne Arundel County Police, in a statement, said Jason had served as a volunteer reserve agent since 2016. Reserve officers have no police authority and do not carry weapons. The department said Jason, following his arrest, is “no longer affiliated with” the department.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.

Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.










There isn't a single app out there that's going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That's just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
 Arkansas’ example

Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.
States push Medicaid work rules, but few programs help enrollees find jobs

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
 Other state efforts

Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

The Alabama Public Library Service Board Thursday voted to consider adding language to its administrative code that would ban materials with positive depictions of ""transgender procedures"" or nonbinary gender from children and youth sections. (Ralph Chapoco/ Alabama Reflector)The state board governing Alabama libraries plans to amend its administrative code to add language effectively prohibiting positive descriptions of “transgender procedures” or “the concept of more than two biological genders” in material for children and youth.
Members of the Alabama Public Library Service Board Thursday voted to open a public comment period on the proposal from board member Amy Minton, one day after Chair John Wahl said he would prohibit libraries from circulating materials related to the undefined idea.
“Last time, we did have a public hearing, we had 6,750 letters, six hours of comment, from a lot of pediatricians, a public hearing, before we passed the last code, so I think it is important,” Minton said during the meeting.
APLS revised its code last year to require libraries to restrict children from having access to materials considered sexually explicit or inappropriate or possibly their state funding.
Wahl said during Thursday’s meeting he was uncomfortable having board members voting to define gender ideology and said modifying the code would be the best approach.
Minton would add language that says “any material that promotes, engages, or positively depicts transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two biological genders, shall be considered inappropriate for children and youth.”
The recommended change would prevent libraries from receiving state funding if children and youth sections in their libraries contain materials, books or otherwise, that fall under the language.
Wahl’s Wednesday letter cited a January executive order issued by President Donald Trump that attacked gender ideology without defining it.
“Any federal grants that the APLS Board distributes have to follow the rules found in that executive order,” Wahl said in an interview after the meeting about his letter. “It talked about the federal executive order, if you are getting federal grants, that money cannot be used to promote gender ideology. It was informing local libraries about what is happening at the federal level, and that the grants that we administer in 2026 are going to have these requirements tied to them.”
Wahl’s letter addressed federal grant money. Minton’s request deals with funding allocated by the state, a sum greater than what libraries would receive from the federal government.
Pelham Public Library Director Mary Campbell, director of the Pelham Public Library, characterized Wahl’s letter as a misunderstanding.
“The misunderstanding there is that we should be going back into our collections,” she said in an interview following the meeting. “The implication that we should remove anything about gender ideology in order to be eligible for federal funds is not, to my understanding, true. What it would mean is if we applied for federal funds, and we received them, those funds could not be used to purchase gender ideology books, or to have programs or anything like that.”
The library directors said the grants they received for the current fiscal year are not tied to gender ideology.
“We have used them a lot for technology, to replace computers as they age out,” Campbell said.
Wahl and other members Thursday delayed a decision on whether to resume state funding that they suspended for the Fairhope Public Library in March after some patrons complained that it continued to have inappropriate materials in sections dedicated to minors.
Wahl said the Board will hold off on deciding until the library board for Fairhope completes its review of the books that have been challenged.
Randal Wright, chair of the governing board of Fairhope Public Library, said they have one book left before completing the review. Board members have reviewed 13 of the 14 books that were challenged and moved five to the adult’s section.
“Our feeling is, in our community, the books that we have read cannot be considered sexually explicit,” Wright said in an interview following the meeting. “They might have a paragraph, or two or three sentences, that are sexual, but it is not written to arouse or titillate.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20240223_130227-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)It’s not surprising that a guy with a gold-gilded New York City apartment would want to decorate a forest with 250 statues.
What might surprise South Dakotans is how close President Donald Trump’s National Garden of American Heroes is to becoming a Black Hills reality.
Tucked among the hundreds of pages in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress passed and Trump signed, there’s a provision appropriating $40 million for statue procurement.
The bill doesn’t designate a location, but multiple signs point to the Black Hills as a contender. Trump was in the Black Hills, after all, when he announced the idea five years ago during a speech at Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Earlier this year, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden offered Trump a site about a mile east of the mountain carving, where members of a prominent Rapid City family are willing to donate undeveloped land bordering the Black Hills National Forest.
South Dakota governor asks Trump to build promised statue garden and put it near Mount Rushmore

If the Black Hills location is chosen, a peaceful pocket of nature will be obliterated to make way for a new road, a parking lot and statues of Kobe Bryant, Julia Child, Whitney Houston, Vince Lombardi and Alex Trebek.
Those debatably statue-worthy names from sports and entertainment are all on the list Trump released in 2021, along with a bunch of names most people have probably never heard of, plus dozens of historical figures such as Paul Revere, Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King Jr.
The project has supporters, but many people who love the natural beauty of the “island in the plains” are likely to oppose the man-made intrusion. It wouldn’t be the first time a politician wrongly anticipated broad public support for a Big, Beautiful Black Hills Idea.
Nearly 10 years ago, then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard was convinced that Spearfish Canyon should have a state park. But where he saw a canyon in need of state management for throngs of visitors like those at Mount Rushmore and Custer State Park, many locals saw a natural treasure in need of protection from exactly that kind of development and increased visitation.
Daugaard eventually gave up in the face of opposition, but that didn’t stop people from flocking to Spearfish Canyon, much of which lies within the federally managed Black Hills National Forest. Modern methods of information sharing have turned some of the canyon’s locally known secret spots into congested tourist destinations.
Some Black Hills residents have conflicted feelings about that. They know tourism is vital to their economy. They also know that if the Black Hills is overpromoted and overdeveloped in pursuit of tourist dollars, it’ll wreck some of the natural beauty that inspires tourists to visit in the first place. There has to be a balance.

Few people understood that better than the late Peter Norbeck, a legendary South Dakota governor and U.S. senator. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, he hiked and rode horseback over Iron Mountain more than 20 times while surveying a route for Iron Mountain Road. The winding ribbon of asphalt that resulted from those efforts intentionally forces drivers to slow down and appreciate the surrounding forest and mountains.
In some ways, the road intrudes on those surroundings, not only with pavement but also with tunnels that frame Mount Rushmore. Those intrusions were carefully planned to complement nature and the mountain carving. The rest of the route twists and turns around the scenery to preserve as much of it as possible.
Norbeck fought for his circuitous route against engineers who favored cheaper, easier and more destructive ways to cut a road through the area.
“He insisted,” wrote Norbeck’s biographer, Gilbert Fite, “that none of the natural beauty be destroyed.”
The proposed Black Hills site of the National Garden of American Heroes is a stone’s throw from Norbeck’s meticulously designed road. It’s unlikely he would have supported a spontaneous, ill-considered installation of 250 statues that would drastically change the character of the route.
And it’s apparent that Norbeck — who devoted much of his life and career to conservation — knew a little more about what’s best for the Black Hills than a guy who’s spent a lifetime putting his name on tall buildings.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Leavenworth District Court judge finalized his decision to bar CoreCivic from housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement prisoners at its closed facility, rejecting the private prison company’s appeal to reconsider.
Judge John Bryant on Friday approved the language for the injunction that will be in place while the two parties fight out their disagreement in court. Bryant cited potential damages to Leavenworth if CoreCivic is allowed to skip the city’s development process.
“The Court also believes that the balance of harms in this case favors the City,” Bryant wrote. “While CoreCivic now has the ability to increase revenue that it has lacked since 2021, it also has had other remedies available to it in order to move this process further along toward a resolution.”
Those “other remedies” refer to going through the city’s development process to get a special use permit, which is what started the disagreement between the two parties. When CoreCivic announced it would reopen the facility, which closed in 2021, as the Midwest Regional Reception Center, the city in March demanded the company apply for the permit.
In court documents, attorneys for Leavenworth said the company needed a special use permit and indicated the city wanted to address problems with the prison management. One judge had called the former prison a “hell hole,” and the city cited numerous instances of CoreCivic prison officials refusing to cooperate with local law enforcement.
CoreCivic pushed back against the need for a special use permit in a new petition filed July 7, saying the city didn’t follow its own development process and maintaining its argument that a special use permit is unnecessary because the company previously operated the site as a prison.
The petition said CoreCivic anticipates about $50 million in annual revenue from its ICE contract to house “1,000 nondetained noncitizens” and laid out the benefits to the community from an annual payroll of $30 million, plus $10 million for local spending by the plant.
“Regarding last week’s hearing and any other court documents that have been filed, we do not have any updates to share beyond the fact that we are pursuing all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” said CoreCivic spokesman Brian Todd in an email. “We maintain the position that our facility, which we’ve operated for almost 30 years, does not require a Special Use Permit to care for detainees in partnership with ICE.”
A hearing has not been scheduled for CoreCivic’s latest petition.

(Getty Images)Four times a year, the polling outfit Morning Consult publishes approval ratings of the nation’s governors, and the latest survey released Wednesday indicates pretty much the same thing the survey always shows: Voters nationwide, when asked if they approve of their governor, tend to say something along the lines of: yeah, guess so.
In the poll released this week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is approved of by 53% of Nevadans polled, compared to only 32% who disapprove of the first-term governor. 
The last time I looked in on Morning Consult’s quarterly approval polls, in November 2023, Lombardo was the 19th most popular governor. The Better Nevada PAC, which exists to make Nevada better for Joe Lombardo’s career, had even put out a statement boasting about how their man was “one of America’s most popular governors.”
The PAC at the time didn’t disclose that by “one of the most popular” they meant 19th out of 50.
This week, the Better Nevada PAC again hailed Lombardo’s performance in the quarterly poll, exclaiming (literally) that the governor has a “net approval at +21%!”
And the PAC once again neglected to mention how Lombardo’s approval stacks up against his cohorts nationally.
There are 23 governors with higher net approval ratings than Lombardo’s in the latest Morning Consult survey. Looked at the Better Nevada PAC way, his net approval rating is most impressive. Looked at another way, it’s a wee two places from being in the bottom half of governors’ approval ratings nationwide.
Lombardo’s approval rating was a little shy of 50% in the first quarter of 2023 — his first as governor (lackluster honeymoon, sniffle). He also dipped a point or two below 50% in polls over the last three quarters of 2024, which can be attributed to a populace politicized, and hence polarized, by a presidential election year. 
Other than that, his approval rating has been pretty steadily in the fifties.
Just like that of nearly every other governor in the country.
And that makes sense.
Unless they do something salacious or sleazy or there is, oh, a pandemic that shuts down the economy, governors are rarely figures to whom people with lives and jobs and such pay much attention. 
Imagine if a poll asked Nevada voters to name the most significant thing Lombardo did during this year’s legislative session. 
Does anyone think 53% of Nevada voters (the percentage of survey respondents who said they approve of Lombardo) could accurately identify even one specific thing Lombardo did? Does anyone think 33% could? Maybe 23%?
Below-average Joe
The most significant thing Lombardo did during this year’s legislative session, by the way, was breaking his own record and vetoing 87 bills. (If you don’t believe me, just ask the Nevada Republican Party.)
Very early in his tenure as governor, Lombardo, a former sheriff who campaigned in his uniform while marketing a tough guy persona, sought to brand himself as a can-do governor of action who would be “getting sh*t done.” 
Like Lombardo and his brain trust’s early effort to make everybody start saying “the Nevada Way” except not sarcastically, the branding never really caught on.
But with his veto pen, Lombardo has made a slam dunk case that he is excellent — indeed, better than any governor in the state’s history — at making sure things don’t get done, including and especially nice things like paid leave, the right to reproductive assistance including in vitro fertilization, and long overdue reforms to Nevada’s notoriously tenant-hostile rental statutes. 
So what accounts for, as the exuberant-about-Lombardo PAC put it, his “net approval at +21%!”?
As the Morning Consult poll shows time and again, put the word “governor” in front of somebody’s name and it almost guarantees an impressive net approval rating.
In the latest Morning Consult poll, only one governor has an approval rating (42%) lower than their disapproval rating (49%), Iowa Republican Kim Reynolds, for reasons … eh, that Iowa’s business.
Of the ten least popular governors in the Morning Consult poll, only two others had approval ratings south of 50%, Maine Democrat (and genuine profile in courage) Janet Mills, and Rhode Island Democrat Dan McKee. And both of them still had net positive approval ratings.
The national average net approval difference between those who approved of their governor and those who disapproved was 22.7%.
The Better Nevada PAC might want to rethink the exclamation point on its social media post heralding Lombardo’s net approval of “+21%!.” Unless of course the PAC sincerely is excited to see the governor scoring below average.
The default approval voters give to governors perhaps more than any other elected officials (certainly more than they give to members of Congress) makes incumbent governors especially difficult to unseat provided they run a competent campaign (and Lombardo’s handlers have run several over the years).
Two incumbent Nevada governors have failed to win a second term in this century. Republican Jim Gibbons was a train wreck, so grown-up Republicans (remember those?) took him out in the 2010 primary. Democrat Steve Sisolak’s reelection bid in 2022 was infected by the coronavirus, and recovery was hindered when Sisolak and allied groups mistook Donald Trump for Voldemort and refused to say his name.
Presumably Democrats won’t be repeating that strategy next year. Trump wasn’t president when Lombardo was elected governor in 2022. Trump will be president when Lombardo is seeking reelection next year. Trump will be holding rallies (oh joy) in Nevada again, and Lombardo will be at them. Whether Lombardo likes it or not.
Lombardo’s 2022 victory wasn’t a triumph of policy arguments and inspiration, but the product of sharp political calculus and navigation that started when the state’s most high-profile Republican consultants snubbed a former U.S. senator and backed a county sheriff instead, for the simple and sound reasons that the senator was yesterday’s damaged goods and the then-Clark County sheriff had won elections in the most-populated part of the state.
Occasional polls giving governors high net approval ratings don’t mean those governors are electoral juggernauts.
But that’s the thing about governors. They don’t have to be.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-499728904-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:57:32.379896

Joseph, a renowned expert on reading instruction, came out of retirement in the 1980s to wage a personal crusade for the adoption of phonics, doing battle with educators who stubbornly supported a rival system called “whole language” that was failing to raise reading scores.
Phonics stresses fundamental instruction in the letters and letter combinations that make up sounds, thus allowing children to “sound out” words and later whole sentences and passages. The whole language approach assumes that reading is a naturally learned skill, much like speaking, and that exposing children to reading material will allow it to emerge.
Having realized that her own grandson, then a first-grader, was having difficulty with reading, Joseph began pestering the state’s politicians to adopt phonics, persuading then-Gov. Pete Wilson in the 1990s to appoint her to a commission on reading instruction and then the state Board of Education, platforms from which she could pursue her mission.
However, she achieved only modest success in what were dubbed “reading wars,” and after she left the school board the whole language approach re-emerged as dominant.
Reading scores on state and national academic tests continued to languish, with fewer than half of fourth-graders reading at an acceptable level.
School districts that had voluntarily adopted phonics demonstrated remarkable gains. They recognized that the ability to read is fundamental to succeeding in other academic skills, such as mathematics.
Finally substantial numbers of legislators decided to intervene, and a pro-phonics contingent began pushing measures that would compel school districts to adopt what has been dubbed the “science of reading,” backed by a phalanx of education reformers.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has struggled with dyslexia, a disorder affecting his ability to read, supported the efforts and included $200 million in the 2025-26 state budget to train teachers in phonics.
Meanwhile Assembly Bill 1454 is moving quickly through the legislative process. Sponsored by pro-phonics legislators including Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, it would require the state Board of Education to adopt phonics-based instructional materials and include phonics in reading teacher credential programs.
The pro-phonics moves are drawing praise from EdVoice and dozens of other educational reform groups.
“When a child learns to read, they don’t just decode letters on a page, they begin to dream bigger, think more critically, and imagine a future beyond what they can see. Today’s committee approval brings us one step closer to all California children reading at grade level,” said Marshall Tuck, CEO of Ed Voice, after the bill cleared the Senate Education Committee last week. 
Assemblymember Blanca Rubio, a West Covina Democrat who has become the Legislature’s top phonics advocate, said, “After months of hard work and collaboration, we are making steady progress toward delivering on our promise to teach all California children to read. The support we saw today in the Senate Education Committee moves us closer to ensuring that no child falls through the cracks because they weren’t taught to read using scientifically proven reading methods. The continued bipartisan support on this bill tells us that California is ready and motivated to lead on literacy.”
The actions fall a bit short of requiring local school districts to adopt phonics, but they go a long way toward achieving Marion Joseph’s goal.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/030725_Literacy_FM_CM_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

Three Republicans will seek the nomination for House District 13 in Walker County. With no Democratic candidate in the race, the GOP primary will serve as the effective election. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Three Republicans have qualified for a special election in House District 13, which covers part of Walker County.
Republican voters will choose between Greg Barnes, Dustin Beaty and Mike Elliot on Sept. 30, with primary runoff on Oct. 28, if needed. With no Democrat in the race, the winner of the GOP primary will be the presumed representative for the seat.
The seat was previously held by former Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, who was elected to the State Senate on June 24. 
Barnes, 67, is a retired contractor. He said in an interview he is running for the seat because he has the time and experience to represent the district fully, he said. He ran in the 2022 primary election against Woods and received 11.4% of votes, according to election results. 
Barnes said in an interview Thursday that he is prioritizing mental health, veterans support and parental rights in education.
“We desperately need consistent financial support for the mental health institutions in Alabama and to assist the mentally ill in our society,” Barnes said. “Placing them in prison or in jail doesn’t help them or society in the long term. This needs to be addressed before they become too mentally ill to be helped.”
He said voters should choose him because he is self-financing his campaign.
“I’m not taking any PAC money donations or any money from anyone,” he said. “This in itself allows me to serve all of the people in District 13 in the great State of Alabama equally and be completely unbiased when it comes time to make a decision.”
Barnes has put in $20,000 to his campaign and spent $7,700 since May, according to campaign finance records.
Beaty, 52, is a pharmacist and owns several businesses in Jasper. He said he is running for the seat to support the county on the state level. His priorities are mental health, economic development and education.
“I am a recovering addict myself, but so that’s something that I think I bring a unique perspective to being a part of the solution,” Beaty said in an interview Thursday. “Do we look at people who have struggled and choose to lock them up, or do we look at and reach out with a hand of friendship?”
He said voters should choose him because he has lived in Walker County his whole life and understands the challenges that the community faces.
“My leadership is grounded in action, not talk. My campaign is built on conservative values and a deep belief in servant leadership,” Beaty said. “It’s shaped by faith, family and commitment to Walker County.”
Beaty has also put $20,000 of his own money into his campaign, raised more than $75,000 and spent more than $33,000 since March, according to campaign finance records.

 Community members and elected officials gathered at Fenton’s First Presbyterian Church Thursday for a teach-in celebrating the work, life, and legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. 
Lewis, who represented Georgia’s 5th district for 34 years, is best remembered for his role as a Civil Rights leader who fought relentlessly for racial justice and voting rights while advocating nonviolence. Lewis was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1986, and, until his death in 2020, he was the “de facto representative of the Civil Rights Movement.”
Now, five years after his passing, groups around the country convened for a day of action honoring Lewis’ philosophy: the fight for good trouble. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Good Trouble Lives On is a nationwide day of peaceful, nonviolent action rooted in the legacy of the civil rights movement, aimed at bolstering civic engagement. More than 1,600 events were held across the country to mark the occasion, as well as highlight the ongoing attempts to restrict civil rights by the Trump administration.
The Fenton teach-in was one of several throughout the state, and was hosted by Indivisible Genesee, Livingston, and Oakland Warriors (GLOW). Speakers included former U.S. representative Dan Kildee (D-Flint), state Senator Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), Genesee County Clerk Domonique Clemons, and Harold Ford, a teacher and community advocate.
Kildee spoke highly of his friend and colleague, sharing stories of Lewis’ “incredible wisdom, incredible intellect, [and] incredible goodness.”

Lewis is perhaps best known for his role in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. At 25 years old, Lewis led 600 peaceful protesters across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were met with overwhelming brutality from the police. The imagery of that day– March 7, 1965– galvanized the public and ultimately led to the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act, which was signed into law five months later.
Kildee recalled being invited to attend the annual reenactment of the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge along with Lewis. With the mayor and city manager out of town, the highest-ranking city official– the one tasked with welcoming the marchers at Brown Chapel AME Church– was Montgomery’s chief of police.
“When John had arrived in Montgomery a few decades earlier, that Chief of Police, who was tasked to protect the Freedom Riders, wasn’t wearing that blue police uniform,” Kildee pointed out. “That police department had traded in their police uniforms for a different kind of uniform. They were clothed in white with masks over their faces, and they nearly beat John Lewis to death.”
Almost fifty years later, Montgomery’s Chief of Police removed his badge and gave it to John Lewis.  
“What I remember so much about it is how gracious John was,” Kildee added, noting that Lewis wanted to make sure that the officer would be able to get another badge. Moreover, Kildee explained, Lewis forgave that police chief’s predecessor.
“His kindness poured out into that church in a moment that could have been a reminder of ugliness. It was a reminder that we can all be good to one another, and John represented that more than anything.”
This was just one of many moments that revealed John Lewis’ patient, unshakeable spirit. Kildee noted that Lewis would carry that spirit– and the unwavering dedication to creating change– until the end of his life.
At the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Congress adopted a rule that allowed a member of Congress to designate another representative to carry their vote to the floor of the House at their direction and cast it on their behalf.
Lewis, who had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer in December 2019, asked Kildee to carry his vote. 
The gravitas of this task was not lost on Kildee.
“I knew John and I had become friends, but I guess I didn’t understand quite how close we had become,” Kildee explained. “Because the man whose name and life is most associated with what he would call ‘the precious right to vote’… asked this kid from the west side of Flint to carry his vote to the floor for the last few months of his life.” 
Five years later, Kildee continues to shoulder that legacy.
“John asked me to carry his vote. His vote was his voice. He didn’t tell me that I should stop when his life ended,” said Kildee. He then implored the audience to do the same: “Act as John would have– fight hard, never give up, never ever quit. But do it with joy, with love and compassion.”  
Clemons shifted the focus from Lewis’ legacy to the present, contextualizing his fight through the lens of contemporary voting rights struggles.
“Since the Voting Rights Act has passed, we have not seen ever, until now, more attacks on the very basic fundamental right to vote across the country,” said Clemons. “We’ve seen time and time again, efforts to strip away people’s rights to vote.”
  Genesee County Clerk Domonique Clemons speaks at the “Good Trouble Lives On” gathering at Fenton’s First Presbyterian Church to honor the legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. July 17, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig
However, he also pointed out that, while voting rights are being targeted across the nation, Michigan has bucked the trend. With initiatives like early voting, no-reason absentee voting, the permanent absentee ballot list, pre-registration for 16-year-olds, and automatic registration through the Secretary of State, Michiganders tend to support the expansion of voting rights and access.
The reason, Clemons asserted, is simple: your vote is your power.
“If you had something so powerful that could change the entire course of history, why would you not use it?” Clemons asked.
In addition to being Genesee County’s first African American clerk, Clemons is both the youngest and the first openly LGBTQ+ clerk in Michigan. 
Through a series of anecdotes, McMorrow, who is also a candidate for U.S. Senate, emphasized that everyday people have the power to lead, organize, and create lasting change. Among those she spoke of was Brandon Wolf, who never expected to become an activist but, after surviving the Pulse Nightclub shooting, testified before Congress and went on to become national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign; and Judge Damon Keith, who used his platform to speak out against secret deportations because “democracy dies behind closed doors.” 
McMorrow’s comments highlighted a critical juxtaposition: a single voice can spark lasting change, but lasting change doesn’t come from a single voice alone.
“We can’t look for a quick fix or the political messiah,” she told the audience. “I know that so many of us want to find the next Barack Obama, the next shiny new thing, the next one person who’s going to fix it.”
  State Senator Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) speaks at the “Good Trouble Lives On” gathering at Fenton’s First Presbyterian Church to honor the legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. July 17, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig
The truth, McMorrow added, is that no single person holds all the answers. A president is not a panacea, a congressman is not a cure-all. On the contrary, she elaborated, it falls to the people– each and every individual– to “rise up, come together, and meet this moment by doing the work.”
“That’s what John Lewis showed us how to do,” she concluded. “And I think he’d be the first to tell you that it’s not going to be easy and it’s not supposed to be. But if we want to protect our freedoms, if we want a government that works for the people, not millionaires and special interests, then we’ve got to show up, dig in, and stay in this fight.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6889-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

I urge our legislators to support an increase in tobacco taxes.

As Vermont lawmakers work to reshape our education system and ease the burden of property taxes, it’s worth asking: why not turn to a revenue source that also improves public health— tobacco taxes?
Vermont’s cigarette tax hasn’t changed since 2015 and remains at $3.08 per pack. Increasing that tax by $1.50 would offer dual benefits: it would reduce smoking-related illness and death, and generate much-needed revenue for education reform.
The health benefits are clear. According to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, such an increase could reduce smoking rates by up to 10.6% and help about 1,900 Vermont adults quit. That means hundreds of lives saved every year — 500 fewer premature deaths, many from preventable heart attacks. At UVMMC, nearly half of all heart attack patients are current smokers.
Tobacco-related illness costs Vermont $404 million annually, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Reducing smoking will reduce these costs significantly. Over five years, we could save $340,000 from fewer lung cancer cases, $570,000 from healthier pregnancies and births, and $270,000 from reduced heart attacks and strokes. Vermont Medicaid alone could save $380,000 in that period — and long-term savings from reduced tobacco use could top $26 million.
And there’s more. In the first year of a $1.50 tax increase, Vermont would collect an estimated $9.57 million in new revenue — funds that could directly support a better, fairer education system for all our children.
This is a chance to do what’s right — protect public health and support our schools. I urge our legislators to support an increase in tobacco taxes. Let’s turn a deadly habit into a lifeline for Vermont’s future.

(Courtesy of the Utah State Department of Corrections)With lethal injection drugs proving both costly and difficult to obtain, a growing number of Republican lawmakers and state officials are pushing for an alternative: the firing squad.
Lethal injection is currently the only method of execution authorized under Indiana law.
After a yearslong pause, the state resumed executions in December, using a single-drug protocol of pentobarbital to put Joseph Corcoran to death. A second execution followed in May, when Benjamin Ritchie was executed with the same drug. Together, they marked Indiana’s first executions since 2009.
A third execution for convicted murderer Roy Lee Ward is tentatively set for October and would also be carried out by lethal injection.

Republican Rep. Jim Lucas said he’s now exploring legislation to allow executions by either firing squad or gallows, however. Both methods are “cheaper, easier” and already permitted in several other states, he said. 
Lucas pointed to the high cost of lethal injections in Indiana, emphasizing the $300,000 price tag for a single dose of pentobarbital.
“That price, that fact right there is why we should be looking at other methods and forms of capital punishment,” Lucas told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “These other methods are certainly a hell of a lot less expensive than our current method with lethal injection drugs.”
Republican Gov. Mike Braun stopped short of endorsing any specific execution methods but pointed to South Carolina, which recently reinstated the firing squad as an option after years of delays due to its inability to obtain lethal injection drugs.
In June, Braun disclosed that Indiana officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
The governor said Indiana no longer has any usable lethal injection drugs. Instead of purchasing more — and risking expiration, given the drug’s 90-day shelf life — his office plans to order new execution drugs only when legal proceedings are near finishing.
Braun has repeatedly suggested, too, that the high cost and short shelf life of the drug should prompt new discussions on how the state approaches capital punishment moving forward. He called on lawmakers to debate the future of capital punishment in Indiana in their next session.
Discussion stirring around new methods
Even so, Indiana’s General Assembly doesn’t return until January, meaning any potential changes to the state’s execution policy are still months away.
Lucas said he has not yet had conversations with leadership or other lawmakers about his proposal, though he plans to introduce it.
“This is an issue that just fairly recently developed,” he said. “I know this is a controversial issue, and if it does come up, I think everybody will treat it with the respect that it deserves as we move forward in the discussion.”
But Republican House Speaker Todd Huston told the Capital Chronicle this week that his caucus hasn’t had any serious discussions about firing squads or other changes to Indiana’s death penalty law.

“There was a bill filed last year (to eliminate the death penalty), but there didn’t seem to be a lot of discussion about it,” Huston said. “We really haven’t talked about any of this.”
When asked whether the cost of lethal injections might push lawmakers to consider alternatives, Huston replied: “Maybe, but I think we should just probably have a fair discussion about it first.”
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray similarly told the Capital Chronicle that the issue “has not come up in his conversations with caucus members.” 
He said earlier this year that a bill filed by Republican Rep. Bob Morris — which originally sought to abolish the state’s death penalty statute  — included “language … that was very interesting to me.” But Bray similarly said at that time that no formal discussion had taken place within the Senate GOP caucus.
Although Morris’ bill never received a committee hearing in the House and ultimately died, it garnered support from several GOP lawmakers, including Sen. Liz Brown, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith also pointed to firing squads as a viable alternative. 
 Rep. Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, speaks on the House floor on Monday, April 14, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
He posted on social media in June that firing squads are “much cheaper than lethal injection” and that “Indiana should follow Idaho’s lead on this,” referencing that state’s 2023 law authorizing firing squads when lethal injection drugs are unavailable.
Rep. Andrew Ireland shared Beckwith’s post on X with the comment: “Stay tuned.”
Ireland told the Capital Chronicle he’s also working on new legislation to authorize alternative execution methods, including the firing squad.
“Some crimes are so horrific, so depraved, that the only just sentence is death,” Ireland said. He specifically cited Ward, who was convicted in 2007 for the rape and murder of 15‑year‑old Stacy Payne. 
“What’s missing now isn’t justice — it’s a responsible, workable method to carry it out,” Ireland continued.
The Indianapolis Republican legislator echoed Braun’s concerns about the cost and shelf life of lethal injection drugs, calling the current approach “unsustainable” and unfair to victims’ families.
“That’s why I’m working on legislation to give Indiana real alternatives, including the firing squad — a method that is fast, effective, and constitutional,” Ireland said. “If we believe the death penalty is still law in Indiana, then we should have the means to enforce it. Otherwise, we’re just giving false hope to victims’ families and sending the wrong message to the worst of the worst.”
Where firing squads are used — and how they work
Currently, five states authorize the use of firing squads under certain circumstances: Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and South Carolina. 
A law review article tallied 144 executions carried out by firing squads in the United States as of 2016.
But only a handful have occurred in recent decades, most recently in Utah, in 2024, and in South Carolina, where the method was used twice earlier this year.
Another execution by firing squad is scheduled for September in Utah.
Idaho’s Department of Correction, meanwhile, has paused all scheduled executions as it wraps up retrofitting of the state’s death chamber for firing squad readiness by mid‑2026. A new law passed earlier this year makes firing squads the primary method of execution in Idaho.
During a firing squad execution, the condemned is typically secured to a chair using leather straps across their waist and head, facing a canvas wall. 
 The above shows the execution chamber in the South Carolina Department of Corrections’ Columbia prisons complex, as seen from the witness room. The firing squad chair (left) was added following a 2021 state law that made death by firing squad an option. The electric chair is under the cover. (Provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections)
Witnesses to the 2010 execution of Ronnie Gardner in Utah reported that a doctor used a stethoscope to find and pin a circular cloth target over the inmate’s heart. Sandbags surrounded the chair to absorb blood, and a hood was placed over Gardner’s head.
A team — usually made up of five volunteer prison staff or corrections officers — stands some 20 to 25 feet away, behind a canvas wall, and fires simultaneously through a narrow opening. One member of the firing squad receives a blank round to obscure who actually fired a lethal shot. Death occurs almost instantly.
The method is often described by proponents and corrections officials as faster and more reliable than lethal injection — especially in states that have struggled to secure execution drugs. 
The use of firing squads remains controversial, however. 
Numerous human rights groups and medical experts cited by the Death Penalty Information Center argue that firing squad executions are inhumane — and that the psychological toll on those involved can be significant.
Others warn that the method can put prison staff or others present during the execution at risk if shots miss the intended targets.
A South Carolina inmate put to death in May was conscious and likely in extreme pain for up to a minute after the bullets missed their target and failed to quickly stop his heart, according to a pathologist hired by the inmate’s attorneys.
Questions linger over Indiana’s lethal injection practices
Recent executions in Indiana have also raised new scrutiny around lethal injections and the use of pentobarbital.
Corcoran’s wife, Tahina, and Ritchie’s girlfriend, Colleen Villeneuve, have both questioned whether drugs used in recent executions caused unnecessary pain or distress. 
Ritchie’s attorneys reported seeing sudden, unexpected movement during the lethal injection process. But no members of the media were permitted to witness the execution, meaning there was no independent observation or account of what happened.
A Capital Chronicle reporter attended Corcoran’s execution in December and did not observe any sudden movements by the inmate while blinds for a one-way window into the execution chamber were open.
‘Violent’ moment during Indiana execution draws scrutiny; DOC officials deny ‘botched’ process

Tahina, who also witnessed, did not speak to the media after her husband’s execution but has since said she and her son, Justin, another witness, saw Corcoran “moving around a lot” before he died.
Indiana Department of Correction officials released few details about the executions but said both went “according to protocol.”
“I want the state to be held accountable for giving them these drugs. … We didn’t even know they had expiration dates. We weren’t given any information at all about anything,” Tahina said. “We want answers.”
Hoosier officials have not publicly disclosed when exactly the state acquired the doses or from where they were purchased. Indiana Code protects the identity of the seller from public scrutiny. State officials had previously declined to provide details about how much pentobarbital was purchased, and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
“We want the truth,” Villeneuve said. “We want somebody to be held accountable. Our guys were accountable for their crimes that they committed. They did the time. They walked in that room and they laid on that gurney, and they accepted their fate. But they did not deserve to be given bad drugs.”
Lucas said he wants Indiana to keep its capital punishment law — with or without firing squads — but made clear that any legislative discussion should be approached, foremost, “with respect for victims.”
“You want to be humane about this,” he said. “We don’t want to cause any undue pain or suffering. But, you know, we have to keep in mind that somebody that gets the death penalty … they pretty well deserve it.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)When I head to Chicago or Nashville, I know I’ll be receiving a tolling invoice in the mail soon after. It’s a minor inconvenience because I don’t use those routes very often.
But the prospect of Indiana tolling interstates within state lines is an entirely different discussion. I take Interstate 65 to and from work almost every day and I would no doubt rack up a ridiculous bill — at the same time that I’m paying high gas taxes every time I fill up.
My immediate reaction is: no way. But I’m trying to see all sides of the debate.
The fact is Hoosiers love to complain about our roads, but no one wants to pay to improve them.
And our roads aren’t that bad depending on who you ask.
The Indiana Department of Transportation compared Indiana to neighboring states on 12 criteria, including road and bridge conditions, fatality rates, travel reliability and more:“INDOT ranked in the top 3rd in 5 areas and in the middle 3rd in the others,” the 2024 report said.
The federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics also rates 97% of Indiana’s roads as “good” or “fair.”
But a Reason Foundation analysis found Indiana ranked 32nd in highway performance nationally.
And the money raised from Indiana’s fuel-related taxes simply isn’t keeping up with demand. That’s partially because people are purchasing less gasoline. Newer cars are more efficient, and some cars don’t need it at all.
Inflation has also spiked the cost of repairing or replacing roads and bridges.
  (Indiana Department of Transportation)
So, Indiana — and every other state — has a diminishing revenue stream but more roads than ever to maintain.
And when I say Indiana, I don’t just mean state-owned roads. Most of the roads in the state are cared for by counties, cities and towns — about 89%. Their needs are immense.
One analysis said local governments would require an additional $2.4 billion annually to eliminate poorly rated local roads and bridges across the state over the next 10 years. The annual price tag for simply maintaining roads at the current condition is $1 billion.
So, would any of the additional revenue raised from tolls go to local infrastructure?
Lawmakers recently tried to think outside the box and offer other options. One was a surcharge on deliveries, such as Amazon and DoorDash. That language was removed pretty quickly. The state is also trying to force local units into implementing wheel taxes to take some ownership of the problem and raise fees and taxes at the local level.
But those are honestly just nibbling around the edges of the problem.
Tolling is where the money is at. And it’s a lot of money.
One 2017 feasibility study produced for INDOT estimated that a statewide interstate highway tolling program would have an 85% chance of generating upwards of $39 billion between 2021 and 2050.
It further reported a 50% chance that revenue could exceed $53 billion over that timeframe. The estimates didn’t include the costs to install and maintain tolling gantries, process payments, provide customer service, enforce collections and more.
  (Indiana Department of Transportation)
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb chose not to go down that route, but Gov. Mike Braun appears to be more interested. And lawmakers recently removed some final impediments to imposing tolling on state highways.
“It’s going to have to be considered because, otherwise, I don’t think we can maintain our main arteries,” Braun said earlier this year.
Tolling interstates isn’t as clear-cut as it seems.
It’s generally against federal law to collect tolls on existing federal highways. But Congress has allowed several exceptions. For instance, a state can toll an existing bridge after it is reconstructed and toll new lanes added to an interstate.
The option that is most expansive is the Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program, which allows tolling on existing interstate facilities to fund needed reconstruction or rehabilitation on corridors that could not otherwise be adequately maintained or functionally improved.
It has only three slots — awarded to Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia years ago. But those states never implemented the program, which has essentially been inactive.
INDOT said it has not filed a waiver request on tolling — yet.
I honestly don’t see how tolling in some way can be avoided. Leaders want to capture the trucks and travelers passing through Indiana without stopping for gas. But it’ll be tough to avoid hurting Hoosiers already paying their fair share.

(Photo by Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State did not confirm whether it had received such a letter.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.
Largely off-limits
While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
 Sweeping Colorado requests

In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.

Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
Trump unhappy
The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
 Letters to other states

As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

Dennis walks with a permanent limp, the result of a serious but treatable condition called laminitis. But an interruption in care means Dennis is unrideable and will likely need to be euthanized because of his poor quality of life.
The veterinarian who was treating Dennis refused to give a referral for a prescription and then cut off treatment altogether, leaving owner Kerri VanMeveren to search for specialized care at a crucial time. She told The Independent was trying to save money at a time when cash was tight and she could buy the prescription for $35 less than the veterinarian’s office charged.
She reported the veterinarian to the board, providing recordings of her conversations with staff at the veterinarian’s office, screenshots of text conversations and a list of people to interview.
But the board dismissed her complaint without contacting her for more information or the veterinarian she hired to treat Dennis.
“After careful consideration, the board determined that there is not sufficient evidence of a violation of the Missouri Veterinary Medical Practice Act,” the letter from the board said. “Therefore, the board voted to close the case and take no further action at this time.” 
In response, VanMeveren filed a pro-se lawsuit in Cole County Circuit Court alleging the board failed in its oversight duty to investigate complaints of malpractice, leaving animal owners without recourse when a veterinarian violates professional standards.
“I just want accountability for this vet, for what he did to me, my horse, the emotional trauma that I was put through and the thousands of dollars that it cost me,” she told The Independent.

She now has an attorney, Elad Gross, who argued against the state’s motion for a judgment against VanMeveren at a July 8 hearing before Circuit Judge Christoper Limbaugh.
The case should continue, Gross said in an interview, because there are too many questions it raises about whether the board is taking complaints seriously.
“There’s a lot more questions than answers on how it is operating, and that is not a good sign for anybody who’s got a pet or a working animal, or really anything that deals with a veterinary practice here in Missouri,” Gross said.
Missouri law describes how the board should report the outcome of investigations. Disciplined veterinarians are placed on a list, available upon request. When it takes no action, it must produce “a report stating that no action is recommended shall be prepared and forwarded to the complaining party and the licensee or applicant.” The board argues there is no requirement it do more than send the letter VanMeveren received.
“The decisions regarding how a complaint is handled, investigated and the ultimate decision as to whether or not the board will seek to discipline a licensee are decisions that are explicitly left to the exclusive discretion of the board,” assistant attorney general Hardin Haynes wrote in a motion in May.
Gross argues the letter from the board is not a sufficient report, so the board did not meet its obligations.
VanMeveren hopes the court action brings some justice to her situation. But if the case doesn’t go her way, she sees an opportunity for state lawmakers to tighten expectations for the veterinary board.
“There needs to be accountability, and there needs to be an appeal process,” she said. “I really hope that maybe there can be some changes made, not only to make a way for citizens to have a way to appeal a decision by the state veterinary board but also for more transparency of what they investigate.”
In fiscal year 2024, the veterinary board received 74 complaints and issued 16 disciplinary actions, a Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance spokesperson told The Independent.
The details of complaints and investigations are closed records. Bob Baker, executive director of the Missouri Alliance for Animal Legislation, would like to see more protections for consumers in the state law that authorizes the board to investigate complaints, called the Missouri Veterinary Medical Practice Act.
“Unfortunately, there’s nothing in that act that mandates that they investigate complaints, Baker told The Independent. “And if they do investigate complaints and they find that there’s probable cause, there’s no mandate that they’re referred to administrative hearing.”
The Veterinary Medical Board declined to comment.
Malpractice lawsuits in the veterinary field aren’t generally a viable option for accountability, he said, because pet owners are often unable to sue for anything except the cost of the animal.
“Animals, under the law in Missouri are considered property, so you can’t sue for emotional value or pain or suffering. The most you can really hope to attain is the value of the animal,” Baker said. “It doesn’t make attorneys willing to go forward on these types of complaints.”
But regulating veterinary medicine is not a popular move in the Missouri Legislature.
Lawmakers have attempted to bar local municipalities from placing restrictions on veterinarians, with bills filed in both the House and Senate in 2023 banning local governments from doing anything to “interfere with the practice of veterinary medicine.” The bill passed the Senate 22-11 that year but has not been filed since.
Baker said he has mostly been in “defense move,” arguing against bad bills but would like to see a shift toward more legislation protecting animals. But, with some animal welfare bills having traction in recent years, he is not without hope.
VanMeveren tries to remain optimistic. Last fall, she scheduled Dennis’s euthanasia after his condition left him confined to his stall all day. But first, she took a few days to let Dennis “be a horse.”
“I wanted him to enjoy the sunshine and the fresh air on his back and let him roll or do whatever he wanted to do. I mean, no restrictions,” she said.
She was afraid Dennis would overexpend himself. But he kicked and whinnied, and the experience filled her with joy. And when Dennis didn’t crash the next day, she canceled the appointment.
“(This situation) turned my life upside down. I was devastated,” she said. “And to see my horse in such pain, if I could go back in time, I probably would have just paid the extra money for the prescription.”

(Getty Images)New Jersey and 19 other states sued the Trump administration on Thursday over a federal rule that could cause as many as 2 million Americans to lose their health insurance.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, challenges a new regulation from the federal government that the plaintiffs say adds unnecessary and improper hurdles to people trying to enroll for health care benefits under the Affordable Care Act.
“This isn’t a serious attempt to protect consumers, it’s yet another political move to punish vulnerable communities by removing access to vital care and gutting the Affordable Care Act,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta told reporters Thursday. “This is rule-making by ideology, not by law or by facts.”
The plaintiffs want a judge to block the new regulation before it takes effect on August 25. It would narrow the open enrollment period for health plans purchased through state marketplaces, add verification requirements for applicants, and strike drug therapies like hormone or puberty blockers used in gender transition-related care from the federal roster of essential health benefits.
The rule estimates that between 750,000 and 2 million people enrolled in qualified health plans could lose their coverage as a result of the changes. The plaintiffs note that the rule comes just months before open enrollment is set to begin.
The Trump Administration says the rule would address waste, fraud, and abuse. Platkin countered that it would punish residents by making health care more expensive and harder to obtain, and punish states by increasing the amount of money they spend insuring residents.
“They’re trying to make health care more expensive and less accessible for every American who relies on it for the most fundamental need: to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy,” Platkin told reporters.
More than half a million New Jerseyans signed up for insurance through the state’s health care marketplace this year, Platkin said.
New Jersey earlier this week joined two separate lawsuits targeting the Trump administration, including one that challenges the administration’s termination of a program intended to pay for pre-disaster mitigation costs.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Thursday claimed 2.8 million Americans are enrolled in multiple taxpayer-subsidized health care plans under Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. This “unnecessary, duplicate enrollment” costs taxpayers $14 billion annually, it said.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”
Proposed federal work requirements could cut over 90k Missourians from Medicaid

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.










There isn't a single app out there that's going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That's just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
 Arkansas’ example

Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.
States push Medicaid work rules, but few programs help enrollees find jobs

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
 Other state efforts

Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Election officials across the country fear the loss of federal support for election security, according to a new survey.
Sixty percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern, a survey by the Brennan Center for Justice found. The center, a left-leaning pro-democracy institute, surveyed 858 officials between mid-April and mid-May.
The concern comes as President Donald Trump has curtailed federal election security work. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in March halted its election security work. A month earlier, the Department of Government Efficiency task force also fired 130 cybersecurity workers at the agency.
Trump is shifting cybersecurity to the states, but many aren’t prepared

And Trump in April ordered an investigation into Christopher Krebs, a former agency director who had vouched for the security of the 2020 election, which Trump falsely claims was stolen.
Federal cuts mean election officials are going to need more financial support from state and local governments, said Lawrence Norden, vice president of Brennan’s Elections and Government Program. The federal government has the advantage of being able to see the “big picture” and more easily share information with election officials across the country, he said.
“That is going to be difficult for states to replicate,” Norden said. “It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but they have to start rethinking how they’re sharing information about what they’re seeing with each other.”
Cybersecurity has long been a concern of states — and not just in elections. Only 22 of 48 states that participated in a voluntary 2023 cybersecurity review conducted by federal agencies met or exceeded recommended security levels.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In the Brennan survey, 36% of local election officials said they were very concerned about federal cuts to election security services, while 24% said they were somewhat concerned and 21% said they were a little concerned. Nineteen percent said they were not concerned at all.
Sixty-one percent of local election officials expressed some level of concern over cuts to the federal cybersecurity agency specifically, with 32% saying they were very concerned. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

The Committee on Natural Resources in the U.S. House of Representatives just voted to delist grizzly bears by Congressional fiat — and prohibit judicial review — following a horrific precedent set by none other than Montana’s Sen. Jon Tester back in 2011.  
By doing so, Congress overrides the role of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services to weigh the best scientific evidence and determine which species should be given protection under the Endangered Species Act and which species are sufficiently recovered to be delisted from those protections. 
As reported, some 50 conservation organizations signed on to a letter urging the committee to continue protections for grizzlies due to, among other things, the fear of permanent genetic damage by inbreeding in isolated populations.  Many also fear state control of grizzlies will mimic “management” of wolves by Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana whose various regulations now include night hunting, thermal scopes, and even shooting cubs in their dens — all of which violate the “fair chase ethic” of hunting.  
Make no mistake: The concerns that state management of grizzlies would likely follow the same path as that of wolves is valid.  Yet many of these same conservation organizations said nothing when Tester delisted wolves by Congressional fiat in 2011. 
The ugly truth is that although many of the big conservation organizations, such as the Greater Yellowstone Coalition and Sierra Club, claimed to be advocates for wolf recovery, they sold out their convictions for one reason – to help get Tester re-elected. 
Mind you, it’s illegal for non-profit organizations to engage in electoral politics and campaigns.  Yet, not only did they ignore the law, they undercut their supposed mission to fully restore wolves to the Northern Rockies. 
And so it was that Tester broke one of his main campaign promises — which was to not use “riders” to pass legislation — and, with his Idaho counterparts, slapped a wolf delisting rider on an unrelated defense spending bill.  And just like that, wolves were no longer protected but were open to hunting, trapping, and now a panoply of ever more cruel, unethical and lethal methods of extermination. 
Suffice it to say Tester basically told the conservationists who had helped propel him to the Senate six years earlier that he had to delist wolves to bolster his campaign for re-election in 2012.  And of course, fearing that he might be replaced by a Republican, those phony conservationists refused to criticize the horrific precedent of abandoning science for electoral expediency. 
Of course, such actions have repercussions.  Now, as Chronic Wasting Disease spreads throughout Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, in the natural order of things it would be wolves that kill and consume the sick deer and elk.  That’s what wolves do, after all, they wean the old, weak, and sick animals, leaving the healthier, stronger members to reproduce and benefit the herd’s overall health.  Grizzlies perform much the same function.  But now, like the wolves, they face an uncertain future of extermination for the crime of simply being grizzly bears.
It’s beyond ironic that these same conservation organizations are up in arms because a Republican has legislation to delist grizzlies when they were complicit in doing exactly the same thing with wolves — only by Democrat Tester.  
And now, as often happens, the unintended consequences of their politically motivated silence comes back around.  They got Tester re-elected alright.  But the precedent of Congressionally delisting endangered species — that they helped him set — is now likely to wreak havoc on recovering grizzly bears.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jon-Tester-Billings-110124-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

(Getty Images)During a recent conversation with folks from across Kansas, someone shared a story about a child speaking disrespectfully to a parent in public.
As they told the story, their body language shifted, their tone tightened, and it was clear they were reliving the moment with visible intolerance. The story was presented as evidence of a parent who simply didn’t care about how their child spoke to them. That moment opened a broader discussion on parenting, “out of control” kids, and the belief that today’s parents need to do better.
As a child trauma therapist, I’ve seen those moments play out more times than I can count. As a single mother many years ago, I was that parent. And every time I found myself on the receiving end of glares, unsolicited advice, or outright judgment, I hoped the people watching wouldn’t break their ankles jumping to conclusions. Instead, I prayed they’d walk, carefully, intentionally, down the path of empathy, if only for a few steps.
If they had asked (and most didn’t), they would have learned that I was a single mom working full time, going to school full time, and raising a child with undiagnosed autism. Meltdowns, yelling, boundary-testing — those were daily experiences in our home. Sometimes the goal was just to make it to bedtime without either of us breaking. I didn’t forget how I was raised. I just had to decide which battles were worth fighting.
“Pick your battles” wasn’t a parenting strategy. It was survival. I needed to save my energy for the moments that felt like life or death, not for preserving the comfort of onlookers.
There’s a kind of disconnect I often see, especially from those who’ve never had to live in survival mode, or who didn’t even realize they were in survival mode because someone else was shielding them from it. At some point, that child becomes an adult, and hopefully, they begin asking uncomfortable questions. Why did we only eat rice for dinner every night? Why did we play “indoor camping” with candles and flashlights when it was not storming outside?
Those realizations matter. They are the first cracks in the lens of innocence. And while childhood protection is necessary, it allows our children to hold onto wonder just a little longer. It also can unintentionally create a bubble that limits compassion.
When that bubble stays intact too long, it can create adults who ignore a mother begging for her child to use a locked restroom because she hasn’t bought a drink yet. A child who needs to use the bathroom urgently shouldn’t be up for a policy debate. But when policy is prioritized over people, we become complicit in inflicting pain. The question is: Do we want to be right, or do we want to be human?
Empathy is not about perfection. It is not always convenient. But it is powerful. It pauses judgment. It redirects the impulse to react and replaces it with a willingness to listen. It opens the door for the kind of response that stings the eyes and chokes the throat, not out of guilt, but out of the realization that there’s a world we’ve been blind to.
Nicole Price, my mentor and a leadership strategist with a doctorate in education, recently posted about the shift in the Black vote from Republican to Democratic. There is plenty of debate about what the actual turning point was. But the part we often miss is this: Coretta Scott King was desperate for her husband to be released from jail. She appealed to John F. Kennedy. As a result of his response, her father-in-law, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., changed the course of an entire voting population with his voice.
Regardless of where you fall on the politics of that moment, the focus here is empathy. Empathy moved her. It moved him. And in that moment, empathy moved a nation.
Empathy is not a weakness or passivity. It is a radical, active force that demands courage, humility, and perspective. It is time for an empathy revolution.
In our families, in our communities, and in our politics, it is not enough to observe, we must choose to understand. The next time you see a human being reaching their limit, pause without mocking or questioning their struggle. Listen to their story, and then act with compassion. Because when we choose empathy, we don’t just change outcomes, we change the world.

(Courtesy of White House Office of Legislative Affairs)The Medicaid cuts recently approved by Congress and President Donald Trump could force states into difficult decisions, health policy experts say.
Part of several major changes to Medicaid, the bill caps how much states can tax health care providers, a tool states use to get extra federal funds for Medicaid, a program largely funded by the federal government. 

Many Medicaid benefits are optional under the law. For many Idahoans, they’re anything but. 


That leaves “a pretty significant hole” in Idaho’s Medicaid budget, said Hillarie Hagen, senior policy associate with Idaho Voices for Children.
“Now it is on our Idaho Legislature to look at how we’re going to pick up the costs from these federal cuts,” she told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “And we’re going to be facing very significant, difficult choices in the coming year on whether to eliminate certain programs, or we’re going to see a lot of people lose access to Medicaid.”
But Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo — a Republican who serves as chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee and pushed for several of the bill’s major parts — said “the attack that people are going to be forced off of Medicaid is not correct.”
Crapo said there’s been a lot of inaccurate information about the bill’s Medicaid cuts. Only time will tell the impact, he told the Sun in an interview. 
“The only way to prove this is to wait and see what actually happens. But the bottom line is this: no one’s benefits were cut in this legislation — unless you are a person who is not an American citizen and not legally present in America,” Crapo said. “… Or if you are a person who is registered in multiple states and are getting payments in multiple states.”
  What Idaho’s U.S. congressional delegation pushed for in the bill

Three of the four members of Idaho’s Republican congressional delegation opposed a proposal, later removed from the bill, to sell off federal public lands.

Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher voted against a House amendment that would’ve prevented federal land sales. Fulcher, in a phone interview, said he thinks “public land should remain public, but the control, management should be local stakeholders, not the federal government.” 
Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson voted for the amendment.
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, told the Sun in an email that he was proud to “have led the charge against the proposal to sell Idaho’s public lands.” 
In June, Risch and Crapo publicly opposed that provision in the bill, which was later removed by Utah’s U.S. Sen. Mike Lee.
“Public lands are an important part of our western way of life and a key driver of our economy,” Risch said. “I will continue demanding greater local, more common-sense management of our public lands to ensure Idaho has a voice on decisions that impact our state.”

In an interview last week, Crapo said he pushed for several major aspects of the bill, including extending 2017 tax cuts, other tax cuts like no taxes on tips and less taxes on Social Security, border security funding and national security funding, including for the military.
Fulcher said the portion of the bill that in many cases eliminates the tax on tips and overtime came from a town hall he had in Sandpoint during the pandemic. He said he first introduced legislation a few years ago and was able to add the provision to the budget bill with the support of the president. These tax cuts will be in effect through December 2028. 
Simpson could not be reached for comment. 
 Tax cut extension avoids harsh restart, and aren’t a cut for the rich, Idaho’s lawmakers say

Like other Republicans, several members of Idaho’s congressional delegation have denied that the bill is a tax cut for the wealthy.
Crapo and Risch say the bill avoids Americans facing a $4 trillion tax hike, by extending 2017 tax cuts. And they say Idaho families will see wide benefits.
  U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho. (Courtesy of U.S. Sen. Jim Risch’s office)
“Our bill not only prevented that from happening but delivered the largest tax relief package for working and middle-class Idaho families in U.S. history,” Risch said in an email. “We eliminated taxes on tips and overtime, enhanced the child and childcare tax credits, and are helping Idahoans keep more of their hard-earned income.”
Crapo agreed.
“I know the attack on the bill has been that it’s just a tax cut for billionaires,” Crapo said. “Billionaires are going to pay the same taxes next year as they pay this year. There was no tax cut for billionaires. The reality here is that we stopped a $3.8 trillion tax increase — and added a number of other tax reductions for middle- and lower-income categories in America.”
An average Idaho family of four will see $2,600 in tax savings, Crapo said. That’s among other impacts avoided by extending the tax cuts, he said — like child tax credits and standard deductions halving, many businesses seeing taxes rise by over 20%, and 33,000 job losses. 
But Idaho Fiscal Policy Center Policy Analyst May Roberts said the budget bill “delivers massive tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while offering little relief to low- and middle-income families.”
In Idaho, top income earners will see tax cuts of more than $78,000 on average, while the lowest earners will see only a $20 cut, Roberts told the Sun in an email. That small cut for low income earners “could be quickly erased by tariffs that drive up the cost of groceries, clothing, and other essentials,” she added, citing estimates by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
“To make matters worse, the tax cuts benefiting the wealthy were made permanent, while those intended to support working families are temporary and set to expire in just a few years,” Roberts said. 
 Medicaid cuts leave budget hole for Idaho, expert says

Over the next decade, the bill is expected to cut federal funds for Idaho Medicaid by $4.3 billion and reduce Idaho Medicaid’s enrollment by as much as 40,000 people, estimates in early June from the group Manatt show. The analysis assumes work requirements will cut Medicaid enrollment and costs. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is still reviewing the bill’s impacts on Idaho, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun in an email last week.
“Many of the Medicaid provisions in the final bill closely mirror items Idaho has already led on. As the department completes its analysis in the coming months, it will make more information available,” he said. 
The bill also includes a mandate for Medicaid work requirements, which also counts community service and education. Cost-sharing, essentially copayments as high as $35, will also be required through the bill for people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, with some exceptions. 
“We’re deeply concerned about how the consequences of this bill are going to be felt. Not only by individuals and families, but also the very safety net that is working to support them, like our rural hospitals and providers,” Hagen said.
 Idaho to pay $6M more for SNAP. That’s lower than it could’ve been.

The bill will also shift millions of dollars to states in costs for the food assistance program, called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
SNAP is a federal program that states run. The federal government pays for benefits. But states already chip in somewhat, by splitting administrative costs with the federal government. 
The bill cuts funding for SNAP by about 20% over the next 10 years, or $186 billion, and over 2 million people could lose SNAP benefits under the bill, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Historically, states paid half of the costs to run the program. But the bill will raise states’ share of administrative costs to 75%, with the federal government contributing 25% of costs, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. 
Under that change, Idaho’s SNAP costs each year would rise by $6 million, said McWhorter, the Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson. 
But — at least for now — Idaho wouldn’t be required to pay more for other SNAP costs under another part of the bill.
Idaho runs SNAP efficiently, officials say. But Congress might make state pay millions more.

For the first time in the program’s history, the bill will require many states to pay a portion of benefit costs. 
Idaho won’t be affected by that part of the bill because the state has the second lowest payment error rate in the nation. Each month, about 126,000 Idahoans receive $172 in benefits, state figures show.
An earlier version of the bill would have placed the benefit cost-sharing requirement on all states, which would have raised Idaho’s annual SNAP costs by at least $18 million, the Sun reported. But the new bill doesn’t require states with some of the lowest payment error rates to pay for benefits.
“We remain well below the rate at which cost sharing would kick in” under the final bill, McWhorter said.
Idaho may still face these increased costs in the future, Idaho Voices for Children Policy Director Kendra Knighten said in an interview. 
“To make up these costs, it may mean the Legislature may cut funding from other critical programs that the state currently oversees. Or it may mean that they choose to opt out of the SNAP program altogether,” she said.
The bill’s expanded SNAP work requirements added through the bill are likely to raise states’ payment error rates over time, she said. About 4,000 Idahoans are at risk of losing the food assistance benefits — parents and caregivers with teenage children, and older adults, Knighten said. 
The bill removes work requirement protections for veterans, people experiencing homelessness, and former foster youth, according to the Food Research & Action Center. 
 What’s missing from the bill: Tax credits for health insurance on exchange

The bill does not extend premium tax credits to buy health insurance on exchanges. If Congress doesn’t extend those, insurance premiums are expected to surge — leading to about 35,000 Idahoans losing health insurance coverage, the Sun reported. 
Crapo said Congress will address this in future legislation, but he isn’t sure how. 
“There is a question about whether that system is actually being used in a way that is abusive … to the federal government in the sense of charging more money or allowing more credits to be claimed that are not truly focused on health care,” Crapo said.
If the premium tax credits aren’t extended, Hagen with Idaho Voices for Children said “we are likely to see about a 25% increase in the number of uninsured people in Idaho, and likely a 52% decrease in marketplace enrollment.”
The bill also ended allowing people enrolled in marketplace plans to automatically re-enroll, which Hagen said 62% of enrollees rely on. That also risks people losing their health insurance coverage, she said.

 Rural Idaho hospitals may be negatively impacted

The combination of thousands of Idahoans losing their health care coverage and constraints on the provider taxes limiting how much money is available through Medicaid may be tough for small, rural hospitals to weather, said Toni Lawson, Idaho Hospital Association vice president of advocacy and external relations. 
She noted that safety net programs that the state used to have in place, such as the Catastrophic Health Care Program and the county indigent fund, are no longer in place. 
“Hospitals will end up trying to absorb those costs, and that’s going to become more and more difficult,” Lawson said. “We don’t know all the exact implications yet, but it’s going to be tough for our rural hospitals.” 
She said that just one costly case of a patient not being able to pay for an expensive service, such as surgery, can upend a small hospital’s budget. 
“It’s going to negatively impact all Idahoans because if a hospital closes certain service lines or has to close, they don’t just close for Medicaid patients. They close for all patients,” she said. “So we’re going to have some challenges with access to care.” 
 Bill ends incentives for wind and solar projects and boosts fossil fuel production 

The massive bill does more than just extend tax cuts and cut government spending. It also shores up government spending for immigration enforcement, national defense, agriculture and energy. 
Idaho Conservation League Executive Director Justin Hayes said he didn’t see anything in the bill that appeared to target Idaho, but that it could affect utility-scale wind and solar projects in the state in the long term. The bill phases out Biden-era tax incentives for large renewable energy projects while lowering royalty rates on gas and oil, Inside Climate News reported.
Hayes noted that since Idaho doesn’t have oil or coal reserves, the state will be “exporting money to buy electricity that is generated from fossil fuels or motor fuel from oil and gas, diesel, as opposed to electric.”

“I think that you’re seeing a wholesale shift in the direction this administration wants to take all of America to,” Hayes said. “That’s going to have huge climate impacts, and I think it’s going to make all of our electricity, whether you’re residential consumers or industrial consumers, more expensive because wind and solar is coming online quickly and is the most affordable option for a lot of these development projects.” 
Idaho doesn’t produce energy like it used to. How drought, renewables are changing our landscape.

Risch argued that projects such as the nixed Lava Ridge wind farm project near Twin Falls were unpopular and said he was proud to work with the president to put a stop to it. 
“Thanks to the reconciliation bill, Idahoans’ tax dollars will no longer bankroll unwanted projects like Lava Ridge that would not effectively meet our long-term energy needs,” he said.
The senator said the bill prioritized investments in several energy sources critical to Idaho, like hydropower, geothermal and nuclear energy.
The bill also “provides certainty for Idaho farmers and ranchers by modernizing critical Farm Bill safety net programs and improving access to risk management resources,” Risch told the Sun.
Fulcher said he supported changes in the bill to boost timber harvesting and grazing leases on federal lands and streamline the process to obtain mining permits. 
“In the West, we have a much more unique system of federal lands in most states, Idaho in particular (is) nearly two-thirds federal, and the president realizes that,” Fulcher said, “and wants to turn some of those resources into, frankly, a profit center instead of a cost center.”
He said the timber harvesting and grazing could help reduce wildfire fuels as well.

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)State health leaders kicked off the Indiana Health Fair Thursday — offering Hoosiers more than $4,000 worth of free health services over four days at the Indiana Convention Center.
The event used to be titled the Indiana Black and Minority Health Fair, but Gov. Mike Braun eliminated diversity programs from state agencies. During the opening ceremony, minority health was still a priority — something Community Health Network Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer Ken Bond made clear.
“I’ve been in this role now for about 18 months. And if you could imagine 18 months ago, where we were as it relates to diversity, equity inclusion and where we are now. And we cannot be afraid to say it out loud, diversity equity and inclusion,” he said.
Bond said more than 50% of patients that Community Health Network sees speak another language besides English.
“I don’t care what they say. We have to serve 50% of people who don’t speak English, they speak Haitian Creole, they speak Spanish, they speak Burmese, they speak Hakha Chin, they speak Punjabi, they speak Mandarin. And so we have to take care of those patients,” he said.

Indiana State Health Commissioner Lindsay Weaver said this is one of the biggest events the Department of Health helps put on every single year and it gives people an opportunity to check in on their health who might not otherwise do so.
“I mean, there’s so many people who they’re like, I feel good. There’s nothing wrong with me. But unfortunately, diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes, you often don’t have symptoms until it’s starting to cause problems,” she said. “And so we’re just really hoping people come out to the health fair to have fun, because it is fun. It’s way less intimidating than going to the doctor.”
She said one of her favorite things about the fair is that there are multiple mobile health vehicles you can see when you walk into the doors of the hall.
“We bring them all here and we see them, but it means so much more to me, because I know that they’re going all around our state to serve Hoosiers in every corner,”she  said. 
The fair also features free educational sessions and interactive activities for everyone to enjoy. The event included special programming for seniors on Thursday – a line dance put on by Young at Heart, a senior line dance group. 


This year’s fair will be held at the following times:

4-8 p.m., Thursday, July 17
1-7 p.m., Friday, July 18
10 a.m.-8 p.m., Saturday, June 19
Noon-6 p.m., Sunday, June 20



This year is also the first time the WNBA has partnered with the Indiana Health Fair — which coincides with the WNBA All-Star game in the city. 
The fair comes after lawmakers reduced public health funding from $100 million each year to $40 million during this year’s budget. State officials are still hopeful the remaining dollars can make a difference.
“We definitely are going to have to be more thoughtful, more focused on things that we get our biggest return on investment on,” Weaver said. “There are some things that we’re not gonna be able to do anymore, that we wish we could. And so we’re really turning to our stakeholders, people like our sponsors here, the health care systems, to help fill in those gaps.”
Antoniette Holt, director of the IDOH Office of Minority Health said she appreciates the last budget increase to the health department because it made a huge difference. 
“We continue to serve people, especially those are in need. Numbers tell the truth in regards to that. So we depend upon the data, definitely. And we want to make sure that we continue to keep that in that vein, we work within our internal departments and things to make sure that the different areas of populations or counties that need their needs are met because every county is different.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Following an exodus of several senior employees from state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ administration, the Oklahoma State Department of Education is now refusing to release records explaining the departures.
The agency denied open records requests from Oklahoma Voice for resignation letters, widely considered to be public documents, of seven top-level administrators who have left over the past nine months. It then refused a subsequent request for all resignation letters submitted to the agency since Jan. 1.
The response is a heel-turn from the department’s practices only months ago. Like most state agencies, the Education Department provided resignation letters in response to open records requests, doing so for Oklahoma Voice as recently as February.
On Feb. 24, the agency provided the resignation letter of its former communications director, Dan Isett, who had left two weeks earlier.
However, as more members of Walters’ inner circle departed over the following months, the department abruptly stopped turning over these documents — a move that prompted a lawsuit from another news outlet and raised questions among some of the very employees whose resignation letters are being withheld.
When Oklahoma Voice requested Isett’s resignation letter again on June 17, the agency denied the request.
Isett declined to comment. His departing letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained through its first request, was brief.
“Please accept this letter as my formal resignation as Director of Communications at OSDE, effective February 10, 2025,” Isett wrote in a message addressed to Walters.
A key basis for all of the denials, the agency said, is a section of the Open Records Act relating to employee privacy. 
The state law gives public bodies sole discretion to keep personnel documents confidential if “disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 
In court, the agency has contended a resignation letter would violate an employee’s privacy and would only satisfy the requester’s curiosity, rather than serving the public interest.
The Education Department also cited a provision in the open records law stating a public agency doesn’t have to release resignation records if they pertain to an internal personnel investigation.
However, agency spokesperson Quinton Hitchcock declined to confirm whether such an investigation exists.
“I am unable to comment on personnel matters,” Hitchcock said.
Former agency employees say privacy, investigation concerns shouldn’t apply
Former Chief Operations Officer Andrea Fielding said none of the employees who left recently, including herself in February, were under investigation. Several resigned for personal or family reasons, not because of personnel issues, she said.
Another former agency employee whose resignation letter is being withheld said he was not under investigation during his tenure, nor has he been informed he’s being investigated now. Former director of research and policy Tucker Cross said releasing the document would not violate his privacy.
“As far as my resignation letter is concerned, I would have no concerns with my letter being made public,” Cross said. “There’s nothing in there that needs to be hidden or protected for my sake.”
Hitchcock declined to explain how an internal investigation statute would apply to Cross, who hasn’t worked at the agency since Oct. 30.
Cross said he wrote a short resignation letter communicating that he needed to be home more to care for his family. Since leaving the agency, he said he’s done exactly that, focusing on his wife and children and their family business.
Former Director of External Relations Matt Oberdick also said neither an internal investigation nor privacy concerns would apply to him or his letter. The document didn’t contain private details like his home address or contact information, he said.

Oberdick, whose tenure at the agency lasted from February 2023 until June 2025, said his resignation letter “sings the praises” of his experience working at the Education Department.
He said he wrote that God had opened doors for him to work with Walters, someone he aligned with on many issues. Oberdick said he had no disgruntlement nor anger toward Walters when he left the agency.
Rather, God had opened another door to work at the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, a conservative think tank where Oberdick now directs the Center for Culture and the Family.
“There was nothing insidious,” Oberdick said of his letter. “There was no defamation of the agency. There was nothing negative said about my time or experience there, so I’m not sure why they wouldn’t want it released.”
A lawsuit challenges withholding of resignation documents
The news outlet Oklahoma Watch and reporter Jennifer Palmer are now suing the state Education Department after receiving an identical response to a request for another employee’s resignation records. 
They contend withholding these documents violates the state Open Records Act. The agency rejected that argument, contending it has sole discretion over the release of resignation records, and urged an Oklahoma County district judge to throw out the lawsuit. 
Palmer had requested the resignation records of former Chief Compliance Officer Kourtney Heard. Oklahoma Voice also requested Heard’s resignation letter and was denied access to it. 
Heard declined to comment for this story. David Martin, a former senior director whose resignation letter the agency also withheld from Oklahoma Voice, did not return a request for comment.
It’s in the public interest, not merely curiosity, to disclose a state employee’s resignation letter, said Joey Senat, an Open Records Act expert and associate professor at Oklahoma State University. 
That document could reveal whether an employee resigned because of corruption, incompetence or issues that could be embarrassing to a state agency if they come to light.
He said it’s common that government agencies use delay tactics or make “ludicrous” arguments to avoid releasing a record. Until recent changes to state law, members of the public often had few options left but the expensive and time-consuming choice to take the agency to court. 
Meanwhile, government officials are “playing with house money,” Senat said. The costs of an open records lawsuit don’t come out of officials’ pockets but rather from the agency’s taxpayer funds.
“It’s just more smokescreen to hide things the government doesn’t want us to know, things that would show it’s being corrupt, it’s being incompetent, it’s not doing its job the way it’s supposed to do it, not doing the job we pay them to do,” Senat said.
State lawmakers added new language to the Open Records Act in recent years giving public bodies “sole discretion” over the release of certain personnel records, which could make it more difficult for courts to hold government agencies accountable, he said. 
The state Legislature, though, passed a law this year that empowered the Attorney General’s Office to investigate and prosecute potential Open Records Act violations. That investigative power previously was limited to district attorneys, who Senat said rarely conducted such investigations.

Legislators also encoded a new public access counselor at the Attorney General’s Office to give the public another outlet to report complaints. The attorney general already had created the position within his staff, but it didn’t exist in state statute until the new law.
The Attorney General’s Office and its public access counselor declined to comment or address Oklahoma Voice’s open records complaint over the withholding of resignation letters because a lawsuit from another media outlet is pending over a similar matter.
Last year, Attorney General Gentner Drummond admonished Walters after receiving an “alarming number of complaints” of poor compliance at the Education Department with open records laws.
 Education Department refused to confirm general counsel’s status

The first resignation letter the agency withheld from Oklahoma Voice was that of its recently departed general counsel, Michael Beason. Like with all the subsequent denials, the agency cited the employee privacy and internal investigation sections of the Open Records Act.
Beason said it’s not accurate to interpret the agency’s response as a suggestion there has been an internal investigation. He said it was “insulting in the extreme” when Oklahoma Voice asked whether he was the subject of such an investigation.
“I was not and am not under investigation by the agency or anyone else,” Beason said. “I have not done anything wrong, illegal or unethical.”

Oklahoma Voice requested Beason’s resignation letter on June 17 during the final weeks he was employed at the agency. The request was denied, and Hitchcock did not respond to questions asking whether Beason still worked at the department.
Hitchcock declined to answer similar questions from The Oklahoman, the newspaper reported. Instead, he told The Oklahoman he isn’t at liberty to discuss personnel matters with the news media, a response he gave to Oklahoma Voice multiple times during the reporting of this story.
This is another U-turn from the Education Department’s previous practice of willingly acknowledging whether an individual staff member is employed at the agency. In February, it confirmed the employment of Walters’ new chief of staff, Matt Mohler.
Refusing to acknowledge whether an individual works at a state agency would amount to another Open Records Act violation, Senat said. The law specifically requires that government agencies disclose an employee’s title and dates of employment. 
“We don’t have secret employees in this state,” Senat said.
Beason confirmed he submitted his resignation letter June 10 and had his last day of work June 30. 
He said he’s been in good standing with the Oklahoma Bar Association for 25 years and chose to return to private legal practice.
He declined to share his resignation letter with Oklahoma Voice.

President Donald Trump said ICE is going after the “worst of the worst.” The agency’s Rocky Mountain data shows otherwise.
The post Most people arrested by ICE in Wyoming and Colorado this year did not have criminal history appeared first on WyoFile .","Lea este artículo en español.
Immigration arrests have quadrupled in Colorado and almost tripled in Wyoming since President Donald Trump took office in January with a significant shift in who is being targeted, new data from the federal government shows.
Most people arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents between Jan. 20 and June 26 of this year in Colorado and Wyoming did not have any criminal convictions, according to ICE data released over the last few weeks. Among those arrested who had a conviction at the time of their arrest, the most serious crime is most often noted by ICE as drunken driving in both Colorado and Wyoming, the data shows.
The data, obtained from ICE and published by the Deportation Data Project, is the most detailed, publicly available picture of who is being swept up by ICE’s dragnet arrest tactics in the two Western states this year. The University of California, Berkeley School of Law, which is behind the project, published the data, and The Colorado Sun and WyoFile analyzed arrests made under the jurisdiction of ICE’s Denver field office, which covers both states.

The ICE arrest data contradicts the purported goals of the Trump administration to target the “worst of the worst.” Increasingly, ICE is arresting immigrants with no criminal history, the data shows. Advocates who work with immigrant communities said the tactics, which include arresting people who appear for their immigration court proceedings, are unlike anything they’ve seen before.
Laura Lunn, director of advocacy and litigation at Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said in her 15 years of working with immigrants, she has never seen ICE arrest people with pending asylum cases and no criminal history. Now, she said, that is common in Colorado.
“People are being picked up from their homes, workplaces, people are being picked up as they’re walking their dogs,” she said. “This is ruthless and I’ve never seen anything like it before.”

The arrest dataset is imperfect, and The Colorado Sun and WyoFile analysis required reporters to make inferences. For example, some arrests were noted as having occurred in the Denver field office area, but the data entry did not include whether the arrest took place in Colorado or Wyoming.
In these cases, reporters used an arrestee’s unique ID number to search for the state in which they were arrested in another data file, the detentions or detainers datasets. When the arrest entry referred to an obvious state landmark, such as the city of Casper in Wyoming, the reporters assigned the arrest to that state. When such an inference could not be made, the reporters removed the arrest from the dataset and did not include it in the analysis. In total, the analysis included 556 arrests from 2024 and 2,162 arrests in 2025 and discarded fewer than 100 arrests. 
Some of those arrested had a criminal conviction listed in one of the datasets, but not in another. The Colorado Sun and WyoFile only counted criminal convictions in the arrest data, which UC Berkeley and other news organizations have determined is the most reliable dataset.
Given the need to infer certain information, this analysis may differ from analyses made by other newsrooms. For example, The New York Times reported that immigration arrests in Wyoming had doubled, not tripled. But The Colorado Sun and WyoFile’s analysis found more arrests attributable to the state than The Times did.

ICE officials declined to respond to questions about the data and The Colorado Sun and WyoFile’s analysis, even though the data was produced by their agency.
Reporters sent questions to Steve Kotecki, ICE’s spokesperson for the two-state region. Kotecki told reporters he forwarded that request to ICE’s national media office. Reporters then received a response from a generic ICE email account declining to verify the agency’s own data. ICE refused to provide a statement from a named official, and instead sent a brief, unsigned statement that echoed national talking points. 
ICE’s response to WyoFile and The Colorado Sun’s request for information about local arrests reflects a growing effort by the agency to make its officials faceless and nameless in the public eye. ICE agents have worn masks during operations around the country and declined to share their names with the people they’re detaining and members of the public. Some attorneys prosecuting detained immigrants have reportedly sought anonymity. 
ICE’s increased focus on immigrants with no criminal history comes as the administration attempts to reach its goal of 3,000 immigration arrests per day. The tactics have spurred protests across the country in recent months, including in cities in Colorado and Wyoming.

Colorado and Wyoming are very different politically and demographically. Colorado is run by a Democratic governor and legislature, while Wyoming is overseen by a Republican governor and legislature. Nearly 10% of Colorado residents are foreign-born while just 3.6% of Wyoming residents were born in other countries, according to the latest U.S. census figures.
The data shows the immigration crackdown in Colorado has been more aggressive than in Wyoming.

Immigration activists and attorneys told WyoFile and The Colorado Sun that in Wyoming the increase in arrests appears built on a system that relies on local law enforcement to alert ICE when officers detain immigrants suspected of committing local crimes. The high-profile, heavy-handed ICE raids and mass arrests seen in other states in the West have been rare. 
A growing number of Wyoming sheriffs have signed agreements to facilitate cooperation with ICE. Such agreements would likely violate Colorado laws prohibiting significant cooperation between local law enforcement agencies and ICE. Activists say that even in Wyoming counties where there isn’t a more formal arrangement, deputies are now more likely to call ICE when they jail someone they suspect is unlawfully in the country. At the same time, ICE is more actively responding to sheriffs’ reports and is more likely to come pick up people from jails than they were under President Joe Biden’s administration. 
“They’re here,” Bianca Infante, program director of the Cheyenne-based statewide immigration advocacy group Juntos, said, referring to the growing number of arrests. “The way they’re acting is more strategic, it’s less visible. But just because we’re not seeing it as much doesn’t mean that they’re not here.”
In Colorado and Wyoming, most people arrested by ICE during the first five months of the Trump administration had no criminal conviction, the data shows. That’s a reversal from the same time period in 2024, when most people arrested by ICE had been convicted of crimes, the data shows.

Of those who had criminal convictions when they were arrested this year, most were for nonviolent crimes, according to the FBI’s definition.
Among those arrested in Colorado and Wyoming are people whose convictions are decades old, although the dates are not always included. Three people arrested this year have convictions ICE says date from 1992 to 1999, and 10 people have convictions from 2000 to 2005.

Very few people in the data appear to have been deported to countries where they don’t have citizenship. But the list includes nine Venezuelan men arrested in Colorado since Jan. 20 who were sent to El Salvador on March 15. At least three other Venezuelan men arrested under the Biden administration were also sent to El Salvador that day, according to the arrest data.
The data does not include names. But the departure date indicates these men may be part of the group of nearly 300 people the Trump administration deported to the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, in El Salvador. They were deported without an opportunity to challenge the federal government’s allegations that they are gang members, according to lawsuits filed over the CECOT imprisonments.
None of the men from Colorado, who range in age from about 22 to 35, had criminal convictions when they were arrested by ICE, according to the data. One had an aggravated assault conviction associated with his ICE detention file. El Salvador is still holding the men with no opportunity for release.
Republicans in Congress voted earlier this month to increase ICE’s annual budget from $8 billion to about $28 billion, making it the highest funded law enforcement agency in the country.
The cash infusion will continue to increase arrests, detentions and deportations, said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. And, she said, more of those arrested, detained and deported are likely to be people whose only offense is entering the country illegally. 
“If they want to keep up the pace of arrests they’ve been conducting,” she said. “They’ll have to widen their gaze beyond people with criminal convictions.”


Methodology
This story is based on data from the Deportation Data Center at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law.
Here’s how we performed the analysis:

Saved the tables as comma separated value (CSV) files.
Imported them into a Jupyter notebook using the Python library Pandas. 
Narrowed the tables to data that included the Denver area of responsibility, Colorado or Wyoming.
In the case of detention data, a list of detention facilities in Colorado and Wyoming were used.
Using unique identifiers to match with detention data, added the most serious conviction charge to the arrest data.
Using unique identifiers to match with detainer data, added conviction dates and additional state data to the arrest data.
Narrowed the arrest data to the time frame of Jan. 20 to June 26 for both 2024 and 2025.
Removed 41 records where the state could not be determined.
Removed 28 duplicate records. Some duplicates in which individuals were arrested in both 2024 and 2025 remain in the data.
Removed 25 records that appear to have come from other states.
Used Excel pivot tables to analyze the remaining 2,718 records.

Some arrested people who were designated as having pending criminal charges at the time of their arrest had a conviction associated with them in the detention dataset. The Colorado Sun and WyoFile included those people, 17 in total, as having pending charges, so it is possible that our total number of convicted arrestees is an undercount.
It is worth noting that there is no way to gauge the accuracy of this data. For instance, three of the records removed listed locations in Colorado or Wyoming, but apprehension states of Florida and Utah.WyoFile and The Colorado Sun are publishing a spreadsheet containing the data analyzed here.

Trump dijo que ICE iba tras “lo peor de lo peor”. Los datos de dicha agencia Rocky Mountain dicen lo contrario.
The post La mayoría de las personas arrestadas por ICE este año en Colorado y Wyoming no tenían condenas penales appeared first on WyoFile .","Los arrestos por inmigración se han cuadruplicado en Colorado y casi triplicado en Wyoming desde que el presidente Donald Trump asumió el cargo en enero, con un cambio significativo en quiénes son los objetivos de los agentes migratorios, según nuevos datos del gobierno federal.
La mayoría de las personas arrestadas por agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, por sus siglas en inglés) entre el 20 de enero y el 26 de junio de este año en Colorado y Wyoming no tenían condenas penales, según datos de ICE divulgados en las últimas semanas. Entre quienes sí tenían una condena al momento de su arresto, el delito más grave registrado con mayor frecuencia por ICE en ambos estados es el de conducir en estado de ebriedad.
Los datos, obtenidos de ICE y publicados por el Proyecto de Datos de Deportación (Deportation Data Project), brindan el panorama más detallado y público acerca de quiénes están cayendo atrapados, de las tácticas de arrestos masivos de ICE en los dos estados del oeste este año. La Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de California en Berkeley, que lidera el proyecto, publicó los datos. The Colorado Sun y WyoFile analizaron los arrestos realizados bajo la jurisdicción de la oficina regional de ICE en Denver, que abarca ambos estados.

Los datos contradicen los objetivos declarados por la administración de Trump de enfocarse en “lo peor de lo peor”. Según los datos, ICE está incrementando los arrestos a inmigrantes sin condenas penales. Defensores que trabajan con comunidades inmigrantes dijeron que las tácticas, que incluyen arrestar a personas que se presentan a sus audiencias judiciales migratorias, no tienen precedentes.
Laura Lunn, directora de defensa y litigios para la Red de Defensa del Inmigrante de las Montañas Rocosas (Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, en inglés), dijo que en sus 15 años de experiencia con inmigrantes, nunca había visto que ICE arrestara a personas con casos pendientes de asilo y sin condenas penales. Ahora, dijo, eso es común en Colorado.
“Están recogiendo a personas de sus hogares, sus lugares de trabajo, o incluso mientras pasean a sus perros”, dijo. “Es despiadado y nunca había visto algo así”.

El conjunto de datos de arrestos no es perfecto, y el análisis de The Colorado Sun y WyoFile requirió que los reporteros hicieran ciertas inferencias. Por ejemplo, algunos arrestos estaban registrados en el área de la oficina de campo de Denver, sin especificar si se realizaron en Colorado o Wyoming.
En estos casos, los reporteros utilizaron el número de identificación único de cada persona arrestada para buscar el estado en el que ocurrió su detención, utilizando otro archivo de datos: conjuntos de datos de detención o de órdenes de retención. En caso que el registro del arresto hacía referencia a un punto geográfico claro, como la ciudad de Casper en Wyoming, los reporteros asignaron ese arresto a ese estado. Si no era posible hacer una inferencia clara, eliminaron el arresto del conjunto de datos y no lo incluyeron en el análisis. En total, el análisis incluyó 556 arrestos en 2024 y 2,162 en 2025, siendo descartados menos de 100 arrestos.
Algunas personas arrestadas tenían condenas penales registradas en uno de los conjuntos de datos, pero no en otro. The Colorado Sun y WyoFile solo contabilizaron condenas penales que aparecían en los datos de arresto, que UC Berkeley y otros medios han determinado como los más confiables.
Debido a la necesidad de hacer inferencias, este análisis puede diferir de aquellos realizados por otras redacciones. Por ejemplo, The New York Times informó que los arrestos migratorios en Wyoming se habían duplicado, no triplicado. Pero el análisis realizado por The Colorado Sun y WyoFile identificó más arrestos atribuibles a ese estado que los que reportó el Times.
Funcionarios de ICE se negaron a responder preguntas sobre los datos y el análisis de The Colorado Sun y WyoFile, a pesar de que los datos fueron producidos por su propia agencia.

Los reporteros enviaron preguntas a Steve Kotecki, portavoz de ICE para la región que incluye ambos estados. Kotecki dijo que había reenviado dichas preguntas a la oficina nacional de prensa de ICE. Posteriormente, los reporteros recibieron una respuesta desde una cuenta genérica de correo electrónico de ICE, en la que se negaron a verificar los datos de su misma agencia. ICE también se rehusó a proporcionar una declaración oficial firmada y, en su lugar, envió un breve comunicado, sin firma, que repetía los mensajes nacionales estándar.
La respuesta de ICE a nuestra solicitud de información sobre arrestos locales refleja un esfuerzo creciente de la agencia por mantener en el anonimato a sus funcionarios. Agentes de ICE han usado máscaras durante operaciones en todo el país y se han negado a dar sus nombres a las personas detenidas o al público en general. Según informes, algunos fiscales que representan al gobierno en estos casos también han buscado mantener su anonimato.
El enfoque cada vez mayor de ICE en inmigrantes sin condenas penales ocurre mientras esta administración intenta alcanzar su meta de 3,000 arrestos migratorios diarios. Las tácticas de ICE han generado protestas en todo el país en los últimos meses, incluidas manifestaciones en ciudades de Colorado y Wyoming.

Colorado y Wyoming difieren mucho en cuanto a su política y su demografía. Colorado cuenta con un gobernador y una legislatura demócratas, mientras que Wyoming tiene un gobernador y una legislatura republicanos. Casi el 10% de los residentes de Colorado nacieron en el extranjero, mientras que solo el 3.6% de los residentes de Wyoming nacieron en otros países, según las últimas cifras del Censo Nacional.
Los datos muestran que la ofensiva anti migratoria ha sido más agresiva en Colorado que en Wyoming.

Activistas y abogados por los derechos de los inmigrantes dijeron a WyoFile y The Colorado Sun que, en Wyoming, el aumento de arrestos parece estar basado en un sistema que depende de que las fuerzas locales del orden notifiquen a ICE cuando han detenido a inmigrantes sospechosos de haber cometido delitos locales. Las redadas grandes, altamente visibles y las detenciones masivas que se han visto en otros estados del oeste han sido poco comunes en Wyoming.
Un número creciente de alguaciles en Wyoming ha firmado acuerdos para facilitar la cooperación con ICE. Dichos acuerdos probablemente violarían las leyes de Colorado, que prohíben una cooperación significativa entre las fuerzas del orden y ICE. Activistas aseguran que, incluso en los condados de Wyoming donde no existe un acuerdo formal, los agentes del sheriff ahora son más propensos a llamar a ICE cuando encarcelan a alguien de quien sospechan que está en el país sin autorización. Al mismo tiempo, ICE responde con más frecuencia a esos llamados y tiene más probabilidades de recoger a personas directamente de las cárceles que durante la administración del presidente Joe Biden.
“Están aquí”, dijo Bianca Infante, directora del programa Juntos, una organización estatal de defensa de inmigrantes con sede en Cheyenne, refiriéndose al creciente número de arrestos. “La manera en que actúan es más estratégica, menos visible. Pero que no lo veamos tanto no significa que no estén aquí”.
En Colorado y Wyoming, la mayoría de las personas arrestadas por ICE durante los primeros cinco meses de la administración de Trump no tenían condenas penales, según los datos. Esto representa un cambio con respecto al mismo período en 2024, cuando los datos indican que la mayoría de las personas arrestadas por ICE sí tenían condenas penales.
Entre quienes tenían condenas penales al momento del arresto este año, la mayoría era por delitos no violentos, de acuerdo con la definición del FBI.
Entre las personas arrestadas en Colorado y Wyoming hay individuos cuyas condenas tienen décadas de antigüedad, aunque no siempre se incluye la fecha. Tres personas arrestadas este año tienen condenas que, según ICE, datan de entre 1992 y 1999, y diez tienen condenas de entre 2000 y 2005.

Los datos indican que muy pocas personas parecen haber sido deportadas a países donde no tienen ciudadanía. Pero la lista incluye a nueve hombres venezolanos arrestados en Colorado desde el 20 de enero que fueron enviados a El Salvador el 15 de marzo. Al menos otros tres hombres venezolanos, arrestados durante la administración de Biden, también fueron enviados ese mismo día a El Salvador, según los datos de arresto.
Si bien los datos no incluyen nombres, la fecha de salida indica que estos hombres podrían formar parte del grupo de casi 300 personas que la administración de Trump deportó al Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, o CECOT, en El Salvador. Fueron deportados sin haber tenido la oportunidad de impugnar las acusaciones del gobierno federal de que eran miembros de pandillas, según demandas judiciales relacionadas con las detenciones en el CECOT.
Ninguno de los hombres de Colorado, cuyas edades oscilan entre los 22 y los 35 años aproximadamente, tenía condenas penales al momento de ser arrestado por ICE, según los datos. Uno de ellos tenía una condena por asalto grave, vinculada a su expediente de detención en ICE. El Salvador sigue manteniendo a estos hombres bajo detención, sin que tengan esperanza de ser liberados.

Los republicanos en el Congreso votaron a principios de este mes para aumentar el presupuesto anual de ICE de 8 mil millones de dólares a aproximadamente 28 mil millones, lo que convierte a esta agencia en el cuerpo de seguridad pública con mayor financiamiento del país.
Esta inyección de recursos continuará impulsando los arrestos, detenciones y deportaciones, dijo Julia Gelatt, subdirectora del programa de política migratoria del Instituto de Políticas Migratorias, un centro de estudios no partidista. Y añadió que es probable que cada vez más personas arrestadas, detenidas y deportadas sean aquellas cuyo único delito es haber ingresado al país sin autorización.
“Si quieren mantener el ritmo de arrestos que han estado llevando a cabo”, dijo Gelatt, “tendrán que ampliar su enfoque más allá de las personas con condenas penales”.


Metodología
Esta historia se basa en datos del Centro de Datos de Deportación de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de California en Berkeley.
Así fue como realizamos el análisis:

Guardamos las tablas como archivos CSV (valores separados por comas).
Importamos las tablas a un cuaderno Jupyter usando la biblioteca de Python llamada Pandas.
Restringimos las tablas a los datos que incluían el área de responsabilidad de Denver: los estados de Colorado y Wyoming.
En el caso de los datos de detención, utilizamos una lista de centros de detención ubicados en Colorado y Wyoming.
Usando identificadores únicos, combinamos los datos de detención con los de arresto para añadir el cargo por condena más grave.
Usando identificadores únicos, combinamos los datos de órdenes de retención con los de arresto para agregar las fechas de condena y otros datos estatales.
Restringimos los datos de arresto al período comprendido entre el 20 de enero y el 26 de junio de 2024 y 2025.
Eliminamos 41 registros en los que fue imposible determinar el estado.
Eliminamos 28 registros duplicados. Algunos duplicados en los que las personas fueron arrestadas en ambos años permanecen en los datos.
Eliminamos 25 registros que parecían provenir de otros estados.Usamos tablas dinámicas de Excel para analizar los 2,718 registros restantes.

Algunas personas arrestadas, registradas con cargos penales pendientes al momento del arresto, tenían condenas asociadas al conjunto de datos de detención.

The state has pushed the feds to hand over its land for decades,
with evolving strategies.
The post What history shows us about Utah’s push to take control of federal lands appeared first on WyoFile .","Note to readers: The following is an excerpt from the Salt Lake Tribune’s Open Lands newsletter, a twice-a-month newsletter about Utah’s land, water and air from their environment team. For a sneak peek at what they’re working on and news they’re following, sign up to have Open Lands delivered to your inbox.
Sen. Mike Lee’s public lands sell-off rider, meant to be part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” is officially dead.
But if history is a guide, Utah’s political leadership will likely be back with a new strategy and some new legal maneuver to gain control over at least some of its 35 million acres owned and managed by the federal government.
To get an idea of how the past informs the present, and how it might inform Utah’s future strategies, the Salt Lake Tribune spoke to Sara Dant, a professor emeritus and author of the book, “Losing Eden: An Environmental History of the American West.”
“If we look historically, of course,” Dant said, “this isn’t a new effort.”
It might come as a surprise, but the state’s Mormon pioneer settlers took a collectivist approach to land management, seeing it as a communal resource for all, kind of like our current perspective on federal lands managed by agencies like the U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management.
That all changed in the 1970s, when Western states with lots of public land retaliated against new federal policies that protected it from overuse.
“It was a recognition that the pendulum had swung too far toward the economy,” Dant said, “at the expense of environmental degradation.”
States’ priorities remained focused on their economies, however. Utah’s former Sen. Orrin Hatch became a prominent leader of the Sagebrush Rebellion that ensued, falsely claiming the states actually owned the lands within their boundaries and the federal government needed to return them.
The sentiment flared up in the West again in the 2010s, when legislatures in Utah, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming drafted bills demanding the federal government hand its lands over to state control. In Utah, that included Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, managed by the National Park Service, and wildlife management areas. Utah even commissioned a study that found the state could only afford the $250 million-plus annual price tag of managing federal lands and suppressing fires if it exploited vast oil and gas resources, and even then, only if prices for those materials held steady.
In recent years, however, we’ve seen Utah shift its tone and strategy, going after smaller chunks of public lands instead of the entire federal estate. The “unappropriated lands” lawsuit it filed last year went after 18.5 million BLM acres. Utah claims the federal government is sitting on this “undesignated land” and should sell it. But it also appears a tacit admission that federal lands, including national forests, parks and monuments, do, indeed, rightfully belong to the United States, not Utah.
Then came the provisions introduced to the Congressional budget by Utah’s Rep. Celeste Maloy and Sen. Lee. They attempted to make the federal government relinquish even smaller tracts by pointing to the West’s rapid growth. Maloy asserted the federal government needed to sell off certain parcels to benefit water infrastructure near St. George. Lee ultimately claimed he wanted a sliver of BLM land to help build affordable housing.
But despite a Supreme Court that has proven its willingness to upend precedent, a friendly, disruptive administration in the White House and Republican control of Congress, Utah failed in all three attempts this year.
And even though the proposals significantly scaled back the amount of federal lands states have pursued over the decades, the backlash has never been stronger, and not just among liberal environmental groups – the fallout also included Lee’s conservative base.
“It’s going to be interesting to see what the political consequences of that are for Lee,” Dant said, “because he really whacked a hornet’s nest.”
Lee’s public lands selloff technically failed because of a Congressional budget reconciliation rule. And the Supreme Court only declined to hear Utah’s “unappropriated” lands case, leaving the door open for the state to argue it in district court.
But Utah’s latest failed attempts show how much public lands politics has shifted in the West. Some former anti-federal land conservative allies, like Nevada and Arizona, have turned purple. And even solidly red states, like Idaho and Montana, came out in strong opposition to Maloy’s and Lee’s plans. Even Interior Secretary Doug Burgum declined to offer support. Social media and pro-public land campaigns led by hunters and anglers almost certainly played a role.
“They’re so rare these days,” Dant said, “issues that elicit a bipartisan response.”
Ultimately, Utah has found itself alone with Wyoming in the fight to wrest lands from the feds. It’s quite the whimper compared to the thunderous roar behind the Sagebrush Rebellion half a century ago.

Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mike Turner of Ohio voted against approval along with Democratic lawmakers.The Senate voted to pass the bill earlier this week after removing the section that would have eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds also secured a handshake deal with the White House budget director to transfer $9.4 million from an undisclosed account within the Interior Department to Native American radio stations in rural areas.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting will lose $1.1 billion in funding that Congress had previously approved for the fiscal year slated to begin Oct. 1 and for the year after that.The corporation provides funding for National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service and hundreds of local stations throughout the country.Another $8 billion of foreign aid will be eliminated once Trump signs the legislation.The White House budget office’s original rescissions request included more than a dozen accounts for reduced spending, including those addressing global health and democracy programs.The proposal called on lawmakers to cancel $500 million the U.S. Agency for International Development used for “activities related to child and maternal health, HIV/ AIDS, and infectious diseases.”“This proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs,” the request states. “Enacting the rescission would reinstate focus on appropriate health and life spending. This best serves the American taxpayer.”The final bill includes that spending cut but says the cancellation cannot affect HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, nutrition, or maternal and child health programs. It also says that “does not apply to family planning and reproductive health programs.”The White House asked to eliminate $83 million from the State Department’s democracy fund, writing that “aligns with the Administration's efforts to eliminate wasteful USAID foreign assistance programs and focus remaining funds on priorities that advance American interests. This best serves the American taxpayer.”Lawmakers included that request in the bill, along with nearly all the others, without any caveats or additional guardrails.Congress last approved a stand-alone rescissions bill in 1992 following a series of requests from President George H.W. Bush, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.The first Trump administration sent Congress a rescission request in 2018 that passed the House, but didn’t receive Senate approval.",,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

Columnist David Romtvedt reminisces about how publicly funded book discussions once allowed Wyomingites from Newcastle to Jackson to make sense of their lives and one another.
The post Talking about books appeared first on WyoFile .","As a newcomer to Wyoming in the 1980s, I earned my living — if you can call how little I earned a living — as a freelance writer and teacher. One of the most satisfying jobs I held was as a book discussion moderator for the Wyoming Humanities Council.

Opinion

Each year, council staff designed thematic reading lists — sports, mysteries, western American literature, science fiction, history, biographies. Any not-for-profit group could go through the nearly 40 different book lists to find one it wanted to use. The Humanities Council mailed out the books as loans to be returned when the series ended, so they could be read by another group. There were six books in a series. We read and discussed one book per month. There was no charge to the local group and if there was no series that appealed to a group, people could design their own list and request funding for it.
The honorarium, travel expenses and lodging for the book discussion leader were also paid for by the council. It wasn’t a lot, but it helped me to both pay the bills and get to know my new home. I met groups in Buffalo, Newcastle, Sundance, Casper, Cheyenne and Jackson. All the driving gave me a physical sense of Wyoming, along with the time to think about why and how books help us make sense of our lives, how they help us to understand each other and our history.
Back then — the 1980s and 90s — the Humanities Council received no funding from the state. Rather, the budget came almost entirely from the National Endowment for the Humanities. With NEH support, we were given the opportunity to know ourselves and others more deeply, and to examine our society in ways that were both serious and pleasurable while building communities of mutual respect.
I worked with a group in Newcastle for five years running. At our first meeting, there were 25 participants, all women. “Where are the men?” I asked.
“Are you kidding?” one woman said, “Our husbands? Read books?”

This was pretty ironic as I was a reader, a man, and the only person in the room being paid to be there. 
That first Newcastle series focused on women’s autobiographies — another irony. One of the books told the story of a woman who disguised herself as a man in order to travel throughout Iran after the 1979 fundamentalist revolution that led to severe restrictions on the rights and activities of women. Many of the Newcastle women spoke of their own experience of disguise — pretending to be someone you’re not in order to get by in society. The woman in disguise story resonated powerfully with the women in our group. 
In Jackson, we read books on water and land use issues in the West, including Marc Reisner’s Cadillac Desert, which briefly mentions James Watt, who served from 1981-83 in the Reagan administration as the Secretary of the Interior. Reisner described Watt as “the environmentalists’ anti-Christ,” and as, at age 30, “a fire-breathing evangelical Christian from Wyoming.” While Watt was said to be a central figure in conservationists’ “annals of villainy,” he was also dismissed as having “hopped around so much with his foot in his mouth that he didn’t really have a chance to do much that the environmental movement regarded as awful.”
At the time of the book discussion series, Watt lived in Jackson and, wanting to defend himself, signed up to participate. I was surprised that he would feel a need to do this and at first thought it self-centered and small. But as he talked in the group, it hit me that he felt vulnerable, that he’d been hurt by Reisner’s book. I’ve felt that way, too, and saw that prior to our discussion, Watt had been for me only a distant — not quite real — figure, I believed had done a disservice to the country through policies and actions that endangered our land, air and water. As a result of the book discussion, Watt was transformed into a person for me. I felt a little ashamed at how I had dismissed him from afar.
The Newcastle and Jackson book discussion series, indeed all of the Wyoming Humanities Council book discussion series, were eye-opening experiences for me and, as far as I could tell, for nearly everyone who took part in them. I’m grateful that public officials supported this use of public funds. It helped us to know one another more fully so that even when we disagreed, we were able to feel kindly toward each other, almost as if we were friends.

Jim Risch announced Wednesday.
Risch, R-Idaho, said he worked with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to secure the updated agreement.
“INL is the flagship laboratory for cybersecurity and is central to our national security,” Risch said in a written statement. “The valuable research and innovation at INL lays the groundwork for fortifying our nation’s electric grid and control systems to mitigate emerging cybersecurity threats. I am proud to have worked with Secretary Noem to ensure the critical cybersecurity efforts at INL continue at full force.”

Based in Eastern Idaho, Idaho National Laboratory is one of 17 U.S. Department of Energy national labs. 
“We sincerely appreciate the support we’ve received from Sen. Risch for our critical national security mission,” INL Associate Laboratory Director Zach Tudor said in a written statement. “This new contract will allow our staff to continue the significant cybersecurity support we provide to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in areas including cybersecurity incident response, vulnerability identification and disclosure, hands-on training for state and local responders and utilities, software security and supply-chain analysis, among other programs.”
INL employs or contracts with about 6,500 employees. Idaho National Laboratory includes a research and education campus in Idaho Falls as well as a vast 890-acre research complex located in the desert west of Idaho Falls that is commonly referred to as “the site.”
Idaho National Laboratory operates four nuclear reactors and is known for its nuclear energy research, as well as its work on cybersecurity, AI, homeland security and defense. 
 Idaho’s research role in cybersecurity mission

Marty Edwards, who headed up the cybersecurity program at Idaho National Laboratory as the director of the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, or ICS-CERT, said teams of Idaho researchers play a critical, front-line role defending against cyberattacks.
“They do things like finding security weaknesses in the computer systems that control our critical infrastructure, things like power grids and pipelines and manufacturing plants,” Edwards said in a phone interview Thursday. 
Edwards worked at Idaho National Laboratory from 2006 to 2017, both as a lab employee and a Department of Homeland Security federal employee. 
More than 100 people at Idaho National Laboratory worked on cybersecurity at the lab.
Although INL is known widely for its nuclear energy research, Edwards said cybersecurity fits perfectly into INL’s mission. Edwards said INL researchers who designed, built and tested nuclear reactors have a tremendous amount of knowledge about how critical infrastructure works. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Edwards said the U.S. government focused on leveraging that knowledge and expertise in Idaho to focus on cybersecurity. 
INL’s cybersecurity work has also involved training other people who work in critical infrastructure to make their systems more resilient to cyberattacks, Edwards said. 
After moving on from INL and Department of Homeland Security, Edwards returned to the private sector to work for a cybersecurity firm and has his own consulting company.
 After 75-year history, Idaho National Laboratory looks to future projects

Idaho National Laboratory celebrated its 75th anniversary last year and is in the middle of growing and ramping up operations. INL is in the process of permitting and building its first new nuclear reactors in 50 years, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
State officials and Department of Energy officials also recently announced a waiver to a 1995 settlement agreement that allows for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for the purpose of conducting research at INL. The waiver was necessary because the settlement agreement limited shipments of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho to prevent the state from becoming the country’s dumping ground for spent nuclear fuel. 
One of the largest employers in the state, INL has grown from about 3,750 employees in 2017 to about 6,500 today, the Sun previously reported.

Photo courtesy of Carla Broadnax of Jarrett Adams Law. David and Robert Bintz appeared at a hearing of the Wisconsin Claims Board last week, seeking compensation for decades spent behind bars before their release in September for a wrongful conviction. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The brothers’ attorney and the Brown County District Attorney expressed different views on a confession made by David Bintz prior to conviction. 
The Bintz brothers spent more than two decades in prison for the murder of Sandra Lison. Robert Bintz is now 69 years old and David is 70, and the brothers have faced health problems and challenges reintegrating into society. In February, Adams’ law firm sent the Examiner their compensation requests, which sought over $2 million for each brother. 
“I missed all the simple things in life that makes life beautiful,” Robert Bintz said via a statement read by his lawyer, Jarrett Adams, at the hearing. 
In April, the Examiner reported on the Bintz brothers’ return from prison and the gap in support to help exonerees in Wisconsin re-enter society. 
“We don’t know if David will still have his housing the next day,” Jarrett Adams, an attorney representing the brothers, said at the hearing. “We don’t know if David will have resources for his medical needs and medication. We don’t know a lot of things…But what we do know is that David is in need right now.”
Wrongly convicted people in Wisconsin can attempt to obtain compensation through the state law, which caps payouts at $25,000 and $5,000 per year of imprisonment. The exception is when the state Legislature approves a higher amount, which is rare. The claims board can recommend that the Legislature issue more compensation. 
Wrongly convicted people can also try to obtain a payout through a lawsuit. The Examiner previously reported that Adams said the brothers might not have an opportunity to get compensation if the state does not award it.
“This may be their only shot,” Adams said at the hearing. 
Brothers’ attorney, DA view case differently 
The claims board has said that the Wisconsin statute does not provide money to someone who only establishes that their conviction was vacated. The board must find that there is clear and convincing evidence of innocence, not just that a conviction was overturned. 
The statute says that the board will decide an amount of compensation for a person if it finds the person is innocent and that they did not contribute to bring about their conviction through their act or failure to act. 
Adams argued that the brothers did not contribute to their convictions. He said David had a documented learning disability and was made to sit under questioning for hours until he signed a confession. 
Brown County District Attorney David Lasee said he didn’t think it was his role to take a position on whether the Bintz brothers should receive additional funds, but he disagreed with Adams’ portrayal of the confession, saying that concern was considered during the legal process.
“…They were not charged until 12 years after the death of Ms. Lison, and that was based on statements that were made by David,” Lasee said at the hearing. “And there’s a confession from David. There’s also statements that David made to other inmates in prison, which is what prompted the investigators to come back and interview him. So that didn’t happen in a vacuum. And again, I take issue with the notion of the statement being coerced…so the defense attorney for David litigated the motion of whether it was a coercive statement that should be suppressed, and the statement obviously was not suppressed, and we proceeded to trial.”
Lasee was asked about how it was determined that the statement was not coerced. He said it was litigated but he did not recall the specifics of the decision.  
The Brown County District Attorney’s Office prosecuted the Bintz brothers with a theory of robbery and murder. 
According to the National Registry of Exonerations, when David’s trial began, the prosecution’s theory changed from the way the case had been investigated at the outset. 
“It was no longer that Lison had been robbed, raped, and killed,” the registry says. “Now, the prosecution contended that the Bintz brothers went to the bar to rob it because they felt Lison had overcharged them for a case of beer and ended up killing her because she could recognize them.”
The registry says that “by the time David’s trial began in May 2000, DNA testing had excluded both brothers from the semen found in the rape kit. Blood found under Lison’s body was not their blood, according to testing.” 
According to the registry, during closing argument in Robert’s trial, the prosecution argued that it was “‘clear that this was not a sexual assault, and whoever the donor of those spermatozoa is, [he] was not involved in this murder.’”
In 2006, the Wisconsin Innocence Project obtained additional DNA testing that confirmed blood found on Lison’s dress came from the same male whose sperm was found in the rape kit, the registry says. A motion for a new trial based on the testing was denied. 
The registry also says that police interviewed 32 year-old David Bintz and his brother, as well as a friend, Vincent Andrus. 
“David reported that Robert and Andrus had gone to the bar from David’s house during the evening to buy a case of beer,” the registry says. “Lison had sold them four six-packs for $3.50 each. When Robert and Andrus got back to David’s home, David, who was intellectually disabled, became angry because he thought Lison should have charged them for the price of a case, which was cheaper. 
“He had called the bar at one point and chewed out Lison. Some would later say he threatened to come over and blow up the tavern.”
The exonerations registry says prisoners testified that David had made various admissions to the crime. 
The registry says that when detectives interviewed David, he eventually agreed to a statement admitting he and Robert were involved and that Robert had strangled Lison. David also said he was home at the time of the crime and was not involved. 
Lasee said that he would “unequivocally state that based on the evidence that exists right now, I do not believe that the state of Wisconsin would be able to prove their guilt at trial.” 
But he said that “we did not stipulate that there was clear and convincing evidence of their innocence, because that’s not what we do. That’s not the standard we operate under.”

(Getty Images)Those closely tracking the post-Dobbs landscape are already familiar with the mounting crises: maternity care deserts, provider shortages, unprecedented Medicaid cuts in the “Big Beautiful Bill,” and widening inequities in access to reproductive and maternal health services. But a recent article from Idaho caught my attention for highlighting a more insidious and underexamined consequence — one that directly intersects with our research into the unregulated maternal care industry: the quiet redefinition of what qualifies as competent medical care. 
Idaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.

The article documents how Idaho’s abortion ban has not only dismantled reproductive services, but also destabilized the broader health care infrastructure, particularly in rural communities expected to be the hardest hit by Republicans’ recent Medicaid cuts. 
As physicians leave the state in response to legal threats and professional uncertainty, nurse practitioners and physician assistants — skilled, essential members of the care team — are increasingly stepping in to meet community needs. But this is not simply a redistribution of responsibility. This shift is occurring in an environment where oversight is eroding, not in response to clinical best practices, but as a byproduct of ideological interference in the delivery of care. 
This deterioration of structured medical oversight is producing dangerous confusion. As one Medicaid patient told States Newsroom, she no longer knows who her doctor is. That disorientation — once unthinkable in a functioning health care system — is quickly becoming the new normal. 
One way many of us have experienced this trend is through telehealth care where a provider you may not know is assigned to your case. That provider may be a physician, physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner but whichever is the case, there is a structure in place to ensure multiple layers of relevant oversight and accountability. 
The crisis pregnancy center industry offers a chilling preview of what happens when that structure is removed. With more than 3,000 centers nationwide, a projected $2.5 billion in revenue in 2025, and a meticulously cultivated image of medical legitimacy — white coats, ultrasound machines, exam tables — crisis pregnancy centers function as a sprawling system of pseudo-health care. 
To manage legal exposure — not individual patient needs — many have adopted a model wherein licensed nurses and volunteers deliver strictly “pro-life” care under the supervision of off-site medical directors. These directors, often overseeing multiple centers in a volunteer capacity as they have full-time positions elsewhere, may lack OB-GYN credentials and rarely, if ever, see patients. Indeed, it’s so rare that a crisis pregnancy center website even discloses the name of their medical director, it’s not even clear if one exists for the vast majority of these clinics.
US hospitals see stark decline of obstetric services, study shows

Internal crisis pregnancy center protocols lay bare just how fragile the illusion of medical capability truly is. 
Take, for example, recent exposés detailing how crisis pregnancy centers handle suspected ectopic pregnancies. While many centers promote ultrasound services under the guise of “ruling out” this life-threatening condition, staff are simultaneously instructed to refer such cases to actual medical providers. 
In a telling contradiction, the crisis pregnancy center model depends on the very emergency abortion care it publicly seeks to dismantle. This practice is revealing: these centers do not regard themselves as true medical providers, yet they meticulously design their operations to mimic traditional clinics — white coats, exam tables, and all.
 It’s no surprise, then, that the public often responds with disbelief: Surely this must be illegal. But it isn’t. A tangle of permissive policy, regulatory loopholes and precedent has made this deeply flawed system not only legal but increasingly normalized and entrenched. 
Now, as Idaho’s health care system strains under the weight of its abortion ban and the looming convergence of Republican-led Medicaid cuts and the abrupt dismissal of trained federal health regulators charged with protecting patient safety, a deeper contradiction comes into view: the very lawmakers slashing funding and dismantling oversight are the same ones lauding crisis pregnancy centers as a model of “comprehensive care.” 
In this political climate, there is growing concern that the crisis pregnancy center-style approach — unregulated, ideologically driven and medically hollow — is not just tolerated, but quietly being ushered into the mainstream. 
What began as an assault on abortion access is morphing into a full-scale redefinition of health care — one that hollows out oversight, sows confusion, and empowers ideologically driven non-practitioners to shape the contours of clinical practice without the training, accountability or ethical obligations of licensed professionals.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Tennessee’s campaign finance regulator is stuck between the state’s open records law and confidentiality surrounding the state board that oversees attorney ethics, leaving the public wondering: What the heck?
State law allows decisions by the Board of Professional Responsibility to remain confidential. Yet the actions of the Registry of Election Finance and its executive director are subject to the Public Records Act, creating a conflict the Registry board wants resolved by the state attorney general.
It all started last summer when Nashville attorney Cynthia Sherwood sent a private investigator to the home of Registry chief Bill Young to question him about legal matters dealing with former House staffer Cade Cothren. A federal jury found Cothren guilty in May on 19 counts of fraud and conspiracy in a kickback deal with ex-House Speaker Glen Casada. Cothren also has a pending case before the Registry over operation of a political action committee called the Faith, Family, Freedom Fund.
Young refused to speak to the investigator, who apparently tried to talk to several House members, as well. But Registry board members were irate about the incident and reported Sherwood to the Board of Professional Responsibility for a potential ethics violation.

Young is represented by a staff attorney and the Attorney General’s Office in the case, and he and Registry board members said it’s clearly unethical for an attorney to try to talk to a person known to have a lawyer in a pending case.
The Board of Professional Responsibility finally issued a decision on the matter, but the letter it sent to Young in his professional capacity is being considered confidential – at least for now – by the Registry until the AG’s Office “clarifies the application of the law,” according to the general counsel for the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance.
Even Young’s letter requesting a legal opinion from Skrmetti is being withheld from public records requests.
The state’s public records custodian also turned down a request by the Lookout, saying Young’s letter to the AG’s Office is exempt because of attorney-client privilege.
Registry members aren’t exactly enthused with that view, and they voted last week to seek a legal opinion from AG Jonathan Skrmetti to determine whether confidentiality rules surrounding the Board of Professional Responsibility supersede requirements for the Registry to adhere to the Public Records Act.
Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, acknowledged the AG’s Office represents the Registry but said the documents should fall under the Public Records Act and the AG should reach that conclusion quickly.
The exemption for the Board of Professional Responsibility exists only so complaints don’t hurt someone’s reputation before a decision is reached, Fisher said. 
“This involves a governing body making a complaint, and I don’t see how that can not be a public record,” she said. “I think they’d have to bend over backwards to twist the law.”
It should be noted the Board of Professional Responsibility didn’t put any official decision about Sherwood on its website, although it could have taken other disciplinary steps.
Registry member Hank Fincher confirmed that Young’s letter to the AG contains confidential information from the Board of Professional Responsibility. At the same time, the attorney board sent a confidential letter to a public agency, Fincher said, pitting “contradictory policies” against each other.
“I think we’re in a quandary,” Fincher said. “We’re a government agency bound by the open records act, and I can state that I don’t have a problem with the letter being public record.”
Tennessee Registry reports Cothren attorney to disciplinary board

Yet the Board of Professional Responsibility takes attorney discipline and confidentiality surrounding those cases seriously because of state law, Fincher said, thus the request for the AG’s direction.
“We have to serve two masters here,” he added.
Registry board Chairman Tom Lawless contends the letters should be public records. After all, the Registry’s actions took place in public meetings.
Obtaining public documents from state agencies is a hit-or-miss proposal, often depending on the wording of requests. 
It will be interesting to see whether Skrmetti believes the public’s right to know is more – or less – important than confidentiality allowed by the Supreme Court for the Board of Professional Responsibility, which isn’t exactly the most transparent group to come down the pike. 
Ongoing SAGA
Tennessee’s Republican leaders are bending over backwards to work with the Trump administration on the deportation of undocumented immigrants.
Not only are they hammering Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell over criticism of federal-state sweeps in the city, they’re spending handsomely for an immigration czar and grants to local law enforcement agencies to teach them how to act like federal agents.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers wearing masks have rounded up undocumented immigrants, and protesters in California also covered their faces in a chaotic atmosphere earlier this year.
Amid that backdrop, Democratic Rep. Justin Jones of Nashville is sponsoring the Stop American Gestapo Act (SAGA), which would make it illegal for law enforcement officers to wear a mask, face covering or personal disguise while interacting with the public in official duties.
The bill, which was filed June 30, would allow officers to wear masks to prevent the transmission of airborne diseases, protect against smoke or other particles during a fire or disaster, and to protect special weapons and tactics officers’ faces from harm.

But simply wearing a mask to go out and sweep the countryside would be a Class C misdemeanor. 
Additionally, the bill would make it illegal for a law enforcement officer to deal with the public without clearly displaying the officer’s name or badge number on their uniform.
Violations could be reported to the local district attorney general or to the state attorney general and reporter’s civil rights enforcement division.
In Metro Nashville, that could mean pitting District Attorney Glenn Funk, who has thumbed his nose at some state laws, against Tennessee Attorney General Skrmetti. Gee, inquiring minds want to know how that would turn out.
But alas, Jones isn’t winning many popularity contests with supermajority Republicans in the General Assembly, calling House Speaker Cameron Sexton “drunk with power” after getting booted from the body for leading an anti-gun rally on the House floor. He was returned to the seat by the Metro Council before winning re-election.
Passing this bill in a chamber determined to beat up on immigrants would be nothing short of miraculous.
Running a little short
Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles is reporting only $53,000 in fundraising over the last quarter, giving him about $109,000 to work with over the next few months.
Clearly, he has more time to build up a war chest in advance of the 2026 election. But this amount is puzzling, considering his attachment to President Donald Trump and popularity in the rural part of the 5th Congressional District outside of Nashville.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting Ogles and trying to flip the seat, which would be a monumental move considering the legislature redrew the 5th District lines to ensure Republicans could take over what was once a safe Democratic seat.
Ogles won a second term in spite of questions about his fundraising and whether he massaged the numbers to make his initial haul look bigger than it really was. Republican voters don’t seem to care, either, that his resume has more holes than a gopher den.

The FBI was looking into his finances until Trump called them off when Ogles filed a bill to allow the president to serve a third term. He’s also gained notoriety by going after Nashville Mayor O’Connell for his criticism of the south Nashville immigrant sweep.
With all of that happening, he might not be worried about campaign fundraising. And, similarly to Jones’ Gestapo bill, a win by Democrats will be miraculous, but a contest from a strong Republican could be hard for Ogles to overcome.
Cutting your losses
Tennessee’s Sports Wagering Council levied fines totaling $250,000 against five offshore sportsbooks for taking wagers in the state without a license.
The council hit Costa Rica-based BetAnySports, Bookmaker and JazzSports; Panama-based BetOnline and Curacao-based Evergame each with $50,000 penalties, bringing its total fines to $600,000.
“The SWC is exploring all avenues with its network of law enforcement to eliminate these bad actors from Tennessee,” Executive Director Mary Beth Thomas said. “Consumers in Tennessee need to be aware that illegal operators will gladly take their money and personal information, and if a consumer does business with an illegal book, they give away their information to criminals.”
The council appears to be doing a good job of ferreting out illicit bookies. If only it could guarantee me a win. But then that wouldn’t be gambling, and it could be journalistically unethical. Do you think that would be exempt from the open records law? Hardly.
“I was gambling in Havana / I took a little risk / Send lawyers, guns and money, Dad, get me out of this.” *

(Photo by Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Colorado-Letter-SoS-Griswold
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
 Letters to multiple states ask about voter registration information, noncitizen voting

DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.
Idaho constitutional amendment to ban noncitizen voting passes

While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
 U.S. Department of Justice requests ‘all records’ for voter data in Colorado

In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.

Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“The bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
Idaho officials work to ensure noncitizens do not vote in state, local elections through order

The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“The really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
 How states are responding to Department of Justice’s voter information requests

As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
HAVA-letter-redacted
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.

Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
Letters to other states
As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.

HAVA-letter-redacted 
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator) 


This article is part of a series on the environmental costs of America’s last remaining alumina refinery.


State environmental regulators have discovered more pollution discharges from the waste containment lakes at the Atlantic Alumina facility near Gramercy, just months after citing the refinery for spewing toxic waste containing arsenic, cadmium, chromium and other heavy metals into state waters.
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality conducted a compliance evaluation May 29 at Atlantic Alumina, also known as Atalco, and documented nine violations at the plant, according to public records available on the agency’s website. 
The company did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. 
Several of the new violations are similar to ones detailed in a recent Illuminator investigation into pollution discharges that occurred at the refinery last year, which neither residents nor local officials were fully aware of at the time. Those discharges involved an industrial “red mud” byproduct of the alumina refining process that contained poisonous heavy metals and caustic chemicals that eroded through giant levees surrounding the facility’s waste containment lakes and spilled onto public property. 
The toxic waste killed vegetation and contaminated the land along its path to a public drainage system that flows to the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas, according to a 606-page LDEQ inspection report finalized in March. Lab analysis of water samples collected from that public ditch contained arsenic at a concentration nearly 1,400% higher than the maximum safety threshold set by the EPA.
During their May 29 inspection, LDEQ officials cited Atalco again for failing to maintain its levees, allowing high grass to obscure the lakes and allowing chemical waste to overflow the embankments. 
“Multiple discharges from Red Mud Lake 3 into Outfall 003,” the LDEQ inspector wrote in his field report. Outfall 003 refers to a drainage system designed to collect rain and surface water runoff from some of the levees.    
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

Atalco’s failure to maintain its system of 50-foot-high containment levees was the primary cause of the levee breaks and toxic waste discharges that occurred last summer and continued through the remainder of the year, according to the state and federal inspectors who documented the incident. 
Additionally, during their most recent visit to the facility, the LDEQ inspectors discovered a diesel tank leaking into a separate outfall that drains into the Mississippi River. That same ditch also contained a red-orange colored liquid with a petrochemical rainbow sheen on the surface and a noticeable “diesel odor present,” according to the records. 
State inspectors found a similar rust-colored liquid in a separate drainage pipe and discovered diesel leaking from a pump near a third drainage system, Outfall 004. The records show they took pH readings from multiple drains and detected levels in excess of 9, which indicates the likely presence of a caustic chemical. 
LDEQ’s investigation into the facility, which began last summer following the levee breaches, remains ongoing. So far, no enforcement penalties have been levied against the company. 
“The company has been cooperating with our staff through the investigation and is actively working toward compliance,” LDEQ spokesman Matthew Day said in an email.
Atalco’s refinery occupies roughly 3 square miles of land where St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes meet on the Mississippi River’s east bank. Atalco sells refined alumina to metal smelters that make finished aluminum. Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States and therefore the nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock. 
Atalco produced 669,261 metric tons of aluminum oxide last year, state records show. For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Tony Evers might not run for a third term. Evers, who hasn’t declared his intentions, has only raised $757,214 this year and has $2 million in the bank, compared with the $5 million he raised during the same period in 2021, before his successful bid for a second term.
Some progressives, most vocally Dan Shafer, creator of The Recombubulation Area blog, have been calling on Evers to step aside. Traumatized by former President Joe Biden’s fumbling 2024 campaign, Shafer says Evers, who is 73 (a decade younger than Biden) should not make the mistake of hanging around too long and instead should “pass the torch.”
“This is not ultimately an argument about ideological differences or policy disagreements,” Shafer writes. For him, it’s about age. It’s about the Biden trauma. And it’s about the problem Democrats at both the state and national level seem to have nurturing the next generation of leaders.
For some progressives, it’s also about ideology and policy disagreements. Advocates for child care, public schools, criminal justice reform and protecting health care access were furious that Evers didn’t drive a harder bargain with Republicans in the recently completed state budget deal. 
Still, if Evers announces his retirement, a large, non-MAGA portion of Wisconsin will experience a moment of fear. In our closely divided purple state, there is a real possibility a Republican could win the governor’s office, just as new, fairer maps are finally giving Democrats a chance to compete for power in the state Legislature. The Republicans who have declared so far are wrapping themselves in the MAGA flag. Evers is popular across the state and has shown he can win.
Devin Remiker, the state Democratic party chair, has said he is “praying” Evers will run again. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters recently that he couldn’t think of a better governor for Wisconsin than Evers.
If Evers doesn’t run, Attorney General Josh Kaul, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys and Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski are all likely Democratic candidates.
“There’s plenty of people on the bench who would love to be governor,” Pocan said. “… that’s not a concern. It’s really, I want the best person to be governor, and I think the best person who could be governor on the Democratic side is Tony Evers.”
Pocan calls Evers a “responsible adult” in contrast to Republicans who are following President Donald Trump off a cliff, slashing health care and food aid and driving up prices and deficits, making life a lot worse for a lot of people, including a projected 276,000 in Wisconsin who will lose health insurance and 49,000 who will lose food assistance under the federal mega bill.
There is an argument that Evers — “the most quintessentially Wisconsin politician I’ve ever seen,” as Pocan put it — accomplished what most Wisconsin voters wanted him to do in the budget process, put politics aside and get the best deal he could for state residents. Working across the aisle to achieve shared goals with the other party — including a last-minute maneuver that mitigates the disastrous Medicaid cuts Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through, drawing down $1 billion per year in federal funds for Wisconsin, was, as Evers himself pointed out, “significantly different” from the dynamic in Washington. 
“How about that, compromise?” Evers said Wisconsin voters told him, happily, when they heard about the deal. 
If the definition of compromise is a bargain that makes everyone unhappy, Democrats and progressives are clearly the more unhappy parties to this bargain.
Despite the glow of productive bipartisanship when the deal was struck, the details — and how the deal was done — are beginning to grate on some of Evers’ biggest former backers.
Big majorities of Republican legislators voted for the deal in both chambers. Five out of 15 Senate Democrats joined them, and there were only seven yes votes out of 45 Democrats in the state Assembly, where Speaker Robin Vos, who helped craft the budget, made it clear he didn’t need or want Democratic votes.
Arguably, the Democrats who gave impassioned floor speeches denouncing the budget have been in the minority in the Legislature for so long they never have to think about making the kinds of compromises involved in governing a divided state. If you look at it that way, it seems unfair of them to react angrily to Evers, a decent man who shares their goals and has worked diligently to accomplish what he can in the face of nasty opposition. Apart from Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein, who joined the budget negotiations behind closed doors after it became clear Republicans were going to need some Democratic votes in the Senate, Democrats were largely shut out of the whole process.
And that’s the real problem with the way Evers governs, according to Robert Kraig of Citizen Action. By not involving legislative Democrats from the beginning, he disempowered not just those individual legislators but their constituents, giving up the pressure he could have brought to bear on Republicans if he leveraged citizen outrage and demands for action on broadly popular priorities — funding public schools, expanding Medicaid, keeping child care centers open, and the whole list of progressive policies in Evers’ original budget proposal.
Instead, Evers was the kind of adult in the room who sends everyone else out when it’s time to make a decision. 
This governing style, Kraig argues, is badly out of step with the political moment. As an increasingly dangerous, destructive administration sends masked agents to grab people off the street and throw them in detention centers or deport them without due process, liquidates safety net programs and deliberately destroys civil society, it’s going to take a massive, popular movement to fight back.
Maybe Shafer is right that a younger, dynamic Democratic candidate could emerge as a leader of that movement. Maybe the Democratic Party needs to stop praying for likeable, bipartisan father figures to deliver victory and instead open the doors to the somewhat chaotic, populist backlash that is brewing against the oligarchic, authoritarian kleptocracy led by Trump.
It’s a big risk. But we are in very risky times. Democrats, and the public at large, have not yet figured out how to defend against the unprecedented maliciousness of our current federal government and the MAGAfied Republican party. The whole idea of bipartisanship seems outdated in a world where one side is seeking to tear up the social contract, the Constitution, due process, the justice system, fair elections, and the most basic, longstanding protections against poverty, hunger and disease.
These are the same conditions that gave rise to the Progressive Era. Fighting Bob LaFollette fought the leaders of his own party and founded a nationwide movement to wrest control of government from the wealthy timber barons and railroad monopolies who, through corrupt, captive politicians, fought to control all the resources of our state and nation.
Now those same powerful interests are fighting to claw back everything, to destroy the reforms of the early 20th century protecting workers, the environment, and the public sphere. They are smashing public institutions and flouting legal constraints.
Democrats need to make the case to the public that they will fight back. And they need the public to rise up behind them to help them do it.

(Photo: Courtesy of Sherry Inman)Three and a half months after a tornado destroyed more than 100 buildings in Selmer, Tennessee, the city is now removing piles of debris from the storm’s scar.
The EF-3 tornado swept through Selmer, the McNairy County seat, with wind speeds up to 160 miles per hour in the early morning of April 3. When its 43-mile storm track fizzled out, the storm left behind 332 damaged structures, most of which were privately owned. Five people were killed.
Selmer Mayor Sherry Inman described the amount of debris as “unreal.” The storm came in the middle of the city’s budget process and plunged Selmer into unknown territory, she said.
“It changed a lot of our plans … we had to sit on the debris for a little while until we could figure out where we could take it,” Inman said.
Selmer borrowed $650,000 from its utility division’s gas fund to cover initial costs, and leased two plots of land from the owners of Knight’s Sawmill for $10 to use for debris sorting and burning.
The city plans to sort through the debris, pulling out vegetation, tree stumps and branches, and other wood to burn. The process uses an air curtain incinerator, a machine that creates a high-velocity air “curtain” to trap smoke and particulates in a burn pit to cut down on emissions.
Burning some of the debris “gives us a chance to separate and hopefully eliminate some of the weight to try to save what money we can save,” Inman said.
The remaining debris that cannot be burned — plastics, metals, asphalt roofing and other construction and demolition debris — will ultimately be trucked to a landfill in Jackson, Tennessee, where Selmer will pay a fee per cubic ton.
But the rules for burning storm debris are strict, and Selmer has run into some issues in its first two weeks of work on the debris site.
The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates incineration of natural disaster debris, received a complaint of odor, ash and soot on July 3, the fourth day of the site’s operation.
Burning complaint and state regulations
The state approved Selmer’s plans to use a temporary incinerator on the site to burn specific types of debris for up to 16 weeks.
The approval stipulates that the city must “make a reasonable effort” to remove any prohibited materials before igniting the blaze. That includes plastic, rubber, vinyl flooring and siding, asphalt roofing materials, carpet, material containing asbestos and any electronic waste.
The city can’t burn debris if air contaminants cause traffic hazards, if there is an air pollution emergency or if the state agency determines the emissions jeopardize public health or create a nuisance, according to state documents.
State records show an inspector who visited the site on July 3 noted “ashes and waste in the pit that indicated open burning of prohibited materials had occurred.”

Selmer Fire Chief Anthony Carr and Inman “noted some open burning of demolition materials had occurred for less than two days before they were made aware that this material did not meet … guidelines for approved burning,” the report states.
An inspector visited the site on July 8 when no burning was taking place and reported that the pit contained materials approved for burning. The complaint was dismissed on July 8 without violation.
Inman said the first week of handling debris was “trial and error” and there were problems getting the burn pit to work properly.
“Everything TDEC has asked us to do, we’re going by that strictly,” Inman said.
She wants to see the debris removal process wrap up within eight weeks, if possible, and doesn’t want to jeopardize that timeline by failing to adhere to state regulations, she said.
“We’re trying to make sure that we are mindful of taxpayers’ money, and … we’ve always been mindful of the residents in that area,” she said. “We don’t want any health issues whatsoever, so we have never burned anything that caused any health (issues) … and the smoke is very minimal.”
When the vegetation is burned and the other debris has been trucked to the landfill, Selmer plans to remove any remaining ash to the landfill as well, Inman said. That will leave the site uncontaminated for future use.
Selmer moves forward
Inman said her main goal is clearing the debris so the city can move forward with whatever comes next.
“We’ve tried to get it off the side of the roads and out of the storm area so that the storm victims and their families and properties can get back to closure and get to where they can work on building back or whatever their next step is,” she said.
The total cost of removing debris will be clear after the city receives its first invoices for trucking debris to and from the staging site and dumping it in the landfill.
President Donald Trump’s administration approved a major disaster declaration for McNairy County in June, allowing the county to access federal assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
In previous years, FEMA public assistance has reimbursed local and state governments for about 75% of the costs of immediate recovery, but Trump’s administration has signaled the possibility of reducing that match and transferring more financial responsibility for disaster recovery to states. Tennessee has historically split the remaining 25% of costs evenly with local governments.

Inman said it’s not clear how much aid funding Selmer will receive, but the prospect of any help “means a great deal for Selmer.”
“Selmer has got some funds, but we have really looked at putting back more if we’re going to continue to have these disasters,” she said. “If we hadn’t had this declaration for our town, it would have been a strain on us, and then if we had (another disaster) coming behind us … it would have been very devastating to our town.”
It will take a year or two for FEMA funding to come through, but that “at least gives us a chance to plan,” Inman said.
The city is also working on ordinances that could help expedite immediate needs like debris removal should another disaster occur.
In the meantime, parts of Selmer are planning to build back. The city lost some historic buildings, but businesses on the North end will rebuild, and the city may see more duplexes replace demolished housing.
Before the storm, Selmer had a shortage of housing, Inman explained. The loss of so many buildings put the town further behind.
Seeing the people who were affected the most begin to put their lives back together gives Inman hope, she said.
“It just kind of makes you think … it wasn’t a perfect plan, and it was trial and error, but at least we’re doing something,” she said. “We’re trying to do what’s right for them and for our town.”

A federal appeals court says it can take effect.,"A Mississippi law that requires age verification for users of social media sites can take effect, federal judges ruled Thursday. But a tech industry group says a court fight will continue.
A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals removed a block that a district judge last year put on the “Walker Montgomery Protecting Children Online Act.”
“Enacted after a sextortion scheme on Instagram led a 16-year-old Mississippian to take his own life, the Act imposes modest duties on the interactive online platforms that are especially attractive to predators,” Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch wrote in court papers filed July 2, arguing for the law to take effect.
NetChoice, a tech industry group that sued the state, said the law creates risks to privacy, overrides parental authority and unconstitutionally limits speech for Mississippi residents of all ages.
The law says a minor must have permission of a parent or guardian to have a social media account, and it requires digital service providers to make “commercially reasonable efforts” to verify users’ ages. It also says social media companies could not collect, sell or share minors’ personal information and tech companies must have strategies to prevent minors from accessing “harmful material.” 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the law in April 2024 after legislators unanimously approved it.
Members of NetChoice include the parent companies of Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram. The group sued Mississippi in June 2024 and a federal district judge blocked the law on July 1, 2024 – the day it originally was set to take effect.
Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said Thursday that the group is “considering all available options” after the appeals court decision.
“NetChoice will continue to fight against this egregious infringement on access to fully protected speech online,” Taske said. “Parents – not the government – should determine what is right for their families.”

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)People held in Florida’s immigrant detention center in the Everglades sued the Trump and DeSantis administrations on Wednesday, demanding access to their attorneys.
This class action from the detainees and their attorneys adds to the mounting legal opposition to the detention center, where people started arriving two weeks ago after a speedy eight-day construction at an old airstrip.
Since detainees’ transfer to the state-run detention center, attorneys have had to wait hours in their attempts to visit the site, only to be barred from entering, the complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida states. Detainees held at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport lack a way to communicate confidentially with their legal representation as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution, it adds.
Four detainees and their legal representatives are asking a federal court to require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Florida to provide access for in-person visits and unmonitored calls.
“What’s happening here is not just a policy failure, it’s a moral one,” said Bacardi Jackson, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, which is representing the plaintiffs. “The state has hastily erected a costly and deadly shadow prison in the middle of the Everglades during hurricane season to warehouse human beings — stripping them of due process and dignity, cutting them off from their families and legal counsel, intentionally putting their lives in danger, and leaving them to suffer in silence.”
The tent and trailer detention center is in a legal limbo, with the federal government disavowing responsibility for the detainees and the DeSantis administration insisting that it’s not a correctional institution. Its existence outside the federal and state systems — the Florida Division of Emergency Management is in charge — has made it extremely difficult for attorneys to locate detainees and file motions on their behalf.

 Complaint outlines detention conditions

Gov. Ron DeSantis defended conditions at the detention center during a Wednesday morning press conference in Tampa, during which he appointed Blaise Ingoglia, an ally in the state Senate, as Florida’s chief financial officer.
“Remember, this is not the Ritz-Carlton, okay. We’re not doing this just to let people have food and shelter, although they do get that. All the minimum standards are upheld, but the reality is it’s there to be a quick processing center.”
The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, and Americans for Immigrant Justice represent the plaintiffs in the case against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its leadership, DeSantis, and DEM director Kevin Guthrie.
So far, the state has lacked transparency about the number of people at the detention center, and the most detailed information has come from the Miami Herald, which published a list on Sunday of 750 detainees housed there, including more than 250 people without criminal convictions or pending charges in this country.
Although the lawsuit focuses on the detainees’ lack of access to attorneys and due process, the complaint details conditions detainees have described at the site, ranging from flooding inside tents and having to go days without showering to guards’ excessive use of force and denial of medication.
Michael Borrego Fernandez, a Cuban man taken to the detention center in the Everglades on July 5, is one of the plaintiffs. The complaint states he had to undergo emergency surgery at a local hospital on July 11 because of excessive bleeding while he was at the detention center. Staff didn’t give Borrego Fernandez the antibiotics prescribed following the surgery, his family told his attorneys.
Miami-Dade County law enforcement arrested Borrego Fernandez on July 5 over a parole violation involving outstanding traffic violations, and his family is working with his attorneys to seek his deportation to Cuba because of the conditions at the detention center.
Dismissing the claims in the lawsuit, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded: “No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States, and yet all they do is complain.”
At the same time, the detention center is at the center of two additional lawsuits: One from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida seeking to halt the site’s operation in the fragile ecosystem, and another from state Democratic lawmakers demanding oversight authority to conduct visits.
DEM and a spokesperson for DeSantis did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

(Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)“In West Virginia, the combination of mountainous terrain and an aging population — who may have slower reaction times or be at increased risk for sudden health events, such as strokes — can create hazardous conditions.” — JNY Law spokesperson
There were 83 older West Virginians who died in 2022 as a result of traffic crashes. For seniors (aged 65+), West Virginia experiences 4.68 fatal accidents per 100,000 residents. Amazingly, that is over 17 times as many per capita as Rhode Island, the safest state for older drivers, per National Highway Traffic Safety Administration figures. And nearly two thirds higher than the national rate of fatal accidents.
Yes, West Virginia’s residents are older than other states and the winding roads can be treacherous. However, the real question to be answered is “How can this rate be lowered?”
As stated above, West Virginia’s population is relatively older than the rest of America. But there are other factors to be considered regarding causation, including mental health and substance abuse. It is very possible that higher drug and alcohol abuse and poorer mental health are hidden causes resulting in the higher West Virginia senior accident figures.
For example, even relatively minor amounts of alcohol have been shown to affect a driver’s ability to avoid crashes. Almost a third of car accidents involve intoxicated drivers, accounting for 11,000 deaths. And 56% of serious and fatal car accidents were drug related (including alcohol, various illegal drugs and prescription medicines).
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2023 there were 1335 West Virginians who lost their lives due to drug abuse. Proportionally, with a rate of 81 deaths per 100,000 population, that is higher than any other state. To give the reader an idea of how outrageous that number is, look at Nebraska, with a rate of 11 out of 100,000. In other words, West Virginia has a drug death rate seven times higher than Nebraska.
Another factor contributing to senior crash rates is mental health. Nearly a third of U.S. residents (32%) have anxiety or depression. But that figure rises to 37.9% for West Virginians, the highest national rate.
Another source has similar findings (and breaks data down to the county level). West Virginia has a higher rate of depression (44 out of 100,000 residents) than all but nine states. The national rate is only 30/100,000 in Rhode Island, for example.
West Virginians have a higher rate of psychosis than any state except Alaska. Post-traumatic stress disorder is another mental health indicator. Only Arkansas and Alaska have higher PTSD rates.
Further, mental health problems and drug abuse do not just occur in seniors or adults; problems start at an early age. According to national government statistics, West Virginia youth are more likely to drink and use drugs.
Nearly 9% of West Virginia children aged 12 to 17 used drugs in the last month, 5% higher than the national average. Over 80% of these children used marijuana. The figure is even higher when we look at annual use. Nearly 12% of 12- to 17-year-olds used marijuana in the last year. Nearly 10% of these teens used alcohol over the last month, more than double the national average.
Getting back to the question, “How can the senior accident death rate be lowered?” West Virginia state health officials should examine their high mental health and substance abuse rates and come up with a specific state plan to address these issues. It will not just happen by itself.

Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)On July 15, 2024, House Bill 5 went into effect and made Kentucky one of the first states in the country to criminalize street camping. One year later, we’re left with a chilling legacy: hundreds of citations, growing mistrust of outreach efforts, worsening homelessness, and a question that still hangs heavy. Why did we let this happen?
According to statewide data, more than 425 charges for unlawful camping have been filed across 30 Kentucky counties. That is more than one citation a day, overwhelmingly targeting unhoused people just for trying to survive. The largest share, 42%, was issued in Jefferson County, followed by Fayette (13.5%), Boyd (12%), and Daviess counties (7.4%).
But these aren’t just numbers. These are fellow Kentuckians trying to get by. Among them are:

A man was cited and moved along after being woken up by police kicking his feet as he slept under a viaduct.
A woman arrested while changing clothes in a parking garage during a heatwave was taken to jail without pants. She was later released, still without pants.
A pregnant woman was cited while in active labor. Her story made national headlines. She has housing now, but it did not come from city services, it came from community care.
A man cited multiple times, stuck in a cycle of court dates and jail, desperate for help that never comes.

This law has not ended or even decreased homelessness. Statewide, numbers show a 10% increase. 
Homelessness jumps again in Kentucky as Trump administration moves to cut housing funds

Daily “caravan sweeps” in places like Louisville’s Portland neighborhood give people five minutes to gather their only possessions — medications, documents, court papers, — before bulldozers and police trucks roll in to destroy their shelter and take what little they have to a dump. Legal identification, birth certificates, prescriptions, everything they have managed to hold on to, discarded without compassion. Without ID, people cannot get housing, cannot get services, can’t get help. This is active harm. This is active cruelty. This is an active cycle. This is the truth about HB5.
Even more disturbing, some of these citations come with promises of treatment or shelter that never materialize. Instead, people are met with citations, jail cells or court dates they cannot make, leading to bench warrants and deeper entanglement in the criminal legal system. 
Street outreach workers and advocates call this what it is: cruelty masquerading as a policy solution. One year in, we’ve seen what this bill delivers: more fear, more displacement, and a widening gap between the people who need help and the services trying to reach them. The word “outreach” itself is now so mistrusted that some service providers must introduce themselves by name, just to avoid being mistaken for the police.
Kentuckians deserve better than this. We can be better than this.
We cannot arrest our way out of poverty. We cannot bulldoze our way to safety. And we cannot claim moral leadership while treating the unhoused with contempt and cruelty.
What works is not criminalization. What works is affordable housing.
Permanent supportive housing has a 97% success rate right here in Kentucky. Non-congregate shelters with trauma-informed care, robust outreach efforts, and harm reduction strategies are what keep people safe and, ultimately, housed.
 Other states may struggle to find people and organizations to help. In Kentucky, that’s not our struggle. Organizations like VOCAL-KY, KyPolicy, St. John’s Center, Louisville Outreach for the Unsheltered, the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky and others are in the fight every day, despite limited resources. The additional harm is, those of us working to help real people in a real way, are shackled with limited capacity, funding cuts, and a government whose members are actively working to undermine the work.
This is not just a policy failure. It’s a moral one. But it doesn’t have to stay that way.
We urge our state and local leaders to confront the root causes of homelessness: the lack of affordable housing, the absence of mental health support, and policies that prioritize punishment over people. We can and must invest in solutions that lift people up instead of pushing them further down.
Because no one should be cited for trying to survive. Not in Kentucky. Not anywhere.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1245806948-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

The freeze, which was announced by the Trump administration earlier this month, affects programs like 21st Century Community Learning Centers, a federal program that supports afterschool programs for low-income students in the state.
State education advocates warn that approximately 11,000 students and 125 programs across North Carolina are at risk. The freeze on the $35 million grant, part of a broader $165 million allotment in congressionally approved education funds for North Carolina, threatens to eliminate academic enrichment, nutritional support, and safe, supervised environments for children while their parents are at work.
“These 21st Century Community Learning Center programs are a real American success story,” said Elizabeth Anderson, director of the NC Center for Afterschool Programs — a project of the Public School Forum of North Carolina. “They’re very effective, and they’re very data-backed in terms of supporting student learning, supporting working families, and supporting student success in general.”
The freeze in funding could potentially leave working parents scrambling for child care and students without structured environments after school. Research has shown that without these programs, children are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and that the juvenile crime rates increase between 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. Children are also likely to fall behind academically, and face challenges in social and emotional development.

Dream Center Academy in Gaston County is among the organizations feeling the impact of the freeze. Roxann Jimison, executive director for the organization, said the organization receives 50% of its funding from the 21st Century Community Learning Centers grant. 
The program has 160 middle and high school students on its roster for the upcoming school year. For these students, many of whom are from Gaston County’s most vulnerable communities, the program offers a support system that goes beyond standard coursework. Beyond academics, students participate in book clubs, enrichment programs, and even job shadowing. They learn tie-tying, discuss character development, and take college tours. “These aren’t just classes,” Jimison said in a phone interview. “We’re building a community that believes in their potential.”
Since opening in 2017, 86% of students achieve positive attendance, 88% maintain positive behavior, and 84% earn good grades, with 61% making the honor roll, according to Jimison. Among the program’s first two graduating classes, 88% enrolled in college or trade school, while 12% entered the workforce for on-the-job training, she said. 
“Without this funding, we’d have to cut back on certified tutors, field trips, and college tours,” Jimison said. “We’ve spent years building this support, and losing these programs would significantly impact at-risk students.” 
Jimison said the Department of Public Instruction has told her it has funding to replace 34% of the amount withheld. Still, she said, the program’s long-term sustainability remains uncertain, with current funds expected to last until December.
According to a 2023 survey by Afterschool Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy organization that works to increase access to after school programs, about 87% of parents, including Democrats, Republicans and independents, back public funding for afterschool programs.

North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, along with 24 other state attorneys general, sued the U.S. Department of Education this week over the withholding of the funds. The money, which was due to be delivered by July 1, was suddenly paused on the evening of June 30 with little explanation.
The department has said the pause is to “ensure taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the president’s priorities.”
Anderson reiterated the broader implications, and the role after-school programs play in societal well-being. “After school provides safe and structured places, so kids don’t necessarily engage in risky behaviors as easily as they are when they’re unsupervised after school,” Anderson said. “After school supports parents so they can go to work. After school supports kids in developing academically, exploring careers, preparing to participate in the American economy.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2533-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia wrestles with high energy demands and deadlines to switch to zero-carbon emission energy production, Gov. Glenn Youngkin last week announced funding to take the first steps towards building an advanced nuclear reactor in the southwest region of the state.
Wise County is the focus of a combined grant of $197,500 to search for private investment and federal funding to prepare the area for an advanced nuclear reactor. The area will be studied to find what kind of advanced nuclear reactor would best serve the region, how it would be funded, and if it could be used for research and power at the University of Virginia Wise. 
“This study is going to look at all the possibilities. What do we need? Does it help with data center development? But also we’re in a unique position to where you have an institution of higher education right there,” said Duane Miller, executive director of LENOWISCO Planning District Commission. 
There have been discussions of a reactor coming to the area for some time as funding has been sought out. Members of the public have expressed concern over nuclear power coming to their doorstep. Miller said this study process will have a public education and interaction period before any project is allowed to move forward. A reactor will be years away from construction in the area, but there is a lot to understand about the growing interest in the new-age small reactors.
What are advanced nuclear reactors?
The third generation of nuclear power facilities are considered advanced nuclear reactors. Most of the designs are small modular reactors, only generating a maximum of 300 MW. They are less costly than a full-sized reactor, driving interest in their development, and they are able to provide power in more remote areas. They are also touted as safer than full-sized reactors due to safety measures that can automatically stop a meltdown.
There are four main types of reactors that the U.S. Department of Energy lays out. 
-Advanced small modular water-cooled reactor (SMR), which uses water as a coolant and is smaller than a traditional light water reactor.
-Liquid metal-cooled fast reactors use sodium or lead as a coolant instead of water, allowing the coolant to operate at higher temperature and lower pressures.
-Gas-cooled reactors use flowing gas to cool them and are designed for higher temperatures.
-Molten salt reactors use molten fluoride or chloride salts as coolant.
There are currently no reactors of these designs in operation in the United States, but several states have cleared the way for the construction of new smaller reactors. 
There are dozens of companies racing to have their designs approved as the interest in kickstarting the nuclear industry again in the U.S. grows. A 2024 Pew Research survey showed that 56% of Americans are in support of expanding nuclear energy. That is significantly lower than the interest in expanding solar and wind, which are at 78% and 72%, respectively. Public interest in those renewable energy sources has significantly dropped since 2020, mainly from Republicans who are shifting focus to nuclear, according to the survey.
Having an advanced nuclear reactor online and producing power is still years off, with the first ones projected to power up in the 2030s. There are multiple advanced reactors in construction already in other states. TerraPower is building a molten salt reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming. It has 345 MW capacity and can power more than 250,000 homes. The company aims to have it online early in the next decade.
How are advanced nuclear reactors approved?
On the local level, a roadmap has to be created, which is being done with the grant funding, to show options for placement, investors, and workforce development. Permitting by the county requires multiple public meetings and votes. State legislation has already been passed to allow utilities to comp some of the development costs of advanced nuclear reactors by passing the costs to consumers.
On a federal level, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is in charge of licensing and regulating commercial nuclear power plants. Applicants have to undergo a safety, environmental, and antitrust review. There are public meetings held near the site to go over the findings of the reviews. 
Only one of the third generation reactor designs have been approved by the NRC, with others working through the process. Fourth generation designs are also in the works. The NRC then visits and approves individual sites for reactors based on various requirements and environmental impacts.
The reviews include looking at site characteristics, design of the nuclear plant, how the plant would respond to hypothetical accidents, what could be emitted from the plant to impact the environment, and other emergency plans.
As there are dozens of designs floating around for these advanced nuclear reactors, the NRC also has to approve the designs in order to move forward with the application.
President Donald Trump has also been pushing for the small reactors to get up and running in the country. In May, he signed an executive order to direct the federal government to develop policies to expedite investment and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors. 
The order also allows the Department of Defense to have a say in the approval of these new reactors on federal lands, taking some of the power away from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which has had the sole power in the past. This comes as a major political push for nuclear reactors takes center stage in national debates about energy production
Why Wise County?
Southwest Virginia once was a bustling energy producer in the heyday of coal production. Department of Energy Secretary Glenn Davis said he anticipates thousands of jobs could be created through the advanced nuclear reactor industry.
“Southwest Virginia was the energy capital of the East Coast, and it is sitting in a prime position to lead this new energy resurgence,” Davis said. “It’s perfectly situated, so we’re just trying to make sure we’re out in front of it, and getting the ball rolling.”
The state is not only considering producing nuclear energy, but Davis said there is interest in bringing manufacturing of the reactors to the commonwealth. He hopes to have some announcements by the end of the year.
Miller explained that like much of the rest of the state, there is a growing demand for reliable power sources. They are in support of an “all of the above” portfolio for energy production, an echo of the energy platform of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. With data centers popping up in their region, he believes that wind and solar power won’t be enough to meet demand.
“What we’re looking at right now, at least at the outset, would be something to help provide power…for UV-Wise but also to provide power for data center development at the adjacent data center park at the Lonesome Pine Technology park,” Miller said.
He said the region also wants to provide research opportunities at the university to aid in training students for the nuclear workforce as the industry grows.
With the university and workforce that is no stranger to energy production, Davis believes the region would benefit from small reactor manufacturing. The grant funds will be focused on bringing one project online, while the state separately works to secure manufacturing facilities.
What comes next for the Wise County project?
The Virginia Innovative Nuclear Hub is assisting local leaders and stakeholders in making a roadmap of the type of reactor that would be needed in that region to meet their future growth aspirations.
“When you’re deploying nuclear, you have a lot of licensing, you have site prep, you have to be able to figure out how you’re going to connect to the grid or not connect to the grid or whatever the case is,” said Jeff Whitt, director of Virginia Innovative Nuclear.
Whitt has decades of experience in the nuclear industry. He believes that Virginia is optimally positioned to develop these emerging reactors to manage energy needs.
“Deploying nuclear technology in a highly regulated, highly licensed regime with somewhat complex supply chain demands, it takes time and some organizations will be more mature in being able to do that than others will,” Whitt said.
Miller wants to assure the community of Wise County that this project can’t be rushed through the permitting process and there will be multiple chances for the public to learn about advanced nuclear reactors and how it could look in their communities. 
The roadmap will be developed over the coming months while the state also applies for federal assistance to begin early implementation for a project. Davis said there are two other advanced nuclear reactor sites proposed near the North Anna nuclear reactor site, which aim to come online in the early 2030s. The Wise County reactor would be online around the same time, should permitting and investment go through.

Glenn Youngkin. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin, when it comes to culture war issues including immigration, rarely misses a chance to stretch – or even obliterate – the truth.
The governor’s office noted this month that more than 2,500 people arrested by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force for being in the country illegally were “violent criminals.” Then Youngkin, in a news conference July 2 about the state-federal entity, added: “Two-thousand five-hundred violent criminals who are here illegally — MS-13 members, Tren de Aragua, others, international violent gang members.”
‘They should be arrested’: Youngkin holds firm on support for ICE raids at Virginia courthouses

This is a purposeful conflation that everyone who might be in Virginia illegally – the lack of due process here and nationwide has been appalling – was indeed arrested for violent offenses. If you’re going to denigrate a minority group – many of those arrested have been Latinos – you should show your receipts. Critics have called the campaign racist.
My screed follows a Virginian-Pilot report Sunday that highlighted the paucity of public details about the 2,512 people the task force detained.
“Neither Youngkin’s office nor state or federal agencies involved in the operation have provided any documentation about those arrested to be able to verify who they are, what they were charged with or whether they’ve been deported,” The Pilot said.
The controversy arises at a time when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have descended on courthouses, like in Chesterfield County, to arrest people who in some cases were present for misdemeanor traffic violations.
Individuals showing up to pay traffic tickets ain’t hardened criminals. Some had never been arrested before.
The Cato Institute, in fact, reported that over a recent eight-month period, ICE agents had booked more than 204,000 people nationwide. Some 65% had no criminal convictions, and 93% had never been convicted of any violent offenses. We’re not talking about a huge number of alleged murderers, rapists and robbers.
That means Virginians shouldn’t blithely accept Youngkin’s hyperbolic utterances. Nor should Americans if Youngkin eventually runs for the presidency, or gains a spot in the administration of President Donald Trump after his gubernatorial term ends in January.
While many politicians exaggerate, it’s clear Youngkin has made assertions that misdirect, omit needed context, or require diligent fact-checking. Remind you of anyone?
Demonizing marginalized groups and racial minorities has been a recurring tactic for Trump. His acolyte Youngkin has copied parts of that reprehensible playbook.
Youngkin’s spokesman didn’t reply to my questions.
The sad thing is the subject of illegal immigration enrages a sizable part of the electorate, in a way that’s disproportionate to the problem. That’s why Republican politicians keep ginning it up.
Some GOP elected officials, beholden to Trump, have also mimicked his penchant for lying.
“I think there’s an increasing temptation, particularly for Republican officeholders, to make claims first and provide the evidence later … if ever,” Stephen Farnsworth, University of Mary Washington political science professor, told me. “In the era of Donald Trump, strict adherence to the facts can be an inconvenience.”
For the commonwealth’s chief executive to have any future in the national GOP, Farnsworth added, “he has to sound more like Trump, and less like the Glenn Youngkin that ran for office four years ago.”
The guv was scheduled to be in Iowa on Thursday for a fundraiser. The state holds an early presidential nominating contest every four years.
Why am I so critical of Youngkin? Too many times since he ran for office in 2021, he’s delved into the culture wars where he knew, or should have known, his comments were lies or gross distortions. On other occasions, he’s declined to correct the record quickly:

 During the 2021 gubernatorial party nomination, he played coy about whether Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race – Trump spurred a failed coup over the results – before finally ’fessing up to the truth during the general election campaign.
His restoration of voting and other civil rights to released felons in 2022 occurred under expedited systems created by his predecessors, and he originally touted some of those restorations. (Virginia has one of the strictest policies in the country.) Later reporting revealed he’d made the process more opaque and less automatic.
 He created a “snitch line” targeting K-12 teachers just days after inauguration. The reporting mechanism was “for parents to send us any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools,” he said. It failed miserably and was finally deactivated months later, but the administration didn’t confirm that fact until Axios reported it.   
His administration pulled Virginia out of a multistate, previously noncontroversial compact for voter security and registration, listening to the braying of conspiracy theorists. If he’s as smart as he portrays, Youngkin should’ve surmised the partisan complaints about the  Electronic Registration Information Center were junk.
Youngkin peddled the notion for months that two men, undocumented immigrants, had “crashed” the gate at Marine Corps Base Quantico in May 2024. That version of events was later debunked: The Jordanian men were trying to make an Amazon delivery. Federal prosecutors said the men were here illegally but didn’t intend any harm at Quantico. Those prosecutors even dropped misdemeanor trespassing charges. Shame on the governor for not forcefully correcting the record.

“I do think there are two Gov. Youngkins,” Farnsworth said. “The combative cultural warrior that made a big thing on the Amazon truck … and at other times, there’s a governor that finds it difficult to go all in on everything that Trump has to say.”
It’s not a profile in courage. Virginians, nor Americans, should swallow at face value what Youngkin has to say – or what he leaves out.

Hospital-based violence intervention programs bring trauma-informed care and resources to patients in the hospital while they are recovering physically from violence-induced injuries. 
The logic is that bringing such care to patients, rather than waiting for them to seek it, can help them stay connected with resources and safety when they leave the hospital. 
The $8.5 million dollar funding stems from Virginia’s Department of Criminal Justice Services. It was awarded to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association’s VHHA Foundation, which will support the staff positions and work of 12 programs around the state. 
“We are grateful to DCJS for the continued support of these impactful hospital programs that help improve lives by advancing the important work of caring for survivors of violence with compassion and support on their journey towards healing,” said VHHA president and CEO Sean Connaughton in a release announcing the new grant award. 
The concept of hospital-based intervention programs have been around for at least 20 years nationwide. The goal is to prevent victims of interpersonal violence like shootings, stabbings and other forms of assault from re-injury or perpetrating violence themselves.
While receiving medical care for physical injuries, victims are connected to counseling, case management or other community resources. 
Since 2019, more than 8,000 victims of violence have been served, VHHA relayed. The association estimated that over $82 million in health care costs have also been avoided due to preventing and reducing re-injury rates. About $41 million of that is estimated to be direct savings to the state.
Hospitals are required to treat people regardless of whether they can pay their medical bills. This means that the costs of care for people who come to emergency rooms for illness or injury who are under- or uninsured, eventually get passed off onto other consumers. 
Several health systems in Virginia operate intervention programs to include Bon Secours Southside Medical Center in Petersburg, Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, Chesapeake Regional Medical Center, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Sentara Norfolk Gegneral Hospital, Ballad Health’s Johnston Memorial Hospital, Riverside Regional Medical Center, VCU Health, and Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters. 
UVA Health University Medical Center is planning to launch its own program by the end of this year and hosted a summit in Charlottesville Thursday with area nonprofits to strategize violence prevention and the forthcoming program’s role in it.

(Photo by Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Colorado-Letter-SoS-Griswold
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.
While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
 Sweeping Colorado requests

In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.

– David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research




Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
 Letters to other states

As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
HAVA-letter-redacted
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

(Photo illustration by Peter DiCampo/ProPublica. Source photos: Bangor Daily News. Document obtained by Bangor Daily News and ProPublica, highlighted by ProPublica.)This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with The Bangor Daily News. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. 
Off a two-lane stretch of U.S. Route 1 in rural Caribou, Maine, sits a white ranch-style house that’s been consumed by weeds and vines.
The house was once the fulfillment of a dream. The owner had purchased it in 2006 through a federal mortgage program designed specifically for people like her: impoverished, first-time homeowners who live in the most rural parts of the United States. The loan, which came directly from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, required no down payment. 
But things started going wrong from the day she moved in. First, the basement flooded. Then the furnace stopped working. As major repair costs accumulated over the next six years, the woman’s health deteriorated until she was forced to leave her job as a manager at Kmart. Her disability check was not enough to cover medical expenses and the upkeep required for the house — let alone the $855 monthly mortgage. 
So in 2012 she drove to a USDA office 20 miles away and tried to give the house back. She said staff there would not accept her keys, telling her instead to call a toll-free number for help, as agency protocol requires. She left a message and did not hear back. She stopped paying her mortgage and moved out. 
Her dream home sat abandoned for more than a decade.    
USDA guidance says the agency should act quickly when borrowers fall behind on payments “to minimize any potential loss to the Government and to the borrower.” A prompt sale keeps the government from having to pay the legal and administrative costs associated with foreclosure down the road and may protect the borrower from incurring a major blemish on their credit history.
But that did not happen. Rather, 13 years passed before a sheriff’s deputy knocked on the door of the woman’s public housing apartment in May and served her with foreclosure papers on the now dilapidated ranch home that’s been overtaken by squatters. The government’s delay hurt the value of its investment and left the woman with a bill far greater than the cost of the loan she initially took out — with additional interest and other fees that had accumulated over those years. 
The woman, now 68, declined to be interviewed, but her attorney, Tom Cox, said she allowed him to share her experience on the condition that she not be named to protect her privacy.
Since March, the USDA has filed 56 foreclosures in the federal court system against properties purchased with a rural development mortgage, also known as a Section 502 direct loan. All but one were in Maine. The borrowers have been in default for an average of nearly nine years. 
As in the case of the Caribou homeowner, the USDA’s delays in those cases have resulted in borrowers racking up more debt because of the interest and fees that piled up in the intervening years, according to a Bangor Daily News and ProPublica examination of the foreclosure cases and interviews with former USDA officials and legal experts. 
On average, borrowers in the 55 Maine cases owe $110,000 more than they would have had the agency moved to take possession of the properties when they first defaulted, the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica found. This includes what the USDA calls “preservation and inspection” fees, a broad category on the foreclosures filings that can include home repairs and yard maintenance, among other things.  
Borrowers who can’t pay risk having the government garnish their wages or federal benefits such as Social Security. The Caribou woman had her disability checks garnished six times since 2015 to offset her debt before the USDA even foreclosed on her property, according to her lawyer. The best way to keep the government from garnishing federal benefits is to file for bankruptcy, attorneys said. 
“It really undermines the concept of giving access to homeownership to a population who might not otherwise have been able to afford it,” said Rhiannon Hampson, former USDA rural development director for Maine who stepped down in January before President Donald Trump was inaugurated. “The irony, with all of these fees piled on, is that they can’t afford to get out of it.”
The recent wave of foreclosure filings in Maine underscores the government’s failure to monitor a mortgage program that since its founding in 1949 has poured tens of billions of tax dollars into giving the poorest Americans a shot at homeownership.
The USDA does not publicly report how often it files foreclosures. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Maine Democrat and member of a House appropriations subcommittee overseeing the USDA’s direct loan program, has proposed language in the House agriculture appropriations report for the 2026 fiscal year calling on the agency to regularly report the number of foreclosures and abandoned properties related to the direct loan program. The bill awaits a vote before the full House of Representative.
The USDA regularly filed foreclosures in Maine prior to the coronavirus pandemic but has rarely done so in recent years, according to Richard H. Broderick Jr., a Maine attorney with whom the agency had contracted to file foreclosures until 2022. Kevin Crosman, the Maine attorney now filing foreclosures on behalf of the USDA, would not comment on why the agency started doing so again.
Reporters visited 12 of the 55 homes in the Bangor Daily News’ core coverage area in May. At least five appeared to be abandoned and in disrepair — with windows boarded up or a sign affixed to the door saying it was being cared for by a New York company — raising doubts that the government will recoup its investments. 
The USDA is supposed to take custody of properties purchased with a Section 502 direct loan and begin the foreclosure process when the homeowner becomes incapacitated, dies or has abandoned it, according to the agency’s handbook. Otherwise the properties may languish and lose value.
Agency guidelines do not specify how soon the government should step in after a loan falls into delinquency, but under federal law, lenders cannot foreclose on a property until borrowers have been in default for 120 days.
Nearly a fifth of the USDA’s 159,208 Section 502 direct loans in its active national portfolio — 30,496 — were delinquent as of March, according to internal agency data obtained by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica. That rate is double what a 1993 internal agency report said was acceptable. But neither the USDA nor the White House would say why the agency is focusing on foreclosures in Maine. Vermont is the only other state in which the USDA has filed a single foreclosure, according to federal court filings.
The foreclosures started just before Trump’s Justice Department sued the state of Maine in April over its inclusion of transgender athletes in girls’ sports, part of a larger spat between Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills. The White House would not say whether the foreclosures are connected in any way to those ongoing conflicts.
The Trump administration is seeking to eliminate the 76-year-old rural homeownership program in the White House’s budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year. Some of his predecessors, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, have also sought to cut back the $880 million direct mortgage program, which has bipartisan support in Congress.
A USDA spokesperson said the Trump administration is in the process of reviewing the loans to “understand the magnitude of the problems it has inherited.” The agency noted that in Maine alone, more than 800 properties are considered delinquent and nearly 400 homes are being tracked for foreclosure. The USDA did not respond to additional questions.
‘Hopelessly in debt’
In 2013, months after the Caribou woman had abandoned her property, she received a letter at her new residence from the USDA informing her that she had to pay the government $22,000 in missed mortgage payments and late fees or she’d lose the Caribou home, said Cox, her lawyer. He said she did not pay because she did not want the house anymore. The USDA sent her nearly a dozen letters between 2014 and 2015 claiming foreclosure was imminent, but a decade passed before she was served with foreclosure papers this spring. 
A sign on the front door says the property is being maintained by a New York City company, which did not return calls seeking comment. A green tarp stretches across missing sections of the roof. Inside, piles of garbage and feces litter the floor.
A real estate broker who inspected the home in June with Cox estimated the value of the house to be around $40,000, a steep depreciation from the 2006 purchase price of $144,000. 
During the time since she abandoned the property, what the woman owes USDA continued to balloon, Cox said. 
His client now owes the government $393,463, according to court documents — nearly 10 times what the home is worth. Nearly 60% of that comprises interest that accumulated after she defaulted, as well as $91,304 in “preservation and inspection” fees. 
“If the USDA had dealt with this back in 2012, they might have gotten most or all of their money back by selling the home” before it deteriorated, Cox said. “They’re not going to collect it now. It’s a huge waste of government resources and money to let this happen.”

Other USDA borrowers simply continue living in their homes long after they default on their loans, accumulating more debt with each passing year that the government does not move to collect. 
Christine Ogden had stopped paying the $465-a-month mortgage for her blue saltbox home in the coastal Maine town of Searsport in 2013, according to court documents. She said she told the USDA at the time to take her home after the agency threatened her with foreclosure if she did not pay.  
But it took the government until 2019 to attempt to foreclose upon her property. The case was dismissed in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Five years later, in April, she received a summons to appear in federal court to start foreclosure proceedings again.
Ogden now owes $203,787 on what had been a $66,200 mortgage, according to court documents. Half of her debt comprises interest that accumulated after she defaulted, as well as other fees she would not have had to pay had the USDA addressed the delinquency sooner, an analysis by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica found. 
Ogden, who has lived rent-free in the house for 12 years, says she is unable to pay the burgeoning debt and does not know what will happen. The foreclosure will hurt her credit, making it harder for her to get another loan or find rental housing, she said. 
“I’m 59,” Ogden said. “I’ll be homeless, basically.” 
Little government oversight
The owners of another property, in Norridgewock in central Maine, also stopped paying their mortgage — and moved out of the house — years before the USDA foreclosed on the home this spring, court records show. The owners have not appeared to live at the property since at least 2014, according to property tax records, and defaulted on their loan in 2019 — but the government did not file for foreclosure until April. 
The owners, it turned out, were violating USDA rules by renting out their home. The tenant, who answered the door when a reporter visited in May after the foreclosure was filed in federal court, would not share his name but estimated that he has paid $100,000 in rent to the owners during the 12 years he said he has lived there. USDA guidelines allow borrowers to rent their homes for up to three years, and only under very narrow circumstances.
Properties purchased under the 502 direct loan program are supposed to be the borrower’s permanent residence and not meant to generate income, according to USDA guidelines. Homeowners can rent out their properties only due to certain life events such as if their families outgrow their current home or if they are moving for a job. But the borrower must still pay the mortgage every month.
The USDA says the owners of the Norridgewock home owe the agency $276,191. The homeowners live in Tennessee, according to foreclosure summons and other court records filed this year by the USDA; they did not respond to calls made to phone numbers listed under their names.
USDA staff based in Maine who once were in close touch with borrowers when they ran into financial trouble now have little to no oversight of Section 502 loans. That’s because a major restructuring in the 1990s eliminated many of the county offices that had managed all aspects of the loans and centralized the servicing of these loans to an office in St. Louis, said Leslie Strauss, a senior policy analyst for the Housing Assistance Council, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on affordable rural housing.
These changes came on the heels of an internal study in 1991 concluding that centralizing the administration of these loans would result in better service and a lower delinquency rate of about 10%, according to a 1993 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. More than three decades later, the delinquency rate for Section 502 direct loans has nearly doubled to 19%. 
Hampson, Maine’s former USDA rural development official who now leads economic development for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, said she had been pushing the agency to allow local staff to regain oversight of borrowers’ financial situations “so that we can go out and monitor what’s going on, so that we aren’t caught by surprise.”
But her effort did not gain traction, Hampson said. 
As the foreclosures accumulated in Maine in recent months, the USDA website published an advisory directing struggling Maine borrowers to call the St. Louis office for help. But fewer staff members are available to respond after Trump’s recent cuts to the federal workforce.
As of early May, 1,536 employees — nearly a third of the rural development office — had taken the buyout, according to USDA documents outlining the results of the Trump administration’s two financial incentive offers to quit. Of those, 197 worked in the St. Louis office.
“We can’t afford failure,” Hampson said of the long-delayed foreclosures leading to insurmountable debt. “The onus is on the government to make sure that we’re providing the right kind of safety nets to prevent this sort of thing from happening.”

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)Environmental advocates and the Penobscot Nation will argue in court Friday afternoon against the expansion of the state’s largest landfill.
Conservation Law Foundation will present arguments as to why expanding the Juniper Ridge Landfill threatens public health, tribal resources and the environment, including the nearby Penobscot River. This will take place at the Penobscot County Superior Court at 1 p.m. in Bangor, with a community rally scheduled to take place outside the courthouse starting at noon.
Last October, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection found that expanding the landfill — which is expected to reach capacity in 2028 — would benefit the public, paving the way for waste management company Casella to apply for a license to expand the landfill. 
Shortly after, the environmental advocacy organization, along with the Penobscot Nation, appealed the decision by Commissioner Melanie Loyzim.
“Challenging this decision is not just about protecting our environment — it’s about safeguarding the future and ensuring justice for the communities most impacted,” said Alexandra St. Pierre, director of communities and toxics at CLF, in a news release after the appeal. “The expansion of harmful landfills threatens our environment, our communities, and our health.”
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which sits between Old Town and Alton. It is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of Casella.
The Bureau of General Services had not submitted an application to expand the landfill as of late April, but Deputy Commissioner Anya Trundy told the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee that it intends to. 
The site expansion is separate from an extension of the current 30-year operator agreement that expires in 2034. 
Trundy said that building out the landfill to its maximum capacity should allow it to operate until 2040. That is why the expanded capacity would also necessitate extending the contract with Casella so that both line up with the 2040 timeline. 
In early May, more than 50 people rallied in Old Town to not only voice the concerns they have with expansion but also to ask lawmakers to back bills that could address the contamination, as well as the injustice they feel local communities have endured.
Among the waste-related proposals that went before legislators this year, activists hoped lawmakers would pass LD 1349, which sought to require approval from two-thirds of the Legislature for contract or contract renewal to operate Juniper Ridge, but it was rejected by both chambers. 
Activists were also disappointed that LD 297 passed and was signed into law by Gov. Janet Mills. While proponents argued the bill was necessary to allow more bulky waste to be brought in to stabilize the sludge that is disposed of at the facility, there are fears it opens the door for more out-of-state waste to fill the landfill even faster.
However, the Legislature did pass a measure (LD 1782) directing the Bureau of General Services to work with the landfill contract operator and the city of Old Town to ensure that the city is “fairly and adequately compensated for the burden of hosting” the landfill.

Here, dozens gather on July 14, 2021, at White Mountains Regional High School in Whitefield to protest Casella's plans. (File photo by Amanda Gokee/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed into law this week a bill requiring trash companies to submit detailed management plans for leachate, the toxic liquid born from rainfall mixing with waste inside landfills.
While the state already requires operators to create leachate management plans, House Bill 566 adds additional permit application requisites for prospective new landfills and expansions for existing dumps, including on-site treatment of that “trash juice” as well as its transportation to off-site treatment facilities.
The bill was a priority for lawmakers amid years-long squabbles between towns and waste companies over the environmental and health hazards of landfills new and old, especially after the Department of Environmental Services issued letters to operators last year outlining issues found at four active landfills in the state.
That included hundreds of leachate-related violations since 2023 by Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems’ Bethlehem facility, which is nearing the end of its operational life. One of two major private landfills in New Hampshire, that facility was also the site of a 154,000-gallon leachate spill in 2021 — likely the largest in state history.
But despite the leachate legislation making it across both chambers and now the governor’s desk, it remains the only major landfill bill to survive the legislative process. 
The rest stalled during this year’s session despite bipartisan support on the issue: House Bill 171, establishing a moratorium on new landfill permits until 2030; House Bill 707, establishing stricter setback requirements; and House Bill 215, requiring comprehensive harm-benefit assessments.
Ayotte, who earlier this year came out against Casella’s contentious landfill proposal next to Forest Lake in Dalton, proposed a one-year moratorium on new landfills and the creation of a site evaluation committee to give communities more input in future siting decisions. But those proposals were stripped from budget negotiations after lawmakers couldn’t agree on the length of any moratorium.
State Rep. Nicholas Germana, HB 566’s sponsor and deputy ranking member of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee, had “high hopes” for progress at the start of the session. 
But if the Keene State College professor had to grade the results, “I’d give it a D-plus,” he said.
“The governor just went radio silent,” Germana told the Bulletin. “She said this was a huge priority for her … and despite our reaching out to the governor’s office, there was never any effort by the governor or anyone in her office to sit people down and try to come to an agreement.”
For the sake of waste
Aside from the standalone bills, the House had approved several landfill measures for budget inclusion, but the Senate made changes that House lawmakers and advocates felt would’ve benefited Casella’s interests.
An amendment from Loudon Republican Sen. Howard Pearl contained provisions that would have allowed companies to override local zoning ordinances and void existing legal agreements with towns. The House ultimately rejected the proposal.
That, for example, would have forced the city of Bethlehem “to accept an expansion of a landfill that has literally hundreds and hundreds of problems in its operation, particularly with leachate,” Germana said.
Germana saw the move as “unquestionably heavily influenced by industry,” saying it took legislation meant to address future landfill siting and “turned it primarily into a big gift bag for current operators to expand, in particular Casella in Bethlehem.”
The Senate was “completely unwilling” to work with House lawmakers on trying to “find some middle path,” Germana said, adding that their definition of compromise was “we take exactly what they were giving us — that it was a take it or leave it situation.”
NHDES has previously reported that nearly half of disposed waste in New Hampshire comes from other states, primarily Massachusetts, which has its own statewide landfill moratorium. New Hampshire’s largest landfill, located in Rochester and operated by Waste Management, has enough capacity to handle all of New Hampshire’s annual solid waste — but instead takes large amounts from out of state.
“We don’t need the capacity,” said Wayne Morrison, president of citizen group North Country Alliance for Balanced Change. “Casella needs it because they’re acquiring a lot of smaller companies and they have a problem where they’ve got a lot of routes and customers in places like Massachusetts, and they need more places to put it.”
The proposed site in Dalton sits within half a mile of Forest Lake, the Ammonoosuc River, and Weeks State Park — pristine outdoor recreation areas in a region dependent on tourism. The controversy divided the small town of 900 residents, creating what Morrison describes as “friends of the landfill and foes of the landfill” in a classic small-town dynamic where neighbors stop speaking to each other.
“I think this is what typically happens,” Morrison said of the divisive nature of landfill siting. “You go to a poor town and you tell the people, ‘I’m going to pay you so you’re not going to have to pay property taxes.’ Some element of the town is going to say, ‘Great.’ And another section is going to say, ‘Well, there’s a huge price to be paid for that.’”
Casella would pay millions annually to the town, creating relief avenues for its small tax base — but Morrison says the environmental and health risks far outweigh any economic benefits, especially for other surrounding communities outside of Dalton that would bear the impacts without receiving compensation.
“You don’t get anything for free,” he said.
Casella is now fighting the state in Merrimack County Superior Court after NHDES in April denied the company’s Dalton landfill bid.
The new requirements in HB 566 are also tied to concerns about PFAS — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — contamination in the state’s waste stream. Landfills often receive PFAS-laden waste that can seep into groundwater, creating a cycle where contaminated leachate returns to facilities such as Manchester’s wastewater treatment plant, which incinerates sewage sludge containing PFAS and discharges treated wastewater back into the Merrimack River.
For the most part, “we’ve been spoiled in the U.S. because we haven’t had to think about” water quality, Morrison said, referencing concerns about contamination in the North Country, where many live on well water. “It’s a big problem. And it’s not just landfills … the state is not that big, and it’s highly connected. The groundwater, the aquifers, and the rivers and lakes are connected, and it’s kind of like, if you have a problem, you have a big problem.”
Advocates frame the situation as an environmental justice issue — small North Country communities bearing the burden of regional disposal while generating little of the waste themselves. Many have long argued that the state should focus on reducing waste generation rather than building more disposal capacity, such as improved composting programs and extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies implemented in neighboring states.
Maine has moved in that direction, passing EPR legislation for packaging that creates economic incentives for manufacturers to reduce waste, taking financial pressure off municipalities.
New Hampshire came close to passing similar legislation for paint waste this year, which had broad bipartisan support from both environmental groups and business interests, but the effort died in the Senate after opponents called it a tax, frustrating House lawmakers who said it had unanimous support from stakeholders.
‘Help us pass something’
The only significant accomplishment beyond the leachate bill was a provision in the budget establishing a $3.50 per ton charge on solid waste going into landfills, which will return revenue to municipalities and help fund waste management programs.
Despite the setbacks, Germana said lawmakers plan to continue pushing landfill laws in the next session.
“The senators keep telling us that they’re weary, that they’re tired of having to deal with landfill legislation,” Germana said. “And my response to that is, well, then help us pass something. If we’re going to turn the page, we’re going to do it by prioritizing public health and the environment rather than corporate profits.”
The governor told lawmakers after the session ended that she remained committed to working on her proposal for a moratorium and site evaluation committee. Germana said the key to progress would be having someone with actual influence in the governor’s office coordinate the effort next time around.
House lawmakers also plan to revive efforts to limit out-of-state waste coming into New Hampshire’s landfills, with Germana saying he would continue to work with Republican Sen. David Rochefort on potential legislation.
“I think that Gov. Ayotte is a lot more open to that approach than Gov. Sununu was,” he said. He noted that legal challenges to interstate commerce can be defended if states can demonstrate the regulations are in their vital interest.
Other priorities for the next session include another stab at single-use plastic bag legislation and food waste reduction measures, including standardized expiration date labeling to reduce avoidable food disposal.
But Germana said the landfill siting issue is top of the list going forward.
“We need to get this straight first,” he said. “We need to have an agreement on a site evaluation process so that going forward, when we do have to start talking about the possibility of a landfill, we have a process with integrity in place.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-7751-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

This is a slightly more than an 8% increase from last year — which was $20.81, according to the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio and the National Low Income Housing Coalition 2025 Out of Reach report. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The cost of rent is squeezing working Ohioans like never before,” said COHHIO Executive Director Amy Riegel. “Rent now consumes so much of the income that people need to survive. That’s why homelessness has been increasing and we’re seeing more and more seniors wind up in the homeless system.” 
There were 11,759 people experiencing homelessness in Ohio last year— about a 3% increase, according to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
The Housing Wage is an estimate of the hourly wage full-time workers must make to afford a rental home at HUD’s Fair Market Rent without spending more than 30% of their income. 
The state’s Housing Wage has increased 40.7% since 2020, according to the report. 
“Every year the housing market keeps pushing people closer and closer to the breaking point,” Riegel said. 
Ohio’s minimum wage is $10.70 per hour, meaning a minimum wage worker would have to work 84 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom rental, according to the report. 
Ohio’s Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,171, meaning a household must earn $46,825 annually, according to the report. The state’s Fair Market Rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $937, according to the report. Ohio has nearly 1.6 million renter households. 
However, the average Ohio renter earns $18.62 an hour — $3.89 an hour less than needed to afford a two-bedroom apartment, according to the report. 
The Housing Wage is higher in urban parts of the state, according to the report. Renters in Columbus need to earn at least $27.79 an hour to afford a two-bedroom apartment, in Cincinnati it’s $24.75 an hour and in Cleveland it’s $23.23. 
Of the 15 most common jobs in Ohio, only general operation managers, registered nurses, truck drivers and maintenance workers earn more than $22.51 an hour, according to the report. This means 1.2 million Ohio jobs don’t pay enough to afford a basic two-bedroom apartment. 
Fast food workers, stockers, retail salesperson, cashiers, laborers, home health aides, janitors, and waiters all earn less than $20 an hour in Ohio, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics May 2024 data.  
The median wage for home health aides has increased by $3.34 since 2020, but Ohio’s 2-bedroom Housing Wage went up $6.52 during that same period, according to the report. 
“The state has taken steps to improve home health aides’ pay to care for Ohio’s growing senior population,” Riegel said. “But home health aides still can’t afford to live near many of their clients, and they can’t afford the food, transportation, healthcare, and childcare they need to keep working.”
At the federal level, the Trump Administration has proposed cutting 44% of HUD’s overall funding and getting rid of  rental assistance programs.
“Low-income renters continue to face impossible choices between paying rent and meeting basic needs,” said NLIHC President and CEO Renee Willis. “Cutting federal housing investments would only deepen the housing crisis.”

Second Street Place, which is located at 5010 Second Street in Raleigh, is the first Wake County-operated shelter of its kind. It removes common barriers like proof of sobriety or background. According to a news release, anyone in need can walk through the doors and access shelter, services and support toward permanent housing.
“The Bryant Center’s proven dedication to serving vulnerable populations makes them the perfect choice to lead operations at Second Street Place,” said Wake County Commissioner Vickie Adamson. “We look forward to working together to expand access to shelter and supportive services in Wake County.”
Second Street Place opened temporarily in January to provide emergency shelter during life-threatening cold weather as part of what’s known as “white flag season.” Following the 2025/2026 white flag season, shelter programming will be temporarily relocated to enable renovations that will transform the site into a year-round facility designed to prioritize safety, accessibility and services for all guests.

“We are honored to continue serving the residents at Second Street Place and grateful for Wake County’s partnership,” said Vance E. Haywood, executive director with The Bryant Center. “Our team remains committed to providing a safe, supportive environment where individuals can access the resources and respect they deserve.”
Plans call for the 9,292-square-foot building to be converted to a “trauma-informed” shelter that offers same-day access to beds, essential services and a path to permanent housing.
Planned improvements include:

Separate staff and guest entrances.
A permanent security station with video monitoring.
ADA-accessible restrooms and showers.
Secure storage lockers for personal belongings.
A food storage and distribution hub.
Private spaces for counseling, case management and support services.

The renovations’ design work is expected to be completed by September 2025, with construction beginning in spring 2026. The upgraded Second Street Place is anticipated to reopen in November 2026.
Second Street Place is a key part of the county’s strategy to reduce unsheltered homelessness by 10% by 2029.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Congress set aside $50 billion for rural hospitals and medical providers to allay fears over the billions more in historic cuts to federal health care spending that President Donald Trump signed into law on Independence Day.
But is that bandage big enough to save struggling rural hospitals?
“I have more questions than I have answers,” said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit policy group. “No one has those answers yet.”
Morgan noted that the new money for rural health, to be spent over five years, is far less than the $155 billion in rural Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years, as estimated by KFF, a nonprofit health policy and research group.
Experts, hospital leaders and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle fear that Trump’s signature legislation will particularly gut rural hospitals and clinics, which see an outsize share of patients who are insured through Medicaid, the federal-state public health insurance for people with low incomes. The new law slashes more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

The $50 billion addition was an effort by Republican leaders in Congress to win the votes of colleagues within their party who initially balked at supporting such steep cuts to Medicaid and other health services.
In the U.S. Senate, the rural program helped secure the vote of Alaska moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on health care in her state. About 1 in 3 Alaskans are insured through Medicaid.
Jared Kosin, the president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said he’s deeply frustrated with the new law’s gutting of Medicaid funding, which he thinks will wreak lasting damage on Alaskans. And Republicans sidestepped potential solutions by just throwing money into a program, he said.
“It’s frustrating in the public realm when decisions like this are made fast and, frankly, carelessly,” he said.
“The consequences are going to fall on us, not them.”
More than half of the law’s cuts to funding in rural areas are concentrated in 12 states with large rural populations that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover more people, according to KFF: Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
Some GOP lawmakers in Congress have heralded the $50 billion rural program as a health care victory. But it’s still unclear which hospitals, clinics and other providers would receive money and how much.
How it works
The Rural Health Transformation Program will dole out $10 billion annually from fiscal years 2026 through 2030.
States must apply for their funding by the end of this year, submitting a detailed plan on how it would be used.
The law outlines some ways that states can use the money, according to an analysis of the legislation from the Bipartisan Policy Center:

Making payments to rural hospitals to help them maintain essential services such as emergency room care or labor and delivery.
Recruiting and training rural doctors, nurses and other health workers.
Bolstering emergency medical services such as ambulances and EMTs.
Using new technologies, including telehealth.
Providing opioid use disorder treatment and mental health services.
Improving preventive care and chronic disease management.

Half of the $10 billion each year will be distributed evenly across states that have applied for it. The other half can be distributed by the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — currently Dr. Mehmet Oz — at his discretion, based on a state’s rural population and rural health facilities.
Although the program doesn’t replace the amount states are likely to lose, Morgan said it’s still an opportunity to rethink how rural health care is funded. He’d like to see states given flexibility in how they’re able to use the funds, and he hopes they focus on keeping rural communities healthy through preventive care while still helping hospitals keep their doors open.
“If done correctly, it could really change the future course for rural America,” Morgan said. “That is such a tough ask, though.”
Hardest hit
Kentucky could take the biggest hit from the new law’s reduction in rural Medicaid funding, losing an estimated $12 billion over 10 years, according to a KFF analysis.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

The state’s Medicaid department is still waiting for additional federal guidance to understand how the state’s program will be affected, Kendra Steele, spokesperson with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, told Stateline in a statement.
“Over 1.4 million Kentuckians rely on Medicaid — including half of all children in our state, seniors and more vulnerable populations — and the passage of legislation on the federal level will have serious impacts for those individuals, rural health care and hospitals and local economies,” she wrote.
Even with the new program, states across the country will have to reevaluate their budgets in light of the cuts, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that supports states in developing health care policies.
“Every region is slightly different and there’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. “Hospital ownership varies [as well as] the types of services that are critical for the community where they’re located. They have to think about new ways to provide those services in a context with fewer resources.”
About 44% of rural hospitals are operating in the red, according to a KFF analysis of Rand Hospital Data, a higher share than the 35% of hospitals in urban areas.
‘Rural at heart’
Prior to the bill’s passage, Oz attempted to reassure U.S. House Republicans that their districts could get money from the program even if they weren’t specifically rural, Politico reported earlier this month.











We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.


– Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association



Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan said money would begin flowing to his district as early as the beginning of next year, telling the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader earlier this month that he met with Trump, Oz and others to secure pledges that hospitals in his district could access the fund. He represents the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, which includes suburban and rural areas, as well as the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre.
Though the legislation includes guidelines on which facilities or areas qualify as “rural,” Morgan, of the National Rural Health Association, expects a mad dash from lawmakers and providers to claim rural status in order to get a piece of the funding.
“That’s going to be a huge issue — defining who’s rural,” Morgan said. “We’re all rural at heart when it comes to money.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderThe 2026 election is still over a year away, but candidates across the Peach State are already hard at work, seeking to win over Georgia voters early and raise funds for their campaign.
Tuesday was the most recent Federal Election Commission filing deadline, when all candidates in federal races must publicly disclose information about how they raise and spend campaign funds. All 14 of Georgia’s U.S. House seats and one of its two Senate seats will be up for grabs next year in what will likely be a closely watched election. 
For the numerous federal candidates who have launched campaigns since the beginning of April, the FEC filings offered the first glimpse into how fundraising efforts are going in some of Georgia’s most notable races. 
Here’s what the most recent campaign data shows.
U.S. Senate
Incumbent U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is the only Democratic senator up for re-election in a state won by Trump in 2024, and will likely face fierce Republican attempts to unseat him as he seeks a second term in Congress. 
It’s not clear who he will be facing on the Republican side, but Coastal Georgia Congressman Buddy Carter and Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King have both launched campaigns for the seat. Neither candidate has secured an endorsement from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp or President Donald Trump, though the two leaders have held at least one meeting to discuss backing a Republican candidate.

Carter, a self-described “MAGA warrior” who serves on the House Budget, Energy and Commerce committees in Congress, became the first established Republican candidate to declare his bid for Senate shortly after Kemp announced he would not be running. 
King followed soon after, announcing his candidacy for Senate while also boasting his loyalty to Trump’s agenda.
Other potential Republican candidates include former football coach Derek Dooley and U.S. Rep. Mike Collins of Jackson, though neither one has announced a campaign for the seat.
But Ossoff, who raised more than $11 million during the first three months of 2025 and over $41 million in the most recent quarter, is currently dominating the Georgia fundraising landscape. In comparison, Carter raised a total of $3.5 million since the beginning of this year, and King has raised $518,000.
U.S. House District 1
Six-term Congressman Buddy Carter’s decision to run for Senate has left a vacancy in his coastal Georgia House district, causing a flurry of new candidates to announce their bids for his seat. Carter, a pharmacist, was re-elected to his seat last fall with 62% of the vote.
Among them are Chatham County Commissioner Patrick Farrell, insurance executive Jim Kingston and former gubernatorial candidate Kandiss Taylor, who until earlier this year served as a regional district chair for the Georgia Republican Party. No prominent Democrats have announced their candidacy yet in the Republican-leaning district.
Kingston, the son of longtime Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston, is currently leading fundraising efforts with nearly $870,000 raised. Farrell has raised $276,000, and Taylor has amassed $8,000.
U.S. House District 13
U.S. Rep. David Scott, a 12-term Democratic veteran in Congress who represents a district in east metro Atlanta, may be in for a fight during next year’s primary election.

At least five candidates have declared primary challenges against Scott, who made history in 2020 as the first Black lawmaker — and the first Georgian — to chair the House Agriculture Committee. Scott, who was first elected to his seat in 2002, has bested primary challengers before. In 2024, he easily sailed over six other Democrats in the primary before defeating Republican nominee Jonathan Chavez with more than 70% of the vote in the general election.
But this year, as he prepares to seek a 13th term in the House of Representatives, Scott is  facing growing pressure to step aside. He is currently the oldest member of Georgia’s congressional delegation, having celebrated his 80th birthday in June. He was also ousted as the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee last December after missing two weeks’ worth of votes due to back issues. Just a few days later, he made headlines for yelling profanities at a Politico photographer who took a photo of him in a wheelchair.
Scott’s primary challengers have also cited his age and health struggles as reasons that the 13th district could use some new representation. State Sen. Emanuel Jones of Decatur, a businessman who was first elected to the state Legislature in 2004, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Scott’s decline was “the worst kept secret in politics.” Jones filed paperwork to run for the seat in January. 
Other candidates vying for Scott’s seat include state Rep. Jasmine Clark of Lilburn. A Democrat, Clark flipped a Gwinnett County seat that had long been considered a Republican stronghold when she was first elected to the state House in 2018, and has successfully fended off challengers in the years since. Her congressional campaign leans on her experience as a microbiologist, Emory University nursing professor and mom, citing cuts to Medicare, medical research funding and reproductive health care. 
“I ran to be a voice for science and truth in the face of Republican disinformation and ever since I’ve been taking on the toughest fights for Georgia families,” Clark said in a campaign video.
Former Gwinnett County Board of Education Chair Everton Blair, who made history as the first Black and openly gay member of the Gwinnett County School Board, entered the race in April. According to the most recent FEC filings, Blair is in the lead, having raised more than $227,000 as of June 30.

There are probably plenty of days in which North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson wishes his job duties were similar to those of past AG’s – prosecuting criminals, helping consumers, targeting corruption. Unfortunately, thanks to the relentless illegal acts of the Trump administration, he’s quickly come to have another top job priority – defending North Carolinians against the federal government.
This week alone Jackson was forced to join other state attorneys general in suing the Trump administration over its unlawful cancellation of millions of dollars in funding for public schools and natural disaster preparedness. The cancelled disaster prep money could have helped prevent flooding damage caused by Tropical Storm Chantal.
Previously, Jackson had to sue to protect North Carolinians from Trump’s blatantly unconstitutional effort to deny citizenship to all people born in the U.S.
The bottom line: It’s tragic that Jackson must devote precious resources to forcing Trump to respect the law, but all North Carolinians should be grateful he’s able and willing to do it.

John Lewis.","Protesters hold signs during the “Good Trouble Lives On” rally Thursday in Annapolis. (Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)Carl Snowden looked out at the crowd of hundreds of peaceful, sign-carrying protesters gathered on Lawyers Mall in the oppressive heat of a late July afternoon and liked what he saw. And he thought John Lewis would have liked it, too.
“You’re part of what John Lewis had once dreamed of, a multiracial group of people who understand that America at its best, is America that’s diverse,” said Snowden, a longtime Anne Arundel County civil rights activist who told the crowd that they are “a part of history.”
“America is at a crossroads,” he said. “But for some people who are pessimistic, I want to tell you, this is not the time for pessimism. This is not the time for apathy. This is a time for action.”
The event in Annapolis was one of more than 1,600 “Good Trouble Lives On” rallies scheduled across the U.S. — more than 40 in Maryland — honoring the legacy of former U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a renowned civil rights leader who talked about making “good trouble” to advance social justice. Lewis died five years ago Thursday, on July 17, 2020, at age 80.
Some events were as simple as a few people gathering to wave signs at passing traffic, others were large, organized marches. In Annapolis, one of four “anchor” cities selected to host a large-scale event as part of the John Lewis National Day of Action, protesters gathered at different points around the city before marching to Lawyer’s Mall and the steps of the State House for a rally.
Throughout the event, held by the statue of former civil rights lawyer and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, advocates and local elected officials spoke of Lewis’ legacy and the different threats they said Marylanders face as a result of the Trump administration.
Maryland Sen. Shaneka Henson (D-Anne Arundel) said that “you have to use your voice to make sure you preserve the right to use your voice.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We will not settle for having a right on paper but no voice out loud, for having a right on paper but no way to exercise it,” Henson said. “We will not settle for rhetoric and talk. We will continue to protest, we will continue to march, we will continue to rally to remember and reflect on those who came before us, but you need to have victory in hand.”
Lewis represented Georgia’s 5th District in Congress from 1987 until his death in 2020. Before that, he was a leader of some of the most important moments of the Civil Rights era, including delivering a keynote speech at the famed 1963 March on Washington at age 23.
Two years later, in March 1965, he was at the head of a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, for voting rights when marchers were attacked by state police as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, an event now known as “Bloody Sunday.” It helped set the stage for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) planned to attend the rally, but got stuck in late votes Thursday on Capitol Hill, so a staffer brought a message from Elfreth to the crowd.
“These are dark times, which is why we must continue to band together to win where we can and protect our community where we must,” said Eva Lewis, the staffer. “We must continue to believe that we can make the change we want to see, that the pendulum will swing back towards equality, freedom and the ideals we hold dear.”
But that pendulum swing won’t happen on its own, Lewis said.
“It requires all of us here today to push and fight for a path forward — a path forward that John Lewis and so many others knew was possible,” she told the crowd.
Several speakers highlighted the impacts Trump’s administration has had on education.
Evelyn DeJesus, the American Federation of Teachers’ executive vice president, said everything the union’s members stand for “has been turned into a punching bag.”
“The Trump administration is trying to defund education unilaterally through government outreach,” DeJesus said. “The administration does not have the right to starve children because of would-be savings.”

Others, like CASA policy manager Ninfa Amador-Hernandez and Annapolis Pride Chair Joe Toolan, spoke of the threats faced by immigrant communities both in Maryland and across the U.S.
“I see every day how fear permeates my Latino siblings. Fear because ICE is detaining anyone who is brown and sending them to Alligator Alcatraz,” Toolan said, referring to a temporary migrant detention center recently opened in the Florida Everglades.
After the event, Anne Arundel County Councilmember Lisa Rodvien (D-6th) said it’s important for people to remind each other that they’re not in the fight alone.
“Our power is when we join together,” she said. “You know the old phrase, ‘The people united will never be defeated.’ And it’s time for us to remind ourselves of that, but also to remind ourselves of what is at stake.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/lewis-6397-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

(Photo by Morry Gash/The Associated Press)The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.

Colorado-Letter-SoS-Griswold
 

Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.
While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
Sweeping Colorado requests
In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.
Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
Letters to other states
As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.

HAVA-letter-redacted
 

More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

Earlier this year, the legislature set aside $1.2 million over four years to pay for efforts to reduce the number of eligible taxpayers who do not apply for the state Child Tax Credit or for the Earned Income Tax Credit.
“As the state’s chief revenue administrator, otherwise known as the tax collector, I believe that our responsibility extends far beyond simply collecting revenue,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman said Thursday. “We must ensure that eligible families understand and can access programs like the EITC and the child tax credit.
“Our goal isn’t just to help people to get by, it’s to provide the resources they need to get ahead and help their communities prosper,” she said.
Last year, more than 444,000 taxpayers claimed $519 million in credits. But as many as 99,000 taxpayers who are eligible did not apply, officials said.
“For these families, an extra $1,100 — which is the average Maryland EITC refund last year — can be truly life-changing,” Lierman said.

The Child Tax Credit aims to help low-income families pay for the cost of raising a child by granting a $500 credit per kid to families with a federal adjusted gross income of $15,000 or less. The EITC is a sliding scale tax break, depending on filing status and number of children — a married couple with three children earning up to $66,819 could be eligible, according to a state fact sheet.
Preliminary results of a study conducted for Lierman’s office found a number of reasons why those credits go unclaimed.
Families of color, residents of rural areas, people with disabilities, the self-employed and nontraditional caretakers, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, foster parents, single parents, make up the majority of those who fail to claim the credit, according to researchers with the Urban Institute who are doing the study.
Four counties top the list for the largest percentages of eligible taxpayers — Howard, Kent, Montgomery, and Prince George’s counties.
Baltimore City and County also had significant numbers of eligible households that failed to claim the credit, according to preliminary data.
Many taxpayers surveyed said they knew about federal tax credits, but did not know about corresponding state benefits. For others there were language barriers, concerns about immigration status or tax preparation service fraud, according to the Urban Institute’s preliminary results released Thursday.

Santiago/Getty Images)Southwest Ohio is going to lose two reproductive health clinics due to the federal budget changes to Medicaid, a loss that could mean more abortions will happen, according to the leader of the clinics.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region announced Thursday that its Springfield and Hamilton clinics will close as of Aug. 1. Nan Whaley, the president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood affiliate, cited the federal reconciliation bill and state budget changes to Medicaid as reasons for the changes. The changes included work requirements for Medicaid patients along with a loss of funding, preventing Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood nationwide.
“This decision, driven by politics, not public health, harms real people who already face immense barriers to care,” Whaley said in a Thursday media call.
Clinics had been bracing for the potential cuts as the federal and state budget process continued earlier this summer, along with threats of funding freezes from the Trump administration of Title X “family planning” grants that go toward research, contraception, health screenings, and testing programs.
Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region will still provide telehealth services, self-pay options and services for those with commercial insurance. For Medicaid patients looking for other options, the affiliate has a referral network it plans to use to redirect patients to resources.

The Southwest Ohio affiliate said patients were notified through letters and messages in the health care software MyChart.
“The affiliate is working hard to ensure that all patients have the information they need to find alternative providers in their communities,” a press release announcing the closures stated, adding the region “does not anticipate additional closures at this time.”
The two clinics that are being closed were chosen based on their volume of Medicaid patients regularly treated there, and the loss will be felt throughout the region and nationwide as the changes are implemented.
“The loss of Medicaid will make people not receive care, so when folks get kicked off Medicaid, that means they’re not going to their federally qualified health care center, they’re not going to Planned Parenthood, they’re not going anywhere,” Whaley said.
While the Medicaid budget changes bar health care providers who offer abortion services from being a part of the Medicaid program, the two clinics that are being closed weren’t clinics that offered that service.
The services that will suffer because of the closures will be in the area of preventive health, such as tests for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control access, cancer screenings and other wellness practices.
“Places like rural Ohio, with access deserts, will be the first place to pay the price,” Whaley said.
The president and CEO said the two clinics in the Southwest Ohio region that do provide abortion care, in Dayton and Cincinnati, will remain open and will still provide those services, along with gender-affirming care.
“The money for Medicaid was never spent in Ohio on abortion,” Whaley said. “It was spent on cancer screenings, on birth control, that’s the work that we were doing every day that was preventative.”
The loss of clinics that provide preventive care will not only cause more people to skip getting health care or resort to costly emergency room care, but could also increase sexually transmitted diseases and unintended pregnancies, along with abortions, the very thing many opponents of Planned Parenthood hope to stop.
“While Medicaid dollars were not being spent (on abortion care), what is interesting to me about this decision, for us here in Southwest Ohio, it will actually increase the number of abortions and lower the number of people getting birth control,” Whaley said. “So, not the answer that the legislature thought they really wanted, I don’t think.”
The closures come as the national Planned Parenthood organization has sued the Trump administration over the budget cuts directly impacting Planned Parenthood.
A federal judge blocked the funding cuts to the organization earlier this month, but the U.S. Department of Justice has asked for a reversal of that ruling.
While Planned Parenthood has said almost 200 health care centers could be at risk over the federal funding, Whaley said the state-level actions are having their own unique effects.
“Our challenge isn’t just the federal lawsuit, but we’re in a state … where the state legislature pays no attention to the needs of its community, and the passage of the Ohio budget that changed the rules around Medicaid is the reason why we had to move so swiftly today,” Whaley said.

Wes Moore on Thursday signed what advocates called a first-ever executive order on environmental justice, directing state agencies to use data on overburdened communities to drive policy decisions and to set new environmental justice goals.","Gov. Wes Moore (D), flanked by Cabinet secretaries, advocates and a lawmaker, signs the VOICE executive order, geared toward bolstering environmental justice efforts in the state. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)In 2022, Maryland released its Environmental Justice Screening tool, a map that allowed users to view data on pollution burdens and health metrics Census tract by Census tract.
But earlier this year, it ran into a President Donald Trump-sized problem. The webpage temporarily gave way to a cartoon roadblock sign, bearing the words “Under Construction.”
“At this time, the tool is temporarily disabled due to disruptions in the federal online data availability,” read the Maryland website.
But now, the tool is back online and functioning, this time, independent of federal data.
In an executive order — which he signed Thursday at Baltimore’s Living Classrooms campus in Harbor East, as young summer campers played outside — Gov. Wes Moore (D) ordered his administration to “​​use this new, improved, data-driven map to inform their policy work and to inform the decisions of their agencies and departments.” Speakers called it a first-ever executive order in the state on environmental justice.
“Since the new Trump-Vance administration took office, we haven’t been able to rely on federal data because that data is not being released, and that data is not now readily available,” Moore said. “But in this administration, that won’t be enough to make us give up.”
  For a period this year, Maryland’s Environmental Justice map was unavailable due to a lapse in federal data. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)
The executive order also creates an interagency advisory council focused on environmental justice and equity that Moore said will serve as a “hub for collaboration across 13 different state agencies,” which will be required to designate environmental justice officers and create environmental justice strategic plans within a year.
“Environmental justice won’t just be the work of a single department. Environmental justice is not a lane. It is a lens,” Moore said.
The council, which will meet at least quarterly, is tasked with collaborating on environmental justice training programs for state employees and identifying opportunities to streamline grant funding for environmental justice communities, among other tasks. It must submit status reports every Dec. 1, starting this year.
The order, nicknamed VOICE — for Valuing Opportunity, Inclusion and Community Equity — also directs state agencies to “prioritize opportunities for meaningful engagement with impacted communities on policies and priorities related to Environmental Justice.”
The order “solidifies Maryland’s unwavering commitment to environmental justice, irrespective of what the noise is around us,” Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain said during Thursday’s event.
“You know what I mean,” she added.
That “noise” is likely coming from the Trump administration, which has sought to eliminate “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs around the country, and targeted environmental justice staffers at federal agencies for reassignment or layoff.
The executive order also includes provisions calling on state agencies to “accelerate progress removing barriers that have always historically stood in the way of our underrepresented farmers,” Moore said. That includes difficulties that farmers face accessing land and accessing financing, Moore said.

It comes after legislators failed to advance an environmental justice-focused bill in the 2025 General Assembly. Called the CHERISH Our Communities Act, it would have set new requirements on permits issued by MDE to polluting sources in areas overburdened with a high environmental justice score.
The sponsor of that bill, Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s), said during Thursday’s press conference that both executive and legislative actions will be needed to improve conditions for Maryland communities grappling with environmental justice.
“I say this with conviction as a sponsor of the CHERISH Our Communities Act: This executive order is not just welcome.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The tax and spending cuts bill signed on July 4 by President Donald Trump will impose the deepest cuts in history to the federal food safety net in Ohio and other states. Even before those cuts hit, the benefits don’t cover the average cost of food in 99% of counties in the United States — and none in Ohio, according to a new analysis by the Urban Institute.
The bill Trump signed will provide an estimated $1 trillion in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans over 10 years and add $3.8 trillion to the deficit.
Those deficits would be even higher if the new law didn’t slash more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. And they might be forced even higher as millions of hungry, newly uninsured Americans require medical treatment, but can’t pay.
The report released Wednesday said that almost everywhere in the United States, Trump’s bill will cut food benefits that were already inadequate.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“With food prices persistently elevated and SNAP benefits failing to cover the cost of even a modestly priced meal in recent years, the One Big Beautiful Bill’s changes are expected to increase food insecurity and poverty for millions of Americans,” the report’s authors, Poonam Gupta and Elaine Waxman, said in a blog post. 
The researchers used data from NielsenIQ in to determine modest food prices each U.S. county. They compared them to maximum SNAP benefits, which average $2.84 per meal. 
They found that on average, that modestly priced meal was 20% more expensive than the maximum benefit, and that monthly benefits fell short of meal costs by $53.01. 
That might not sound like much. But this is a program under which a family of three can’t make more than $33,576 a year to qualify for any benefits. So they’re likely to have a hard time paying other basic expenses as well.
In all, the researchers found, SNAP benefits fall short in 99% of U.S. counties.
“That means there’s virtually nowhere in the US where a family who qualifies for even the largest benefit (nearly 40 percent of all SNAP recipients) can reliably afford food,” they wrote.
In Ohio, many of the biggest shortfalls are in the northeast.
Cuyahoga County appears to have the biggest, with meal costs exceeding maximum benefits by 40%. In Geauga County, the gap is 39%. In Medina it’s 35%, and in Summit it’s 33%.
By comparison, in Franklin and Hamilton counties the gaps are 27% and 24%, respectively.
Many of the smallest gaps are in the rural counties of north-central and western Ohio. Hardin County appears to have the smallest, at 1%, while in Van Wert County it’s 4%.
As the One Big Beautiful Bill Act takes away money for nutrition, it uses specific mechanisms to do it, the researchers said.
“The new law undermines SNAP’s ability to reduce food insecurity and help families put food on the table in several ways,” they wrote. “It requires, for the first time, that states fund part of benefit costs, imposes work requirements for and associated time limits on receiving benefits for older adults and families with older children, and eliminates eligibility for lawfully residing humanitarian immigrants.”
They added, “Another concerning provision requires that updates to the program market basket, known as the Thrifty Food Plan, be cost neutral. SNAP benefits are already too low to cover food costs, and this requirement will make it even harder to increase benefits to a level that is enough to help families afford food.

(Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The baseball on my desk disintegrated.
The leather skin of the ball, torn off and twisted like the hide of roadkill, slouched on one side of my desk. Red confetti sprinkled the tabletop, the shredded stitches that once held the leather figure 8s in place.
From my parent’s bathroom drawer, I borrowed the sharpest scissors in the house. I found a thread ripper in the family sewing kit from the linen closet. My dad’s workbench in the basement supplied a handheld vise. All of these tools splayed across the desk for this experiment in reverse taxidermy.
The baseball had asked: “How long would it take to unwrap me? And what will you find at the center?” 
During this summer between sixth grade and seventh grade, those twin questions nagged me. I was intrigued not because I cared much about the physics of baseball.
I was intrigued out of boredom.
Unraveling the ball was an exorcism, a ritual I invented.
What else was I going to do if my parents wouldn’t let me watch TV all day long? I wondered in my bedroom adorned with books.
On many days during summers in middle school, I would head straight for my favorite chair next to the TV after breakfast. Even though my mom banned it, I would swing sideways in the chair, draping my legs over the high arms of its upholstery. I folded like a tortilla in a taco stand.
I am not sure I ever sat frontways in that chair, especially not during summer.
In that position, I was so close that my knees almost touched the TV. Sure, I could change channels with a remote. But I preferred pressing my big toe against the channel buttons to click through cable reruns and game shows.
“Three’s Company” and “Happy Days” and “You Can’t Do That On Television.”
I remember having a symbiotic bond with the VCR, too. Without looking, I could use my toes, which dangled on the other side of the armchair, to fast forward and rewind. I only needed to slither out of the chair to clunk a new tape into the machine.
“Airplane” and “Star Wars” and “Top Gun.” Rewind and play — mashed with my toes.
I could sense the concerned annoyance from my mom each time she passed through the living room, on her way to work or preparing for the next household chore. She was busy. I was slack-jawed.
“Are you going to watch TV all day?” she would ask before answering her own question. “Ten more minutes.”
On her way out the door on errands, she banned television while she was gone. I thought I was safe, nestled sideways in that armchair while she was away. If I heard the grind of the garage door yawning open, I would click the TV off with my big toe. I slid across the tile in the entryway. Spinning unseen past the front door, I took the stairs two-by-two. I had escaped. She would never know.
“Why aren’t your thank-you notes done?” she would ask, swinging my bedroom door open and calling me out. “No TV until they are in the mailbox.”
How long has summer been the sparring ground between parents and children over technology? Since “Lone Ranger” episodes on the radio? If not, then surely since television and the internet.
In 2025, it’s even more with social media, mobile gaming and streaming videos.
If this is the most hyperactive moment of technology use among young people, these final weeks of summer — July heading into August — amp up the tension with their parents.
By this time in the summer, parents are worn thin, juggling work and child care while hoping to keep their kids active on anything besides a tablet. Just like I reclined innovatively in that chair, I have seen kids in my family hold iPads with their feet. Or prop their phones against a bottle of Gatorade. All of it still drives parents crazy. 
Ask a parent during these next few weeks how summer is going and the stock answer will likely be, “It’s time for school to start up again.”
We parents will also find nostalgic pride in cultivating boredom. Curse the iPads. Call in the screentime limits. Stack up the phones. Bounce the kids outdoors without anything to do. 
As a member of Generation X, I am contractually obligated to tell my kids that it’s healthy to be bored. That they should have a few days without technology. That summer’s attendant boredom can rewire their brain. 
“Back in my day … ” I will say, before catching myself.
Which brings me back to my desk, strewn with the shrapnel of a baseball. 
Writing about it now makes me embarrassed of the mindlessness of the task: unwinding the gluey string of a ball over hours when it probably took mere minutes to make in the factory. Maybe a bit more time scrunched in that TV chair wouldn’t have been so bad. 
Or, was my mom doing me a favor by shooing me away from the TV on a summer day, even if it made me bored? Were the synapses of my brain — like the intertwining strings encircling the baseball — helped by spending hours unwinding that ball? 
Rewatching TV shows and movies from that period of my life, I sympathize more with the characters who are parents. As I re-run that middle school summer through my mind today, it’s the same. 
We parents are hovering a bit, yes. And making our kids a bit bored for the moment. 
But it’s a wholesome boredom that’s a signature of late summer.

The Trump administration wants to take away citizenship from naturalized Americans on a massive scale.
While a recent Justice Department memo prioritizes national security cases, it directs the department to “maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence” across 10 broad priority categories.
Denaturalization is different from deportation, which removes noncitizens from the country. With civil denaturalization, the government files a lawsuit to strip people’s U.S. citizenship after they have become citizens, turning them back into noncitizens who can then be deported.
The government can only do this in specific situations. It must prove someone “illegally procured” citizenship by not meeting the requirements, or that they lied or hid important facts during the citizenship process.
The Trump administration’s “maximal enforcement” approach means pursuing any case where evidence might support taking away citizenship, regardless of priority level or strength of evidence. As our earlier research documented, this has already led to cases like that of Baljinder Singh, whose citizenship was revoked based on a name discrepancy that could easily have resulted from a translator’s error rather than intentional fraud.
 A brief history

For most of American history, taking away citizenship has been rare. But it increased dramatically during the 1940s and 1950s during the Red Scare period characterized by intense suspicion of communism. The United States government targeted people it thought were communists or Nazi supporters. Between 1907 and 1967, over 22,000 Americans lost their citizenship this way.
Everything changed in 1967 when the Supreme Court decided Afroyim v. Rusk. The court said the government usually cannot take away citizenship without the person’s consent. It left open only cases involving fraud during the citizenship process.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
After this decision, denaturalization became extremely rare. From 1968 to 2013, fewer than 150 people lost their citizenship, mostly war criminals who had hidden their past.
 How the process works

In criminal lawsuits, defendants get free lawyers if they can’t afford one. They get jury trials. The government must prove guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt” – the highest standard of proof.
But in most denaturalization cases, the government files a civil suit, where none of these protections exist.
People facing denaturalization get no free lawyer, meaning poor defendants often face the government alone. There’s no jury trial – just a judge deciding whether someone deserves to remain American. The burden of proof is lower – “clear and convincing evidence” instead of “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Most important, there’s no time limit, so the government can go back decades to build cases.
As law professors who study citizenship, we believe this system violates basic constitutional rights.
The Supreme Court has called citizenship a fundamental right. Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1958 described it as the “right to have rights.”
In our reading of the law, taking away such a fundamental right through civil procedures that lack basic constitutional protection – no right to counsel for those who can’t afford it, no jury trial, and a lower burden of proof – seems to violate the due process of law required by the Constitution when the government seeks to deprive someone of their rights.
The bigger problem is what citizenship-stripping policy does to democracy.
When the government can strip citizenship from naturalized Americans for decades-old conduct through civil procedures with minimal due process protection – pursuing cases based on evidence that might not meet criminal standards – it undermines the security and permanence that citizenship is supposed to provide. This creates a system where naturalized citizens face ongoing vulnerability that can last their entire lives, potentially chilling their full participation in American democracy.
The Justice Department memo establishes 10 priority categories for denaturalization cases. They range from national security threats and war crimes to various forms of fraud, financial crimes and, most importantly, any other cases it deems “sufficiently important to pursue.” This “maximal enforcement” approach means pursuing not just clear cases of fraud, but also any case where evidence might support taking away citizenship, no matter how weak or old the evidence is.
This creates fear throughout immigrant communities.
About 20 million naturalized Americans now must worry that any mistake in their decades-old immigration paperwork could cost them their citizenship.
 A two-tier system

This policy effectively creates two different types of American citizens. Native-born Americans never have to worry about losing their citizenship, no matter what they do. But naturalized Americans face ongoing vulnerability that can last their entire lives.
This has already happened. A woman who became a naturalized citizen in 2007 helped her boss with paperwork that was later used in fraud. She cooperated with the FBI investigation, was characterized by prosecutors as only a “minimal participant,” completed her sentence, and still faced losing her citizenship decades later because she didn’t report the crime on her citizenship application – even though she hadn’t been charged at the time.
The Justice Department’s directive to “maximally pursue” cases across 10 broad categories – combined with the first Trump administration’s efforts to review over 700,000 naturalization files – represents an unprecedented expansion of denaturalization efforts.
The policy will almost certainly face legal challenges on constitutional grounds, but the damage may already be done. When naturalized citizens fear their status could be revoked, it undermines the security and permanence that citizenship is supposed to provide.
The Supreme Court, in Afroyim v. Rusk, was focused on protecting existing citizens from losing their citizenship. The constitutional principle behind that decision – that citizenship is a fundamental right which can’t be arbitrarily taken away by whoever happens to be in power – applies equally to how the government handles denaturalization cases today.
The Trump administration’s directive, combined with court procedures that lack basic constitutional protections, risks creating a system that the Afroyim v. Rusk decision sought to prevent – one where, as the Supreme Court said, “A group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship.”

The sweeping requests raise fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states — representing data on millions of Americans — and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.
Trump’s proof of citizenship elections order blocked for now in federal court

While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
 Sweeping Colorado requests

In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.

Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.
Trump signs broad elections order requiring proof of citizenship

The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.
New voter registration rules threaten hefty fines, criminal penalties for groups

The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
 Letters to other states

As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

Municipalities pay per ton to incinerate or landfill trash, yet residents rarely see any financial incentive to reduce waste","Waste crisis, climate emergency, fast-fashion, PFAS, electric vehicles, wildlife collapse, increasing pollution—keeping up with the pressing environmental issues we face today can be overwhelming. 
It’s a moral dilemma to care about the environment when it seems like everything in our society is designed to be harmful. How can we make effective change without burning out over every small decision’s impact? We need to be able to zoom out, understand the impact of each action, and focus our energy where it counts.
My colleague Christine O’Neill’s recent op-ed on CT’s plastic bag ban raised some important concerns on the increasing burden of plastic waste on public health, wildlife, and the mounting trash crisis.
The uncertainty of where our trash goes is compounded by a growing suspicion of recycling —the idea that items placed in the blue bin may be incinerated or landfilled anyway feels like a betrayal. Many hard-to-recycle items —like food waste, soft plastics, and electronics, which aren’t accepted in curbside recycling— often end up in blue bins. This leads to recycling contamination, fines for municipalities, and missed opportunities to properly recycle those materials.
Understanding what our trash and recycling is really made of can help contextualize these issues and take the mystery out of it. Did you know the types of trash we produce is actually quite predictable? Waste characterization studies —conducted regularly by state and municipal governments— tell us that most people throw out the same types of things in similar proportions. 
On average:

41% of residential trash is recyclable materials like paper, cardboard, glass, and containers (CT DEEP, 2022)
22% is food waste
7% is textiles that could be donated or recycled.
1% by weight (4% by volume) is plastic film and bags

Recyclables are only valuable if they’re clean and separated. Once mixed with non-recyclables in a trash bag, they can’t be recovered. You can’t unscramble an egg.
Food waste is also a huge opportunity. If composted or anaerobically digested, it can become a valuable soil amendment. But if sent to a landfill or incinerator, those nutrients are lost —and the wet, heavy food drives up disposal costs.
Our economic system is designed to encourage waste. Throwing everything in the trash is free and easy —it’s covered by property taxes. In contrast, recycling soft plastics, composting food scraps, or using specialty recycling programs takes extra time, money, or effort. The system makes waste the path of least resistance.
This means the true cost of trash is hidden. Municipalities pay per ton to incinerate or landfill trash, yet residents rarely see any financial incentive to reduce waste.
So how can we fix this? In her op-ed, O’Neill notes: “Connecticut desperately needs to cut its waste generation, either through source reduction (make less trash in the first place) or diversion (send it to be used for something other than burying or burning).” As tipping fees continue to rise, towns are looking for effective solutions to reduce waste and increase recycling without adding additional burdens to budgets or residents.
Unit Based Pricing paired with food scrap diversion is widely considered the gold standard for municipal waste reduction, with the potential to reduce trash by up to 70%. This is seen in Stonington, the only town in the state to exceed CT DEEP’s 2024 goal of 60% waste diversion.
This approach prices trash according to volume instead of flat fees that are buried in property tax bills, giving people the power to save money by reducing the amount of trash they produce. Unit Based Pricing works, in every one of the 300+ communities in New England that use it, trash is reduced by an average of 44%. Why it works is a lesson from behavioral economics —when people see that their trash has a cost and a value, they think about it differently, and they behave differently.
Pair this with removing food scraps from the regular waste stream, and we’re on our way to significant progress.


The above chart shows the impact of Unit Based Pricing on the annual generation of waste by material category. WasteZero, Sustainable CT Coffee Hour, April 19, 2025. 
These are real, achievable solutions, but municipalities are strapped for cash and resources, making development and implementation of these programs even more challenging. However, Sustainable Materials Management and Materials Management and Infrastructure grants from the CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection have made funding and implementing these programs a reality for municipalities across the state. 
Using the 2023 SMM grants, 15 towns launched exploratory projects, and seven of those projects were adopted permanently. These efforts reduced municipal solid waste by over 6 million pounds across Connecticut.
I, like many others, want to be a good citizen— health-conscious, anti-racist, feminist, good daughter/friend/granddaughter, mindful co-worker—and also save the planet. But when everything feels urgent, I focus on what I can control: reducing food waste, shopping secondhand, remembering my reusable bag, and I’m lucky to work on systemic change professionally.
But effective change cannot rely on individuals to make the perfect choice every time. We need systems that make good-enough choices easier and more rewarding. We need collective accountability, not individual perfectionism.
Remember: 41% of what’s in the trash could go in the recycling bin. Another 22% could be composted, and 8% could be recycled in other ways. That’s 71% of trash we could divert with existing systems—if people had a reason to use them.
We need to stop hiding the true cost of waste. Let’s evolve our systems to ones that support and reward smarter choices —Unit-Based Pricing for trash, composting, bottle and can redemption, Extended Producer Responsibility —ones that help us all do better, together. That’s how we build communities that are not just less wasteful, but more resilient, more just, and more hopeful.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (Alaska Beacon file photos)Alaska’s two U.S. senators voted differently on a bill requested by President Donald Trump to block federal funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting. 
The cuts include $1.1 billion for public broadcasting over two years, with more than $20 million in funding for Alaska’s 27 public radio and television stations. The measure is known as a rescission package, because it claws back funding that Congress had already approved earlier this year.
The overall bill includes $9 billion in cuts, with most in foreign aid.
The bill passed 51 to 48, with Alaska’s Republican senators voted differently: U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan voted for the rescission, and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted against. 
Sullivan spokesperson Amanda Coyne sent a statement by email on Thursday repeating the senator’s position that he had warned public media, NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for years about their “biased reporting” that “would eventually jeopardize federal support for both national and local radio stations,” she said.
However, Coyne added, Sullivan has advocated for rural stations and has been working with other senators and White House officials on alternative sources of funding to keep rural stations on the air, particularly Native stations in Alaska.
“Currently, there is approximately $10 million available for tribal and Native stations in the country. Alaska has 11 Native stations. Going forward, Senator Sullivan will continue working to provide resources to support as many Alaska rural radio stations as possible. He was discussing this funding issue with a senior administration official this morning,” Coyne said.
Coyne did not respond to questions on how much would be available for Alaska stations, when, or what stations would be eligible. 
Murkowski was outspoken and critical of the rescission bill, voting no. 
In a statement on Thursday, she first cited a lack of clarity by the Trump administration for what programs and amounts would be rescinded, especially for global health programs. “We still lack necessary details, including which ones will be zeroed out. There is no way to determine the implications for lifesaving care and vital resources for women and children abroad,” she said.
“I also strongly oppose the rescission of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. My colleagues are targeting NPR but will wind up hurting – and, over time, closing down – local radio stations that provide essential news, alerts, and educational programming in Alaska and across the country,” she said. 
Murkowski introduced an amendment on the Senate floor late Wednesday night to protect CPB funding, and it was voted down 51 to 47. 
Murkowski told reporters on Thursday afternoon in an audio recording shared with the Alaska Beacon, when asked about the fate of rural stations in Alaska, that her office was also looking into funding for stations from federal tribal grants.
“Some of them, about a dozen, will be able to access these tribal grants,” she told the reporters.
“But that’s less than half of the Alaska stations. So what happens to KUCB going forward?” she said, referring to the public radio station in Unalaska that broadcast a tsunami warning and emergency evacuation order for remote Aleutian Island communities following a magnitude 7.3 earthquake the day before.  
“So what we’re trying to do is kind of identify how perilously close are many of these small stations to being in a shut down mode. How much do they have to carry them forward?” she said.
In her statement, Murkowski emphasized her opposition to the rescission process, driven by the White House Office of Management and Budget, as undermining Congress’ authority. 
“Finally, and most importantly, approving this package in this manner further shifts the balance of power over the federal budget to the executive branch. Congress, not OMB, holds the power of the purse under the Constitution. To the extent that certain appropriations are not necessary to comply with the laws passed by Congress, we can best address that through the annual budgeting process, where we routinely rescind funds every year.”
The rescission bill now advances back to the U.S. House, which passed an earlier version of the measure. As of Thursday evening it had not been taken up for a vote.

The anti-Trump demonstrations marked the fifth anniversary of the death of civil rights leader and former Rep. John Lewis of Georgia.
The Colorado protests — planned from Alamosa to Denver to Fort Collins — were led by organizations including Colorado 50501 and Solidarity Warriors, and local progressive groups. Organizers called for the demonstrations to “carry forward (Lewis’) fight for justice, voting rights and dignity for all” and “respond to the attacks on our civil and human rights by the Trump administration.”
The Denver “Good Trouble” protest kicked off at about 5 p.m. amid intermittent rain in Lincoln Veterans Memorial Park, near the state Capitol. More than 1,000 people turned out, carrying signs, umbrellas and flyers.

Denver resident Chris Condat, 74, set up a booth with other members of Third Act Colorado, an organization for democracy and climate advocates over the age of 60. The group set up a poster and markers asking other protestors, “How are you going to make good trouble?”
“For many of us, the main thing driving us is what kind of planet and what kind of democracy we want to leave our children and our grandchildren,” Condat said. “We are trying to do something about the state of the Earth, and to make a better life for them.”










Trump and the Project 2025 people are doing everything they can to destroy what makes this country great ... I love this country. I don’t want to see democracy destroyed.


– Kathy Icenogle, Boulder resident


Lewis served in the U.S. House of Representatives for more than 30 years, and he was outspoken against President Donald Trump. He was a major leader in the civil rights movement and popularized the phrase “good trouble.” He chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s and helped lead the 1963 March on Washington.
By about 5:40 p.m., protesters marched south on Lincoln Street, chanting “No justice. No peace. No ICE in our streets,” a reference to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Immigration is a key issue for many protestors, including 23-year-old Brandon Quintanilla. Quintanilla is a co-founder of the Aurora Unidos CSO, a group that advocates for immigrant rights and organizes against ICE’s presence in Colorado.
“This is about bringing out the community and getting more people involved,” Quintanilla said. “We can’t just come out one day, we have to do it consistently.”
The “Good Trouble” protests come a month after tens of thousands of Coloradans participated in nationwide “No Kings” demonstrations, which coincided with Trump’s birthday and a military parade in Washington, D.C. 
Boulder resident Kathy Icenogle brought a Lewis-inspired sign to the Denver protest. She said she felt compelled to participate to “stand against the obliteration of the Constitution.”
“Trump and the Project 2025 people are doing everything they can to destroy what makes this country great,” Icenogle said. “I love this country. I don’t want to see democracy destroyed.”

Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann asked Youngkin during a “fireside chat” at the fundraiser if he likes the current presidential nominating system that starts with the Iowa Republican caucuses — and Youngkin responded he “absolutely” supports the current system.
“Here’s why: The beginning of the nomination process starts with incredibly informed voters,” Youngkin said. “You see, the difference in the way that the caucus system works, and the way a normal primary works. You all know this, is it is a moment to fully understand issues candidates, and what that candidate can do. And so often, primaries are a day when someone shows up and just pulls on a pulls on a lever because a friend whispered in their ear, ‘vote for them.'”

The Lincoln Dinner, an annual event held by the Republican Party of Iowa, has historically hosted presidential candidates and hopefuls who aim to introduce themselves to Iowa caucus voters. In 2023, leading up to the 2024 Republican Iowa caucuses, 13 presidential candidates including President Donald Trump spoke at the event.
Though it’s still early in the cycle for candidates to announce their intentions for a bid in 2028, Youngkin has been brought up as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. His trip to Iowa, as well as plans to headline the Silver Elephant Gala in South Carolina, the SC GOP’s biggest fundraiser — both events in early states during the GOP presidential nomination cycle — have fueled speculation that he may be considering a run.
Youngkin gained prominence among Republicans nationally after his initial election to the Virginia governor’s office in 2021, when he defeated Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, becoming the first Republican to hold the office in over a decade. Governors cannot serve consecutive terms in Virginia, meaning he will have to leave the seat after his term ends in 2026.
The Virginia Republican was formerly co-CEO of the Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C. private equity firm. He did not have previous political experience before becoming governor, and spent more than $20 million of his own money to fund his 2021 campaign, according to the Associated Press.
In his gubernatorial campaign, Youngkin focused on “parental rights” issues related to education, opposing allowing sexually explicit material in school curriculum and to mask and vaccine mandates in K-12 schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Youngkin told Iowa Republicans these are the issues that motivated Virginians to vote for him in the 2021 election, despite Democrats having a history of winning the state.
“In a state that was blue, it didn’t matter … whether you’re a Republican parent or a independent parent, or even many Democratic parents, they said my children are the most important thing in my life, and I will decide I do not co-parent with the government,” he said.
He said during his time as governor, he was able to enact many laws allowing parents to have a say in their children’s education — and said his next goal is to create a private school scholarship program in Virginia, similar to Iowa’s Education Savings Account program using public funds for private school tuition and associated costs.
He said passing the “Virginia Opportunity Scholarship” program will be more difficult in Virginia than it was in Iowa, as both chambers have Democratic majorities. He added, “when I hear about these supermajorities (in the Iowa Legislature) I sit back there and go, ‘oh my goodness, wouldn’t that be great?'”
“We’re going to get this done,” Youngkin said. “We’re going to have Virginia opportunity scholarships so that families who couldn’t otherwise send their children to private schools have an opportunity to make that decision and exercise their right to make decisions for their kids.”
The Virginia Republican said his stance on education, as well as on issues like supporting law enforcement, lowering taxes and shrinking government, are positions that most Virginians share — but “they just didn’t know it” before hearing from his campaign in 2021.
“Virginians came together in a way that we couldn’t believe,” he said. “They said no to the left and yes to common sense, conservative values, policies. And it was a moment that made me so proud to be a Virginian. I have to say — it’s the exact same feeling I had when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. The exact same feeling that common sense conservative policies not only win, but a vast majority of Americans want them and believe in them.”
Though Youngkin did not discuss future plans following his current term as Virginia governor, Kaufmann told reporters following the event that Youngkin’s stop showed the importance of having the Iowa caucuses lead the nation by providing a platform for potential presidential candidates long before the 2028 campaign season kicks off.
Iowa’s job, Kaufmann said, “is not to pick the president, but to provide an avenue where everybody can see what these candidates, potential candidates, have to say.”
While Iowa Republicans are set to keep their position as first in the nation in 2028, the Democratic presidential nominating calendar for the upcoming election cycle is less clear. Iowa lost its starting position in the 2024 Democratic nominating cycle. While the Democratic National Committee is set to reconsider the early state lineup before the next presidential election season, Iowa has lost its seat on the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee, meaning a return to holding the first-in-the-nation caucuses looks unlikely.
Youngkin said the Democratic Party “made a massive mistake in abandoning Iowa as their first stop and abandoning their process.” Kaufmann echoed this sentiment, adding that he is willing to work with Iowa Democrats to restore their position in the nominating calendar.

Nicole Mitchell took the stand in her own defense in her felony burglary trial Thursday, depicting herself as a concerned stepdaughter who took steps to conduct a welfare check on her stepmother without being seen. 
The Woodbury Democrat admitted to lying to the police about her intentions — she told them she went to her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home to get a few of her father’s things — but only to refrain from exacerbating her stepmother’s Alzheimer’s-related paranoia, including about being put in a facility against her will, Mitchell said during nearly an entire day of testimony. 
“I created this entire situation, so the only person I have to blame here is myself,” Mitchell acknowledged. 
Mitchell is hoping that a mix of just enough contrition and explanation for her erratic behavior will spur empathy from jurors, who may have experience with family upheaval that can result from age and infirmity, and especially dementia.
She became emotional several times when she recalled the happier times with her late father and stepmother Carol Mitchell — before her father’s death, after which she said Carol’s Alzheimer’s worsened.
Nicole Mitchell on Thursday read aloud text messages with Carol about one month prior to the break-in. The pair argued about interring the ashes of Nicole Mitchell’s father. (Contrary to a widely reported detail that came from police, Mitchell knew the ashes were already interred when she showed up at Carol’s house, so she could not have made an effort to purloin them. In addition, Carol had already mailed Nicole Mitchell some of the ashes.)
During the text exchanges, Carol accused Nicole of not loving her father and disdaining her.
Nicole Mitchell said after that she didn’t contact Carol anymore because she needed a break from the hostility, which can be a symptom of Alzheimer’s.
In the days leading up to Nicole Mitchell’s April 22, 2024, arrest in Carol’s Detroit Lakes home, Mitchell accessed her stepmother’s medical records without Carol’s permission.
The records showed, Nicole Mitchell said, that Carol had gotten lost on her way to her April 17, 2024, Alzheimer’s appointment, and was struggling with depression and drinking more frequently. She attended the appointment alone. Nicole Mitchell said that her interactions with her stepmother were worsening, citing Carol’s dementia-induced paranoia even as Nicole tried to help her. 
She testified that she feared if she merely called instead of showing up in person, Carol would lie about her well-being. What she read in her stepmother’s medical records catalyzed her decision to conduct a welfare check in person, she said.
“I was worried, in general, and I decided to check and see how things were myself,” Mitchell testified. 
Nicole Mitchell said she left her home on April 22, 2024, around 1 a.m., leaving her two young sons in her stepfather’s care, and arrived at Carol’s home around 4:30 a.m.
She had a pair of special “flashlight gloves,” as well as a flashlight with a sock on it, which she said was not a burglar’s tool but instead a favorite calming nightlight for her young autistic son. She also said she brought a prybar to the house.
Nicole Mitchell had been a frequent visitor of Carol’s, so Nicole Mitchell testified that she parked far away from the house so the neighbors wouldn’t recognize her car and dressed all in black to avoid being spotted.
She didn’t want the neighbors to see she was there, she said, because they would inform Carol that they saw her, which would cause Carol to be paranoid about Nicole Mitchell’s intentions. Carol testified during the trial Tuesday that she believed Nicole Mitchell wanted her money and even wanted to end her life.
Nicole Mitchell said she had a key to Carol’s because she and her kids would frequently stay over.
She saw a chair pushed up against the door and a bar laid up at an angle to the door knob, inhibiting easy opening. Nicole Mitchell said she could have tried to force her way in, but she didn’t want to make noise and wake Carol up.
She said she entered the home through a rotted, easily opened egress window. She testified that she took off her shoes when she entered to avoid tracking dirt into the home.
She looked in the basement freezer and then made her way upstairs to the kitchen to see if Carol had food in the house. Nicole Mitchell said she believed Carol had lost weight, so she wanted to make sure she had enough food.
She said she wanted to ensure Carol Mitchell’s phone was working. She said Carol wasn’t technology-savvy and had been deleting messages and contacts because of her paranoia, so she wanted to see if Carol had inadvertently turned on the phone’s “do not disturb” function or deleted her family members’ phone numbers.
Nicole Mitchell said she went to Carol’s bedroom, where she believed Carol kept her phone at night, and opened the door a crack. Carol stirred. Nicole Mitchell, standing near the door, said she watched her stepmother get out of bed, walk up to her and say, “What the hell are you doing here?”
Nicole Mitchell said she was afraid of a confrontation, so she “dashed” into the hall. Carol chased her. Unlike Carol’s telling of the incident, Nicole Mitchell said she was not crawling on the floor. Carol Mitchell earlier in the week misremembered several aspects of the break-in, including that police had “pulled” Nicole Mitchell out of the basement window to arrest her. She also struggled with dates and names. 
The first-term senator said she was afraid and didn’t want to escalate the situation, so she ran to the basement to wait and see how her stepmother responded. She heard Carol say that she had a knife. Nicole Mitchell said she panicked and tried to escape through a basement window, shoving her backpack near the window, but she realized she couldn’t get out. She said she heard her stepmother call the police.
She said she believed her stepmother was merely angry at her. She was initially relieved that police would arrive and deescalate the situation and resolve the family dispute.
Nicole Mitchell testified that she was not there to steal anything in the house.
But this contradicted what she told police numerous times during her arrest — that she was there to get a few of her late father’s belongings.
This was a lie, Nicole Mitchell testified.
“Why did you tell the police four times that that’s why you were there?” Mitchell’s attorney Dane DeKrey asked his client on direct examination.
Mitchell said she didn’t want to heighten Carol’s fear of being put in memory care.
“If I would have told her I was trying to do a welfare check …  she would have assumed I was trying to stick her in a nursing home, which was a real fear she had. So in that moment, and having just seen all the stuff of dad’s in the basement, including a couple of things that she promised me but never gotten to me, what came to my mind was just to say I was coming to get a couple things of dad’s,” Mitchell said.
She said she wasn’t thinking rationally at the moment and wished she had behaved differently, but she doesn’t regret trying to check in and help her family member.
“You just admitted to lying on video,” DeKrey told Nicole Mitchell on the stand. “And so the obvious question is, if you lied to the police four times on the night of this incident, how is the jury supposed to believe that you are not lying now?”
“Sometimes to protect family members, you have to lie,” Nicole Mitchell said.
Police never searched Mitchell’s car and did not find any evidence of theft.

On cross examination, Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald tried to poke holes in Mitchell’s story. She remained composed and consistent.
McDonald noted that Nicole Mitchell was with police for 37 minutes outside of the presence of Carol and not once did she tell police that she was there out of concern for her stepmother.
“The problem with that story is that you were with the officers much longer outside of her presence than (in) her presence, right? And you continue the story,” McDonald said.
Nicole Mitchell said that she didn’t tell officers why she was there because she noticed that the cops were relaying information from her back to Carol; she said she still believed that if she could keep Carol’s paranoia at bay — about putting Carol in a home, or stealing her money or otherwise harming her — Carol might not press charges.
McDonald noted that in her remarks to police, Nicole Mitchell intertwined truths with what she now asserts were lies, like when she told officers that she was a military commander and “there’s just a couple of my dad’s things I came to get” in the same sentence. (Mitchell retired as an officer in the Air National Guard at the end of 2024.) 
In one of his final questions on cross examination, McDonald asked Nicole Mitchell what her late father would have thought of her actions.
“I think he would be very sad by this whole situation, and that he would support me because he loved Carol,” Mitchell said. “Even if I did it the wrong way, he would have wanted me to do my best to take care of her.”
On Friday, the defense will likely call a few more witnesses before closing statements.
If convicted of burglary, Mitchell faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. If found guilty of possession of burglary tools she faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071725.MITCHELL17-scaled-e1752802062493-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.



There isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
Arkansas’ example
Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
Other state efforts
Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

The U.S. Senate narrowly approved on July 16, 2025, a bill that would claw back federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes money to NPR, PBS and their affiliate stations. The US$9 billion rescission package will withdraw $1.1 billion Congress had previously approved for the CPB to receive in the 2026 and 2027 fiscal years. In addition, it makes deep foreign aid cuts. All Democrats present voted against the measure, joined by two Republicans: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. As long as the House, which approved a previous version, votes in favor of the Senate’s version of the bill by midnight July 18, Trump will be able to meet a budgetary deadline by signing the measure into law in time for it to take effect.
What will happen to NPR, PBS and local stations?
NPR and PBS provide programming to local public television and radio stations across the country. The impact on them will be direct and indirect.
Both NPR and PBS receive money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, an independent nonprofit corporation Congress created in 1967 to receive and distribute federal money to public broadcasters. More than 70% of the money it distributes flows directly to local stations. Some stations get up to half of their budgets from the CPB.
But NPR and PBS get much of their funding from foundation grants, viewers’ and listeners’ donations, and corporate underwriting. And local public radio and TV stations also get support from an array of sources besides CPB.



Only about 1% of NPR funding, and 15% of PBS funding, comes directly from the government via the CPB. However, once local radio and television stations lose federal funding, they’ll be less able to pay NPR and PBS for the programs they produce.
The nearly 1,500 public media stations in the U.S. rely on a mix of NPR, PBS and third-party producer programming, such as American Public Media and PRX, for the programs they offer. Local stations also produce and air regional news and provide emergency broadcasts for the government.
In rural areas with few broadcast stations and spotty cellphone coverage, public broadcast stations are vital sources of information about important community news and updates during emergencies. Federal support is essential for the programming and day-to-day operations of many local stations and allows for the maintenance of equipment and personnel to operate these vital community resources.
We believe that stations in communities that most need them, especially in rural locations, would be hit especially hard because they rely heavily on CPB funding.
Why are Republicans taking this step?
Public broadcasting has long been a target of conservative Republicans. They say that with a highly diversified media landscape, the public no longer needs media that is subsidized by federal dollars. They also claim that public broadcasting has a liberal bias and taxpayers should not be required to fund media that slants to the left politically.
Why is public media necessary when there’s news on the internet?
As journalism revenue has plummeted, public broadcasting has remained a vital source for news in communities across the nation. This is especially true in rural communities, where economic and political pressures have threatened the survival of local journalism.
In addition, with much online news coverage placed behind paywalls, public radio and television plays an important role in making quality journalism available to the American public.
Why did Congress approve these funds 2 years ahead?
Public broadcasting has gotten roughly $550 million per year from the federal government in recent years. The CPB has always approved and designated those funds two years in advance, due to a provision in the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, after Congress has voted to provide that money. The CPB then has distributed that funding primarily through grants to PBS and NPR affiliate stations to support their technical infrastructure, program development and audience research.
What are the consequences for Native communities?
Dozens of Native American stations are at risk of closing once the CPB is defunded. Native Public Media, a network of 57 radio stations and four TV stations, is a key source of news and information for tribal communities across the nation and relies on CPB support.
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, publicly stated that he secured an agreement with the White House to move $9.4 million in Interior Department funding to two dozen Native American stations. But there is no provision related to this promise within the legislation.

And it won’t be Joe Kent, the man she’s defeated twice.
State Senate Republican Leader John Braun and Washington State Republican Party Chair Jim Walsh are both eyeing a challenge to the congresswoman, who won a second term last year and is up for reelection in 2026. 
Her 3rd Congressional District has drawn national attention as a battleground where the outcome helps decide which party controls the U.S. House. Republicans are eager to reclaim the seat they lost three years ago.

Braun, a Centralia resident reelected last year to a fourth term as a state senator, was recruited by the National Republican Congressional Committee. He is expected to formally announce his campaign as soon as next week.
“My wife and I are talking about it. We’ll see,” Braun said Wednesday morning.
Walsh, an Aberdeen resident and state representative since 2017, said he’s “looking at it” and not “closing the door,” but noted his work to rebuild the state party “is not complete.” 
“That’s a factor,” he added.
With their respective political experience and electoral success, either could be a tough match-up for Gluesenkamp Perez. President Donald Trump won the 3rd District in each of his presidential runs.
One Republican, Antony Barran, owner of Willapa Wild, an oyster farm in Willapa Bay has already announced his candidacy in the district. This is his first run for Congress.
Tim Gowen, a campaign manager for Gluesenkamp Perez, said in an email on Thursday that the congresswoman “is laser-focused on cutting red tape for small businesses, expanding shop classes, and lowering costs for SW families.”
“She’s ready to put her record of fighting our fentanyl crisis and leveling the playing field for everyday people up against anyone,” Gowen added.
The 3rd District encompasses Clark, Cowlitz, Lewis, Pacific, Wahkiakum, and Skamania counties and a small part of Thurston County. It includes the city of Vancouver, and its southern boundary is the Columbia River.
In 2022, Gluesenkamp Perez, co-owner of an auto repair and machine shop with her husband, defeated Republican Joe Kent, a former Army Special Forces soldier who had Trump’s backing. 
It was one of that year’s biggest ballot upsets, costing the Republican Party a seat it had held for more than a decade and dropping the number of Republicans in Washington’s 12-member congressional delegation from three to two.
Last year, in a rematch, Gluesenkamp Perez defeated Kent by 15,000 votes, while in the presidential race, Trump beat Democrat Kamala Harris in the congressional district by nearly the same margin.
A co-chair of the centrist  Blue Dog Coalition, Gluesenkamp Perez has positioned herself as a moderate Democrat, touting her willingness to work across the aisle.

In her first term, she voted to oppose then-President Joe Biden’s border security policies and his proposals for student loan forgiveness. This year, she voted with House Republicans to pass the SAVE Act, which would require a person to prove they are a U.S. citizen when registering to vote in federal elections.
“It is a Trump district,” Walsh said. “The incumbent has worked very hard to create the image that she represents the district. She’s a progressive. You can wear all the Carhartts in the world, but your votes are your votes.”
If Braun enters the race, Walsh might not. He said he wants to avoid a divisive primary, citing damage done by intraparty primary fights in the last two elections. 
In 2022, Republican U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler faced several GOP challengers angered by her vote a year earlier to impeach Trump during his first term. Herrera Beutler had held the seat since 2011. 
Kent beat Herrera Beutler in the primary that year but then lost in the general election.
As a candidate, Kent drew attention for embracing false claims that Trump, not Biden, won in the 2020 election and unfounded theories about FBI involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Last year, Kent fended off Republican Leslie Lewallen of Camas before losing his November rematch with Gluesenkamp Perez.

The Border Patrol began conducting operations in Sacramento on Thursday, as two federal court rulings have ordered them to stop warrantless raids.


Border Patrol agents moved their operations northward Thursday to California’s capital, targeting a Home Depot in Sacramento, this time more than 500 miles away from the border. 
On Friday, a judge in Los Angeles ordered federal immigration agents to temporarily stop the “roving patrols” in which heavily armed agents have aggressively detained immigrants and U.S. citizens throughout Southern California during a month-long crackdown. They targeted car washes, construction jobs, and Home Depots, arresting mostly Latino men who were longtime residents of Los Angeles. 
It appeared agents had stopped the warrantless, aggressive sweeps through Los Angeles since the court ruling, which only applied to the state’s Central District. However, Border Patrol has been under a separate court order to stop similar warrantless raids in the state’s Eastern District – which includes Sacramento – after agents raided a Home Depot and other worksites in January. 
The architect of both the Central Valley and Los Angeles operations, Gregory Bovino, stood in front of the State Capitol Building on Thursday for an interview with Fox News. 
“There is no sanctuary city. Sacramento is not a sanctuary city. The state of California is not a sanctuary state. There is no sanctuary anywhere,” the El Centro sector’s chief patrol agent said.  “We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.”   
Also on Thursday, a federal appeals court denied on procedural grounds the Department of Homeland Security’s request to pause the temporary restraining order won last week by civil rights groups, who argued that the “brazen, midday kidnappings” violated the Constitution’s protections against unreasonable searches, and the government was illegally denying detainees access to an attorney. 
In the Kern County case, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April barring agents from using racial profiling in the Eastern District of California, which includes Sacramento. 
In court paperwork, the federal government maintains that its tactics are legitimate while vowing to retrain agents on the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. 
Bovino publicly said that Border Patrol went after a list of specific criminal targets, but the agency’s own documents later showed that it only had a previous record on one of the 78 people it arrested. 
After that court ruling, Border Patrol agents moved districts and became more aggressive, fanning out, while wearing masks, across Southern California. 
Not only do Thursday’s activities mark a return to the Eastern District, but they went right to the heart of California’s government. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom said the Border Patrol is trying to escape a court order, and said they should get out of California. 
“The Border Patrol should do their jobs – at the border – instead of continuing their tirade statewide of illegal racial profiling and illegal arrests,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a Newsom spokesperson. 
Agents arrested about 10 people at the Home Depot in Sacramento on Thursday, according to Border Patrol. 
In a video shared by KCRA, the NBC affiliate in Sacramento, a woman identified as Andrea Castillo can be heard shouting, “Leave him alone! He’s a U.S. citizen!” as masked agents chase a man running across a parking lot. An agent wearing a mask momentarily turns and points a can of mace at the person filming the video. Another armed man, in a full-face mask and wearing a green vest labeled only “police,” could be seen joining in the chase. Castillo continues shouting, “He’s my husband.” 
Five men surround the man, who is face-down on the blacktop, while screaming at the person filming the video to stay back. “His brother is a Marine Corps officer,” she shouts while several more armed and masked men join in on the arrest. “Stand back or you will be maced,” another agent screams at her. The woman filming asks one of the agents for his badge number, and he responds: “Google me.” 
Another photo shared to social media shows the man — identified in media reports as Jose Castillo — being arrested with a badly stained face, presumably from mace, and what appears to be a bruise under his left eye. His wife told KCRA he is a U.S. citizen. The Border Patrol said he slashed one of their tires in the Home Depot parking lot. 


The Mexican government interviewed 330 Mexican nationals who were arrested by immigration officials in Los Angeles between June 6 and July 6, finding more than half had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade. One-third had lived here for more than 20 years, and one-third had U.S.-born children, according to the Mexican Consulate of Los Angeles. 
The vast majority of those arrested were employed in working-class labor-intensive jobs, with 16.4% working at a car wash, 13.3% in construction, 13% had a factory job, and 11.5% worked as landscapers. 
In a motion to dismiss the Kern County lawsuit, the federal government argued agents are using a variety of factors, and not just a person’s skin color, when considering immigration stops, including the type of haircut a person has. 
“There are a number of factors Border Patrol can consider in assessing reasonable suspicion, including the characteristic appearance of persons who live in Mexico, such as the mode of dress and haircut,” the federal government wrote in their motion to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California on behalf of the United Farm Workers.
The government also said in the court filings that agents are considering a “totality of the circumstances, including the agent’s training and experience,” and prior surveillance of locations known to agents as places where undocumented workers congregate. 
The  Border Patrol also issued new guidelines to agents, the government said, to provide detainees with access to legal counsel before they sign “voluntary removal” orders, after being accused of using coercive tactics like brandishing their guns when someone asked to see an immigration judge.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071725-Sacremento-Raid-HA-REUTERS-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-18 09:08:32.412053

Viewers and listeners across Pennsylvania are now seeing and hearing new announcements accompanying their favorite public broadcasting programs.
Public media organizations in the commonwealth, like central Pennsylvania’s WITF, place banners on their main web pages reading, “Call your Representative today to help protect the future of local public media,” as they now face an uncertain future. 
The U.S. Senate passed a bill Thursday to eliminate $9 billion in foreign aid and federal funding for public broadcasting that it had previously allocated, putting $1.1 billion in jeopardy for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The measure passed the House shortly after midnight Friday.

More than 20 public radio and television stations in the commonwealth will be impacted.
“These funds support vital services — educational programming, local journalism and public safety — in regions like Central Pennsylvania,” WITF CEO Ron Hetrick told LNP/Lancaster Online (WITF and LNP share a parent company). 
President Donald Trump has defended the decision, writing that public broadcasting “spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news’,” in a statement in May.
Pennsylvania’s two U.S. Senators took different stances. Republican Dave McCormick voted in favor of backing the Trump administration’s efforts to defund public media.
Democrat John Fetterman voted against the bill alongside all of his fellow Democrats. 
“Mr. Rogers, a Pittsburgh icon, taught us kindness and empathy. My wife, Gisele, learned English watching PBS, where Big Bird and Elmo have educated generations of American kids. As a father, it’s personal, and I can’t understand why we’re even considering taking away this programming for families across the nation,” he wrote in a statement to reporters.
Accusations of a liberal bias or “woke propaganda” are “sheer and total nonsense,” said Terry O’Reilly, president and chief executive officer of the Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corporation. PCPC operates National Public Radio (NPR) member station WESA and independent public radio station WYEP, an indie and classic rock music station. 
WESA does get complaints about its coverage from people on the left and right of the political spectrum, and O’Reilly values constructive conversations about the station’s coverage, he explained.

But after decades in journalism, “I can tell you that if you’re not getting complaints from both sides about the fact that you’re not covering them closely enough, you’re probably not working hard enough,” he said. 
Federal funding for the hundreds of nonprofit organizations is relatively meager in the U.S. compared to government funding for public media in other democratic countries. 
Two percent of NPR’s annual budget and 15% of Public Broadcasting Service’s (PBS) annual budget comes directly from federal grants. The funding amounted to .01% of the total government spending in 2022, which was less than 18 countries across the world, including the U.K. and Canada, according to the economic analysis firm Nordicity. 
Despite the small amount of federal funding public media receives in the U.S., this is not the first time it has come under fire, especially from Republican lawmakers, said Victor Pickard, professor of media policy and political economy at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, as well as Trump in his first term, attempted to defund NPR and PBS, but Congress halted their efforts.
The move reflects a historical trend, as well as Trump’s broader media strategy to discourage dissenting views, according to Pickard. 
Defunding public media was a “convenient” way for the administration to “weaponize any policy tool at their disposal to try to neutralize the press and rein them in and bully them into submission,” he said.
But Pickard argues the cutting initiative is not driven by public opinion on federal funding for public radio, which remains high among Democrats and Republicans, according to a survey conducted last week by The Harris Poll for NPR. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
National support is especially bipartisan when it comes to public radio emergency alerts. Three-quarters of Democrats and Republicans rely on them for public safety news, the report found. 
“I don’t think people were clamoring to defund public broadcasting,” Pickard said. “This is much more of an elite-driven agenda.”
Nearly 18% of NPR’s 1,000 member stations would stand to close if the federal government cuts off funding, according to a 2011 internal NPR report obtained by The New York Times. 
The individual effects of these cuts would largely depend on the media market, said Matt Jordan, head of the film production and media studies department at Penn State University. Larger areas, like Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, depend less on federal funds for their operating budgets, and also have bigger donor bases than rural stations, he explained.
Federal funding accounts for about 9% of WESA’s total operating budget. WESA’s largest funding source comes from individuals and institutions local to the Pittsburgh area, and O’Reilly believes donors will continue to stand by the station, should the cuts go into effect, he said.

“We don’t have any plan to make specific changes to programming, but we will have to face the fiscal realities of what does it take to operate without those federal funds,” according to O’Reilly.
“For public media to be sucked into the political maelstrom that is Washington these days is unfortunate, particularly because the greatest damage is going to be done in communities where it can be afforded the least,” O’Reilly added.
Representatives from WITF in Harrisburg, WVIA in Pittston and WHYY in Philadelphia did not respond to requests for comment.
Rural stations, who often derive 25% to 50% of their budget funds from federal monies, will be disproportionately hurt by the cuts, Pickard said. 
WPSU, for example, will be more heavily affected because 20% of its funding comes from the federal government, Jordan said. Penn State operates the State College-based organization, which also faces a 20% funding cut from the university. 
As a result of such financial pressures, the station has already begun layoffs, Jordan said, and local coverage will be spread thin. 
“There’ll be one or two people trying to do everything … what we’re losing is people hearing and reading about their own lived experience, and everything becomes much more nationalized,” he said.
When communities lose their community media institutions, they tend to turn more toward national news outlets or Facebook groups, Pickard said. This loss can reach wide-ranging areas of social life, incentivizing disinformation and political polarization, and leaving people vulnerable to local corruption, according to recent studies.
Areas that stand to lose the most funding throughout the state are already underserved by journalism because of growing news deserts caused by private equity firms buying up local newspapers, according to Jordan. 
Public media was established because a commercial media system is unlikely to generate “the things that democracy needs but the market is unlikely to provide,” including service to poor communities and programming that doesn’t attract advertisements, Pickard said.
“Most democracies on the planet take this to heart, and that’s why they fund robust public broadcasting systems, because they understand that this market failure will prevent commercial media from ever providing all society’s information and communication needs.”

(Photo by Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)President Donald Trump has nominated Louisiana state school board member Paul Hollis to run the U.S. Mint, which is responsible for producing American coin money. 
“It’s been a life’s dream to have this opportunity,” said Hollis, who started studying coins as a child and works as a rare coin dealer professionally. 
The Mandeville Republican described himself as a numismatist, someone who intensely studies the history and manufacturing of coins. 

After graduating from LSU in 1994, Hollis spent a decade working for Blanchard and Co., a rare coin and precious metals firm in New Orleans. He eventually started his own rare coin business and, in 2011, published a book, “American Numismatist,” which explored the nation’s coin production through history. 
“I don’t think there is anybody better qualified than me” to run the U.S. Mint, Hollis said in an interview Thursday. 
His appointment requires U.S. Senate confirmation, and he expects a hearing to be scheduled in the next two months. The Mint director reports to the U.S. Treasury secretary and serves a five-year term. 
In the job, Hollis would oversee six manufacturing plants, where American coins and honorary medals are made, as well as the Mint’s 500 law enforcement agents. The director is also in charge of the U.S. government’s gold reserve in Kentucky, known as Fort Knox. 
Kristie McNally currently has served as interim U.S. Mint director since Ventris Gibson, the appointee of former President Joe Biden, stepped down from the role at Trump’s request in March.
Since 2024, Hollis has represented District 1 on the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which includes St. Tammany and portions of Jefferson, Orleans and Tangipahoa parishes. He previously served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 2012-23. 

Hollis will have to resign his state school board seat to take the Mint director job, but he isn’t sure when he will step down yet. His departure will likely be followed by the interim appointment of a new school board member by Gov. Jeff Landry and then a special election to fill the seat permanently. 

Hollis said he reached out to President Donald Trump and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton, ahead of the 2024 election to express interest in becoming the Mint director if Trump won a second term. Johnson and Hollis served in the Louisiana House together and are friends, Hollis said. 
Assuming he receives Senate confirmation, Hollis said he is most excited about helping the U.S. government celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence next year, which will come with a new batch of coins. 

He will also assist with the phasing out of the penny. The Mint is expected to stop producing one-cent coins in early 2026. 
Hollis said his favorite coin is the one that launched his interest in numismatics as a child. When he was seven, his grandmother gave him a $2.50 Indian Gold coin made in New Orleans during the Great Depression.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador and two Idaho county prosecuting attorneys agreed to not prosecute some Idaho doctors for referring patients out of state for abortions, under a new legal agreement published in federal court Thursday.
The settlement concludes a lawsuit that challenged a legal opinion from Idaho’s top legal official that said medical professionals who refer or prescribe abortion pills to pregnant patients across state lines are subject to criminal penalties under Idaho’s strict abortion ban.
Federal judge B. Lynn Winmill closed the lawsuit Thursday following the agreement, which protects a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate organization and two Idaho doctors.
‘End the ban:’ Idaho organizers start gathering signatures for abortion rights ballot initiative

In 2023, Labrador issued a legal opinion upon request from Idaho lawmaker Rep. Brent Crane, R-Nampa, on behalf of anti-abortion clinic Stanton Healthcare. In the opinion, Labrador said abortion pills are included in the state’s strict abortion ban law, States Newsroom reported. 
Soon, Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, and the two Idaho doctors sued over Labrador’s opinion. Labrador later recalled the opinion.
Idaho is surrounded by several states where abortion is legal, including Washington, Oregon and Montana. Historically, Idaho physicians referred patients to clinics in those states if they need care that is unavailable in Idaho, such as termination for medical reasons related to fetal anomalies or complications that put a pregnant patient’s health at risk.

 Labrador: ‘We do not have the authority to prosecute referrals for out-of-state services’

Under the recent agreement, Labrador along with two Idaho local prosecutors — Ada County Prosecuting Attorney Jan Bennetts and Valley County Prosecuting Attorney Brian Naugle — will not enforce Idaho’s abortion ban against the organization and two doctors for out-of-state referrals.
In a statement, Labrador said the agreement “avoids unnecessary litigation and protects Idaho taxpayers from further costs.”
Idaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.

“Idaho’s strong pro-life laws remain fully in effect, and we remain proud to defend the rights of mothers and their unborn children,” Labrador told the Idaho Capital Sun. “This settlement simply affirms what our office already made clear in court: We do not have the authority to prosecute referrals for out-of-state services.”
In December 2024, a federal appeals court panel upheld an injunction by a lower federal court in Idaho that blocked Labrador from prosecuting Idaho medical professionals for out-of-state abortion referrals, the Sun previously reported. 
In a statement, the Planned Parenthood affiliate CEO, Rebecca Gibron, said the agreement “brings much-needed clarity, compassion, and relief to both patients and providers.”
“It ensures that health care providers in Idaho can continue doing what they are trained and ethically bound to do — offer accurate information and help patients access the care they need, even if that care is out of state. In a state where abortion is banned, those referrals can be lifesaving,” she said.

The agreement blocks enforcing Idaho’s abortion law for “referring a woman across state lines to an abortion provider,” the federal judge wrote. 
That includes “informing about, counseling about, recommending, providing a referral for, scheduling an appointment for, informing about sources of funding for, or otherwise advising or assisting an individual in learning about or obtaining, an abortion …”
The ruling also protects that activity for out-of-state “consultation for abortion pills where that abortion will be performed or the out-of-state prescription will be filled outside the borders of Idaho where it is legal to obtain such abortion or prescription for abortion pills.”
The agreement does not have an end date.

(File photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)An Anne Arundel County police reserve officer was arrested Thursday and charged in federal court with threatening Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and her family.
Seth Jason, an Edgewater resident, was arrested early Thursday by U.S. Capitol Police and the Anne Arundel Police Department, according to a statement issued by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.
Jason faces one count each of influencing a federal official by threatening a family member, influencing a federal official by threat, interstate communications with a threat to kidnap or injure and anonymous telecommunications harassment, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday in federal court in the District of Columbia.
Federal investigators said Jason repeatedly threatened to assault and murder members of Greene’s family between Jan. 26, 2024, and Jan. 8, 2025.
Additionally, Jason is accused of making threats directly against Greene between Oct. 11, 2023, and Jan. 21, 2025. Prosecutors allege in the indictment that Jason made the threats by telephone and attempted to hide his identity.
Greene is a MAGA conservative and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump.
An investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police found the phone calls were made from various phone lines connected to studios and control rooms at Voice of America headquarters, where Jason had was a longtime employee. In eight calls made over 15 months, Jason threatened the use of firearms to kill Rep. Greene, her staff, and their families, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office.
Jason is represented by Annapolis attorney J. Dennis Murphy, according to online court records. Murphy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.
Anne Arundel County Police, in a statement, said Jason had served as a volunteer reserve agent since 2016. Reserve officers have no police authority and do not carry weapons. The department said Jason, following his arrest, is “no longer affiliated with” the department.

“At the end of the day, this is not just about expanding care,” said sponsor Sen. Lisa Boscola (D-Northampton). “This is about keeping our talent right here in Pennsylvania. Without this flexibility, counselors may look across the border for jobs in other states that have already joined the compact. … This helps keep us competitive and keeps Pennsylvania on a level playing field.”
The Senate sent the measure to the House Thursday. The bill’s companion HB668 passed the House in June.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Five Republicans opposed the Senate measure because they think the setup gives the compact commission that oversees multi-state licensing of providers – which includes representatives from all member states –  too much power.
One concern: the compact’s rules are automatically binding and supersede member states’ laws, at least initially. Member states’ legislatures can get rid of a rule if a majority passes laws to do so within four years.
Boscola noted the compact rules only would apply to counselors who’ve voluntarily obtained a multi-state certification.
The group would work like the others for nurses, doctors and physical therapists to which the commonwealth already belongs, she said.
“If this bill simply provided reciprocity and assurance of proper accreditation and licensing between states for licensed professional counselors, I would have supported it,” said state Sen. Dawn Keefer, (R-York/Cumberland), in an emailed statement. 
Keefer said Pennsylvania already provides limited reciprocity for counselors licensed in other states.
“If these processes are cumbersome or difficult, let’s fix them,” she said. “But creating an independent, national bureaucracy for professionals to navigate and taxpayers to fund is not the solution.”

Enabling legislation is identical in each of the member states, because it has to be, according to Jesse Monoski, executive director of the state Senate Consumer Protection & Professional Licensure Committee.
The commission expects to start taking applications for multi-state licenses this fall, Monoski said.
As for other interstate compacts for nurses, physicians and physical therapists, problems with the state’s background check system had prevented Pennsylvania-based professionals from getting multi-state credentials for years.

(Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE – Kilmar Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated in Tennessee for at least another week after a federal judge heard prosecutors’ arguments that he poses a flight risk and a danger to the community if released.
U.S. District Court Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr. said Wednesday he would make a decision as early as next week on the pretrial release of Abrego, a Maryland resident who was wrongly dispatched to a notorious prison in El Salvador as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
Abrego was brought to Nashville in June to face two criminal human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. The grand jury indictments against Abrego were brought even as his deportation case drew national attention, and after the Supreme Court ordered Trump administration officials to facilitate his return from El Salvador.
Abrego, 29, has pleaded not guilty to the Tennessee charges.
What would immediately happen to Abrego should Crenshaw order his pretrial release in Tennessee remains an open question.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, in a separate Maryland case centered on Abrego’s wrongful deportation, said they planned to take him into custody immediately.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
ICE officials said they may then send him to a “third country.”
Abrego, a Salvadoran national who entered the U.S. illegally nearly 15 years ago, has an active immigration case that includes an order barring U.S. officials from returning him to El Salvador due to fears that he could be the target of gang violence.
Wednesday’s hearing was the third in recent weeks to review the pretrial release of Abrego, who sat next to his attorneys in an orange jumpsuit for the hours-long hearing. His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, attended the hearing.
Last month, Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes ruled Abrego was not a flight risk or a community danger, setting certain conditions for his release that included ankle monitoring.
Holmes subsequently agreed to a request by Abrego’s attorneys to temporarily keep him detained while they sought assurances from the government that he would not be deported if released.
Crenshaw on Wednesday heard the prosecution’s appeal of Holmes’ release order.
The judge appeared, at times, skeptical of the government’s arguments to keep Abrego detained, including allegations that Abrego is a member of the notorious MS-13 gang. Crenshaw noted there is a high bar in federal court that evidence be “clear and convincing” to warrant pretrial detention.
“The proof on MS-13 in and of itself does not meet ‘clear and convincing,’” Crenshaw said.

(Photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined another challenge to President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday, aligning himself with 20 other states in a lawsuit against recent federal rules surrounding health coverage purchased via Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces.
The suit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, argues that a June 25 final rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would make health care harder to access under the ACA, especially for transgender people.
The rule, set to take effect Aug. 25, heightens eligibility requirements and narrows the open enrollment window for health plans purchased through state marketplaces. Some consumers who previously qualified for $0 premiums could possibly see new monthly charges on their health plans.
“We expect these actions will provide immediate premium relief to families who do not qualify for Federal premium subsidies and reduce the burden of improper ACA premium subsidy expenditures to the Federal taxpayer,” the rule reads.
Neronha lambasted the new rule as “unnecessary and irresponsible” in a statement Thursday. 
“We should be making it easier, not harder, for Americans to obtain health care coverage,” Neronha wrote. “And yet, this Administration is intent on making life harder for everyday Americans while lining the pockets of the ultra-rich.” 
The lawsuit is seeking a preliminary injunction to block the law from becoming active before the Aug. 25 start date. The lawsuit is co-led by Attorneys General Rob Bonta of California, Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, and Matthew Platkin of New Jersey.
Signed onto the suit are attorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, plus the governor of Pennsylvania.
Neronha performed a hat trick this week, joining three lawsuits against the Trump administration across four days. On Monday, Neronha co-led a case filed in Rhode Island over education funding. On Wednesday the AG allied himself with a blue state coalition hoping to undo cuts to a disaster preparedness program. Overall, Neronha has joined or co-led 28 lawsuits against the Trump administration since January.  
The lawsuit argues that the final rule would cause up to 1.8 million people to lose their health insurance, and it would increase premiums, copays and deductibles for millions more.
“We know millions are already expected to lose health coverage under the President’s recent legislation, which cuts $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next 10 years,” Neronha added. “Now, with this final rule, over a million more could be one medical emergency away from bankruptcy.” 
According to Neronha’s office, health insurer HealthSource RI estimates the rule would reduce enrollment in the Ocean State by 3%, or about 1,380 people.
Removing treatment options for transgender people
The CMS rule also strikes drug therapies like hormone or puberty blockers used in gender transition-related care from the federal roster of essential health benefits. That would mean states who decide to subsidize such treatments would need to rely on their own coffers, rather than federal ones, if they mandate coverage among state health plans. These drugs fell under the banner of gender-affirming care in the Biden years, but the new CMS ruling prefers the label “specified sex-trait modification procedure” and distinguishes such medication from other non-pharmaceutical or non-surgical therapies.
The lawsuit argues that the final rule’s “sweeping changes” will remove “States’ substantial autonomy to set their own policies” when it comes to health care marketplaces. It additionally argues that the “abrupt decision to exclude services … on the very basis of gender identity is highly disruptive” and will disproportionately affect transgender and gender non-conforming people. 
“Notably, the only individuals who might seek services with the express purpose of aligning their gender identity and their body, and their gender identity differs from their sex, are transgender individuals,” the lawsuit reads, quoting language used in the federal law. 
An hour after the attorneys general announced their lawsuit, CMS issued its own press release. Although not specifically in response to the lawsuit, the agency defended imminent changes to ACA plans as measures that will “crush fraud, waste, and abuse in America’s healthcare programs.” 
The agency wrote that a recent software-led analysis of historical enrollment data found that, in 2024, nearly 2.8 million Americans were improperly enrolled in multiple public insurance programs, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans purchased on ACA marketplaces. The agency says ending duplicate enrollments could save approximately $14 billion annually in taxpayer spending.
“The Biden Administration struggled to ensure that individuals were only enrolled in the single Medicaid or Exchange plan for which they were eligible, that ends today,” CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “CMS is restarting these important checks to follow federal law. We are going to work with states to identify individuals enrolled in multiple programs and fix the duplicate enrollment problem to save taxpayers billions of dollars, while minimizing inappropriate coverage loss.”

On July 1, the start of a new fiscal year for most educational institutions, many school districts anticipated receiving a chunk of federal funding that helps with various programs. That check, so to speak, isn’t in the mail.
As of Thursday, the Trump administration was still sitting on $6.8 billion in authorized and approved Congressional funding for public education, but not released because the Office of Management and Budget is still reviewing the funds. The money has a broad array of programming, from after-school funding for English-learning language, to support for migrant education. For Montana, it means more than $11 million in funding remains in limbo.
OMB Director Russ Vought has not said if and when those funds will be released.
“The department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spend in accordance with the President’s priorities and the department’s statutory responsibilities,” Vought said in a letter.
The Montana Department of Public Instruction said it has been constant communication with districts about funding updates, and told the Daily Montanan it remains hopeful that the funds will be released. In fact, in a July 2 letter that Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction shared with other state education officials from Vought, it said some delayed funding had already been released in other areas, for example funding that helps students with disabilities or those who are homeless.
On Wednesday, though, a group of Republican U.S. Senators joined some Democratic members of Congress and called on the Trump administration to release the funds, which had been promised to districts. Montana’s two U.S. Senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, both Republicans, were not among the GOP members who signed onto the letter.
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, chairwoman of the broader Senate Appropriations Committee, signed onto the letter, along with: Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Boozman of Arkansas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and both Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice of West Virginia.
“The decision to withhold this funding is contrary to President Trump’s goal of returning K-12 education to the states,” the senators wrote. “This funding goes directly to states and local school districts, where local leaders decide how this funding is spent, because as we know, local communities know how to best serve students and families.”
The Office of Management and Budget did not respond to requests for comment when contacted by States Newsroom, the parent organization of the Daily Montanan, on Wednesday.
However, Rep. Troy Downing, a Republican representing Montana’s Second Congressional District, said he’s aware of the situation, monitoring and working with state officials to get the funding in place.
“As a former research scientist and teacher, I take the issue of education very seriously. My team and I are in contact with Montana OPI and will continue to seek additional clarity for Montana’s educators as the OMB scrutinizes this funding,” Downing said.
The left-leaning policy center and think tank, New America, analyzed the funds and found that they stand to hurt districts represented by Republicans more than Democrats.
“School districts represented by Republicans in Congress will lose more per-pupil dollars. Across these four programs, the average school district represented by a Republican stands to lose 1.6 times as much funding per pupil as the average school district represented by a Democrat. The 100 school districts that would see the worst losses per pupil are heavily concentrated in Republican-represented Congressional districts (91, compared with nine in Democrat-represented Congressional districts),” the analysis said.
New America’s analysis also showed an average-sized school district in America would lose around $220,000, but that number is likely far smaller in Montana.
“Districts serving high-poverty student populations (those where over 25 percent of children live in poverty) will lose over five times as much funding per pupil as low-poverty school districts (those where fewer than 10 percent of children live in poverty). The 100 school districts facing the biggest cuts on a per-pupil basis have an average child poverty rate of 24.4 percent, much higher than the national average of 15.3 percent,” the report said.
Two large Montana school districts were contacted for this story this week by the Daily Montanan. Both said they were still evaluating the situation, hopeful the funding would come through, and weren’t ready to discuss what a funding loss this close to the start of the new school year might mean for them.
McKenna Gregg, Communications and Policy Advisor for Montana’s OPI, said education leaders throughout the country weren’t given advance notice about the funding delay, so state officials were as surprised as many local districts which are counting on the fund.
Gregg said that OPI has not started putting together advice or contingency plans for the funding yet, but remains open to helping districts.
“At this time, we are hopeful that the timely release of funds will help mitigate any disruptions,” she said.
While many local school districts have already set their budgets for the upcoming 2025-’26 school year, Gregg said budgets aren’t required to be finalized until the first Tuesday in September, meaning even if the funding is delayed, budgets could be adjusted.
“OPI will continue to support districts throughout this process and will keep them informed as new information becomes available. We remain committed to assisting districts in navigating any challenges that arise. Should specific federal funding streams not become available, we will evaluate how to best support districts on a case-by-case basis, but we cannot speculate at this time,” Gregg said.
The Daily Montanan also reached out to Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Republican who represents Montana’s First Congressional district, but had received no response. Questions to Zinke included whether he was concerned about the delay and what his office might be doing to restore the funding.
States Newsroom D.C. Capitol reporter Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.

(Photo contributed by Aaron Lehman)Farmers on a virtual town hall with Iowa Farmers Union talked Thursday about the strong partnership they have had with U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the fears they have about the programs being cut in federal budgets. 
Programs from USDA have helped farmers to diversify their operations, find consistent markets and implement practices that protect water quality and build soil health, though some could be trimmed or cut by congressional budgets. 
According to a Politico analysis of the president’s budget proposal, USDA could see a near $7 billion budget reduction for fiscal year 2026, depending on how closely U.S. lawmakers follow the proposal. The same analysis noted significant cuts to Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service and Rural Development.

Seth Watkins of Pinhook Farm near Clarinda said he has tried to put himself “in the other person’s shoes” to understand the federal budget cuts and said he “appreciate(s)” that elected officials are working to trim down the nation’s $36.6 trillion in debt. 
“I guess what worries me, speaking from my experience as a farmer, is I don’t want to see us be … a penny wise and a pound foolish,” Watkins said. 
He said it’s especially challenging for him to see the programs that protect water or create opportunities for young farmers on the chopping block. 
Watkins, who raises cattle, sheep and honey bees, said many of the USDA agencies provide technical support to farmers in addition to funding opportunities. 
Watkins said the Natural Resources Conservation Service especially was already “operating on the shoestring” budget, which has made it difficult to get help with engineering a pond or waterway, for example, that will stand up to the significant weather events that have become the norm. 
“As farmers, we’re practical – we want to do the right thing, but we need that help,” Watkins said. 
Ellen Walsh-Rosmann runs Rosmann Family Farms near Harlan with her husband and in-laws, where they raise cattle, hogs, “grain and such.” 
Walsh-Rosmann said at the town hall that she previously utilized the Local Food for Schools and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs with USDA to “deliver pallets” worth of food products to food hubs, which were then distributed to local schools and food banks. 
She said this program offered “guaranteed sales” and a scalable distribution model, as opposed to selling beef “a pound at a time” via a direct-to-consumer model. 
The programs, which were established during the pandemic under the Commodity Credit Corporation, were canceled in March and farmers and institutions lost an estimated $11.3 million in federal funding for the purchase of local foods in 2025. 
Walsh-Rosmann said the program was a “lot easier” for her operation, as compared to direct sales, and also meant that food banks and schools were able to serve her organic beef. 
“It was just really disheartening, because there was nothing wrong,” Walsh-Rosmann said of the program. “We also know that for every dollar that was spent in that program, $4 were going back into our local economies, which you can’t say that about many government subsidized programs.” 
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship piloted a similar program to help schools and food banks purchase local food. 
The Legislature extended the Choose Iowa purchasing program for food banks, but the school program is still in the pilot phase. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Wednesday at the Iowa Hunger Summit he hoped to expand the number of schools participating in the pilot for the upcoming year.
Another farmer on the town hall call Thursday said USDA offices need to be funded and staffed to adequately support young farmers who might have a business model “different than what’s common in the county.” 
Anna Hankins of Over the Moon Farm in Coggon said because the barriers to entry for young farmers, like herself, are “really, really high,” many young farmers are turning to niche markets or specialty crops they can grow with fewer resources and smaller plots of land. 
Hankins said she has been able to use the same USDA programs her more traditional neighbors might be using, but in a way that works for her meat and cut flower operation. 
“It takes more legwork, and it’s really, really important for beginning farmers like myself and others that come after us to make sure that we have a USDA that is well funded, that has enough support in our local offices to make it possible for beginning farmers like myself,” Hankins said. 
The farmers on the call said they regularly reach out to their elected representatives about these issues, and encourage their neighbors to as well, as lawmakers finalize budgets for the year. 
“Farmers really rely on a robust, honest, pragmatic partnership, a farmer-public partnership to make sure that our family farms can thrive, to make sure that we can implement practices that contribute to a healthy landscape, and to thriving rural communities,” Aaron Lehman Iowa Farmers Union President said in closing. “Without that partnership, it will only lead to greater consolidation, fewer family farms, and deteriorating local communities.”

A new round of flooding occurred the afternoon of Thursday, July 17. (Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)More flooding in Ruidoso on Thursday afternoon required three swiftwater rescues, including of a person trapped inside a trailer, according to the National Weather Service.
The flooding is just the latest round to hit the beleaguered village of Ruidoso and surrounding area since late last week, when floods swept three people, including two children, away from a mobile home park. They were later found dead. 
According to National Weather Service reports, emergency managers and members of the public reported 10 flash flood impacts in roughly an hour between 12:50 p.m. and 1:43 p.m. on Thursday. 
‘Expecting it to be ugly,’ Ruidoso braces for new round of potential floods

That includes three swiftwater rescues, three road closures and other problems, according to the National Weather Service. One of the rescues occurred for a person “trapped in trailer” just south of town, and south of the Rio Ruidoso, according to the service. 
Post-fire flooding has continued to hamper recovery from the South Fork and Salt fires that burned more than 1,000 structures in the Ruidoso area last summer. After the fires, monsoon rains fall on hydrophobic soil sitting on fire-scorched mountainsides, where there is little vegetation to hold back floods or debris flows. 
Public safety alerts around 1 p.m. from the village noted that “rapidly rising floodwaters” threatened drivers along US Highway 70. The village also closed it for about an hour.
In addition to the swiftwater rescues and highway closure, emergency managers reported that the Cherokee Mobile Home Park was flooded and inaccessible.
