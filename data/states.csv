It has a young population and large family sizes. It boasts countless family-friendly events and attractions. And family values are — allegedly — at the center of its lawmakers’ decisions.
Unfortunately, our representatives are currently in the process of advancing a federal bill that would harm the most vulnerable families in our state. Republicans’ Big Beautiful Bill proposes scaling back key tax credits on which low-income families rely to make ends meet. But it’s not too late — while the bill passed in the U.S. House, our senators now have the opportunity to make changes and protect these vital tax credits.
I’m a sociologist at the University of Utah. I have spent my career examining how policies that were never really intended to improve health do so nevertheless. These include things like food assistance, minimum wage increases, and tax credits. We typically think about how these policies affect our wallets, but they also affect our bodies. They influence whether we can afford safe housing, adequate diets, regular health care, and other basic needs that shape our physical as well as mental health.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a popular, bipartisan program that puts much-needed cash back into the pockets of working families, but it also improves their health. Research has shown that moms who received the full EITC have better prenatal care, birth outcomes, and mental health compared to moms who did not. And children in households who received the full EITC are less likely than non-recipients to experience food insecurity, behavioral health problems, obesity, and childhood abuse and neglect.
But this bill would require families to “pre-certify” the children they claim each tax year. Already, approximately 1 in 5 families who are eligible for the EITC miss out because it’s too difficult to file for it, and “pre-certification” is another unnecessary piece of red tape that will deter even more families.
Meanwhile, the Child Tax Credit, which currently provides up to $2,000 per child, has also been shown to have significant health benefits for both parents and children. The Child Tax Credit improves well-being in similar ways to the EITC by giving families’ more financial breathing room.
Proposed changes to the CTC in this bill would leave many families behind. First, it would make millions of U.S. citizen children ineligible if at least one or both their parents are not U.S. citizens. Secondly, estimates project that 163,000 kids statewide would earn less than the full CTC because their parents’ income is too low, meaning that families with the most need won’t get the full amount. In my own Congressional district alone, UT-01, a total of 33,000 kids would be left behind.
Utah state legislators have already expressed some concern about the local impact of these restrictions, which function as a sort of marriage penalty and would hit many active-duty and veteran service members especially hard.
Some argue that cutting these tax credits is fine because honest work is enough for Americans to get by. But we know this is not the case for most families. My personal experience, which motivates my own research, corroborates this.
Growing up, my father worked tirelessly to provide a decent standard of living for our family through a combination of long hours, manual labor, and sheer will. By the time I was in middle school, it had begun to take its toll; the downturn in his health was rapid. My mother’s physical and mental health likewise began to suffer as she set to filling the economic gap that had opened with my dad’s failing health. This strain marred my childhood and undoubtedly contributed to parents’ early deaths at the ages of 58 and 60.
Utah is a place that promotes the ideal that “when families win, we all win — economically as well as socially.” Our elected officials, and the people who voted them in, should keep in mind the impact of these critical programs in the service of that family-friendly agenda and the health of Utah families",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sensoryexercises-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 13:10:14.663101

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.

Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


–  – Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Five and a half years after nurses launched a campaign to restore union representation at UW Health, the state’s highest court ruled Friday that the Madison-based hospital system has no obligation to collectively bargain with employees.
Act 10, the 2011 state law that stripped most union rights from public employees, also removed legal guarantees of union representation for University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority’s employees, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for a unanimous Court.
“When we examine the statutory language along with the statutory history, it is clear that Act 10 ended the collective bargaining requirements formerly placed on the Authority,” Hagedorn wrote.
The Court rejected the argument from Service Employees International Union (SEIU) that with the Act 10 changes, the hospital authority as a corporation fit the definition of “employer” under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act.
The Peace Act defines an employee as anyone working for hire other than an independent contractor and an employer as a person — including partnerships, corporations and some other legal entities — that engages the services of an employee.
The hospital authority doesn’t automatically meet that definition, however, Hagedorn wrote.
The hospital system was spun off from the University of Wisconsin in 1996 into a new “public body corporate and politic,” the UW Hospital and Clinics Authority. The hospital system’s employees were state employees represented by unions and with collective bargaining rights under Wisconsin’s state employment relations law.
The hospital authority “is not defined as a corporation,” Hagadorn wrote, “it is a ‘public body corporate and politic.’” He cited the Peace Act’s definition of “employer” that states the term does not include “the state or any political subdivision thereof.”
The 1996 law creating the new hospital authority removed its employees from the state employment relations law and added language specifying that the hospital authority was an employer under the Peace Act.
Act 10 changed that, Hagedorn wrote — repealing the hospital authority’s collective bargaining duty that was in the 1996 law as well as all other references to collective bargaining.
“In sum, Act 10 purged references to the Peace Act from the Authority Statute,” Hagedorn wrote.
“When it created the Authority, the legislature added the Authority as an employer under the Peace Act and imposed numerous other collective bargaining provisions. In Act 10, the legislature eliminated the Authority as a covered employer along with other collective bargaining requirements. We therefore hold that the Authority is no longer covered by the Peace Act and is not required to collectively bargain under the Peace Act.”
Friday’s ruling was the final stop for a case that started in September 2022. In an agreement brokered to avert a planned three-day strike by nurses demanding union recognition at UW Health, the hospital system and SEIU agreed to a joint petition to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC).
In the petition, the union argued that the hospital should be considered an employer under the Peace Act, while UW Health argued that Act 10 eliminated collective bargaining at the hospital system. WERC sided with UW Health, and Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost subsequently affirmed the employment commission’s conclusion.

Taylor. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a preliminary victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
In Pride month, transgender Marylanders reflect on strengths, weaknesses, of state protections

“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose—guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity.”

In a brisk nine-page ruling, the Superior Court judge concluded that the Milton lawsuit was very similar to a previous bundle of suits fighting the multi-family housing law and should be dismissed.
The post Superior Court tosses Milton taxpayer suit against MBTA Communities law appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OPPONENTS OF A PLAN to rezone the affluent Boston suburb of Milton spent weeks urging town voters and officials to pump the brakes while a court considered a suit challenging the MBTA Communities housing law. 
All the way up to a special Town Meeting in mid-June, a set of residents, planning board members, and warrant committee members tried to hold off a proposal that would allow for the potential to add 25 percent more total housing units, required by the state because of Milton’s proximity to public transit. Less than 10 days after Town Meeting voters moved ahead with a plan to comply anyway, Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea offered another firm rebuke to the naysayers.  
The 16 taxpayers who brought suit to halt local enforcement of the controversial MBTA Communities multi-family housing law lacked standing, Gildea found. The plaintiffs also did not convince the court that the state’s designation of the town as a “rapid transit community” was unreasonable, Gildea wrote in a crisp nine-page opinion handed down on June 26. 
He rejected the taxpayers’ request for an injunction and granted the state housing office’s motion to dismiss the suit. 
The conclusions Gildea reached in a June 6 order considering a bundle of town complaints about the MBTA Communities law “apply equally here,” he wrote, reiterating that the housing law is not an unfunded mandate. The taxpayers offered only speculative costs that they would have to bear if the town complied, Gildea said. The MBTA Communities law lays the groundwork for but does not require new construction, and Milton always has the option of pursuing state grants that already exist to fund infrastructure associated with new housing, he added. 
As to the third-rail of the entire Milton debate – whether the quaint Mattapan High-Speed Trolley should count as “rapid transit” in the same way that MBTA subway lines or the Silver Line bus does – Gildea needed barely 100 words to dispense with the matter. 
In the brief MBTA Communities statute, lawmakers made no mention of the Mattapan trolley, which the taxpayers argued meant that Milton is not a rapid transit community. Rather, they said, their more distant proximity to commuter rail or Red Line subway service should make them an “adjacent community.” That designation would require rezoning for only 10 percent more units – even less than the 15 percent required for commuter rail communities. 
Gildea agreed with the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities that “the mere use of a ‘rapid transit’ category is not arbitrary and capricious simply because that category is not found in [the law],” he wrote. The specific language of an “adjacent community” is also not found in the law, he added. 
The way that the housing office created its four community categories applied its “substantive expertise” to tailor the regulations to fit the real-word conditions of each MBTA community, Gildea said, just as the state Supreme Judicial Court ordered in January. 
“For a second time this month, the courts affirmed the intent of the MBTA Communities Law, which is to increase housing production to address one of the greatest challenges facing the people of Massachusetts – high costs,” said Ed Augustus, secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, in a statement Friday. He noted that nearly 80 percent of MBTA Communities “have already said yes to multifamily housing to bring down costs for all residents, and we continue to work closely with communities that have yet to do so.”  
As the judge tasked with overseeing the many MBTA Communities lawsuits, Gildea’s Thursday ruling might yet be appealed but severely narrows the likelihood that any of the other suits before him will be positively received at the Superior Court level. As lawmakers suggested during the Milton debate, this dispute may now rest in the hands of the same legislators who signed off on the sweeping policy change in the first place.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Americans have long enjoyed the practical and romantic aspects of the West. The West has provided us with minerals, timber, energy and space to roam freely for generations. We have a wonderful asset in the West — our public lands — which are owned by the people of the United States and held in trust for us by the federal government. Anybody can go out there and recreate, for free, any time, and that is a good thing for all of us.
Congress previously recognized the value of the public lands, declaring that these lands would remain in public ownership in an act known as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management are each commissioned in FLPMA to allow a variety of uses on their managed lands. Most of the public land in the West is thus managed under a nonexclusive shared-use arrangement. Lands for grazing, mining and logging — or all three — typically remain open to the public for hiking, hunting and camping.
Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill

“Multiple use” is defined as “management of the public lands and their various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people.” FLPMA addresses topics such as land use planning, land acquisition, fees and payments, administration of federal land, range management, and rights-of-way on federal land. Local communities are empowered to ask for transfers to accommodate growth patterns.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has proposed significant changes to the manner in which public lands are sold. He seeks congressional action to bypass FLPMA and its requirements, instead claiming that the “housing crisis” can be eased if only the federal government will sell off millions of acres of public land to developers. That’s nonsense, and those proposals have drawn significant criticism for good reasons.
Previous homestead acts have done much to foster private land ownership in the U.S. Those effects are undeniably positive. But Sen. Lee’s proposal isn’t a homestead act, and it fails to take into account that the land in the West which is capable of human habitation has by and large already been claimed. There’s little water, even less infrastructure and where those shortfalls can be blunted, the cost of developing housing in those locations is significantly higher than in already settled areas. Think of the expense of drilling (and maintaining) a fresh water well for each home, along with the needs for electricity, telecommunications, solid and liquid waste, and you can easily determine that further developing wild land for housing results in costs that can’t be recovered.
Further, Sen. Lee’s proposals have not been subjected to hearings or formal input as he seeks to put them in the One Big Beautiful (budget reconciliation) Bill currently under consideration in Congress. While it’s true that the Senate parliamentarian ruled the Lee Amendment out of order with respect to that bill, Sen. Lee continues to push his proposal in the media, and in Congress. Senators Thune and Rounds have not declared their positions on his proposal to my knowledge. While maps show that South Dakota does not have any parcels for sale, Lee’s original proposal put parcels in the Wyoming Black Hills on the chopping block. Lee has since said he would alter the proposal to include only Bureau of Land Management land within 5 miles of a population center and exempt U.S. Forest Service lands altogether.
Americans need space to be free, and fortunately we have it still. We need wild spaces in America to allow for the continuation of the frontier spirit that made us who we are as a people.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court unexpectedly announced it will not rule on Louisiana’s congressional redistricting case this term, instead scheduling it for further arguments in the fall. 
The case, Callais v. Louisiana, involves non-Black voters who sued over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. Justices said they will issue an order specifying additional questions it wants addressed before they revisit the case later this year. 
“Although we hoped for a decision this term, we welcome a further opportunity to present argument to the Court regarding the state’s impossible task of complying with the Court’s voting precedents,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement to the Illuminator.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative who has served on the court since 1991 when he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, issued a dissenting statement, arguing the court has a responsibility to act promptly. 
By delaying a decision, which isn’t likely to come until next spring, the court all but ensured a new congressional map, if necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election and until the 2030 census cycle is underway.

“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Those were my mother’s words to me as we stood in the hallway of my parents’ home in Leland in 2008. At the time, I was a 20-year-old college student, home that weekend from Ole Miss.
My mother had sensed that I had been growing distant, reluctant to talk to her on the phone, and pulling away generally from my family. She knew — as mothers often know — that to become fully myself I thought I needed to leave my family behind. I thought they wouldn’t understand.
She stopped me in the hallway and asked what seemed like a simple question: “Eric, are you gay?” In the ensuing conversation, I officially came out to my mother, who like my father, brother and sister, had known all along. Though she was not surprised by the confirmed knowledge of her middle child being gay, what she said next surprised me. “I don’t want you to have a hard life.”
I recoiled from her words at that moment. I did not appreciate the link she made between me being gay and my life being harder as a result. Knowing her work in healthcare, I did not appreciate what I assumed was her subtle link between being gay and adverse health outcomes. I wanted to believe then — as I still do now — that to be gay does not immediately equate a harder life. I wasn’t naive enough to think that life wasn’t hard, but I believed in my bones that the fact of one’s sexuality shouldn’t be a primary reason for it. I believed that to be gay was no different than one’s eye color or height: an inescapable and unavoidable biological fact.

Since that 2008 conversation, living an “out” life seems to have gotten a bit easier as reflected in national numbers. A 2024 Gallup poll found that nearly one in 10 Americans identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. All in all, in the 12 years that Gallup has tracked LGBTQ+ identification in the United States, the rate of self-identification has nearly tripled.
While there are various explanations for this statistical change, many queer people prior to this administration believed our lives would not be made harder by being who we are and living our lives openly and authentically.
These national numbers reverberate locally. Recent numbers indicate that there are 93,300 LGBTQ+ adults in Mississippi, around 4.1% of the state’s total population. Further, despite a history of exclusion, LGBTQ+ folks in Mississippi raise and sustain families.
In a 2022 article for Mississippi Today, Nigel Dent related how “the percentage of same-sex parents in Mississippi is higher than the nation at 25.7% in Mississippi versus 17.2% nationally.” In 2022, Mississippi had the nation’s highest rate of same-sex couples raising children, an inversion of statistical realities that often place our state at the bottom of lists. The unexpected fact that same-sex couples in Mississippi are raising families at such rates should be a banner of pride for our state.
Mississippi is not an anomaly in the South. In 2023, the Williams Institute found that 35.9% of all of those who identify as LGBT (the center’s chosen acronym), more than five million people, live in the U.S. Southeast, more than any other region in the country. Chances are most Southerners today know someone who is lesbian or gay or bisexual or transgender. Beyond those of us who are LGBTQ+ in Mississippi, many of us have brothers or sons, sisters or daughters, mothers or fathers, cousins or chosen kin, who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer.
LGBTQ+ Mississippians are woven into the fabric of many of our daily lives, contributing to our economy, our culture, our sense of place, our ideas of community, family and home. The rainbow connection we create is being felt across the state.
In Jackson, Mississippi Capital City Pride hosts year-round events covering the state’s queer history and culture and the Jack Myers house opened in 2024 as the first LGBTQIA+ shelter in Mississippi. Since 2008, Tupelo has hosted a Pride parade as does the Biloxi-based Gulf Coast Association of Pride.
College towns such as Hattiesburg (Pine Belt Pride), Oxford (Oxford Pride), and Starkville (Starkville Pride) also host annual pride events and year-round programming. I attended this year’s Oxford Pride, where hundreds marched in full technicolor despite changing political dynamics and institutional support. In Water Valley, Violet Valley Bookstore is one of the nation’s most revered LGBTQ+ independent bookstores and is annually featured in a graphic from Oprah Daily.
Across many fields and walks of life, we are shaping our home state, creating and making the lives of all Mississippians better, easier, more beautiful and fulfilling. Why would we want to listen to rhetoric and support policy that makes the lives of any group of Mississippians harder? Why would we want to make the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians harder? Why would you want to make your son’s or your daughter’s or your friend’s or your co-worker’s life harder? What purpose does that serve? Whose purposes does it serve?
Today politicians across the country feel emboldened to advocate to make my life and the lives of folks like me harder in this politically divisive moment. Political leaders are positioning themselves to pass legislation that would strip away rights already codified and set a foundation for further intrusion into the lives and freedoms of LGBTQ+ Americans.
The following is but a sampling of our current moment: on March 8, 2025, Donald Trump posted a crossed-out pink triangle on his Truth Social, evoking the Nazi persecution of gay men. Republican leaders in five states—Michigan, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota—have suggested the Supreme Court overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage. Idaho and North Dakota have already passed such legislation. Four additional states—Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas—have introduced legislation that would create a separate category of legal marriage called “covenant marriage,” that could only take place between a man and a woman.
On June 10, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the US, approved a resolution calling for the overturning of Obergefell as they deem it “def[ies] God’s design for marriage and family.”
Executive orders have forced the National Park Service to remove “transgender” and “queer” from the Stonewall monument website irrespective of any consideration of the historic facts pertaining to that site. Transgender flags are no longer allowed at Stonewall “officially,” though visitors continue to bring trans flags to leave at the site.
With the fate of Medicaid in limbo, some insurance companies now feel comfortable denying coverage for PrEP, or Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, a routine treatment that significantly lessens one’s risk of contracting HIV. With the defunding of the federal USAID and PEPFAR in the balance, access to HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention protocols has been interrupted globally.
As with any virus, HIV does not discriminate based upon gender or sexual identity, and an HIV diagnosis, while no longer fatal for most in the United States, does indeed make life more difficult for whoever it impacts.
Under the new leadership of Kristi Noem, Homeland Security has quietly moved to eliminate a ban on surveillance based on sexual orientation and gender identity leading many to speculate that the agency will now increase targeted surveillance on gender and sexual minorities.
Finally, executive orders, policy reversals and legislation targeting trans Americans are too many for one list to capture. Regarding the executive order against trans people serving in the US Military and using the pronouns of their choice in such service, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes called the policy “unadulterated animus.” Absolute hostility: a policy reversal that exists for no other reason than for one group to be hostile toward another group of fellow Americans.
Aren’t we better than this?
In Mississippi, some state officials continue to vilify groups of fellow Mississippians without regard for expertise or diligently consulting established facts on a given issue. Adding fuel to the flames of anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment without any grounding in evidence, such leaders strive to make the lives of a group of fellow Mississippians harder for no other reason than political utility.
What tangible benefit is there for a straight Mississippian to tell a trans Mississippian that they don’t exist? There is none. It is the politics of cruelty, plain and simple, a refusal, as Jane Fonda stated at the SAG awards earlier this year, to “give a damn” about someone different from you.
In Mississippi, only five cities — Clarksdale, Holly Springs, Jackson, Magnolia, Rosedale — and no county have passed ordinances to protect LGBTQ+ Mississippians from discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. If federal mandates are removed or held in the limbo of ongoing legal challenges, then, only 6% of LGBTQ+ Mississippians will be protected from discrimination under local law.
With recent rhetoric and proposed actions from federal and local governments, one can only imagine how the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians may be about to get harder. And to be clear, some folks within our community will be hit harder than others.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Seventeen years later, I understand now where my mom was coming from. She was coming from a place of care and concern for her child. Her words were not about who her son was but who other people were. She knew in her wisdom and experience that she would not be able to control how my life would be made manifestly more difficult by the actions of others who did not see, love and know me as unconditionally as she did. She knew people feared what they could not understand and that the so-called “marginal” among us will always be our most vulnerable.
My mother has been a healthcare provider since she was 15 years old in our native Mississippi Delta. She has often repeated a mantra attributed to Hippocrates, known best to us as the author of the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm. In a medical setting, such advice is often more idealistic than practical. Doctors and nurses must often react to extraordinary situations comparing risk and benefit for a myriad of treatments. Many treatments — such as those for cancer — often cause significant short-term harm in service of hoped-for long-term healing.
But the point is that many healthcare providers like my mother operate under the basic assumption that they should not cause further harm to their patients. That to heal, one must first aim not to make the problem worse.
I’ve been thinking in the last few months of the words harm and hard in conjunction. What if we simply told our politicians and representatives not to make it harder? No matter what you do — no matter what mistakes you may make in the process — no matter what ideological system aligns with your personal values — no matter from whom comes your campaign financing — no matter what your political party — can you first promise to not make it harder for any of us?
Can that be your first guiding principle and most basic commitment to all of your constituents? It would be nice to believe that public servants get into that line of work because they already adhere to that foundational ethic.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Life is hard. I know of few people from all walks of life who have not gone through hard times. But we should expect our leaders not to go out of their way to make it harder for any one of us.
We should hold our leaders accountable when they attempt to target any group of us in ways that will make life harder for that group and, by the way, do little if anything at all to benefit those of us who are not in the targeted, oft-marginalized, group.
As a native Mississippian, my life hasn’t always been easy. But who I am in my full authenticity has prepared me to weather the hard times and cherish the easy ones.
In March of 2025, I attended my cousin’s marriage in Pass Christian; there, she married her long-term boyfriend. The weekend after, my partner and I attended his cousin’s marriage in Georgia. There, his cousin married his long-term girlfriend. Two straight-marriages in two weekends. Good times. Easy times. Fun times. Family time.
When I was growing up, I never dreamed that the legal path for me to marry the man I now call my partner would be as easy as it has been since 2015, since the Obergefell ruling. As my partner and I watched our cousins walk down the aisle to meet their beloveds and commit to them to weather life’s storms, for better or for worse, I prayed that option remains viable for us, two men who by the grace of God found each other. I pray, too, that marriage remains a legal option for all couples like us well into our nation’s future. Life is so much easier when you walk it with someone you love by your side. Love should be enough.
In 2008, a few months after I officially came out to my mother in that hallway conversation, my older sister got married. The easiest conversation I ever had about being gay was with my sister. The conversation was easy because it never took place. My sister knew; she knows. And yet, she didn’t need me to go through the hard part — the difficult step — of having that conversation where I described my supposed difference in contrast to her assumed normalcy.
My sister made it easy because all that mattered to her is that I’m her younger brother. For her, that was, and is, enough. No need to make it any harder than that.

Federal scientists released their annual forecast for Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms on June 26, 2025, and they expect a mild to moderate season. However, anyone who comes in contact with the blooms can face health risks, and it’s worth remembering that 2014, when toxins from algae blooms contaminated the water supply in Toledo, Ohio, was considered a moderate year, too.
The Conversation asked Gregory J. Dick, who leads the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, a federally funded center at the University of Michigan that studies harmful algal blooms among other Great Lakes issues, why they’re such a concern.

bulletin_current 
1. What causes harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are dense patches of excessive algae growth that can occur in any type of water body, including ponds, reservoirs, rivers, lakes and oceans. When you see them in freshwater, you’re typically seeing cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae.
These photosynthetic bacteria have inhabited our planet for billions of years. In fact, they were responsible for oxygenating Earth’s atmosphere, which enabled plant and animal life as we know it.

Algae are natural components of ecosystems, but they cause trouble when they proliferate to high densities, creating what we call blooms.
Harmful algal blooms form scums at the water surface and produce toxins that can harm ecosystems, water quality and human health. They have been reported in all 50 U.S. states, all five Great Lakes and nearly every country around the world. Blue-green algae blooms are becoming more common in inland waters.
The main sources of harmful algal blooms are excess nutrients in the water, typically phosphorus and nitrogen.
Historically, these excess nutrients mainly came from sewage and phosphorus-based detergents used in laundry machines and dishwashers that ended up in waterways. U.S. environmental laws in the early 1970s addressed this by requiring sewage treatment and banning phosphorus detergents, with spectacular success.
How pollution affected Lake Erie in the 1960s, before clean water regulations.
Today, agriculture is the main source of excess nutrients from chemical fertilizer or manure applied to farm fields to grow crops. Rainstorms wash these nutrients into streams and rivers that deliver them to lakes and coastal areas, where they fertilize algal blooms. In the U.S., most of these nutrients come from industrial-scale corn production, which is largely used as animal feed or to produce ethanol for gasoline.
Climate change also exacerbates the problem in two ways. First, cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures. Second, climate-driven increases in precipitation, especially large storms, cause more nutrient runoff that has led to record-setting blooms.

2. What does your team’s DNA testing tell us about Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms contain a mixture of cyanobacterial species that can produce an array of different toxins, many of which are still being discovered.
When my colleagues and I recently sequenced DNA from Lake Erie water, we found new types of microcystins, the notorious toxins that were responsible for contaminating Toledo’s drinking water supply in 2014.
These novel molecules cannot be detected with traditional methods and show some signs of causing toxicity, though further studies are needed to confirm their human health effects.
We also found organisms responsible for producing saxitoxin, a potent neurotoxin that is well known for causing paralytic shellfish poisoning on the Pacific Coast of North America and elsewhere.
Saxitoxins have been detected at low concentrations in the Great Lakes for some time, but the recent discovery of hot spots of genes that make the toxin makes them an emerging concern.
Our research suggests warmer water temperatures could boost its production, which raises concerns that saxitoxin will become more prevalent with climate change. However, the controls on toxin production are complex, and more research is needed to test this hypothesis. Federal monitoring programs are essential for tracking and understanding emerging threats.
3. Should people worry about these blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are unsightly and smelly, making them a concern for recreation, property values and businesses. They can disrupt food webs and harm aquatic life, though a recent study suggested that their effects on the Lake Erie food web so far are not substantial.
But the biggest impact is from the toxins these algae produce that are harmful to humans and lethal to pets.
The toxins can cause acute health problems such as gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, fever and skin irritation. Dogs can die from ingesting lake water with harmful algal blooms. Emerging science suggests that long-term exposure to harmful algal blooms, for example over months or years, can cause or exacerbate chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems and may be linked to liver cancers, kidney disease and neurological issues.

In addition to exposure through direct ingestion or skin contact, recent research also indicates that inhaling toxins that get into the air may harm health, raising concerns for coastal residents and boaters, but more research is needed to understand the risks.
The Toledo drinking water crisis of 2014 illustrated the vast potential for algal blooms to cause harm in the Great Lakes. Toxins infiltrated the drinking water system and were detected in processed municipal water, resulting in a three-day “do not drink” advisory. The episode affected residents, hospitals and businesses, and it ultimately cost the city an estimated US$65 million.
4. Blooms seem to be starting earlier in the year and lasting longer – why is that happening?
Warmer waters are extending the duration of the blooms.
In 2025, NOAA detected these toxins in Lake Erie on April 28, earlier than ever before. The 2022 bloom in Lake Erie persisted into November, which is rare if not unprecedented.
Scientific studies of western Lake Erie show that the potential cyanobacterial growth rate has increased by up to 30% and the length of the bloom season has expanded by up to a month from 1995 to 2022, especially in warmer, shallow waters. These results are consistent with our understanding of cyanobacterial physiology: Blooms like it hot – cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures.
5. What can be done to reduce the likelihood of algal blooms in the future?
The best and perhaps only hope of reducing the size and occurrence of harmful algal blooms is to reduce the amount of nutrients reaching the Great Lakes.
In Lake Erie, where nutrients come primarily from agriculture, that means improving agricultural practices and restoring wetlands to reduce the amount of nutrients flowing off of farm fields and into the lake. Early indications suggest that Ohio’s H2Ohio program, which works with farmers to reduce runoff, is making some gains in this regard, but future funding for H2Ohio is uncertain.
In places like Lake Superior, where harmful algal blooms appear to be driven by climate change, the solution likely requires halting and reversing the rapid human-driven increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

“Every year, over 6.5 million dogs and cats and other household pets are surrendered to animal shelters” in the U.S., according to World Animal Foundation.
Although data on pet intake fluctuates, some shelters in South Carolina are currently so overcrowded that officials are reporting “crisis” levels.
Fostering, or providing temporary care for, is a great way to give pets a break from shelter life. Plus, fostering “also relieves pressure on shelters and rescues, allowing these organizations to help more pets in need,” says Pedigree Foundation.
Pets at shelters can range from puppies to dogs rescued from illegal and “barbaric” dog fighting rings. Fostering helps prepare all of them for adoption.
Fostering opportunities are available year-round.

But every June — National Foster a Pet Month — there’s a push to get more pet lovers to temporarily look after companion animals.
For years I fostered dogs. I cared for young dogs, senior dogs, and everything in between.
One of the dogs I fostered was Jeriko:. “J” loved my bathroom mat. Even though I made a comfortable space for him in the living room, he’d always return to the bathroom to lie on that mat. “J” showed me that dogs have preferences.
When he was adopted, I bought him the same mat to take with him to his “forever home.”
I also fostered Misty.
During the time I was caring for her, I asked a friend to look after Misty while I took a short vacation. When my friend came to the house to pick her up, Misty started doing “the zoomies.”
Misty was so excited that she ran in circles. She reminded me that dogs are expressive. Misty really liked my friend, and she showed it. In no time, my friend’s family fell in love with Misty and adopted her.

Then, there’s Arthur.
I first saw Arthur when I was pulling up to the shelter’s parking lot. I was returning a crate that belonged to them, and I saw a volunteer walking him back to the building. I thought, “This dog shouldn’t be here.” Arthur’s missing one of his legs.
The next day I called the shelter to see if Arthur was still there. He was. I picked him up, and he became my next foster.
When Arthur arrived home, I let him lie down on the couch and I sat next to him. He quickly got up and dropped on my lap. He showed me that dogs just want to be loved.
I quickly fell in love with Arthur and adopted him — “foster to forever.”
People frequently ask me about Arthur. Does he need a prosthetic? No. Is he ill? No. I like when people ask so they discard misinformed or preconceived ideas about dogs with special needs. Anyone who’s met Arthur knows he’s passionate about tennis balls, and he loves to run — even hop — to catch them.
Sometimes dogs who’ve spent time at a shelter are misunderstood.
Once while walking Misty, a neighbor saw us and said he couldn’t be near pit bulls. Misty’s a pit bull mix. I reminded the neighbor that breedism is a form of racism. He’d never spent time with Misty, so he didn’t know that she’s calm and affectionate. If he’d given Misty a chance, he wouldn’t have judged her just by her appearance.
Animals don’t judge us, so let’s not judge them.
By fostering and getting to know companion animals, we can inform potential adopters about their personalities. This increases their chances of getting adopted.
Saying goodbye once they’d been adopted always made me cry. I laughed and learned with them, and it was impossible not to get attached.
People sometimes said, “I couldn’t foster. It’d be too painful.” But to me it was simple. I could cry from joy that they’d found a safe and loving home. Or I could do nothing.
Fostering is flexible and varies.
There are hundreds of shelters across South Carolina, and they’ll help coordinate a schedule that works well for everyone.
Fostering can last for a few weeks or be as short as an afternoon walk. But regardless of the amount of time given, the benefits are manifold.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 15:29:22+00:00,CT Mirror,Avelo deportation flights prompt bill on jet fuel tax exemptions,Adam Walker | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/avelo-deportation-flights-jet-fuel-tax-bill/,William Tong joined a virtual press conference announcing a proposal to cut jet fuel tax breaks for airlines involved in deportation flights.,"In a growing effort to hold airlines like Avelo accountable for their role in controversial deportation flights, New York State Sen. Patricia Fahy is spearheading legislation that would revoke millions of dollars in jet fuel tax exemptions from carriers found to be violating civil liberties.
Fahy unveiled details of the proposal during a virtual press conference Wednesday, hosted by a national group called Coalition to Stop Avelo. 
The conference featured Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and advocates from across the country pressing for transparency and action against Avelo Airlines, which activists say is profiting from deportation flights contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
New Haven has been an epicenter for the boycott movement against Avelo, as the budget airline flies 30 passenger-travel direct routes from Tweed New Haven Airport, even as it’s spent the past nearly two months running deportation flights from a separate airport in Arizona.
The airline, facing financial pressures, has defended its DHS partnership as necessary at a time of increased competition to its New Haven passenger-travel business. Activists and officials from across Connecticut and the country have continued to criticize Avelo’s role in migrant removals.

Meanwhile, at Wednesday’s online press conference, Fahy, who represents Albany in the New York State Senate, explained the rationale behind her new legislative proposal. ​“It’s leveraging our proprietary authority over public airport contracts here in New York to say that it is part of the state oversight contractual authority that airlines have to uphold Constitutional rights,” she said.
Fahy’s bill targets New York’s jet fuel tax exemption — described by Fahy as ​“very, very generous” — that saves airlines between $11 million and $17 million statewide each year. Under the proposal, airlines engaged in deportation flights that undermine due process would lose that tax benefit. 
The legislation, titled the State Airport Facilities Enforcing Accountability in Immigration Removals (SAFE AIR) Act, aims to ensure that no state agency, department, or locality in New York enters into or renews contracts with airlines that transport individuals detained for deportation without a valid judicial warrant or order from a federal judge or magistrate — not merely an administrative immigration detainer — and proof that the individual has been afforded due process rights, including access to counsel and a hearing before an immigration judge.
Introduced in May, the bill is currently under consideration in the New York State Senate’s Committee on Procurement and Contracts. It has not yet passed. 
The SAFE AIR Act would also amend state tax law to deny fuel tax exemptions to airlines that fail to meet these standards, while protecting carriers that comply with valid court orders or lawful federal mandates. It empowers the state attorney general to seek injunctive relief or civil penalties against violators. 
“This is the first private-sector contract we’re aware of between ICE and a commercial airline,” Fahy said, referring to Avelo’s alleged cooperation with DHS. ​“If they’re violating civil liberties, they shouldn’t get a break from New York taxpayers.” (Avelo has also been the beneficiary of a Connecticut state aviation fuel tax break.)
During his remarks at Wednesday’s presser, Connecticut Attorney General Tong echoed Fahy’s stance, urging states to reconsider economic support for companies engaged in harmful practices. 
Tong said Avelo refused to provide information about its relationship with DHS and instead told the state to file a Freedom of Information Act request — a response he called dismissive of a state that has offered the airline significant support. He also criticized Avelo’s claim that working with DHS is essential to its survival, arguing no business model should depend on profiting from others’ suffering.
“When I heard what Avelo is doing to immigrants and families in total violation of the law and without regard to due process — and if Avelo says, ​‘Well, that’s not us, that’s DHS, that’s ICE.’ No, sorry. You’re part of the deal, too,” Tong said.
“We are considering all of our legal options and legislative options to get more information, number one,” Tong added, ​“and if we’re unhappy with what we see and understand from Avelo, to not do business with them and not to be their partner.”
When asked about the criticism, Avelo spokesperson Courtney Goff wrote to the Independent Wednesday, ​“We recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and assert their freedom of speech. Avelo’s main priority continues to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation that over 7.3 million Customers across the country continue to enjoy.”
The press conference, organized by the Coalition to Stop Avelo, highlighted the growing grassroots and legislative movement opposing the use of commercial airlines in deportation operations. Advocates from Delaware, Michigan, Tennessee, and other states joined Fahy and Tong in calling for stronger accountability measures and the end of taxpayer subsidies for airlines tied to immigration enforcement. 
The Coalition continues to coordinate protests, boycotts, and legislative campaigns nationwide, with new local actions planned in the coming weeks to pressure airlines, investors, and public officials, including protests set to take place this weekend in states such as New York, Florida, and Michigan.

Wes Moore (D) is turning to a strategist with close ties to a potential rival in the 2028 White House election to helm his 2026 reelection campaign in Maryland – and possibly a national campaign beyond that.
Moore has hired Ron Owens, a Michigander who has worked as a political operative and statehouse aide for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) to run his reelection campaign.
Many Democrats – in Moore’s political orbit and beyond – had expected Ned Miller, who ran Moore’s 2022 campaign, joined his administration and later oversaw his super PAC, to head the reelection effort. But Miller has moved to Georgia, to run former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ 2026 campaign for governor.
“I’m thrilled to have Ron Owens leading our reelection campaign as our campaign manager,” Moore said in a statement provided to Maryland Matters. “Ron brings immense experience to Maryland from his work all across the country – with him on our team we will create the most aggressive statewide operation in history to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot all across Maryland.”
Though only 29, Owens is a seasoned operative who worked most recently as a campaign adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, helping Democratic Senate candidates, including now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), with strategy and campaign management.
In 2023, he was campaign manager to Brandon Presley, a former state utility regulator – and cousin of Elvis Presley’s – who was the Democratic nominee for governor of Mississippi. Presley ran a surprisingly strong race in a red state, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves by just 3.2 points.
Most of Owens’ political experience, however, is in Michigan, his home state. After a stint as a legislative aide to the state House Democratic leader, Owens was the deputy political director on Whitmer’s successful 2018 campaign for governor.
He spent two years as Whitmer’s public affairs specialist in her gubernatorial office, then was political director in her 2022 reelection campaign.
After Owens was hired to run Presley’s campaign, a leading Mississippi Republican cited the operative’s ties to Whitmer as a way of blasting the Democratic contender.
“COVID showed Americans that it certainly matters who serves as governor,” Henry Barbour, the Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, told the Magnolia Tribune in 2023. “Democrats such as Gretchen Whitmer advanced their elitist, government-knows-best agenda that restricted Americans’ liberty. And Brandon Presley hired her top political operative.
“Don’t believe him for a minute when he tries to persuade you he’s not of the same political persuasion,” Barbour said.
Whitmer and Moore are both seen as top-tier potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. But while Whitmer is termed out of office at the end of 2026, Moore must first win reelection next year before he can fully focus on any hypothetical national campaign.
Still, in the early skirmishing leading up to the 2028 White House primaries, Owens’ decision to cast his lot with Moore, one of Whitmer’s potential rivals, is noteworthy, if only significant to insiders.
In a 2018 interview, Owens highlighted his work ethic and life philosophy.
“One thing that my mom instilled in my siblings and me was to, one, always be kind to other people, two, always work twice as hard as anyone else and, three, whenever you’re working you should always be doing something that is benefiting others,” Owens said in an nterview with Pride Source, a Michigan LGBTQ+ publication.
“We are fortunate to have him as our leader as we seek to continue our mission to create a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said.
At this stage, Moore still has a pretty skeletal campaign operation as the 2026 election ramps up, though that is likely to change soon. But he will enter a potentially perilous campaign season without Miller, who, after guiding the governor’s first statewide campaign, became a senior adviser and director of engagement for his administration.
In the middle of last year, Miller left state government to oversee Moore’s Unity First PAC and also played a leadership role in Freedom in Reproduction – Maryland Inc., the entity that helped pass the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Moore appears to have also lost the services of his finance director, Patrick Denny, who was with the campaign since 2021.
The Moore campaign has not yet indicated who will replace Denny as finance director and it is not known who will oversee the governor’s PAC, which he largely used during the 2024 election cycle to attack Republican congressional candidates in Maryland. The PAC is now airing ads touting Moore’s economic record.
Even though he has publicly insisted in recent weeks that he is not running for president in 2028, Moore continues to behave like a possible national candidate. His trip in late May to South Carolina, site of an early and critical presidential primary, won wide attention from national political insiders and commentators.
Strategists on the popular “Hacks on Tap” podcast subsequently called Moore a “top 10” contender for 2028, and Chuck Todd, the former political director of NBC News, recently opined that Moore has the strongest resume and most gold-plated Rolodex of any of the hypothetical Democratic presidential candidates.
Moore appeared last week as a guest on “Pod Save America,” the breezy podcast hosted by former Obama administration officials. There, he explained why he’s not making plans to run for president, saying he never anticipated a career in politics and is enjoying serving as governor after starting the 2022 campaign as a relative unknown.
“I’m playing with house money right now and I love the work we’re doing in Maryland,” he said. The governor added that he will “go anywhere and everywhere” to tout the state’s progress.
 Bold-faced names

Moore’s out-of-state travels continue this month, and include a recent gathering with Democrats in Virginia, which is holding closely watched statewide elections this year.
Moore is headed to a fundraising brunch in Aspen, Colorado,on Saturday, hosted by Damian O’Doherty, the former Maryland political operative and co-founder of KO Public Affairs in Baltimore, who lives now in the Rocky Mountains but often returns to his home state.
The host committee of the event, which O’Doherty has informally dubbed “A Whole Lotta Skiers For Maryland Governor Wes Moore,” includes David Baugh, the executive director of the Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club, and a former superintendent of the Aspen School District; Rich Benenson, managing partner of the Denver office of the law firm and lobbying powerhouse Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; Gordon Bronson, chief business officer at Continuum Partners, a real estate development and financing firm; Adam Goers, a former Democratic operative with ties to former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and now the Denver-based senior vice president for corporate affairs for Columbia Care, a cannabis company; and Michael Stratton, a senior Colorado-based Democratic and corporate strategist.
Moore’s fundraiser in Colorado coincides with the Aspen Ideas Festival, the signature annual event of the Aspen Institute. According to the festival website, the confab “brings brilliant minds from around the globe to discuss the ideas that will shape tomorrow and help us understand today. From sunup to sundown, we’ll explore critical issues and uncover ideas that spark wonder.”
The festival schedule shows Moore discussing “bold, purposeful leadership” on Saturday afternoon with Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, moderated by CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.
“Big thinkers and doers share fresh ideas, challenge assumptions and ignite conversations that ripple far beyond [the Aspen conference venue],” the conference website says of the panel discussion with Moore and the other dignitaries. “Curiosity required.”
Moore is then scheduled to travel to Detroit, where he will deliver the keynote address at the Detroit NAACP’s 70th anniversary dinner on Sunday evening. That appearance was first reported by Politico.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT legalized recreational cannabis 4 years ago. What’s changed?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/ct-cannabis-marijuana-sales-recreational-medical/,"As sales of recreational marijuana have increased in CT, sales of medical cannabis have dropped, and overall sales have held fairly steady.","July 1 marks four years of legalized recreational cannabis use in Connecticut, and with legalization came major changes to the medical marijuana market.  
A law enacted in 2012 allowed the purchase and use of cannabis for medical reasons only. But in 2021, the state legalized recreational use for everyone 21 and older. Statewide recreational retail sales began in January 2023, and by May 2023, recreational sales accounted for the majority of state cannabis retail sales, a trend that has continued to today.
Connecticut was the 19th state to legalize recreational marijuana. 
Under state law, anyone 21 or older without a medical card is allowed to possess up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower or other cannabis product equivalent in public and up to 5 ounces in their private residence. Medical cardholders can posses up to 5 ounces of cannabis on their person.
Not only have recreational sales increased, but medical purchases have made up less than half of the state’s cannabis market retail sales since May 2023.
Both medical and recreational dispensaries sell similar products, but medical users who are using the product to treat “debilitating medical conditions” aren’t subject to the cannabis tax. Medical users can also buy other products that recreational users cannot, including capsules, tablets, pills, sublinguals and suppositories.
Medical users are also not subject to potency restrictions, while recreational cannabis is currently capped at 30% THC for cannabis flower and 60% THC products other than vapes. However, as of Oct. 1, 2025, the cap for raw flower will be raised to 35% THC and 70% THC for concentrates other than vapes.
The cannabis tax is dependent on both the product and the amount of THC; edible products are taxed the most heavily per milligram of THC and plant products the least. For an eighth of flower that’s 15% THC, for the tax currently sits at around 9.4%, fluctuating based on product pricing. Edibles are subject to a tax of $0.0275 per milligram of the product’s total THC content.
Medical card holders are required to apply for renewal annually, which involves a consultation fee with health care providers that can range from $100 to $350 for user 18 and older. For users under 18, users must have a condition specified by the legislature for medical usage as well as parental consent and a caregiver arrangement.
Because cannabis usage is federally illegal, medical card holders are prohibited from purchasing firearms, and everyone applying for a firearm is required to disclose their usage of cannabis and other federally controlled substances. Federal law bars all cannabis users from owning a firearm.
Each hybrid or recreational cannabis retailer registered in Connecticut must pay the cannabis tax, which varies by product. The state cannabis tax brought in $21.3 million in state revenue for FY 2024.
Overall, the sales tax — along with state sales tax, municipality sales tax and licensing and conversion fees for dispensaries — brought in $49.4 million in cannabis revenue for FY 2024.
While there are dozens of products on the market, usable cannabis flower, which is just the dried plant, brings in the most sales across the medical and recreational markets. Overall, in May 2025, recreational cannabis retail sales were $18.7 million. Medical retail sales were $6.6 million.
There is only one exclusively medical dispensary in the state. The rest of the dispensaries have transitioned and cater to both the recreational market and the medical market as hybrid dealers, or just the recreational market.
Statewide, there are 36 recreational dispensaries and 35 hybrid dealers. However, the number of dispensaries fluctuates. Back in January 2023, only nine hybrid dispensaries existed. Numbers from around February 2025 showed 64 dispensaries in the state— eight fewer than are currently open.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-10.15.39-AM-1024x737.png,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.
Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.
If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”
 Reaction from lawmakers

Republican lawmakers celebrated the opinion as another strike against abortions in the state. The federal ruling follows decisions by the state’s highest court upholding the state’s so-called “fetal heartbeat” law as a six-week abortion ban.
“Planned Parenthood has sued South Carolina over and over again, and over and over again, the abortion-giant keeps losing,” state Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a win for all South Carolina taxpayers, and most of all, this pro-life generation looking forward to the day when Planned Parenthood’s doors close for good.”
The opinion allows the state to determine how it spends its money without interference from outside groups, Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement.
“The Supreme Court just slammed the door on Planned Parenthood’s latest attempt to force its radical agenda through the courts on our state,” Wilson said. “South Carolina, not federal judges or D.C. activist groups, gets to decide how we run our Medicaid program.”
The decision will disproportionately affect low-income women who relied on Planned Parenthood’s services, Sens. Margie Bright Matthews and Tameika Isaac Devine said in a joint statement.
“The real price of this decision will be paid by patients, especially Black, brown and rural women who now face fewer options and greater barriers to care,” the Walterboro and Columbia Democrats said.

“It can be blistering out here, but as long as you bring something to keep hydrated, and keep the children hydrated, it’s OK,” said Cearnel.
The trio had been at the play area for about two hours when approached for this story. Cearnel pointed to a gallon-sized bottle of water and remarked that it had been a “block of ice” when they arrived.
“A lot of people come out here to beat the heat,” Cearnel said. “Two days ago, there were some grandparents out here with their grandchildren because their AC went out and they came to the splash pad because it’s free.”
On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for most of Central North Carolina until 7 p.m. That was a downgrade from the Extreme Heat Warning in effect on Wednesday, when temperatures were several degrees warmer.
Wake County announced that temporary cooling stations across the county would remain open through at least June 30 as a response to the heat wave.
“During prolonged periods of extreme heat, it’s important for everyone to remain cautious and continue taking the proper steps to stay cool,” said Josh Creighton, deputy director of Wake County Fire Services and Emergency Management. “If at all possible, avoid strenuous activity outside during the hottest part of the day. Take breaks in the shade, or preferably in an air-conditioned space, and drink plenty of water.”
In Winston-Salem, housing activists gathered this week to demand the City of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County enact “immediate plans” to protect the county’s “elderly, children, unhoused and others without access to air conditioning from heat deaths.”
Housing Justice Now said the county’s response to the heat advisories had been “sorely lacking.”
“The only official response to the heat advisory from Forsyth County is a Facebook post stating: “be careful with the extreme heat expected this week!” Housing Justice Now said in a press release it shared earlier this week. “With conditions demanding more than a one-liner on social media, Housing Justice Now and community advocates urge public officials to do better.”
The group demands included extending the county’s public library hours and using vacant buildings such as the old courthouse and Kaledium North (a downtown museum that targets children and families) as cooling stations.
Back in Wake County, Vielka Gabriel, the season and volunteer supervisor, who oversees “Cool for Wake,” the county’s heat relief program that provides window air conditioners and fans to people who can’t afford them, said soaring temperatures this week sent demand into overdrive.

“We have lots of individuals that are seniors who have broken HVAC systems and can’t afford to get their systems fixed,” Gabriel said. “We’re also partnering with our public health department, which has been referring individuals with chronic illnesses, newborn babies that are coming out of NICUs (Neonatal Intensive Care Units).”
On Wednesday, Gabriel said “Cool for Wake” ordered eight air conditioners for senior citizens and donated six used ones to families who needed them.
“We’ve just restocked our regional centers with fans,” she said. “Yesterday alone, I’ve ordered about 150 fans.”
The fans are sent to regional centers, so residents don’t have to travel to Raleigh to get them. “Cool for Wake” also arranges deliveries of air conditioners to residents with chronic illnesses, she said.
“We’re utilizing a partnership with the Raleigh Regional Association Realtors Giving Network,” Gabriel said. “They took six requests on Tuesday, and delivered four and are delivering the other two today [Wednesday].”
Gabriel noted that residents who receive air conditioning units must arrange to have them installed.
Residents are grateful to receive fans, Gabriel said, but acknowledged that in the extreme heat the region is experiencing, a traditional box fan does little more than circulate hot air.
“This year, I’ve made a major push into getting more air conditioning units into homes,” Gabriel said. “It has been a challenge because of the cost. We have an amazing community, however, that has stepped up to the call and has been helping to get gently used units into homes.”
The Central America native has been looking into acquiring cooling units that are popular there. The units use water and ice to cool rooms, Gabriel said.
“We’re just trying to find ways that are truly effective in keeping a person cool.
In the meantime, Gabriel said residents should close curtains, lock doors and run AC units strategically to conserve energy.
This year, Gabriel said, “Cool for Wake” has worked with the Wake County Housing team to connect with the county’s westernization program to help seniors and others with to provide adequate cooling systems.
“Part of my ask would be for businesses and folks to help us get to the root cause [of why a resident doesn’t have an adequate cooling system],” Gabriel said. “If the HVAC system is the need, is there a way get donations or have [HVAC] companies come in and check units?”
Continued monetary donations are also critical, Gabriel said. And air conditioning units are no longer a luxury as summer temperatures continue to rise.
“We can get box fans rather cheaply, but if four people or five people got together and donated $25 each, it would help us be able to purchase more air conditioning units,” Gabriel said. “We really need to see the need for air conditioning units in the community.”
Financial donations can be made online at the Cool for Wake website.

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)The two unions representing nearly 40,000 Minnesota state workers — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — separately announced Friday that they reached tentative agreements with the state.
MAPE members have been fuming about Gov. Tim Walz’s part-time return-to-office order that took effect earlier this month and have picketed outside negotiations between Minnesota budget officials and their union.
Under Walz’s order, state employees must work in the office at least 50% of the time unless they live more than 50 miles away or receive an exemption. Walz argues the policy will improve collaboration, mentorship and workplace culture, with the added benefit of bringing bodies and dollars back to downtown St. Paul.
The return-to-work order itself was not negotiable, MAPE said in a press release, but the union said the agreement includes a 21-day notice requirement for telework changes, up from 14 days.
“To fight off concessions in a year like this is a real testament to our members,” MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a statement. “They showed up at the table, at the rallies and at the site. This was a contract campaign in the truest sense, and our members won it.”
MAPE and AFSCME members have also expressed outrage over the state’s health care proposals, which they estimated would have raised many workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year. The administration says rising health care costs left them no choice, but MAPE and AFSCME seems to have prevailed on this point.
The tentative agreement includes “a complete defeat” of the state’s health care proposals, AFSCME Council 5 said in a press release, and MAPE said it too had “successfully fought back the most aggressive health care cost increases.”
AFSCME Council 5 also won across-the-board raises of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.75% in 2026. MAPE said it secured over 3% in across-the-board raises over the 2025-2027 contract term.
“This tentative agreement is the direct result of the incredible strength, solidarity and determination shown by our union members from every corner of our state who were determined to fight for economic justice and the public services they provide every day,” AFSCME Council 5 Executive Director Bart Andersen said in a statement.
MAPE members will vote to ratify the agreement in August; AFSCME Council 5 did not announce when their dues-paying members will vote on the agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230073-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802
,DC,2025-06-27 14:45:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-limits-injunctions-allows-trump-act-birthright-citizenship-ban,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday in a major decision reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order barring birthright citizenship.The high court declined to decide the constitutionality of birthright citizenship itself, but said the executive order rewriting the constitutional right to birthright citizenship could go into effect within 30 days after Friday’s ruling.The ruling likely could hamper other legal challenges against Trump administration actions in which nationwide injunctions are sought.In a 6-3 ruling, the conservative justices found that nationwide “injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”“The Court grants the Government’s applications for a partial stay of the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,” according to the ruling written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.While the dispute before the court related to Trump’s executive order to rewrite the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, the Trump administration asked the high court to instead focus on the issue of preliminary injunctions granted by lower courts.“The applications do not raise—and thus the Court does not address—the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act,” according to the ruling, referring to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil.The order instructs lower courts to “move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity.""More than two dozen nationwide injunctionsIn the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, through April 29, judges issued about 25 nationwide injunctions, according to the Congressional Research Service.“The lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate; we therefore leave it to them to consider these and any related arguments,” according to the ruling.A narrower injunction could refer to a class action suit.Barrett argued that a nationwide injunction would not grant more relief for barring the enforcement of Trump’s executive order against a pregnant person who is not a U.S. citizen and fears their child would be denied citizenship.“Her child will not be denied citizenship. And extending the injunction to cover everyone similarly situated would not render her relief any more complete,” according to the ruling. “So the individual and associational respondents are wrong to characterize the universal injunction as simply an application of the complete-relief principle.”Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.In last month’s oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, he said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.Origins of birthright citizenship caseThe case, Trump v. CASA, was consolidated from three cases.One was brought by immigrant rights groups and several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens who filed their case in Maryland; the second came from four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — that filed a case in Washington state; and the third came from 18 Democratic state attorneys general who filed the challenge in Massachusetts.Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.This is not the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of birthright citizenship.In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld the 14th Amendment, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, extending birthright citizenship.In that 19th-century case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had legal authority to be in the United States, such as a temporary visa. While Ark was born in California, his citizenship was not recognized when he went on a trip to China. Upon his return to California, he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.When his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, the high court ruled that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.The Trump administration has argued that the 1898 case was misinterpreted and point to a specific phrase: “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.Attorneys for the Trump administration contend that the phrase in the 14th Amendment means that birthright citizenship only applies to children born to parents who are ""subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.That would mean, under their view, people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin and therefore so would be any children they have.",,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

Read this story in English.
Los legisladores de Connecticut aprobaron en esta sesión legislativa una ley que reforma partes de las leyes estatales de protección al consumidor, añadiendo salvaguardas adicionales para quienes compran una amplia variedad de bienes y servicios.
El proyecto de ley de 33 páginas, promulgado por el Gobernador Ned Lamont a principios de este mes, fue una de las principales prioridades de los Demócratas del Senado este año e incluye cambios de gran alcance.
Amplía la capacidad de la Fiscalía General del estado para controlar la especulación de precios, exige que las empresas revelen las llamadas tarifas basura, exige a las empresas que producen dispositivos conectados a internet que informen a los usuarios si su tecnología captura y comparte audio o video desde los hogares, y más.
El Senador James Maroney, Demócrata por Milford, ayudó a impulsar el proyecto de ley, S.B. 3, en la legislatura y afirmó que ayudaría a proteger a los residentes de Connecticut en un panorama de consumo cambiante.
“Connecticut está intensificando sus esfuerzos para proteger a las familias de prácticas comerciales abusivas, ya sea mediante micrófonos en electrodomésticos, grabaciones de conversaciones o cargos sorpresa por productos engañosos que inflan sus facturas”, declaró Maroney, copresidente del Comité de Derecho General de la Legislatura.
Esto es lo que el proyecto de ley hará y lo que no hará.
Abusos de precios
Connecticut ya contaba con una ley que permitía al fiscal general del estado supervisar y procesar los casos de abuso de precios, o el aumento artificial del precio de los productos durante emergencias, como desastres naturales.
La S.B. 3 amplía la supervisión del fiscal general más allá de los minoristas, como supermercados y gasolineras. Ahora, la oficina del fiscal general también puede investigar y acusar a distribuidores, fabricantes, proveedores y mayoristas por cobrar precios “injustificadamente excesivos”.
La ley también amplió esa supervisión a los contratos de alquiler y arrendamiento.
Renovaciones automáticas
¿Alguna vez se ha suscrito a un servicio y ha olvidado que lo estaba pagando? Bueno, la legislatura de Connecticut quiere asegurarse de que reciba un recordatorio.
Parte de la nueva ley de protección al consumidor exige que algunas compañías con “renovaciones automáticas” o “cláusulas de servicio continuo” envíen a los consumidores un aviso anual indicando que se les seguirá cobrando por el servicio.
La ley también exige que las compañías informen a los consumidores cómo pueden cancelar ese contrato recurrente a través de un sitio web, teléfono o correo electrónico.
Sin embargo, este apartado del proyecto de ley no aplica a todas las compañías. Los legisladores establecieron exenciones específicas a esta norma para las empresas de gas, agua y electricidad, así como para los proveedores de servicios de internet. También establecieron exenciones similares para los bancos y las compañías de seguros.
Todos ellos ya están regulados por entidades estatales y federales independientes.
Sin embargo, los legisladores también eximieron lo que denominaron “servicios globales o nacionales” que ofrecen predominantemente “contenido audiovisual”, lo que parece incluir los servicios de streaming en línea.
Divulgación total de precios
Otra sección de la nueva ley aborda las tarifas ocultas, o tarifas basura, como a veces se les llama.
Los legisladores elaboraron un texto que prohíbe a las empresas anunciar, exhibir u ofrecer un bien o servicio a un precio que no incorpore todas las tarifas, cargos y costos que los consumidores deberán pagar.
Si dichas tarifas no se anuncian ni exhiben, o si los cargos se ocultan, se presentan de forma intencionada o se tergiversan, las empresas pueden ser demandadas en virtud de la Ley de Prácticas Comerciales Desleales de Connecticut.
Este tipo de requisito también se aplica a las propiedades en alquiler. El proyecto de ley generalmente establece que el arrendatario debe incluir cualquier tarifa, cargo o costo periódico que el inquilino deba pagar al anunciar una vivienda en alquiler.
Al igual que con las renovaciones automáticas, existen excepciones a la divulgación de tarifas.
Las empresas no necesitan detallar los impuestos federales, estatales o locales que se añaden al precio de compra. La ley tampoco se aplica en situaciones en las que una empresa no puede calcular de forma viable el costo de un servicio, como el envío, durante la compra.
Dispositivos conectados a internet
Los legisladores de Connecticut también abordaron un problema relativamente nuevo para los consumidores: los dispositivos que pueden grabar a las personas en sus propios hogares.
La legislatura, controlada por los Demócratas, busca evitar que las empresas que venden electrodomésticos, televisores o juguetes conectados a internet graben a consumidores involuntarios y utilicen esa información para sus propios fines.
La nueva ley especifica que las empresas que venden estos productos deben informar a los consumidores cuándo su dispositivo puede transmitir audio o video al fabricante o a un tercero. Los dispositivos también deben ofrecer a los consumidores la opción de desactivar dichas funciones, a menos que dicha acción inutilice el dispositivo.
Los legisladores también añadieron una sección al proyecto de ley que prohíbe que los dispositivos conectados a internet incluyan funciones integradas que permitan a las fuerzas del orden monitorear las comunicaciones de las personas.
Y prohíbe a las empresas utilizar los dispositivos para recopilar información que pueda ayudar a otras empresas a identificar al usuario para publicidad dirigida.
Maroney se refirió a estas secciones como las “disposiciones contra escuchas ilegales” del proyecto de ley.
Derecho a reparar
Una de las secciones más ambiciosas de la ley aborda el derecho a reparar, que busca garantizar que los consumidores tengan acceso a todos los materiales necesarios para reparar sus propios productos.
Más de media docena de estados ya han aprobado disposiciones similares.
La versión de Connecticut exige que los fabricantes de productos electrónicos o electrodomésticos pongan a disposición de los consumidores recursos para “diagnosticar, mantener o reparar sus productos”.
El proyecto de ley especifica que estos recursos deben incluir “documentación, piezas y herramientas”, y se aplicará a los productos “fabricados, vendidos o usados” en Connecticut después del 1 de julio de 2026.
Los fabricantes estarán obligados a poner a disposición dicha documentación, piezas y herramientas durante tres o cinco años, dependiendo del precio del producto.
Sin embargo, las empresas no están obligadas a entregar nada que se considere secreto comercial o propiedad intelectual, y el proyecto de ley no se aplica a los productos que ya no se fabrican.
Aun así, hay una larga lista de artículos que no estarán cubiertos, incluidos barcos, vehículos todo terreno, generadores, herramientas eléctricas, estaciones de carga de vehículos eléctricos, equipos de jardinería, equipos de construcción, equipos agrícolas, equipos forestales, equipos de minería y motores.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association (States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector).

The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.”
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”


Moran’s communications director, Angela Lingg, said “the Senate is continuing to negotiate any changes to Medicaid, and Sen. Moran is working to make certain Kansas hospitals are at the forefront of those discussions.”


Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.”
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.”
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association president and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients.
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation.
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent.
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.”
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”

A flurry of lawsuits is challenging the Trump administration's “slash-and-burn"" campaign, which axed hundreds of grant programs mid-stream. The White House is fundamentally misinterpreting a short phrase buried in recent regulation, the suits argue, to justify the sweeping cuts.
The post Flurry of lawsuits over Trump cuts hinge on nine words appeared first[...]","THERE WAS NOTHING subtle about the Trump administration’s approach to government spending when Elon Musk waved a chainsaw in front of a crowd of cheering activists at a February gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. The clear message from the face of the new Department of Government Efficiency: This is no delicate pruning exercise but one in which we’re felling entire trees.
The sweeping powers of the presidency give the administration plenty of running room to upend the status quo, but it can’t do that by simply reinterpreting federal laws and regulations. That’s the argument at the heart of a series of lawsuits challenging sweeping cuts to federal grants.
Hundreds of organizations across the country were notified in recent weeks that federal grants they operated – funding everything from anti-violence programs to initiatives to ensure clean drinking water – were being terminated immediately. 
The government authority to abruptly cancel millions of dollars in funding relied on the same boilerplate wording delivered to each grant recipient, usually in a short email: The award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  
A coalition of state attorneys general that includes Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell filed suit on June 24 against an array of federal offices over the administration’s use of that nine-word phrase. The “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign” rests on a fundamental misinterpretation of a short subclause “buried in federal regulations” put out by the Office of Management of Budget, the attorneys general argue. 
While this clause says that agencies can indeed terminate grants if they no longer “effectuate program goals or agency priorities,” the AGs argue that the Trump administration is fundamentally misinterpreting the meaning of this language. 
The clause does not mean that when an administration changes its priorities that organizations abiding by the terms of their grants are suddenly subjected to having the grants yanked, the complaint argues. Instead, according to the lawsuit, the wording means the grant is subject to termination if it’s determined that the recipient is not meeting the goals set out for the grant program at its inception. 
The regulatory language governing grants was put in place by OMB in 2020, but the suit claims the federal office “never once indicated that the words ‘agency priorities’ would confer broad authority on federal agencies to terminate grants based on new or changed agency priorities.”  
Rather, the suit says, the office focused on establishing program goals at the time that the grant award was made public. In other words, to ensure the continuity of their funding, grant recipients have to do what the grant said they would do. 
Yet, in recent months, programs that have been using money in the way Congress intended in authorizing the spending suddenly saw the rug pulled out from under them.  
“The results have been devastating,” the coalition of mostly blue state attorneys general wrote in their complaint filed this week. “With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived states of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more. Federal agencies have done all of this without any advance notice, without any explanation to the state recipients, and in direct contravention of the will of Congress.” 
Massachusetts housing groups, the state Department of Agricultural Resources, forestry services, public health programs, and violence prevention organizations are just some of the groups left reeling from abrupt cuts. 
In a separate suit filed in March, before the recent complaint from state AGs, organizations that fight against discrimination in housing organizations sued to “quite literally keep the lights on.” A US District Court judge in Massachusetts granted a temporary restraining order reinstating 78 Fair Housing Initiatives Program grants. 
These cuts came “arbitrarily and without notice, reason, or sensible explanation,” the housing organizations argued, and suddenly losing the funding would cause immediate and irreparable harm. 
The axe also fell on violence prevention organizations like Chelsea-based Roca, which saw a $6 million grant terminated for not being aligned with the agency priorities. Health Resources in Action, a Boston-based non-profit public health equity organization and one of the five named plaintiffs in a national class action suit, is among a group of community organizations suing the Trump administration for slashing Department of Justice grants because of changed priorities. 
In the suit, which received a hearing in federal court in Washington, DC, on Thursday, the community organization coalition argues that the use of the boilerplate language when the Office of Justice Programs ended more than 370 multi-year agreements and grants was unconstitutionally vague, exceeded the office’s authority, and did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
The group argues that the idea that the agency has broad discretion to terminate a grant already awarded because of a post-hoc change in agency position is a novel and unacceptable understanding of the grant termination provision.  
It also argues that the cuts are a constitutional violation, bypassing Congress’s appropriations authority and ignoring separation of powers. 
The DOJ is asking to dismiss the suit. The groups, it said, accuse the administration of “blindly terminating various grant agreements ‘en masse’ so that it can avoid spending congressionally appropriated funds,” adding, “These accusations are unfounded and wrong.” 
In the Trump administration’s view, the DOJ reviewed several thousand “competitive, discretionary grants” to assess whether those grants aligned with current agency priorities, deciding to terminate 376 grant agreements. It intends to reallocate those funds to “new projects that more directly advance agency priorities.” 
Along with asking that funds be reinstated, the community groups want an injunction and declaration that the DOJ’s interpretation of the right to terminate a grant based on its alignment with agency priorities is incorrect. 
In the suit filed this week, the attorneys general do not ask to stop any particular grant cut, but rather seek a legal declaration on the meaning of the OMB “priorities” clause. According to the court docket, the government has not yet submitted a response.
The Department of Justice is one of the named defendants and is representing the heads of OMB, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and he National Science Foundation. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment in an email on Thursday. 
The states and programs in question receive billions of dollars in federal funding each year, the lawsuit asserts. Beyond the funds that the administration has already attempted to cut off, there are ongoing grant programs to which the organizations are planning to apply. 
These attorneys general and the impacted organizations are worried not just about the impacts of the funds already stopped mid-stream, but also the fate of future grant awards.
Indeed, a national fair housing group filed suit on the same day, arguing that “HUD is flouting its obligation to administer a fair housing grant program established and funded by Congress.” The agency is refusing to spend appropriated funds, the lawsuit argues, cutting off its usual grant awards schedule midstream. 
HUD has not awarded any new grants or asked Congress to revoke already approved funds for these new grants, and because any funds that are not assigned by September will expire, the agency’s inaction “risks the complete loss of the appropriated funds.” 
Each of the groups and states bringing the array of lawsuits argue that the damage goes beyond even the significant funding loss, and that they are already feeling the urgency.
Attorney Lisa Newman, representing the violence prevention coalition, told US District Court Judge Amit Mehta on Thursday that the erosion of trust and damage to reputation to these on-the-ground violence prevention groups, built up over decades, “cannot be overstated.” The groups have made promises to community members who will assume that the organizations are backing away from their obligations, she said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As many as 40 employees of the Indiana Department of Child Services could lose their jobs under a reorganization eliminating three layers of management, which agency leaders said would improve communication and decision-making.
The agency protecting Hoosier children from abuse and neglect announced the changes Friday. They go into effect July 1.
  Department of Child Services Director Adam Krupp
DCS Director Adam Krupp said the layoffs won’t put children at risk because “these are not the folks on the front line.”
Instead, the employees are part of middle and upper management that Krupp is reducing so that family case managers have a more direct line to authority. Between 16 and 40 employees could be laid off, depending on if some accept new lower-paying positions.
“This is going to reduce the opportunity for communication breakdowns and it’s going to reduce the delay in decision-making,” he said. “I very much believe this will improve our outcomes in terms of focusing on child safety and working closely with families, whether it be on the prevention side or the intervention side.”
The behemoth agency has more than 4,040 employees, with almost 1,800 family case managers who handle daily interactions with children and families.
“All Hoosier children deserve a safe place to lay their head at night, and our most vulnerable kids often need an extra layer of security. Things are not working as well as they should at DCS, but we are going to change that,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “With this entrepreneurial plan, we will remove layers of inefficient middle management and bureaucracy and instead redirect resources to frontline services like foster care and family case workers to keep kids safe.”
It is estimated the state could save between $4 million and $8 million from restructuring – dubbed Project Awaken — but that money could also be redirected to child safety efforts.
DCS Regions before and after
 
Krupp talked with the ICC and went through the nine layers of employees currently in the agency, from him all the way down to family case managers. The reorganization will eliminate a level of assistant deputy directors and several others.
The state will also move from 18 different regions — each with its own manager — to five. The agency said it looked at caseloads, square mileage and staff to help determine the regions, generally aligning with a central region and four quadrants.
He noted that these regions had slowly developed their own microcultures, or 18 different ways of doing things. The streamlining will result in more consistent policies.
“Executive management, right now, we are too far removed from a family case manager, and that’s not because of geographical distance. That’s simply because of all the layers of communication, information flow and decision-making,” Krupp said.

He added the state will continue to hire family case managers, noting it’s a constant cycle of turnover and training.
“It never really stops,” Krupp said.
He said currently the agency needs between 175 and 195 more family case managers to meet statutory caseload ratios. DCS has long struggled with retention due to the stress of the job and the three months needed for training.
There was a brief move during the General Assembly session to eliminate those caseload rules, but Krupp said that is not a priority. He said lawmakers considered giving the agency more flexibility.
As part of the restructuring, the legal division will also be aligned under the new regions and work more as a co-leader with regional directors. Financial and budgeting efforts have been centralized so that there is more visibility into day-to-day spending. DCS has regularly overspent its appropriation in the state budget.
Krupp added that work toward reorganization started during the transition period after the November election. The agency in May announced new mission, vision and purpose statements and this is the second phase of reorganization.

Rodgers Health Center will provide doula services to maternity patients (Suzanne King/The Beacon).When Tristin Dockery was in labor with her first son in 2021, she only had one request: To get up and walk around her hospital room.
The nurse on duty said no.
So Dockery, then 20, stayed in her uncomfortable hospital bed as one contraction followed another. It was at the height of COVID. She and her husband were alone. And Dockery didn’t think she had much choice but to do as she was told.
“We were young and we’d never had a baby,” she said. “We didn’t know what we were doing.”
Dockery, an esthetician who works and lives 50 miles east of Kansas City in Lexington, was determined that things would be different last year when she learned she was pregnant again. She turned to the Maternal and Infant Health Center (MaIH) in Lexington.
The organization provided a doula who helped Dockery through her pregnancy and the first months after she gave birth.
“I had someone who was going to be there,” Dockery said, “who was going to help me focus on what I needed and what I wanted.”
On June 26, Altruism Inc., the nonprofit that runs the MaIH Center in Lexington, will open a second center. This one is in Kansas City’s urban Westside neighborhood.
The new Kansas City center, opening in partnership with Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center, will share space with the health center’s maternity care clinic at 2121 Summit St. and be called the MaIH Center at Sam Rodgers.
Putting doula care and other nonclinical support services in the same space with maternal health is an effort to remove a potential barrier that could keep expectant parents from getting all the services they need, said Janelle Harvey Jordan, chief operating officer at the Samuel Rodgers center.
“We’re trying to help mothers by having everything in one area,” Jordan said. Offering doula services provides “an avenue for new moms to have better outcomes.”
 What is a doula?

Doulas don’t provide medical care, but they establish relationships with patients and answer questions, give advice and offer support. They also advocate for patients, helping them communicate with their medical provider.
Studies show that the extra attention and education significantly boosts maternal outcomes, lowering the risk of cesarean deliveries by 47% and cutting the chance of preterm deliveries by 29%. Doulas also improve by 46% the rate at which new parents show up for postpartum medical checkups.
Once considered a perk only for those who could afford it, doulas are increasingly seen as an important tool in the effort to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce pregnancy-related deaths in poor and underserved communities.
In fact, last year Medicaid programs in both Missouri and Kansas began covering doula services. In its emergency rule granting the coverage last fall, Missouri’s Department of Social Services cited “an immediate danger to public health, safety or welfare of pregnant women in Missouri” as the reason doula services should be covered.
It is one of the changes Missouri’s Medicaid program has made in recent years to try to improve the state’s concerning maternal mortality rate.
According to data collected by KFF, a health policy research organization, Missouri’s maternal mortality rate between 2018 and 2022 was 24 deaths per 100,000 live births, and Kansas’ was 23 deaths per 100,000 live births. For the United States overall, the rate was 23.
But in Missouri the pregnancy-related mortality rate was three times worse for Black people than for white people. And in Kansas, more than half of pregnancy-related deaths were people who identified as racial and ethnic minorities.
In both states, pregnancy mortality reviews found that most deaths related to pregnancy were preventable.
According to the March of Dimes, more than 20% of Missouri infants were born to people who did not get adequate prenatal care. And in Kansas, the organization found that almost 17% of infants were born to people who didn’t get adequate prenatal care.
 Balancing the scales

Tonia Wright, Altruism’s CEO, is confident that making doula care available to more expectant parents will mean that more people get the care they need, and that will help balance the scales.
“In Missouri, a woman who is covered by Medicaid is seven times more likely to have a pregnancy-associated death,” Wright said. “By allowing doulas to bill for their services, it’s leveling the playing field between Medicaid-covered pregnant people and privately insured pregnant people.”
Wright, whose marketing firm, Grace Advertising & Consulting Inc., has long advised health care organizations, decided after the pandemic to form a nonprofit to help smaller health-related organizations. At first she thought she would help them with marketing and advocacy. But then she saw an even greater need and decided to tackle health disparities directly.
“The statistics in Missouri about maternal and infant health were just landing hard,” she said. “COVID had ripped the veil and really laid bare what was happening, especially for poor white women, Black women and Hispanic women. I could not escape the research studies, the news stories. So I pivoted.”
That’s when she founded the MaIH Center in Lexington.
It offers doulas for free to clients without insurance. The Kansas City center will do the same.
People who have doula care tend to have better outcomes, Wright said, because their needs are more likely met. Someone with access to government food assistance and regular health checkups — services a doula might help set up for a client — is less likely to have gestational diabetes, pregnancy-related high blood pressure and even postpartum depression. Those are all leading causes of maternal deaths.
Dockery said her doula, Shariah Edwards, helped her deal with severe morning sickness, which lasted her entire second pregnancy. She helped Dockery write a birth plan, so when she went into labor her wishes about medication and other things would already be in her medical chart.
And Edwards was with Dockery at the hospital for her labor and delivery, making sure her plan was followed. After Dockery’s second son was born, Edwards stayed by her side, Dockery said, helping her deal with postpartum depression.
“She came to my house,” she said. “She watched the baby so I could take a nap. She offered to help me clean up. And she really just sat with me a lot and talked through it all.”
 Doulas aren’t new to Sam Rodgers

Doulas are not new to the maternity care the Samuel Rodgers center provides. The community health clinic, a federally qualified health clinic, participated in a program funded by UnitedHealthcare to encourage new approaches to prenatal and postpartum care.
The center experimented with multicultural outreach campaigns, emphasized screenings to identify patients facing social barriers to care and offered patients help signing up for Medicaid, government food aid and other community programs.
The result, according to a UnitedHealthcare blog post, was a 30% increase in behavioral health and dental care for obstetric patients, a 3.6% improvement in full-term births and a 90% improvement in people showing up for postnatal care appointments.
And in 2023, the Samuel Rodgers center received a $2 million grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration to continue this work, which included offering doula care.
The health center’s new partnership with Altruism is helping extend that work again. It’s not hard to find benefits to giving patients the extra support a doula provides, said Bob Theis, Sam Rodgers’ chief executive officer.
Helping a pregnant person maintain a healthy pregnancy not only makes that birthing person healthier, it makes their new baby healthier.
“Having a good prenatal care program results in healthy birth weight babies and healthy birth weight babies bring stronger children into the world,” Theis said.
And caring for a baby at a healthy weight can cost a fraction of what it takes to care for a baby who comes into the world early or underweight. Theis said a low birth-weight baby’s care might cost 10 times more than a baby born at a healthy weight.
At least by the measure of birth weight, Sam Rodgers’ efforts to promote and improve prenatal care are paying off. Theis said the center’s percentage of low birth-weight babies fell to 5.5% in 2024 from 8% four years earlier.
Extending doula care by partnering with Altruism, he said, will add to that success.
“We’re building healthy kids in our community,” Theis said, “because one day I’m going to retire, and I want to make sure that we’re building a strong community of strong children to take care of me when I’m ready.”

Laura Kelly, left, and Kansas Department of Labor secretary Amber Shultz, right, announce the launch of the state's new online unemployment system Nov. 22, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas program aimed at preventing unemployment fraud has been caught in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The U.S. Department of Labor in May canceled $400 million in unemployment insurance grants across the country. Included within the grant funding was language that the Trump administration associated with DEI initiatives, such as studying the “equity of the unemployment system” and an “equitable access director.”
A spokesperson for the department said the cuts were “part of the administration’s ongoing effort to remove unlawful DEI programs across government.”
But at the Kansas Department of Labor, the rescission didn’t eliminate any DEI programs.
Instead, it defunded a program that implemented identity verification tools, fraud analytics and safeguards to prevent criminal attacks and system failures, which were crucial in the wake of record volumes of fraudulent claims during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amber Shultz, Kansas labor secretary, wrote a letter Thursday to U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, expressing her “deep concern and disappointment” over the federal government’s decision, which she called “both confusing and contradictory.”
“The rationale of canceling a grant specifically intended to detect and prevent fraud is, frankly, counterproductive,” Shultz said in the letter.
Kansas forfeited $1 million of the $1.7 million total without forewarning.
“Revoking this support now leaves states more vulnerable to the very threats we were all called to confront,” Shultz said.
She called the funding loss “a huge blow,” and said she anticipates that employers and claimants will feel the impacts, which could mean slower claims processes.
The termination notice the state received from the federal government reasoned that the grant “no longer effectuates the department’s priorities for its grant funding.”
Communication between the state and federal departments has been nonexistent. Shultz said in a phone call that she and department staff have been attempting to communicate with the federal department, without any response.
A statement to Kansas Reflector attributed to a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said America’s unemployment system is in an “infrastructure crisis, riddled with waste, fraud and abuse.”
The statement said the Biden administration squandered its opportunity to fix the system by focusing “on equitable access rather than advancing access for all Americans in need.”
Shultz said none of the funding for Kansas’ unemployment insurance fraud prevention grant program was used for DEI initiatives.
The federal department is fulfilling its goal, Shultz said, “if they want fraudsters to have equitable access to our funds.”
A different grant from the U.S. Department of Labor under the Biden administration, called the equity grant, gave Kansas more than $4.5 million, which the state used to ensure all Kansans could access the unemployment system. That meant focusing on rural Kansans without broadband access, Shultz said.
With the federal funding, the state fraud prevention program was able to conduct investigations and recover funds lost to fraudulent claims. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kansas and many other states faced extreme volumes of unemployment fraud, largely from international crime rings, which took advantage of aged and vulnerable claims systems. Kansas recently recovered $11 million in fraudulent claims, which totaled around 2.4% of the $460 million in state and federal funds lost during the pandemic.
The federal department’s Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office have pressed states across the country to improve fraud prevention and recovery efforts.
“Yet now we are asked to do so with fewer tools, fewer resources, and diminished federal partnership,” Shultz said in the letter to Chavez-DeRemer. “That not only undermines the substantial progress already made, but it also weakens our readiness for future crises.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/241122_unempP-01-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-27 10:01:53.693125

Though advocates say school choice programs are necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools, critics argue these efforts drain critical funds and resources from school districts.The committee proposed $4 billion a year in tax credits beginning in 2027 for people donating to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships.The tax credit provision mirrored a bill that GOP lawmakers — Sen.

Mike Dunleavy has canceled a bipartisan proposal that would have allowed rural school districts to maintain teacher housing with money from the state’s rural schools fund.
House Bill 174, from Rep. Robyn Niayuq Burke, D-Utqiagvik, passed the House and Senate by a combined 54-5-1 margin.
The vote count led lawmakers to raise the possibility of overriding the veto.
Burke, reached by phone on Thursday, said that when she heard about the veto, she immediately sent a text to the group chat shared by members of the House’s coalition majority.
“The response was, yes, let’s override,” she said.
It would take 40 votes from the 60 members of the combined House and Senate to override the governor’s decision on HB 174, and a vote isn’t expected until the Legislature convenes in January.
If enacted, HB 174 would allow small school districts to use the state’s Regional Educational Attendance Area fund for major maintenance at district-owned housing.
It would also allow Mount Edgecumbe High School, the state-operated boarding school in Sitka, to use the fund for major maintenance. Currently, the high school is maintained using funds from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
HB 174 also would remove a $70 million cap on the size of the REAA fund, allowing the Legislature to stock that account with more money.
In his veto message to the Legislature, the governor said that enacting HB 174 would diminish the equity across school districts “and commits the state to a local housing obligation, diverting already scarce dollars away from critical classroom repairs and complicating grant rankings.”
The message also said that the repeal of the cash cap on the REAA fund could allow general-purpose dollars to accumulate “without project deadlines and adding ongoing operating costs to the state.”
That latter comment is a reference to the bill’s fiscal note, which said that the state would have to hire two new employees to deal with the change and that there would be other costs associated with implementing HB 174.
Burke said the veto wasn’t a surprise and that the governor’s legislative office had tried to reach her about the bill, but that meeting didn’t take place before the legislative session ended.
Burke is a graduate of Mount Edgecumbe, as is her mother, grandmother and grandfather. Other lawmakers, including Sen. Donny Olson, D-Golovin, have tried to advance HB 174-like legislation in prior legislative sessions, without success.
In 2024, a similar bill passed the Senate but died in the House Finance Committee. 
“There’s a lot of excitement about it,” Burke said.
“I’m sure they’re pretty disappointed,” she said of the bill’s advocates, “because they’ve been working on that for quite a while. I’m frustrated, disappointed, not surprised, and will look forward to overriding it.”
Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, is a longtime advocate for Mount Edgecumbe. The Beacon’s call about the veto was the first he had heard of it, “but it doesn’t surprise me,” he said.
Stedman said that while it’s possible that the Legislature could override the governor’s decision, doing so is tough, “because the governor runs blocking maneuvers — no matter who the governor is, that’s just business, right? So it’s easy for him to pick off a few votes.”
It’s also a rural issue, which adds to the difficulty of gaining support, Stedman said.
The veto is “unfortunate for Edgecumbe,” Stedman said, “but there’ll be another governor in a year and a half, and we’ll give it to the next governor.”
So far this year, Dunleavy has vetoed five policy bills in addition to his line-item budget vetoes. Since taking office in December 2018, Dunleavy has vetoed 14 policy bills, a low number by historical standards.
But since 2014, the number of bills passed by the Legislature has dwindled, legislative statistics show. As a proportion of the number of bills passed by lawmakers, Dunleavy is vetoing at an above-average rate when compared to prior governors.

June 20, 2025. | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFor more than a century the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan has been home to a wide collection of materials documenting social unrest, protest, and various movements that were at a time considered radical. 
Referred to in the 1930s as “probably the most complete record of the social unrest of our times that has ever been assembled,” the collection holds books, periodicals, pamphlets, recordings of speeches and protest songs and other artifacts from movements including anarchism, feminism, labor, civil rights and anti-colonialism. 
Housed in the university’s Special Collections Research Center, the Labadie Collection is also home to one of the largest and most heavily-used stores of transgender history in the country.
While the university already boasted a strong collection of materials on trans history in 2000, that collection would be bolstered considerably through a donation from the National Transgender Library and Archives, which began as the collection of Dallas Denny.
A search for identity and information
“I knew I was transsexual by the time I was 12 or 13 and I remember the summer before I started the ninth grade. My father had retired from the Army, and we moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and I pedaled my bicycle to the library there and looked up every word I knew, which was very little,” Denny said.

She found two books. 
“One of them was in reserve, which meant I’d have to ask the librarian for it because I was just 13, and I was unwilling to do that because I felt like she would probably get in touch with my parents and my life would be over,” Denny said. 
The other was in circulation, but Denny was unable to find it on the shelves. Last she checked, after graduating from high school, it still was not available. 
“I was looking for information all through college and just not finding anything, you know, [an] occasional article in a magazine or something, but nowhere to go for help, nowhere to go for information, nowhere to go for support,” Denny said. 
After completing graduate school in 1979, Denny discovered there was a gender clinic at Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville, where she lived at the time. 
“I went there, and they turned me down, they turned down most people, but on the grounds that, essentially, I was not dysfunctional enough to be transsexual because I had two college degrees, because I worked as a child protective services worker for the state of Tennessee, because I was sexually attracted to women, because I had been married,” Denny said.  
Upon visiting the medical library, their material backed up the hospital’s findings, because those materials were generated by the clinics, Denny said. 
Denny later found a group for heterosexual crossdressers. While they did not allow trans members, Denny joined, holding her breath in hopes that they would be in touch with someone with information about her identity. 
After about five months, a member came in with a magazine called Transgender Tapestry, which held a support group in Atlanta. 
“They gave me information I’ve been looking for my whole life,” Denny said. 

Shhh, NTL&A, V. 2 No. 0, in AEGIS News No. 3 
After she was recruited to help run the support group in 1988, which she did for a year, Denny went on to found the American Educational Gender Information Service, or AEGIS in 1990, publishing pamphlets, medical bulletins and a magazine, while providing services including a 24-hour trans help line.
“My reasoning was, you know, if I am well educated and I am smart and I am literate and I couldn’t find information, how many other people are out there in a similar situation?” Denny said. 
The ‘90s was largely a print culture, Denny said, and she was exchanging newsletters with more than 100 other organizations around the world. Publishers would send her books, and whenever she’d attend a trans conference, Denny said she’d buy everything that was for sale. 
While she’d started with zero information about her identity, Denny’s collection would go on to fill two big rooms in the house she was renting. 
“I started realizing that, you know, the history of people like me was pretty much scattered through history and mostly lost, and there seemed to be little interest in rediscovering that history,” Denny said, noting that she founded another group, the Transgender Historical Society. 
Denny donated her collection of materials to AEGIS in 1993, marking the start of the National Transgender Library and Archives, however, the advent of the internet would mark the decline of brick and mortar nonprofits like Denny’s. 
While people would previously write in requesting information, receiving a response a week or two later, the internet had rendered that model obsolete, Denny said. Now individuals could share information with a wide audience for almost no cost. 
AEGIS transitioned away from a paper and stamp organization into one based on the internet, rebranding as Gender Education and Advocacy in 1998. However, that left the question of what to do with the organization’s considerable print collection.

Finding a new home for the archive
Ultimately, the organization put out a request for proposals to house the materials on January 13, 2000 and received a number proposals, which Denny said came down to two finalists: The University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan. 
As part of the criteria for applicants, Denny said the materials had to be stored in a physically and intellectually safe location, which had secured funding for the foreseeable future.
While the University of Minnesota had a long history of working with trans people, Denny said the University of Michigan was selected due to the Labadie Collection’s focus on social movements that were often unpopular. 
“I felt like it would be intellectually secure there, and it wouldn’t be reinterpreted as a gay and lesbian history instead of a trans history,” Denny said. 
It also helped that the University of Michigan had a building to house the materials, while Minnesota did not.

Labadie Collection)






 
Prior to acquiring the National Transgender Library and Archives, the Joseph A. Labadie collection already held a multitude of materials on transgender movements due to its strong LGBT collection, Curator Julie Herrada told the Michigan Advance.
When the call for proposals went out, Gender Education and Advocacy board member Sandra Cole, a professor who founded the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Gender Services Program, recommended the university apply. 
On taking a deeper look at the materials, Herrada realized the collection spanned a number of topics from medical materials on surgery and psychology to items on public health, law and cultural materials tied to LGBTQ movements. While the collection was too large to take into the Labadie Collection, Herrada said she’d gathered other units and staff within the library system and asked about working together to collect the materials and house them within their relevant departments. 
“Surprisingly, everybody was really on board with it and said that they would also make it a priority for access so it wouldn’t sit uncatalogued for however many years,” Herrada said. 
Upon collecting letters from the community to submit alongside her proposal to Gender Education Advocacy, Herrada found an outpouring of support. 
“That was real eye opening for me that there was this whole community of people out there that were advocating not only for the trans community, but for us to have this, create the space for this collection, and to maybe make it grow,” Herrada said. 
After making her case to the head of the library on the logistical matters needed to process, catalog in addition to transporting the materials from Atlanta, Georgia to Michigan, Herrada said the obvious support from the community made their case much stronger. 
Herrada oversaw the packing and shipping of the materials from their home in Atlanta to their new location in Ann Arbor, in September 2000, and on March 25, 2004 the university held a dedication of the National Transgender Library and Archives with Denny as the guest of honor.

While the original collection has long since been fully cataloged, Herrada says Denny still regularly sends them materials to add to their holdings. 
With the acquisition of the National Transgender Library and Archives in 2000 and the university’s previous holdings, Herrada said the collection has seen individuals traveling from across the world to utilize its holdings. While other universities have collected materials on transgender people, U of M was one of the first, she said. 
Having these materials available to individuals from across the globe fulfills both Denny’s personal mission of providing people with information to make sane decisions about their lives, while preserving a rich history Denny said she would hate to see lost.
Additionally, the University of Michigan was the first institution to partner with the Digital Transgender Archive, Herrada said, with Denny sending materials to the archive first for scanning, before the materials are passed on to the Labadie Collection. 
While most libraries require individuals to put in a request to view archived materials, Denny, who serves on the archive’s board, said the Digital Transgender Archive serves as a way for people to have easy access to information on trans life and history. 
Holding the line amid national backlash
Over the years, many of the movements documented within the Labadie collection have become more mainstream, Herrada noted, pointing to the growing acceptance of lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals since they began collecting materials on those communities. 
“I don’t know if I could say that we’re sort of at the forefront for making these movements more mainstream and more accepted and more accessible, but that’s part of the plan, I think,” Herrada said. “We need to have access to this material, because a lot of it is inaccessible otherwise.”
As the federal government takes aim at several marginalized groups throughout the nation under the guise of opposing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Herrada said it’s more important than ever to dig in their heels and to not only maintain, but strengthen the commitment to having these materials available. 
While the Labadie Collection has not faced any threats to its holdings on transgender individuals, Herrada said there have been some discussions around being more aware and tightening security on materials given the national climate. 
Denny shared her own concerns about holdings at other institutions, noting that the previously-independent Kinsey Institute, which holds a vast collection of materials on human sexuality, had merged with Indiana University. With Indiana state law barring the university from using state funds for the institute and the university board facing a conservative takeover, Denny expects further attacks on the institute’s funding, raising concern that institute’s materials may be less accessible in the future. 
  Rep. Lorissa Sweet, R-Wabash introduced the amendment to strip public funding for the Kinsey Institute during a hearing on the state budget in February 2023. (Screenshot of annual report.)
While she’s a bit concerned about the University of Michigan, due to the University’s decision to eliminate its diversity equity and inclusion office and halt work on its DEI 2.0 strategic plan, Denny held greater concern for the Kinsey Institute.
In addition to threats at the university level, local libraries have become a battleground as conservative groups seek to ban or sequester materials with LGBTQ+ themes. 
Alongside the University of Michigan, Denny has supplied materials to the University of Victoria in British Columbia’s transgender archives and other collections documenting trans history.
Denny noted she didn’t want all transgender materials centralized in one location due to the possibility of war or natural disaster and that she was glad there were a number of places to access these materials alongside those that had been digitized and were available online.
“Transgender people are, and probably were, and probably still are, famous for purging. They’re like, ‘I can’t be like this.’ And they’ll get rid of everything and often they just throw it in the trash or burn it,” Denny said, noting that a lot of times materials people were looking to get rid of would appear at conferences.
Now, unlike when she was 13, there is a wealth of material for trans individuals, Denny said. 
“All it was really about in all of my work was for people to have information, to make competent decisions about their lives, because if you know nothing you can’t do that” she said.

A year after the U.S. Supreme Court granted cities more authority to clear homeless encampments, how much has California’s homelessness crisis changed? 
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains — along with Lisa Halverstadt from Voice of San Diego and Aaron Schrank from LAist — the landmark Grants Pass v. Johnson ruling allowing local authorities to arrest unhoused people for sleeping in public spaces has empowered cities across California to ramp up efforts to sweep encampments, or pass more punitive anti-camping rules.
In Los Angeles for example, the police department made 68% more camping arrests in the second half of 2024 (after the court ruling), compared to the first. But last March, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency found that while 94% of people targeted under the camping ordinance wanted shelter, only 17% were able to secure it.
That includes Deadra Walicki, a 51-year-old unhoused person living near Van Nuys Boulevard in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley. In a span of 16 months — from August 2023 through December 2024 — the LAPD cited Walicki 34 times for illegal camping.
Walicki, for the most part, ignores the citations because she has neither the money to pay the fines nor a phone to contact her case manager. She lives in an encampment with her male partner, and says she wants both of them to be admitted into separate gender-segregated shelters at the same time. This, however, hasn’t happened yet.

Walicki: “The cops come here Monday through Friday and give tickets for being in the zone of the shelter. It’s whatever they want to do.”

L.A. isn’t the only city where citations for camping and other homelessness-related offenses soared shortly after Grants Pass. After filing more than 100 public records requests, Marisa found that in San Francisco, arrests and citations increased 500%, and in San Diego and Sacramento, arrests and citations doubled and tripled, respectively.

Cutting research funds, cutting forests

Let’s dive into some federal news affecting California:

Restoring research funding: On Monday federal judges issued rulings to restore hundreds of science research grants, including about 430 in California, which President Donald Trump’s administration initially canceled earlier this year as part of an effort to cut funding for programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. The frozen funds affected research related to, among other things: dementia, vaccines and health disparities among women and the LGBTQ+ community. The administration has filed appeals for some of the rulings, and it remains unclear when the money will be restored. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Removing forest protections: The Trump administration said it plans to rescind a rule developed under the Clinton administration that could result in the lifting of bans on logging and road construction within parts of national forests, including more than 4 million acres throughout California. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture said this would prevent fires, but some experts argue that timber harvesting may actually promote more flammable fuels in forests.

Banning ultra-processed food from school meals?

The state Senate is considering a bill that would get rid of food containing chemical additives — such as stabilizers, coloring and flavoring agents — in school meals by 2035.
As CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang explains, the proposal by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel has strong bipartisan support, and aligns with both Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to limit the harms of ultra-processed foods, and the federal administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign.

Gabriel, an Encino Democrat: “Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”

But a coalition of food and beverage manufacturers and other business groups oppose the measure, arguing that it makes consumers inaccurately perceive all ultra-processed food as unsafe. Pizza, for example, has ingredients such as dough conditioners and stabilizers to keep them shelf stable.

Dennis Albiani, a coalition spokesperson and president of Capitol Advocates lobbying firm: “Healthy products are going to be pulled in and labeled as ultra-processed, which in the lexicon of America means dangerous and unhealthy.”

California could lose votes in the electoral college and suffer economic setbacks if President Trump’s immigration crackdown deters people from moving to the state.


It hasn’t happened yet, but California is bracing for a demographic and economic hit under President Donald Trump’s multi-pronged effort to limit the entry of people born abroad and deport those already in the U.S.
In fact, during the last Trump administration, California’s population declined in part because immigration to the state slowed down after the White House put up increased obstacles to enter the U.S., according to the state’s chief demographer, though COVID-19 didn’t help. The Newsom administration is worried about history repeating itself enough to cite Trump’s immigration policies as an economic risk in the state budget forecasts.
Key business sectors, including hospitality and construction, rely on the labor of workers in the U.S. without legal authorization, who themselves are a small portion of California’s immigrant population. The state’s leading tech companies, major drivers of state wealth, overwhelmingly employ highly educated people born abroad.And all these people help California maintain its population and its status as the state with the most electoral college votes during presidential elections.A full third of the state’s prime working-age population is made up of immigrants, including immigrants in the country without authorization. That latter group represents roughly a tenth of the state’s workers, said Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at UC Davis who studies the economic impact of immigrants. And despite popular rhetoric, California workers living here without legal authorization fill jobs that few legal residents want.
Most of the undocumented workers in California have been here for a long time — an average of 15 years, Peri said.“They have family and they have kids who are American citizens normally,” Peri said. “So these are people very well integrated in the economy of California.”
More than a quarter of the state’s population was born abroad; double the national average. Nearly half of California’s children were born to an immigrant parent and more than half of California’s immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens.
Plus, California’s immigrant community is diverse: 49% are originally from Latin American countries and 41% from Asia. For the past decade, more immigrants from Asia came to California than from Latin America.After Trump directed a pause in immigration raids at farms, hotels and restaurants two weeks ago, days later he doubled down again on those industries and targeted major cities in a social media post.“We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center,” he wrote.A large business group, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, released a statement this month that said it’s “deeply concerned by recent enforcement actions that have disrupted the well-being of our communities, compromised public safety, and threatened the stability of our local economy.”Here are three ways an immigration crackdown could affect California.
Congressional seats and the electoral college
California is on track to lose at least one more congressional seat after the U.S. Census counts all the residents in the country in 2030 — and Trump’s policies on legal and illegal immigration could further erode the state’s electoral college dominance.For much of the last three decades, more residents in California have moved to other states than out-of-state residents have moved to California. But the overall population loss to out-migration is offset by the sheer number of immigrants attracted to California. Though the trend has slowed down lately, the state is home to the largest number of immigrants in the country — about a fifth of the total U.S. immigrant population.
“If that immigration stops, then that’s going to have some real consequences for our population growth and ultimately for our representation, for sure,” said Eric McGhee, a demographer and politics researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California.
By representation, he means both the number of House seats California is apportioned after the census and, by extension, the number of electoral college votes the state is given (which is calculated by adding a state’s House seats and U.S. Senate seats).
Because Congress capped the number of House members to 435 nearly a century ago, a state basically needs to grow its population at a higher rate than the national average to gain seats. California didn’t do that in the previous decade; as a result, it lost a House seat for the first time in state history in 2021. 
The electoral math concerning immigration in national elections is nuanced, though. People in the U.S. without legal authorization are counted in the U.S. Census. So, if Trump’s immigration raids lead to a large decline of people in the country without proper legal status, that affects California’s overall population. But Florida and Texas, the largest states that now regularly support Republican candidates in presidential elections, also have large numbers of people without proper legal status.California has an estimated 1.8 million here without authorization, down a million from a decade ago. Texas has 1.6 million and Florida 1.2 million. That means those states have a slightly larger percentage of people here without proper legal status than California, according to tallies by the Pew Research Center.But those states are also domestic net-migration winners; they gain more people from out of state than they lose to other states.One major reason California loses so many people is the high cost of housing. McGhee says high living costs are also increasingly a drag on the state’s attractiveness to new international arrivals.Bottomline, “if you’re interfering with immigration flows to California, that’s going to hurt the state’s growth,” said McGhee. “Unless we can somehow start to attract people back to the state  from other states and reverse that out-migration.”But “that doesn’t seem likely to happen anytime soon,” he added. 
California relies on undocumented labor
Workers without proper legal status “have allowed the economy of California to grow in many sectors,” Peri said. They work in fields that U.S. legal residents generally don’t want, either because they have higher levels of education, want higher incomes or have retired.A report released last week by UC Merced and the business-focused think tank Bay Area Council Economic Institute estimated that removing all undocumented immigrants from California would decrease economic activity by $275 billion, or 9% of the state’s GDP. That figure includes both direct labor by undocumented workers and the economic output generated by their and their employer businesses’ spending. 
In construction, mass deportations would curb GDP by 16%, and in agriculture, 14%, the report’s authors found. Undocumented immigrants make up more than a quarter of the workforce in both industries. 
They also found about 11% of the state’s small business owners are undocumented, as well as about 700,000 of the state’s homeowners — about a third of the state’s undocumented population.

“Most of this population has very deep and longstanding ties to the state of California,” said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “They’re really embedded in our economy, both in dollars and cents and institutional knowledge” on job sites.Three-quarters of U.S. registered voters — including 59% who backed Trump — said they agreed that immigrants without proper authorization mostly fill jobs that American citizens don’t want, The Pew Research Center reported in 2024.
California adults without legal authorization work at much higher rates than the overall workforce. Around 85% of California adults without authorization to stay in the country work, Peri said; the comparable figure for the state’s overall working age population is around 62%.“They don’t have access to any of the welfare support that a citizen will have, because they are undocumented, and so the only source of income for them is really work,” Peri said. That’s in spite of the fact that they contribute billions of dollars in tax revenue to local, state and federal governments, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
If Trump’s immigration raids and deportation efforts force these workers to leave, “companies will start leaving California because they cannot find the construction workers, the farm workers; hotel and hospitality will become smaller because you don’t have this type of worker,” said Peri. And companies are limited by how much more they can pay workers to attract new employees before the price of their goods exceeds what buyers can afford. That affects U.S.-born workers and legal residents, as well, who’d have fewer job openings as companies stall their growth plans.
But undocumented immigrants’ concentration in low-wage industries has also made them vulnerable. State labor officials have found undocumented immigrants to be particularly at risk of wage theft and other exploitation, and have focused their enforcement efforts in industries that disproportionately employ such workers such as car washes, garment factories and janitorial services. 
How immigrants drive California’s economy
Peri said that when we talk about immigration overall, there’s an even larger positive effect on the economy, since half of recent immigrants are college-educated and so are big players in founding companies and helping lead California in science and technology.“And so the wage impact of immigration in total, there is no evidence that is depressing wages,” he said.An immigration crackdown may prompt a growing number of would-be or recent immigrants to reconsider California or the U.S., said experts with the California Department of Finance, a state agency in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office.
They might be thinking, “why am I going to invest and build something in California or the United States?” said Somjita Mitra, chief economist in the forecasting division of the Department of Finance.Case in point: two-thirds of Silicon Valley workers were born abroad, according to a 2025 report by Joint Venture Silicon Valley. Tech companies and the high compensation they pay workers are a chief source of state revenue for California.There’s evidence that Trump’s policies slows down immigration to California. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, about 211,000 immigrants moved to California, according to data from the Department of Finance. By 2018-19, a couple of years into Trump’s first term but before the COVID-19 pandemic, that figure drops to 159,000 individuals.“Some of it is slowing down what’s happening at foreign embassies, making them come multiple times for multiple vetting sessions, slowing their processing down,” said Walter Schwarm, the finance department’s chief demographer.The figure rebounded in the latter half of Joe Biden’s presidency to more than 220,000 new international arrivals. It does not include immigrants without proper legal status.

And the vast majority of immigrants are between the ages of 28 and 40, “so they really form a core of the labor force,” he added, especially as more U.S.-born Californians retire.The country lost out on at least $335 billion in economic growth because of a slowdown in foreign-born workers between 2016 and 2022, a period that includes Trump’s first term and the COVID-19 pandemic, found Madeline Zavodny, an economist who wrote a 2024 paper for the National Foundation for American Policy.Trump’s immigration sweeps and the fear they induce are also prompting immigrants to shop and spend less, which is a drain on the economy. “If there’s a lot of uncertainty, if there’s a lot of confusion, it kind of makes people not want to go out and spend their money,” Mitra said.“The fact of the matter is, a lot of the revenue that is being generated, and a lot of the economic growth that is being generated in this country … is coming from the contributions of legal immigrants,” Schwarm said.Asked if she’s worried Trump’s immigration policies will have a detrimental effect on California’s economy, Mitra said “yes, I am worried about that.”

About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings.
The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
SC senators approve K-12 mandate that ‘a boy will use the boys’ bathroom’

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “commonsense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year.
South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law this year as part of the state budget. The mandate — initially inserted into the budget last year during the Senate’s floor debate — applies to multi-stalled school restrooms and places where students undress, to include locker rooms and gym showers.
Such directives attached to South Carolina’s state spending package — called provisos — are officially one-year laws. But they roll over from one year to the next indefinitely, unless legislators vote to take them out. There was no debate at all this year on the bathroom rule, which carries over into the fiscal year that starts Tuesday.
A lawsuit challenging it was filed in federal court last November on behalf of a transgender middle school student in Berkeley County. Attorneys for the national nonprofit Public Justice have asked for the law to be suspended pending the case’s outcome, but nothing has been decided.
In Arizona, the legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

The Legislature is considering phasing out chemical additives in school meals linked to health problems. Opponents say the definitions are so broad that it could ban items like tomato sauce and olive oil.



During the school year, kids attending schools in the Tahoe region are served cafeteria meals of ground turkey tacos, chicken or tofu bowls with brown rice, a salad bar filled with locally grown produce and other healthy items.
About 80% of breakfasts and lunches served at Tahoe-Truckee Unified School District are made from scratch without food additives such as dyes and preservatives, and nutrition workers have worked to eliminate prepackaged foods and serve minimally processed meals.
“The health of your entree is your ingredients, so we control those ingredients by cooking or making our own,” said Kat Soltanmorad, food and nutrition services director with the district.
Tahoe-Truckee Unified is part of a small but growing group of school districts in California trying to make the billion meals served in public K-12 schools every year healthier and less processed. The schools have relied on nearly $15 billion in state and federal funding over the past few years to begin making some of these changes.
Now lawmakers have set their sights on mandating improvements in school meals. A measure introduced by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino, aims to start phasing out some ultra-processed food at schools by 2028 and remove them by 2035. The bill targets foods with chemical additives, such as stabilizers, coloring and flavoring agents.
The bill doesn’t list specific foods or additives that would be banned. Instead, it tasks the state’s environmental health agency with identifying “particularly harmful” ingredients by next July. But there’s controversy brewing between the bill’s supporters and the agriculture and food manufacturing industries that worry safe products could be targeted.
For example, pizza — a favorite among students — often contains many ingredients like dough conditioners and stabilizers that manufacturers say are needed to produce the foods and keep them shelf-stable. Health experts say some are linked to cancer and other health harms. 
The bipartisan measure passed the Assembly in a 65-1 vote, with 13 members not voting, and is now being considered by the Senate. It comes on the heels of a January executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom directing the state health department to recommend how to limit harm from ultra-processed foods. The proposal also coincides with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which prioritizes chronic disease, including obesity and diabetes.
“There is a growing national awareness, particularly among parents, about how deeply what we feed our kids impacts their physical and mental health,” Gabriel said. “Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”
James Gallagher, Republican Assembly leader and co-author of the bill, said he used to be skeptical about state efforts to regulate additives like food dyes, but as he reviewed the evidence, he became convinced that kids should not consume them.
“Our kids should be eating better,” said Gallagher, a sixth-generation rice farmer from Chico. “What we all agree on really is let’s get out the most harmful ingredients that might be present in foods that are going into kids lunches.”
“Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER JESSE GABRIEL
A coalition of grocers, farmers, food and beverage manufacturers, and business groups has risen in fierce opposition to the measure. They say that creating a system that designates most groceries as ultra-processed will give consumers the false impression that their food is unsafe. 
More than 80% of products sold in grocery stores would be considered ultra-processed under the state definition, said Dennis Albiani, president of lobbying firm Capitol Advocates representing the coalition. 
“The definitions are so broad and so vague that many both healthy and determined healthy products are going to be pulled in and labeled as ultra-processed, which in the lexicon of America means dangerous and unhealthy,” Albiani said.
For example, manufacturers inject small amounts of nitrous oxide into the top of olive oil bottles to prevent the oil from oxidizing, he said. Canned goods like tomatoes and other vegetables often contain citric acid and other preservatives. Vegan and vegetarian meat supplements, which are touted as being healthy and environmentally friendly, also rely on thickeners, flavors and binders. Under the state’s proposed legislation, all of these added ingredients could classify those foods as ultra-processed, Albiani said.
First in the world to define ultra-processed
The measure would make California the first government in the world to define ultra-processed foods, according to the bill’s sponsor, the advocacy and research organization Environmental Working Group.Researchers generally consider ultra-processed foods to include ingredients like starches, fats and proteins that have been substantially modified from their original form, as well as additives like chemical binders, food dyes and flavors, and high levels of salt or sugar. Often they are high in calories and low in nutritional value.But there is no standardized definition. Under California’s definition, a food would be considered ultra-processed if it contains ingredients in nine categories: stabilizers, propellants, emulsifiers, colors, flavoring agents, flavor enhancers, surface-active ingredients, surface-finishing agents and non-nutritive sweeteners. Other food additives monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would also count.California and federal laws already include requirements that regulate the nutrition content of meals such as how much salt, fat, sugar and calories are in a serving.The measure would require the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to identify and maintain a list of “particularly harmful” ultra-processed ingredients — ones linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and other serious health problems. Schools would be required to begin phasing them out by 2028 with complete elimination by 2035. Vendors would also be prohibited from selling schools food with the identified substances.Bernadette Del Chiaro, a senior vice president with the Environmental Working Group, said the measure is “chemical neutral.” Rather than specifying which ingredients may be harmful, it allows the state’s expert toxics agency to follow the science and make that determination, she said.The legislation builds on recent laws passed in California to eliminate synthetic food dyes from school meals and certain additives from all food sold in the state that are associated with cancer, reproductive harm and behavioral problems in children. “What we’re talking about now in the 21st Century is a threat of food that isn’t really food. So it doesn’t matter if it’s low in fat or high in fat if it’s loaded with chemicals,” Del Chiaro said. Gabriel acknowledged that the bill needs work to “sharpen the definitions” as it moves through the Senate, but he also said it doesn’t ban any food, even from schools. The reality, he said, is that the environmental health agency will identify harmful ingredients that school districts and vendors will have to remove from products. “A lot of what this may boil down to is switching from one brand of oatmeal to another, or switching from this type of maple syrup product to a different product that is just maple syrup,” Gabriel said.

Although the authors say the measure is focused on school meals, Daniel Conway, vice president of government relations for the California Grocers Association, said he’s concerned that it will have implications beyond school nutrition. The ultra-processed food definition would apply to all food sold in the state even if the prohibition on “particularly harmful” ultra-processed foods is for schools only. “This is going to incorporate foods that we have otherwise been encouraging people to eat,” Conway said. “Really focus it on school nutrition and school meals, and that would go a long way to address our concerns.”Gabriel, whose previous nutrition bills have at times drawn both praise and political scorn, such as the so-called “Skittles ban,” said California’s commitment to removing harmful substances from food predates Kennedy’s rhetoric. But it helps that many of his Republican colleagues are supportive. Gallagher, the Republican co-author, said the “MAHA movement” in the Trump administration has helped give this bill momentum but agrees with Gabriel that California lawmakers have been paying attention to the issue for years. 
Link between childhood obesity and ultra-processed foods
One in five children in America is obese, and the ubiquity of processed and ultra-processed foods are a significant contributing factor, said Dr. Rohit Kohli, chief of gastroenterology at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and an expert in fatty liver disease among children.
Kohli thinks efforts to remove or limit ultra-processed foods from school meals, which low-income children in particular rely on, are a good idea. “We would see societal-level benefits from a societal change,” he said.
“In large population studies, we are seeing, unfortunately, the higher the rate of (ultra-processed food consumption) the higher the rate of obesity,” Kohli said. That’s because ultra-processed foods are usually calorie dense, he said.
Obesity and severe obesity rates among children and teens steadily increased between 1999 and 2016 in the U.S. despite some studies showing slowing growth, according to a 2018 study published in the journal Pediatrics. Severe obesity, in particular, increased among all child and adolescent age groups and populations during the study period, according to the authors. 
Children from low-income families are also more likely to have lower physical fitness and a higher risk of obesity, studies show. One of the reasons is little availability of affordable healthy food.
That makes lifestyle changes very difficult for most children and their families, Kohli said. When he speaks to overweight or obese children about their favorite foods, sugary beverages and pre-made, ultra-processed meals like pizza or fast food top the list. Those types of food are designed to be cheap, convenient and hyper-palatable, he said, which makes it hard for families to remove from their diets. 
What some schools are already doing
Some districts in California are already trying to improve upon the state and federal standards governing school meal nutrition. They’re using state grants to build new kitchens, hire chefs, train staff and renegotiate contracts with vendors and local farms.
Michael Jochner, nutrition director for Morgan Hill Unified School District, said food costs have dropped 30% over the past five years because the district switched to whole foods or “clean” packaged items. A lot of the savings come from working with local farmers, he said. 
“When you start shopping locally you have more control over the local market. You can go to a local farmer and say ‘Hey this is what I need,’ and we negotiate the price,” Jochner said. 
The changes in his district’s menu have also eliminated more than 34 pounds of sugar consumed per student each year. They did it primarily by removing sugary beverages like juice and chocolate milk and replacing sweet breakfast foods like cereal and banana bread with savory items. Breakfast includes sausage patties, bagel sandwiches and plain Greek yogurt with fruit.
Removing items high in sugar also often removed ultra-processed ingredients like binders and anti-caking agents, Jochner said. “One amazing move took out a bunch of stuff simultaneously,” he said.
In Fresno Unified School District, the third largest district in the state, 14 million meals are served to kids annually. Nutrition director Amanda Harvey said her program has also worked to reduce sugar and remove food additives. They’ve increased the whole grains served to students and do more scratch cooking. For their most popular item — a spicy chicken sandwich — they swapped out a pressed chicken patty with a breaded whole muscle, such as a thigh or breast, to eliminate a preservative that may be linked with respiratory harm and liver damage.
But Harvey said it’s unlikely any district could make 100% of meals in-house.
Schools will still need vendors, and this legislation would force them to comply or lose schools as customers. At one point, Harvey said she approached one vendor to see if it could remove several food additives and was told no.
“This would put the impetus on vendors to clean up their product,” Harvey said.

In major cities and more rural areas, arrests and citations rose in the months following last summer’s Supreme Court decision. In some places, officials insist the events are unrelated.


Homeless residents of some of California’s biggest cities increasingly are facing criminal penalties for the actions they take to survive on the street, according to a first-of-its-kind CalMatters analysis of data throughout the state.
Saturday marks the one-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson, which upended California’s homelessness strategy by allowing cities to enforce blanket bans on camping — even if no shelter beds are available. Immediately after the decision, unhoused Californians and the people who help them reported seeing an increase in enforcement. But CalMatters’ reporting, gleaned from more than 100 public records requests, appears to be the first statewide effort to quantify that increase.
CalMatters analyzed data on arrests and citations for camping and other homelessness-related offenses for 2024, comparing the six months before the June 28 Supreme Court decision to the six months after. We found increases in cities throughout the state, even in those where local leaders said they didn’t change their policy as a result of Grants Pass. 
Here are some of the places with the most significant increases, according to police data:

In San Francisco, then-mayor London Breed promised to be “very aggressive” in moving encampments following the Grants Pass decision. She delivered: Arrests and citations for illegal lodging increased from 71 in the six months before the ruling to 427 in the six months after — a 500% increase.
Even though Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass spoke out against the Grants Pass decision, calling it “disappointing” and vowing to lead with housing instead of enforcement, homelessness-related arrests increased 68% after the ruling. 
Citations and arrests doubled in San Diego, which also doubled the size of its police teams that respond to homelessness.
In Sacramento, the number of citations and arrests nearly tripled – from 96 in the six months before Grants Pass, to 283 in the six months after. From January through May 2025, Sacramento police had already issued 844 citations and arrests, suggesting enforcement continues to trend upward.
Stockton issued just 14 homelessness-related citations in the six months before the Grants Pass decision. In the six months after the ruling came out, that number jumped to 213.
It wasn’t just big cities that saw more enforcement: Citations and arrests increased by more than two-thirds in Ukiah, on the North Coast, and more than doubled in Merced, in the San Joaquin Valley. 

The ruling, which found that the city of Grants Pass, Oregon did not violate the constitution by banning encampments throughout the city when no shelter was available, accelerated a shift toward a pro-enforcement approach to homelessness. Buoyed by voters fed up with large encampments near their homes, Gov. Gavin Newsom used the opportunity to urge cities to ramp up enforcement and pass anti-camping ordinances. 
The people making the case for enforcement argue it’s a type of “tough love” that’s sometimes necessary to get people off the street. If someone refuses multiple offers of help, the threat of arrest might make them finally say yes, said San Diego Police Department Capt. Steve Shebloski. 
“I hope nobody has to go to jail, and I hope everybody takes services,” he said. “I just dont think that’s the reality of where we’re at with certain individuals.”
The type of help police can offer varies widely by city and situation. In San Diego, the Homeless Outreach Team, which includes police officers as well as social workers and mental health professionals, is supposed to offer shelter before issuing citations or making arrests. Between May 2024 and May 2025, that team made 357 placements into housing or shelter, Shebloski said. People refused help 2,471 times, he said. And they accepted another form of services 3,578 times, from a referral to a treatment program, to a ride to an appointment, to a new toothbrush. The department does not track how many people wanted shelter but couldn’t get it.
In Stockton, police take a more hands-off approach: They hand out flyers with six phone numbers people can call to reach homeless shelters and other organizations.
But shelter beds aren’t always available. Last year, California had more than 187,000 unhoused residents, and fewer than 76,000 year-round shelter and transitional housing beds, according to data compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Doctors, academics and social workers who work with people on the street often say arrests make it harder for unhoused people to get back on their feet. When someone living outside gets a citation, they often miss their court date — they might lose the ticket or simply forget the date amidst the chaos of life on the street — which leads the court to issue a warrant for their arrest. People with active warrants can’t qualify for many housing and treatment programs. 
“They don’t understand. It’s not camping. It’s surviving.”Beverly Harding, 58, Sacramento
In many situations, people cited or arrested for homelessness-related crimes are never charged, or the charges are quickly dismissed. But the threat of an arrest can be just as disruptive as the arrest itself. People leave their campsites to avoid getting taken to jail, and in so doing, lose touch with the outreach workers trying to connect them with housing and other services.
“In a weird way, it undermines the housing process to such an extent that you end up working for homelessness and against the people who are experiencing homelessness,” said Brett Feldman, director of street medicine at USC. 
Some leaders are pushing back against the enforcement mindset. This week, two Democratic Congress members introduced the “Housing Not Handcuffs Act,” which would prohibit federal agencies from punishing people for living outside if they have no other option. 
Grants Pass made no difference, say cities where arrests and citations spiked
In the year since the Grants Pass decision, at least 50 cities and three counties in California passed new ordinances targeting homeless encampments, according to a recent analysis by UC Berkeley Law students and faculty. Some ban camping only in specific areas, such as near schools, waterways or levees, while others ban camping throughout the entire city. Some cities, such as Fresno, made camping a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and $1,000 in fines. 
Even cities that didn’t pass ordinances started cracking down on encampments with new vigor, using old rules. 
To quantify that crackdown, CalMatters filed more than 100 public records requests to police departments, sheriff’s offices, prosecutors and city and county governments for data on arrests, citations, charges filed and encampment removals. Those requests span a sample of about 35 large and small cities and counties throughout California. When requesting law enforcement data, CalMatters asked each agency to provide a list of the ordinances it uses to address homeless camps. In some cities that included ordinances that specifically prohibit encampments, but it could also include rules that ban sitting or lying on the sidewalk, impeding the right of way, storing belongings on public property and violating city park rules. 



Los Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman said she was surprised to see the data showing arrests related to homelessness increased 68% in her city, jumping from 920 in the six months before Grants Pass, to 1,549 in the six months after. Not all of those arrests led to someone being taken to jail. Some were what is called “noncustodial arrests,” where the person is released on site.
There were no policy changes in how the city dealt with encampments after the Supreme Court ruling, Raman said. But the city continues to expand its list of “sensitive locations,” such as near schools, where it bans encampments, she said.
“One of the city’s top priorities is to reduce unsheltered homelessness and bring people indoors and off the streets,” Raman said. “Our urgency to do that did not come from the Grants Pass decision in any way, shape or form. We were already focused on that.”
Mayor Bass’ office did not respond to requests for comment.
But Feldman, who provides medical care in encampments on the streets of Los Angeles, said he saw a noticeable change after the Supreme Court ruling. Suddenly, the areas where his team used to regularly find people were empty. That was a problem, because only about 5% of the team’s patients have reliable cell phones. If medics can’t find their patients, they can’t give them important follow-up care — such as their monthly antipsychotic injection or medicine to treat opioid addiction. As a result, their patients get sicker. 
“It was really tough for a few months,” Feldman said, though he believes enforcement has gone back down to pre-Grants Pass levels in recent months. That’s because most people have moved out of the heavily enforced areas (such as around schools) and re-settled in places that escape police notice, he said.  
The data CalMatters obtained from the Los Angeles Police Department does not include 2025 information.
San Diego similarly did not pass a new camping ban after Grants Pass. Its “unsafe camping” ordinance passed in 2023, and police also enforce older rules that prohibit encroaching on the public right of way. Shebloski says Grants Pass hasn’t changed anything in San Diego, despite the correlated increase in enforcement — 524 arrests and citations in the six months before Grants Pass, and 1,045 in the six months after. That’s because the police department added officers to its Neighborhood Police Division and Homeless Outreach Team, under the direction of its new police chief — which coincidentally lined up with Grants Pass, he said.
“I can tell you there’s absolutely zero operational direction that, ‘Grants Pass is now passed, go out there and write tickets,’” he said.
Outreach workers struggle to find clients
Beverly Harding, 58, has been on the streets for about 10 years. For the last year of that time, she was sleeping in a makeshift tent she pitched in various places along X Street in Sacramento, by attaching tarps to the shopping cart that held her food.
She still cries sometimes when recounting her run-ins with police, who she says have confiscated treasured items, including a necklace that held her mother’s ashes. An arrest last fall was particularly traumatic. A friend’s dog had bitten her wrist a few days before, and she’d gone to the hospital for treatment, she said. When the officers grabbed her injured wrist and handcuffed her, Harding said she almost passed out from the pain. She said she still gets shooting pains through her damaged wrist.
“They don’t understand,” Harding said. “It’s not camping. It’s surviving. And if you don’t have a home, where else are you going to try to survive? Anywhere you can.”

These days, the authorities are moving unhoused people around Sacramento on a daily basis, said Joe Smith. He’s the director of residential services for homeless services nonprofit Hope Cooperative and board chair for the county’s continuum of care, which coordinates the area’s response to homelessness. Because of that movement, Smith said, people are seeking out hidden spots to sleep, away from the gaze of law enforcement.
That’s making it harder for outreach workers, who have housing and other services to offer, to find their homeless clients. Smith saw that first-hand last fall. An unhoused man finally got a spot in Smith’s Hope Landing housing program after years of trying to get off the streets, but no one could find him. The program pushed his move-in date back three times, in hopes that someone would be able to track him down. 
The client eventually resurfaced and Smith was able to get him into housing earlier this month. It was just in time: A few more days, and the client would have lost the spot and had to start the entire process over. Even so, the delay meant he needlessly spent about six extra months on the street.
Smith, who was homeless himself between 2005 and 2011, said he’s “deeply concerned” the increase in enforcement is making other people lose out on housing opportunities.
“How devastating is that?” he asked. “Surviving outside becomes a lifestyle for you, and your ticket out comes up and nobody can find you. What a shame that is.”
A missing tent doesn’t mean someone has found housing
Shortly after the Grants Pass decision, then-Mayor Breed vowed to crack down on homeless encampments. What difference did the 500% increase in arrests and citations make in the city?
The number of tents and structures on San Francisco’s streets dipped to 222 in March — the lowest it’s been since the city began counting regularly in April 2019. That’s down from 360 in April 2024. 
But just because someone has ditched their tent doesn’t mean they are off the street.
“Most people are just sleeping on cardboard or on the street and moving every night,” said Chris Herring, a UCLA professor of sociology who researches homelessness in San Francisco and beyond. 
In Stockton, the city launched a “take back our parks” campaign to crack down on encampments after Grants Pass. Around the same time, the police department was recovering from a COVID-19 pandemic-era staffing shortage and increased its staffing in the departments that typically respond to homeless encampments. 
Police issued hardly any citations for violating park rules (including camping, drinking and lighting fires in a public park) or obstructing sidewalks in the six months before the Grants Pass ruling. In the six months after, police cited people for those offenses 213 times. 
Police give a 72-hour warning before they clear an encampment, said Officer David Scott, public information officer for the Stockton Police Department. If people don’t move after those 72 hours are up, officers may cite them. In rare cases, if someone is being combative, police may make an arrest instead, he said.
Police also hand out flyers with phone numbers people can call for housing, shelter beds, showers, meals and other resources. 
“We’re always going to be out there,” Scott said. “We want to provide those resources and help to those individuals that are vulnerable. And we’re going to continue the efforts in that area. But at the end of the day, we’ve got to make sure that our city is safe and as clean as we can get it.”
The flyers list numbers for six service providers (including one that’s listed twice). But there’s no guarantee any will be able to help with whatever the homeless person calling needs. St. Mary’s Community Services, one of the providers listed, had two-dozen beds available across its men’s, women’s and recuperative care programs as of June 25. A week before, it had just 11. None were available for families. 
Police have no way of tracking whether anyone calling St. Mary’s or the other providers gets help, or whether they just move a few blocks down the road and start the cycle over again. 
And for some people, police interactions don’t stop just because they’ve moved indoors.
After living on the streets for about a decade, Harding recently moved into a community of tiny homes for homeless residents in Sacramento, where case workers are supposed to help her find permanent housing. 
Shortly after, Harding and her boyfriend were hanging out in front of a nearby laundromat, using the Wi-Fi. She was downloading music onto her phone, and he was downloading games. Harding said they had a thin blanket over them, because it was cold.

In Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Diego, homeless Californians describe their experiences over the past year as camping ban enforcement has increased. 


Deadra Walicki has lived in the same spot for more than a decade: a cracked patch of asphalt in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley, squeezed between a boarded-up grocery store and Amtrak tracks so close that passing trains shake the ground beneath her tent.The air carries the scent of diesel fumes from busy Van Nuys Boulevard below and rotten food from the dozens of garbage bags piled up near her mattress, baking in the summer sun.She stays put so that friends, family members and case workers can always locate her. But that consistency has also made Walicki, 51, a target for the police officers who patrol the area.The Los Angeles Police Department cited Walicki for violating the city’s camping ordinance at least 34 times between August 2023 and December 2024.
 “They drove through today and I waved at them,” said Walicki, her smile revealing cracked porcelain veneers. “The cops come here Monday through Friday and give tickets for being in the zone of the shelter. It’s whatever they want to do.”

It’s been 12 months since a groundbreaking U.S. Supreme Court decision rewrote the playbook on homelessness, allowing cities in California and beyond to make homeless encampments illegal, even when no shelter is available.
Before the justices ruled in Grants Pass v. Johnson, Los Angeles and other cities generally had to offer someone a shelter bed before punishing them for sleeping on the street. But that went out the window when the justices upheld an ordinance by the Oregon city of Grants Pass that banned camping on all public property. 
Since the ruling, camping-related citations and arrests have soared in cities throughout California — everywhere from Sacramento to Los Angeles to San Diego and beyond.
In each of those three cities, police are citing many of the same people again and again. And while some have managed to move indoors, many others are still camping in the same places, racking up citations that ultimately make it more difficult to find housing.
We tracked down a few of those people. Here are their stories: 
Los Angeles: 10 citations in six months
Walicki motions across the train tracks to what looks like a giant rubber bubble. It’s a transitional homeless shelter that opened in 2020.While L.A. does not have a blanket ban on public camping, the city’s main anti-camping law  allows enforcement in select sensitive locations chosen by council members, including near schools, parks and homeless shelters.L.A. Municipal Code 41.18 says people camping within 1,000 feet of a shelter can be cited. That’s what the majority of Walicki’s citations are for, but she claims the shelter is about 2,000 feet away, as the crow flies.Hope the Mission, which operates the shelter, did not dispute her distance assessment when contacted for comment, but the citations keep coming.City-led cleaning and enforcement at homeless encampments makes outreach work harder, according to the nonprofit. Outreach teams build rapport with participants only to lose track of them.“When they do this cleanup, we go back the next day, that same day,” said Hope the Mission outreach worker Armando Covarrubias. “Where can we find ’em? We can’t contact them because they have no phones.”
In recent years, L.A. city leaders have used the ordinance to designate more and more areas for anti-camping enforcement, creating a patchwork of hard-to-follow rules for unsheltered Angelenos like Walicki.
Last March, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency released a report showing L.A.’s anti-camping law has not been effective at getting people into housing or keeping encampments away: It found 94% of people targeted for removal under the ordinance wanted shelter, but only 17% were able to get it.
Los Angeles hasn’t changed its enforcement as a result of Grants Pass, according to the City Attorney’s Office. But LAPD data show the department made 68% more camping and homelessness-related arrests  in the second half of 2024 than the first. Those include non-custodial arrests, where the violator is released at the scene.
Walicki received 10 camping citations in the latter half of 2024, according to LAPD records obtained by CalMatters. She was even cited for camping two mornings in a row that October, at the same intersection.
“ People are being targeted every day in the city through enforcement, through resolutions to get them to move,” said Shayla Myers, senior attorney with Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, a nonprofit providing free legal services for poor Angelenos. “That’s the very definition of criminalization.”
When patrol cars arrive — usually in the morning, Walicki says — officers give people about 10 minutes to pack up. Anything left behind disappears into the back of sanitation trucks. Over the months, she’s lost bags of recycling she’d collected for cash, sleeping bags, clothes, even dental tools for her veneers.
Walicki lives in the encampment with her partner Steve Maroulis, a 57-year-old man with mental disabilities. The two of them want to go at the same time into two separate gender-segregated shelters, but haven’t had any luck.
“It would just be nice, for safety reasons,” she said. “And I don’t want either of us to be alone out here.”

Police records capture the chaos of tracking someone arrested so frequently. Her name appears as Deadra, Dedra, and Debra. Her last name is spelled five different ways across case files.
Each citation adds to a growing pile of legal paperwork she largely ignores. She hasn’t paid any fines because she doesn’t have the money, she said. Court dates blur together. Walicki said she’s tried to show up to court for some of her infractions, but she’s never gone on the right day.
Others have dealt with more serious consequences for camping. David Cerritos, 46, has lived in Skid Row for five years, his tattered tent on a sidewalk flanked by wholesale smoke shops in the shadow of downtown L.A.’s skyline.Cerritos was cited at least 12 times last year, including six times after the Supreme Court decision.Unlike Walicki, with her repeated citations, Cerritos has been handcuffed and temporarily detained for violating the ordinance several times, he said.“If you don’t comply, you’ll just be arrested,” he said. “And then even if you get cited out, hours later or whatever, by the time you get back, you’ve lost everything.”If someone resists, refuses to comply with or obstructs camping ban enforcement, LAPD can submit the case to be charged as a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. Otherwise, LAPD will designate it an infraction punishable by a $250 fine, according to the department’s guidelines.Several of Cerritos’ arrest records include mention of disorderly conduct. For him, these arrests usually mean spending 6 to 12 hours in jail while everything he owns disappears. Cerritos said he’s lost barbering clippers, tattoo equipment, bicycles, tools, laptops and more.LAPD submits misdemeanor cases to the L.A. City Attorney’s office for prosecution consideration, and that office ultimately decides whether to file misdemeanor charges or knock them down to infractions.The office said it filed charges in 87 camping violation cases in 2024 — 8% of the 1,034 enforcement actions LAPD made under the ordinance last year.For Cerritos and Walicki, the citations and fines don’t mean all that much. For them, any interaction with police or city workers feels like enforcement, whether a charge is issued or not.Cerritos feels like he’s getting harassed more than usual recently, but he’s not interested in moving. Like Walicki, he has a case manager but no phone. ”Now if they were forcing me to move away from here, and I went even just a block over, you might never find me,” Cerritos said.After years of frequent arrests and citations for camping, neither Cerritos nor Walicki are any closer to leaving their spots, for permanent housing or anywhere else. 
Sacramento: Go to jail, or go to a tiny home
Over the past three years, Jerry Carter could often be seen biking around Sacramento’s Midtown neighborhood, his brindle bull terrier, Zaddy, riding in style behind him on a homemade trailer he built special for the beloved pup.
Music followed him as he zipped past trendy bars and restaurants, playing R&B, jazz or reggae (never rap) from a small speaker. Sometimes he played his all-time favorite: Prince, who he saw perform at Arco Arena in 1997.
Local businesses and other homeless people who slept nearby knew him by sight, if not by name. 
The police knew Carter, too.
Over the past year, they gave him at least seven citations for camping, storing his belongings on public property and blocking the sidewalk.

Each encounter with police followed a similar playbook, Carter said. Officers showed up and told him he had 10 minutes to pack up all his belongings. Anything he couldn’t pack in time, he had to abandon. 
Carter said he lost a lot of possessions that way: bicycles, clothes, tents and more. Losing bikes stung the most: Getting hit by a car a few years ago left Carter in constant pain, making it hard to walk. But biking is easier.
Sacramento bans camping or “using camping paraphernalia” on public property. Police can cite or arrest someone if they are using a sleeping bag, or even a piece of cardboard as a mattress and a tarp as a blanket — but not if they are sleeping on a bench with no camping materials, according to a police training bulletin. 
Enforcement of that ban, as well as related ordinances, spiked after the Grants Pass decision. The number of arrests made and citations issued nearly tripled, from 96 in the first half of last year, to 283 in the second half. From January through May of this year, that number jumped to 844.
In most of those cases, the person was cited and released, not taken to jail. Violations led to an arrest 199 times in 2025.
Despite the frequent tickets and attempts to push him out of the bustling shopping and dining district, Carter never moved far from his preferred spot, around 21st and K streets. All of his citations over the past year were issued within about a two-and-a-half-block radius. He felt he had to stay central if he wanted to eat: That’s where his friends were, and where passersby would stop and give him money or food.
“I could survive there,” he said.
Carter became homeless about three years ago, after he says a property manager stole cash from his apartment while he was in the hospital. Carter moved out to avoid a physical confrontation. After that, Carter admits he “gave up a little bit.” He didn’t have the money to get a new apartment, and, focused every day on survival, he didn’t have the energy to start the process of getting back on his feet.
Initially, when the cops showed up wherever Carter was sleeping, an outreach worker would come too and put Carter on a waitlist for shelter. But nothing ever came of that, Carter said. 
Then, at the very end of December, Sacramento County opened a new tiny home community for homeless residents. The Stockton Boulevard site, which was part of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2023 promise to build tiny homes throughout California, has 155 small cabins with room for a bed (or two beds if it’s for a couple) and a few belongings. Residents share communal bathrooms with plumbing and showers. Case managers meet regularly with residents to try and help them find permanent housing. 
As the tiny homes gradually filled, one police officer started urging Carter to move in. Carter said no multiple times. He’d spent a few days in a different tiny home site last year. He hated it, he said.
Finally, the officer gave Carter an ultimatum: Go to jail, or go to a tiny home. Carter knew getting locked up meant he might lose his dog. And he’d heard the new tiny homes were actually kind of nice. So he said OK. 
“I guess he was actually a caring officer,” Carter said. “It didn’t seem like he was a caring officer, because he kept on writing tickets and everything. But he kept on just pushing me.”
Carter moved into his tiny home about two months ago, where, when he finally got to shower for the first time, it felt like he stood under the hot water for hours. He no longer has to worry about police waking him up at 6:30 a.m. and demanding that he move,  sometimes only minutes after he’d finally managed to fall asleep amidst the noise and chaos of the street.
“That’s wonderful,” Carter said. “I can actually sleep in. I can take naps.”
But the police actions that got him there also took a toll. Each time officers wrote Carter up, they gave him a piece of paper that said when he had to appear in court. But Carter invariably lost the papers. It would rain and they’d get wet and ruined. Or they’d get mixed in with the items the police tossed out the next time they told him to move. 
He didn’t think it was a big deal. After all, camping is a misdemeanor. There’s no way the court would issue a warrant for such a small offense, Carter thought. 
He was wrong. Now, at 53 years old, he has warrants out for his arrest for failing to appear at multiple court dates. It makes him worried that he could be biking down the street one day, minding his own business, and get arrested and taken to jail. 
“I’m just too old to have any type of trouble like that,” he said.

Carter’s hardly the only one in that position, said Terra Hennefer, the case manager supervisor for the tiny home site where Carter lives. 
“We see a lot of people that end up with the tickets,” she said. “Then it makes more work for us trying to clear their warrants and stuff before we get them into housing.”
Landlords often conduct background checks and won’t take someone with a warrant, Hennefer said. The county also runs background checks on people applying for subsidized housing vouchers.
Hennefer’s team works with the probation office to help residents resolve outstanding warrants. The first step is to set a new court date, and make sure the resident doesn’t miss it.
Then a judge will decide on a penalty, which could be a fine. Her organization, a shelter and interim housing provider named First Step Communities, can help cover the cost. But it’s frustrating, she said, as that money could instead go toward helping more people get off the street. And it adds yet another hurdle to what for many is a seemingly endless list of tasks on the way to housing.
Carter has just started that process. His case manager, Matthew Burbridge, is working on getting his Social Security benefits restarted and finding him permanent housing through CalAIM, the state’s expanded Medi-Cal program. 
The problem is, neither Burbridge, nor anyone else, knows how long that may take.
“They’re working on it,” he said. “It might be quick, it might be long. We don’t know. But we’ll be ready when the time comes.”
San Diego: Moving into a swamp 
Micah Huff for a time lost touch with a San Diego case manager who was trying to help him move to a city-backed homeless campsite as he sought to avoid police and encampment clean-ups.   
Huff, 45, moved to a boggy area near Ocean Beach bordered by brush, mud and city streets because it’s harder for the authorities to find him there. He had to hike in and out and said he’s already moved his belongings across the wetland once. Earlier this month, he said he expected to move again soon, as he’s done every couple weeks since the city stepped up enforcement.
Since May 2024, records show police cited Huff seven times for offenses tied to his unsheltered status and arrested him twice. 
Police data obtained by Voice of San Diego shows arrests and citations for violations tied to homelessness more than doubled in the six months after the Grants Pass ruling. Rather than the ruling, police attribute the increase to the new police chief assigning more officers to engage with community members and enforce crimes tied to homelessness. 
A year before the Grants Pass decision, the San Diego City Council approved a camping ban that police began enforcing in summer 2023, while also continuing to enforce older ordinances, such as those that prohibit encroaching on the public right of way.

The city’s street homeless population fell last year, and Mayor Todd Gloria credits that reduction to approaches such as the camping ban, continued enforcement of existing laws and increased shelter offerings and more outreach. 
Arrests can be traumatic: One of Huff’s arrests, which police records suggest may have occurred last September, has made a lasting impression on him.  
Huff was meeting a friend he hadn’t seen in a while at a dog beach in Ocean Beach. The two fell asleep near a public restroom, Huff said, and were startled awake by police. Police arrested Huff for encroachment and possession of drug paraphernalia, though Huff says the supplies weren’t his. 
Huff said his heart raced during his encounter with police. He heard an officer talk about a backpack with drug supplies. Huff’s blood pressure surged, a reaction that Huff said put him at risk of a heart attack or stroke due to a blood pressure condition. 
Then he passed out. 
Huff said police took him to Scripps Mercy Hospital in Hillcrest. Huff estimates the officers waited six or seven hours before finally giving up on booking him and leaving.
He left the hospital with medications that were stolen within a few days of his return outdoors. 
Superior Court records show that Huff has yet to be charged for these offenses or other alleged homelessness-related violations over the past couple years. 
The outcome of the city crackdowns, according to Huff, has simply been that he’s been pushed “further and further away” into remote areas — currently a literal swamp — to avoid enforcement or clean-ups. 
But increasing enforcement in recent weeks and months at nearby Ocean Beach hasn’t convinced 38-year-old Ryan Taylor to move elsewhere. Taylor, who has been cited nine times and arrested five times for offenses tied to homelessness, continues to set up an umbrella and blankets at the beach. 
One recent arrest came on Memorial Day, when Taylor was picked up on a warrant for failing to appear in court to address homelessness-related charges. He was relieved to find most of his belongings still at the beach when he returned the next morning.  
More recently, Taylor’s case manager has been helping him work on addressing his criminal cases in court. He is set to appear at a July 24 hearing to start the process. 
Taylor hasn’t left the Ocean Beach area he’s settled in for most of the four years he’s been homeless in San Diego despite the repeated arrests and citations, he said, because he’s “just accepted that’s the way that it is.” 
Taylor also said he’s repeatedly accepted offers of shelter when police show up next to him at the beach, but said shelter has never been available when he agreed to it. 
“To me, it seems like the people that need help or whatever don’t have money, giving them more tickets doesn’t help them, propel them to get them financially out of the hole or help them,” Taylor said.

San Diego police Capt. Steve Shebloski, who oversees the division focused on homelessness-related enforcement, and Denny Knox, executive director of business group OB MainStreet Association, argue that increased enforcement is having a positive effect, though both also said there’s more work to do. 
Shebloski noted recent homeless census results showing a 4% drop in unsheltered homelessness in the city and less visible homelessness in communities including San Diego’s downtown.  
But Dawn Contreras, a case manager for nonprofit PATH working with both Huff and Taylor, said the increased enforcement only makes homeless service workers’ jobs more difficult. 
One day this spring, Contreras said she was picking up an unsheltered client for a required webinar to obtain housing when a beat officer — not assigned to the Neighborhood Policing Division that Shebloski oversees — ordered her client to clear his camp. Contreras said she implored the officer to allow the man to clean the camp later so he could head to his meeting. 
“You’re not willing to bend for just one hour?” Contreras said. 
The officer refused. With Contreras’ help, the unsheltered man later signed onto his meeting a few minutes late. Rescheduling it would have added another logistical hurdle for both Contreras and her client as they prepared to move him off the street.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/082224-LA-Homeless-Camp-Sweep-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 09:02:32.273604

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — Professors and students at the University of Alabama said in federal court Thursday that a 2024 state law banning DEI and so-called “divisive concepts” had chilled academic freedom and thrown funding for student organizations into uncertainty.
The testimony concluded a two-day evidentiary hearing over the law, known as SB 129, before U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor. A group of professors and students have sued the state and the University of Alabama Board of Trustees over the statute, saying it violated the First and Fourteenth amendments.
Richard Fording, a UA political science professor focusing on race and politics, said Thursday that the law has forced him to make significant changes to his courses, including reducing coverage of topics such as the Black Power movement, Black Lives Matter, and white nationalism. Fording also said it led him to cancel an undergraduate course on “Politics and Poverty.” He said he was concerned about teaching topics that could be interpreted as violating the law.
“That’s a decision I made based on everything that I witnessed since (SB 129 has) been implemented,” he said.

In two other courses, “Social Movements and U.S. Politics” and “Politics of Voting Rights,” Fording said he removed some discussions on systemic racism and oppression, central to the social movements he teaches and the history of voting rights, to avoid any student complaints and potential sanctions. He no longer assigns related readings and refrains from facilitating class discussions on these sensitive topics.
“(In) group discussions, students may express opinions that relate to divisive concepts, and because I facilitate those discussions, if those discussions become kind of one-sided, that can make a student feel like they’re being compelled to assent,” Fording said.
Cassandra Simon, a professor in the University of Alabama’s School of Social Work, testified that the law led to a class project chosen by students being abruptly canceled “the morning that we were to have it.”
Simon said that Dean Schnavia Smith Hatcher of the UA School of Social Work asked in an email for the project to be canceled because it “could be viewed as sponsoring a program that promotes DEI” by requiring “a student assent to a divisive concept” and “attend or participate in coursework that advocates” for a divisive concept.

She disagreed and told Hatcher that the class picks the project to work on while she offers support, and that she had “never gotten into trouble.” But according to Simon, Hatcher said she would “be subject to progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination.”
“I was specifically told in an email by my administrator, my immediate supervisor, my dean, that if I did my did not have my students cancel their project that I would be subjecting myself to, in the exact words, progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination,” Simon said in a press conference Thursday.
Simon called the law vague and confusing, saying that she still does not understand why her class project was canceled.
“I still don’t understand what [SB 129] is. I am not a non-intelligent person. I have talked to many people who don’t understand what it is, all who are very intelligent and informed, and view themselves as the experts in their fields and as educators,” she said.
Both professors said that while they were not directly told to change their courses to comply with SB 129, they did so out of caution due to UA’s administration treatment of Dana Patton, a director of the Witt Fellows Program and a political science professor at the University of Alabama who testified Wednesday, during an investigation of anonymous complaints that claimed the program was “embedded” with “divisive concepts.” In her testimony, she detailed an intense investigation she faced after the university received an anonymous complaint.
“I felt like the administration should have determined if it actually was students in my course who complained and talked to other students in my class, because I was being accused of violating the law, and that complaint came from the state legislature, so I felt like there should have been a little bit more investigation into that,” Patton said in a press conference Thursday.
Students who testified in Thursday’s hearing said that SB 129 has also impacted funding for school organizations that may potentially promote “divisive concepts.”
Sydney Testman, a University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) political science student, said that the Social Justice Advocacy Council (SJAC) was “demoted” from a “university funded organization” to a “registered student organization” after SB 129’s implementation, which meant that they no longer automatically received funding from UAB. Because the organization lost funding, her role as finance coordinator, which provided her and other student leaders with a yearly stipend, was also terminated.
Miguel Luna, a UAB student studying political science and history, testified that his organization, Esperanza, which focuses on Hispanic and Latine students, relied on funding from the former Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), which was rebranded as the Office of Access and Engagement to comply with SB 129, and other organizations like SJAC. 
Since the anti-DEI law was implemented, he said he lost access to those funds and could no longer provide incentives like food at events, leading to a decline in the events they have hosted.
“Many other student organizations have also found that when you provide incentives, people will attend, especially the off campus people that you’re trying to reach,” Luna said.
During cross-examination by Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the UA Board of Trustees, Luna acknowledged that Esperanza did not apply for direct USGA funding in the most recent academic year, partly because the deadline had passed and he believed, based on his experience on the executive council of USGA, that Esperanza would not be eligible due to its mission.
Judge Proctor asked why the organization didn’t submit the application anyway.“What would have been involved in submitting? Why not take a chance? Why not take the effort, submit the application, get a ‘no,’ rather than assume,” Proctor asked.
Ja’coby Bibbs, a UA political science student and president of the UA chapter of the NAACP student chapter, detailed the historical significance and practical benefits of the Black Student Union (BSU) and the LGBTQ+ center that was closed in August to comply with SB 129. He said the BSU office, located on the first floor of the Student Center, served as a hub for fostering connections, mentorship, and community among Black students and other minority groups.
“The Black Student Union space was invaluable to my experience, to my success at the University of Alabama,” Bibbs said, adding that the space helped him in his application to the Blackburn Institute, a prestigious leadership development and civic engagement program for UA students. He emphasized that the BSU space was open to all students, regardless of race or ethnicity, and did not require membership or a fee for entry.
Bibbs recounted an incident involving racist text messages sent to Black students on campus, stressing that the absence of the BSU space deprived students of a place to “cultivate and really digest what was happening.” He described the BSU as “an ode to the trailblazers who came before us,” including the first Black students and professors at the university.
The BSU space was a place where “people who get me, people who look like me, understand what I’m going through,” Bibbs said.
Proctor indicated he wants to decide whether to issue an injunction before class starts in August and might rule on the state’s motion to dismiss after. An oral argument hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250626_1731190742-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Early morning May 22, 2025, when most families were still asleep, members of the U.S. House passed a bill to make sweeping cuts to Medicaid, SNAP — which helps people afford groceries — and other basic safety net programs, all to finance tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country. 
A Senate vote is imminent.
The 215 representatives who voted for this bill said “yes” to kicking over 13 million people off their health care through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, while raising costs for millions of others. These representatives said “yes” to ransacking the pantries and clearing off the dinner tables of 3 million families on SNAP who are struggling to get by. These representatives said “yes” to taking away school lunches from 18 million kids. 
In Minnesota, the effects of these cuts will be devastating. Fully $11 billion of the $18 billion that Minnesota spends on Medicaid comes from the federal government. Cutting these funds will leave people without access to doctors and the medicines they need to survive. SNAP serves over 450,000 Minnesotans who are trying to make it to another day.
These 215 of our U.S. representatives said “yes” to endangering the health, livelihood and well-being of millions of families, all to reconcile their budget that seeks first and foremost to cut taxes benefiting the top 1%, who already pay in too little compared to other developed countries. 
This is a cruel, fiscally irresponsible and wildly unpopular budget bill. 
Touting this as a “beautiful” bill is disingenuous and brazen. There is nothing beautiful about denying people cancer treatment. There is nothing beautiful about children going hungry. There is nothing beautiful about prioritizing those already well off at the expense of families just trying to get by.  Should this bill become law, it will cause irreparable damage to families.  
Not in our name
As faith leaders and members of our community, we cannot remain silent to the cruelty unfolding that denies the humanity and dignity of our families, congregants and neighbors. Our policies and our budgets reflect what we value. Yet, what House members passed in the budget bill — and what the Senate is currently considering — defies the values of the vast majority of Americans. No matter our worldview or ideology, most of us recognize the wisdom of the Golden Rule.  
It is troubling to see politicians who claim to be Christian govern in a way antithetical to the core values of the teachings of Jesus.
Biblical writings emphasize again and again the importance of caring for one another, particularly the sick, hungry and vulnerable.  
But do you know what you won’t find in the Bible? Instructions to deny sick people care. A parable advocating for letting a child go hungry. A proverb praising a rich man for stepping on others to amass more wealth for himself. 
Our faith tradition doesn’t only emphasize caring for vulnerable people in our communities because it’s right — and it absolutely is. Our faith tradition emphasizes it because over millennia, societies and people in power needed to be reminded again and again when they lost their way of caring for one another.
To the 215 representatives who voted for the House bill: You most certainly have lost your way. 
Another moral crossroads
We are at another moral crossroads in our country. Will we have a government that makes life better for all? Or will we have a government that aims above all to further enrich the rich on the backs of working families? 
Will we allow our elected leaders to continue to draw sharper, wider lines between the “haves” and “have-nots,” or will we embrace budgets that ensure everyone is better off by making sure everyone has their basic needs met? 
As a country, we have faced identity crises before — of who we are and what we stand for. We’ve wrestled with dark parts of our history tainted by injustice, cruelty and prejudice. We’ve expanded rights, freedoms and protections for those who were too long denied them. Frankly, we’re still wrestling. But we’ve risen to the occasion before, and we must do so now again. 
What the passage of the House bill signals is grave but not guaranteed. 
The House bill passed narrowly by one vote (215-214), four of whom were Minnesota representatives. Now the Senate is deliberating. You can contact your Congress members. You can urge senators to think hard about the budget bill that cuts people’s health care and food assistance. 
If your representative voted for the House bill, politely ask them what kind of government they want to have a hand in making. 
If and when it comes to the House again, insist they do better.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medicaid-rural.jpg,,,2025-06-27 09:02:32.273604

The Hallsville School District was asking for a $6.5 million bond issue to finance more parking for the growing high school, a new elementary classroom and increased security for schools. And on April 8, nearly 75% of voters approved the measure, and the district launched pre-construction and design work.
But the project came to a halt the afternoon of June 6 when Superintendent Tyler Walker learned the district hadn’t met public-notice requirements before the election. So their bond counsel, the law firm Gilmore & Bell, couldn’t submit the bond issue for certification to the Missouri State Auditor’s Office.
“This was not the fault of the school district,” Walker told The Independent, “yet the school district and the students we educate are unfortunately being punished.”
Hallsville is the only school district to publicly acknowledge issues with its bond measure, but there could be as many as 10 political subdivisions forced to throw out the results of the April election.
Mark Grimm, an attorney with Gilmore & Bell, said in a June 3 email to the auditor’s office that eight to 10 of his firm’s clients may need to put voter-approved bonds back on the ballot because they appear to have fallen short of the state law laying out public notice requirements in the run up to an election. 
 Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick speaks to reporters about a critical report of the Secretary of State’s office on Jan. 23, 2024 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Notice of a bond issue must be published in local newspapers twice — once two weeks prior to the election and again within one week of the election. In each instance, Grimm wrote, notice ran three and two weeks before the election.
Exactly which bond measures are in jeopardy isn’t clear. The firm couldn’t comment on specifics about its clients, and the auditor’s office — which must certify that local bond measures comply with state law — was not provided with a list.
In an interview with The Independent, Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick said the state law is clear. The last thing he wanted to do was disqualify a voter-approved measure, Fitzpatrick said, but his hands are tied because public notice requirements are very specific and allow no flexibility. 
“If we’re aware of the deficiency,” he said “we can’t knowingly certify that the bonds comply with all the laws.”
Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Shell Knob, acknowledged similar issues with public notice have gone undetected over the years. In fact, an $8.5 million bond measure for the Centralia R-VI School District, Hallsville’s neighbor to the northeast, was certified with similar problems.  
The office has historically relied on bond attorneys like Gilmore & Bell, Fitzpatrick said, to ensure their clients are in compliance with state laws before submitting paperwork for certification. While his staff ensures publication takes place, “it was not part of our process to closely check the dates of the publications.”
“There’s a level of trust that has been historically built into this process,” he said, “because this is a sporadic thing. It’s not something where we have a team of people sitting around all day and their only job is to review these bonds and check every single law.”
Bill Burns, general counsel for Gilmore & Bell, doesn’t agree with the auditor’s position. He believes Missouri law gives Fitzpatrick enough wiggle room to certify voter-approved bonds despite “minor deficiencies relating to publication notices that would not in any way affect the outcome of the election.”
But Fitzpatrick said the law firm should have been on the lookout for these sorts of problems after a dust up in February involving the Higbee Fire Protection District — another Gilmore & Bell client — resulted in a bond measure being refused certification over similar issues. 
“I am surprised that we’re dealing with this now,” he said. “I would expect that bond counsel will be more proactive and communicate with the county clerk on these deals moving forward to make sure the publication dates are where they need to be. But I would have also thought that following the February deal.”
 Higbee Fire Protection District

Over the course of two elections last year, voters in Randolph County approved $1.6 million in bonds to support the Higbee Fire Protection District. It was only supposed to take one election, but the county clerk put the wrong total on the August ballot, requiring the rest of the bonds to be approved in November. 
By February, all that was left for the bonds to finally be issued was the certification of the auditor’s office.
And that’s where things went sideways.
Fitzpatrick’s staff kept asking for a copy of the sample ballot that was published in the newspaper prior to the election. Erick Creach, an attorney with Gilmore & Bell representing the district, instead sent affidavits attesting that the county clerk published a sample ballot.
As it turns out, the reason Creach couldn’t share a copy of the sample ballot was because it was never published as required by law. 
“Erick called first thing this morning,” wrote Leslie Korte, general counsel for the auditor’s office, in a Feb. 26 email obtained by The Independent through Missouri’s Sunshine Law. “He admitted that despite their prior representations and the certification of the clerk, they in fact did not publish the notice as required. For any election. He basically wanted us to let that slide.”

Korte wrote that she informed Creach that the auditor “cannot certify a bond that we know does not comply with state law.”
“I also addressed the secondary issue, which is Gilmore & Bell sending us documents certifying to facts that are not true, and him providing us documents yesterday afternoon identifying them as something they are not,” she wrote. “I told him all bond packages we receive from them going forward will be under heightened scrutiny, and if anything like this happens again, how it is addressed by our office will be escalated.”
Creach responded later that day reiterating that sharing the affidavits wasn’t an attempt to fool anyone but rather to “keep your office updated as I was piecing together the information, which to your point should have been addressed prior to submission of the transcript in the first place.”
The firm, Creach wrote, will “have a call today internally to discuss best practices regarding submission of transcripts and review of documentation to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.”
Fitzpatrick said in an interview this week that Gilmore & Bell “kind of intended to mislead us on that one, and we were unable to certify those bonds because no publication took place.”
 Brookfield R-III School District

In May, the auditor’s office refused to certify bonds for the Brookfield R-III School District in Linn County, again due to public notice deficiencies. 
Though the school district was not a Gilmore & Bell client, the firm took note and decided it would “submit certain hypothetical fact situations” to the auditor in the hopes of clarifying what could disqualify a bond measure, said Burns, the firm’s general counsel. 
One of the hypotheticals the firm submitted was publication three weeks and two weeks before the election. The auditor’s office confirmed it would not certify under those circumstances. 
Grim responded that “we believe there are 8-10 bond elections from April for political subdivisions we represent where the election authority complied with all publication requirements except the publications fell slightly outside of the two week/one week provision.”
One of those was Hallsville. 
“While we definitely agree that good public policy is to ensure compliance with election laws,” Grimm wrote, “failing to register bonds due to election law technicalities has the result of effectively annulling an election.”
He requested the auditor’s office consider certifying bonds regardless of the public notice issue, with the understanding that “going forward, no such grace will be provided.” And he noted the auditor’s office had just certified a bond for one of the firm’s other clients, Centralia, that had the exact same deficiencies. 
Korte responded in a June 4 email that for Centralia, the auditor’s office “relied on the representation of bond counsel that the bonds complied with all state laws, including state law that dictates when those publications must take place.”
Given the number of state laws that exist to cover the issuance of bonds, Korte wrote, it would not be surprising if over the years a bond was certified “despite having an unknown or undisclosed legal defect.”
“That should never be taken as a tacit approval of any failure to comply with state law,” she wrote. “If anything, it should be used by bond counsel as a cautionary tale causing them to double down on their efforts to ensure they are monitoring their clients’ bonds and advising on how to issue bonds in full compliance.”
 Hallsville School District

Boone County Clerk Brianna Lennon, who oversees elections including publishing notices,  told The Independent that her office intentionally chose to publish sample ballots three and two weeks before the election.
“We have tried, especially this past time, to make sure that we have some (safeguard),” she said. “So if there is a mistake that’s made in one of the weekly papers, we still have a grace period to be able to publish.”
A changing newspaper industry has made it harder to publish sample ballots. After a local paper was bought by a large corporation, Lennon’s office struggled to get edits made of notices and receive proofs prior to printing.
Lennon didn’t think her notice strategy would run into statutory issues, since the heart of the law is to ensure voters are informed. Her office goes beyond the law’s requirements and sends sample ballots in the mail to voters and posts them online in advance of all elections.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hallsville plans on resubmitting the bond issue for November’s election, which Walker estimates will cost the district “between $10,000 and $20,000.” Until the issue is funded and approved by the state, no payment is due to Gilmore & Bell.
The cost of delaying construction isn’t quantifiable, he said, and will cause “significant planning issues for the district,” with improvements critically needed.
“The safety and education of our students is of utmost importance to all of us in Hallsville,” he said.
Walker felt he had no reason to doubt the district’s bond counsel, since Hallsville previously passed three bond issues with Gilmore & Bell’s assistance, and he knew the firm’s reputation as “one of the best.”
“Districts rely on bond counsel because the process to pass a bond issue and finance a successful issue is a complicated one,” he said. “It requires the assistance of a bond counsel to navigate the legal and financial complexities that are involved in the process from start to finish.”
Fitzpatrick said his office will begin requiring bond counsel to sign an affidavit when submitting paperwork for certification of a bond measure “basically saying that, to the best of their knowledge, all laws have been complied with.”
State lawmakers have also reached out to him, Fitzpatrick said, with interest in changing the public notice law when the legislature reconvenes in January. Burns said his firm agrees that the law needs to be adjusted. 
“The main thing I think that really needs to be changed is becoming more lenient with the date of the publication,” Fitzpatrick said, adding: “There’s a lot of kind of antiquated aspects of it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/money-e1750989760274-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

,California,2025-06-27 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Five years later, the pandemic still weakens two California employee safety nets",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/pandemic-california-employee-safety-net/,"The state still hasn't fixed problems with its unemployment and workers compensation funds, both of which faltered during the COVID pandemic and haven't recovered.","When the COVID-19 pandemic struck California five years ago, it massively impacted California families not only medically but economically.
As the state forced many businesses to close their doors, 3 million Californians lost their jobs, shooting the state’s unemployment rate up to more than 16%. In turn, two state programs that are supposed to cushion employees from the effects of workplace disruption were hard-hit.
The most obvious impact is what happened to the state’s unemployment insurance program.
As workers were laid off, they filed claims for weekly benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, which is financed by employers through payroll taxes.
However the fund, which had been struggling to pay claims prior to the pandemic, was soon exhausted, and the state borrowed about $20 billion from the federal government to keep benefits flowing.
The Employment Development Department also suffered a managerial implosion, leading to not only the blockage of payments to legitimate claimants, but billions of dollars in payments, mostly out of federal funds, going to fraudsters.
Five years later, not only has the state been unable to claw back the billions in fraudulent payments, but the state’s unemployment fund’s debt to the federal government has continued to grow. Interest charges are piling up, and there’s still a gap between income and outgo even though the state’s unemployment rate today of 5.3% is about a third of what it was in 2020.
The Employment Development Department estimates that the debt will rise to $23.7 billion by the end of 2026, even though federal officials have raised their payroll taxes in California to chip away at the debt. Underlying the issue is a decades-long political stalemate over unemployment insurance benefits and taxes.
The other safety net program affected by the pandemic is workers’ compensation, which provides medical treatment and support payments to employees suffering job-related illnesses and injuries.
Most employers purchase insurance either from private insurers or from the quasi-public State Compensation Insurance Fund to cover employee claims. Some big employers, including state and local governments, self-insure for “work comp,” as it’s dubbed.
An estimated 200,000 work comp claims were filed by COVID-19 victims, even though a connection between the disease and the workplace is tenuous at best.
Nevertheless, those claims and sharp increases in medical costs are being cited by the insurance industry’s Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau in seeking an 11.2% increase in employer-paid insurance premiums, tentatively approved by the state Department of Insurance to take effect on Sept. 1.
It’s the latest chapter in the long-running political friction over work comp costs and benefits, which collectively approach $20 billion a year.
Roughly once a decade, the major players in the work comp system — employers, insurers, unions, work comp attorneys and medical care providers — clash over the issue. The last time was in 2012, when then-Gov. Jerry Brown negotiated a compromise that raised benefits but imposed new rules on eligibility for benefits and medical care to save enough money to pay for the increases.
Although opposed by medical providers and attorneys, the deal had the desired impact, including a sharp reduction in insurance costs vis-à-vis payrolls. However, California’s insurance costs, 1.86% of payroll, remain among the highest in the nation, according to a biennial survey by the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, widely considered the most authoritative source of work comp premium data.
The stage would seem to be set for another of the Capitol’s periodic work comp clashes. However, legislation that would have increased cash benefits to disabled workers never made it through the first committee this year, so the contending forces will face off sometime in the future.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/102423-Unemployment-Insurance-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Roberts, 59, is scheduled to be put to death Aug. 21 by nitrogen gas. He is the fourth person the state will put to death this year and the third using that method of execution.
A Marion County jury convicted Roberts of two counts of capital murder in December 1992.
According to court documents, Jones was sleeping at her boyfriend’s den, Wendell Satterfield, where Roberts was also staying. Roberts left his job and went to the Setterfield residence. He packed his belongings, stole money from Jones and shot her three times in the head using a rifle, then set the residence on fire.
The jury voted 7-5 to recommend Roberts be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge overruled the recommendation and sentenced him to death.
After an appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court to allow Roberts to present mitigating evidence in hopes of a reduced sentence.

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Steep fines in Iowa set off state-federal showdown over child labor laws

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader.
Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Photo: Spencer Dondovan for USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.)The federal government raised its estimate this week for how much oil and gas could be extracted from public lands in Nevada, placing the state third for oil potential.
Nevada holds 1.4 billion barrels of “undiscovered” oil beneath its public lands – only falling behind Alaska and New Mexico – and 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas, according to the newly compiled figures released by the U.S. Geological Survey last week.
“We think there’s resource potential there, and it just so happens there’s a lot of federal land,” said Chris Schenk, the lead author of the report.
The estimates are of “technically recoverable oil and gas resources” — many of which may not be economically viable to extract — that could be retrieved with current technologies. It’s the first time the agency has tallied the amount of oil and gas under national parks, wilderness areas and other public lands nationwide since 1998.
Technology has improved significantly since then, increasing the estimated resources that could potentially be extracted from public lands, according to the report.
The analysis was prepared in response to a directive by the Trump administration to “unleash” domestic energy supplies. In February, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed his agencies to identify energy and critical minerals on public lands.
“American Energy Dominance is more important than ever, and this report underscores the critical role science plays in informing our energy future,” Burgum said in a press release announcing the study.
The report also comes as Republicans in Congress try to push a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Nevada, Utah and other Western states.
Nationally, the analysis estimated 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.6 trillion cubic feet of gas lie below all federal lands – enough oil to meet the county’s needs for four years and a dozen years in the case of natural gas.
The last federal analysis of undiscovered oil and gas resources on public lands in 1998, estimated about 7.8 billion barrels of oil and 201 trillion cubic feet of gas. 
Schenk, the lead author of the report, said the analysis uses decades of federal data to estimate the potential for oil and gas where it hasn’t been discovered yet, but there’s still room for “uncertainty.”
“Whenever you’re exploring for resources, whether it’s minerals or oil and gas, there’s uncertainty before you drill,” Schenk said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, because it’s undiscovered.”
That uncertainty is reflected in the lack of oil and gas leasing in Nevada, despite available data pointing to potential sources in the state.
Nevada lease sales have long drawn little interest from industry. It’s not uncommon for large swaths of nominated land to never get a bid.
For example, the Bureau of Land Management offered five oil and gas parcels in Nevada totaling 6,800 acres this week. None of the parcels received a single bid. Those same parcels also failed to attract any industry interest in 2023 and 2024.
“We recognize that interest in Nevada is lower than other states in the West where development is more economical, such as New Mexico and Wyoming. The scale of this auction, for instance, was small relative to others,” said Aaron Johnson, the vice president of public and legislative affairs for the Western Energy Alliance trade group.
When land does get leased for oil and gas development, it underperforms in auction. From 2015 to 2024, the average bid per acre in Nevada was just $4.10—compared to $4,900 per acre in New Mexico.
Still, the Trump administration has pushed to lease more of Nevada’s public lands including 264,000 acres of public land in Elko County’s Ruby Mountains, a popular hunting and outdoor recreation site in Nevada. 
Drilling opponents remain skeptical that there’s much oil and gas in Nevada or that extracting it would make economic sense any time soon. They think the development push is rooted in speculation. 
“We’ve been leasing these low potential lands since the 1950s,” said Russell Kuhlman, the executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation. “We have yet to find anything that would get the oil and gas industry excited.”
Kuhlman said speculative oil and gas leasing in Nevada removes land that would be better suited for the recreation economy, wildlife conservation, or renewable energy development in the state.
Over 90 percent of public lands managed by the Interior Department in Nevada are available to be leased for oil and gas drilling. Once leased, public lands are locked up from being managed for multiple uses such as outdoor recreation and conservation for the life of the lease, which could be 10, 20 or even 30 years.
“That’s really where the issue is, once land is identified as an oil and gas lease, it’s essentially put in that folder and forgotten about by the Bureau of Land Management,” Kuhlman said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/snow-1024x625.png,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Paul Sarlo, the state Senate's budget chair, said Thursday that when lawmakers eye certain tax hikes, it's ""always a difficult ask and a difficult choice to make.""  (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Budget panels in both legislative chambers approved a series of tax increases on Thursday meant to keep New Jersey’s books balanced in the fiscal year that begins July 1, but legislators stopped short of a vote on the full budget.
Lawmakers advanced proposals that would raise fees on the sale of certain expensive buildings, hike cigarette and nicotine taxes, and push up tax rates on online gambling and sports betting in a bid to keep the state’s budget above water.
Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate budget chairman, said the tax hikes would help Gov. Phil Murphy keep his pledge to pass along a $6 billion surplus to the next governor. Murphy leaves office in January.
“Any time you have to tax an industry or ask someone to put more money in, it’s always a difficult ask and a difficult choice to make,” Sarlo said.
The full budget did not get a vote Thursday, with lawmakers saying the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services was still drafting the bill after negotiators reached an agreement on how much New Jersey would spend in the next fiscal year.
Budget committees are expected to vote on the bill at 8 p.m. Friday, with votes before both full chambers planned for Monday, the last day they have to pass a budget without shutting down the state government.
Republican members, who broadly opposed the tax bills advanced Thursday, expressed some frustration over the budget process, noting the timing of the committee’s vote on the budget bill made it likely that few would see the vote.
“This overall process, none of us is happy with,” said Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth), the chamber’s GOP budget officer. “If you got something you want to release in the dark of night when no one’s paying attention, everybody knows you put it after 4:30 on a Friday in the summer.”
Among the tax hikes approved Thursday was a bill that would raise tax rates on online gambling and sports betting to 19.75%, from 15% and 13%, respectively. The proposal, earlier reported by the Press of Atlantic City, resembles a pitch the governor made in his budget address that called for the state to raise tax rates on online gambling to 25%.
The governor’s proposal was set to generate $402.4 million in additional revenue in the coming July-to-June fiscal year. The reduction from 25% to $19.75% would reduce those collections by about $85 million.
“Any time there’s anything that could negatively impact our casinos in Atlantic City, we want to just raise our concerns because Atlantic City is kind of the powerhouse of South Jersey, and we don’t want to do anything to impact their competitiveness with other states,” said Hilary Chebra, director of government affairs for the Chamber of Commerce of South Jersey. “We do appreciate that it is less than what the governor proposed.”
Some lawmakers have pushed to raise the state’s tax rates on casinos’ online gambling winnings, noting that New Jersey’s existing rates are far out of step with its neighbors. New York levies a 51% tax on casinos’ winnings from online sports betting, while Pennsylvania’s online sports betting rate is 36%.
Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex), the bill’s prime sponsor, initially pitched raising New Jersey’s rates to 30%.
Legislators made broader changes to a separate Murphy proposal that would have doubled the 1% fee on property sales valued above $1 million and imposed an overall 3% fee on those worth more than $2 million.
Under the Legislature’s version, the fee would remain at 1% for homes worth between $1 million and $2 million but rise for more expensive homes, climbing to 2% for homes worth between $2 million and $2.5 million and rising by an additional half percentage point for every $500,000 in value, to a cap of 3.5% on property worth more than $3.5 million.
“This is one thing I wish didn’t have to be included, but I also fully understand the need to balance a budget, provide necessary revenue, to continue to work down our structural deficit, to provide a healthy surplus,” Sarlo said.
Lawmakers made another significant change: Their version of the tax would be paid by sellers rather than by buyers, as is the case under current law. The change would reduce owners’ profits from the sale of property but reduce upfront costs for home buyers.
Murphy’s proposal was expected to generate $317 million in additional state revenue in the next fiscal year, though revenue relying on home sales can be highly volatile. Sarlo said legislators’ version would raise about $282 million and impact between 2% and 3% of home sales.
The bill calls for the state to refund the difference in fees for a property that was sold before July 10 and whose deeds were recorded no later than Nov. 15, 2025.
The committee’s vote on the so-called mansion tax measure was delayed by hours. When it first came up for a vote, the panel’s Republican members had not seen the current version. When it was brought up a second time hours later, the measure had been amended again to allow additional time for homes to be sold and face the lower fee.
Lawmakers also approved a bill that would raise the state’s cigarette tax to $3 per pack, from $2.70, and triple tax rates on electronic cigarette cartridges to 30 cents per milliliter or 30% of the retail price for bottled fluid.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sarlo-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

It used be that we tried to make America great by making it a vibrant, welcoming, open, prosperous place where we were proud to welcome people from other places.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: Wresting people from their families is no way to solve our border problem.","This commentary is by David Moats of Salisbury. He is editorial page editor emeritus of the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.


Three federal judges in Vermont have played a leading role in trying to establish constitutional protections against the unlawful seizure and imprisonment of people by arbitrary government force.
These three cases are a small sample of the vast program of immigration enforcement launched by President Trump in order to deport thousands of immigrants to El Salvador or South Sudan or wherever he can send them. Such a program could not be anything but brutal. Justice takes time — to hold hearings and consider individual cases. We are all individuals deserving of justice, and our immigration status does not alter that constitutional reality.
The cruelty of the program has become apparent to millions of Americans who turned out in all 50 states on June 14 to declare that America is not a nation of kings.
By the logic of the Trump administration, all those millions could well have been rounded up and imprisoned in some vast gulag. After all, the administration has advanced the idea that protest itself may be antithetical to the national interest. And dissenting views seemed to be the only specified basis for the seizure of foreign nationals in two of the Vermont cases.
One of those foreign nationals, Mohsen Mahdawi, is a lawful resident of Vermont and a student from Columbia University, where he was also a pro-Palestinian activist. His activism, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, could “potentially undermine” U.S. foreign policy.
The absurdity of Mahdawi’s arrest, and of Rubio’s claim, was compounded by the fact that masked and armed ICE agents seized him after he had turned up in Colchester for a citizenship interview. In other words, he was doing everything right. While in prison, he has said he felt empathy for his father and other relatives on the West Bank who had been imprisoned by Israelis. But as it turned out, U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford saw no justification for his detention and ordered his release.
In another case, a Turkish woman, Rümeysa Öztürk, was grabbed off the street in Somerville, Mass. by masked government agents and whisked away in a car. In ordering her release from a Louisiana detention center, U.S. District Judge William Sessions found the government’s justification for her detention to be pathetically weak. What had she done? She had co-authored an op-ed piece for a student newspaper supporting Palestinian rights. 
But of course, this is what people in America do — they express wide-ranging views on issues of their choosing. Rather than undermining American policy, this freedom is a bulwark of our democracy, drawing people here from all over the world, seeking to participate in that freedom. The Johnson and Nixon administrations thought that dissent on the Vietnam War was inimical to American interests, even if history proved that dissent on the war was pointing the nation in the right direction. 
In a third case, U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss found that there was no basis for the government’s case against Russian scientist Kseniia Petrova, whom it had held in detention for four months. She had entered the country with frog embryos obtained from a lab in France to further her research at Harvard Medical School. Not only was her detention illegal, but it represented a further chilling assault on science. The most brilliant scientists from abroad have long sought to come to the United States, but now they are wondering why they should.
Vermonters are familiar with these three cases. But multiply them by the thousands, and we gain an understanding of the outpouring of protest in downtown Los Angeles, and in other cities, as well as the recent No Kings marches in every state. Brutality seems to be not an accident, but a feature of the administration’s policy.
It was on display in the manhandling and cuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla. His crime? Showing up at a press conference and daring to ask a question of Kristi Noem, secretary of homeland security. That was followed later by the manhandling of Brad Lander, New York City comptroller, also on a bogus charge.
It used to be that public officials knew how to handle questions that made them uncomfortable. It was part of their job. Now the job seems to be the deployment of force to send the message that dissent won’t be tolerated.
Except dissent is spreading in all parts of the country. Wresting people away from their families, sending them off to who-knows-where — this is not right, and it is no way to solve the border problem. The government will argue that making life miserable for foreigners here will dissuade others from coming.
It used be that we tried to make America great by making it a vibrant, welcoming, open, prosperous place where we were proud to welcome people from other places. Not American carnage, but America the beautiful.

Like marriage, love unites. And, ten years after Obergefell, I’ve come to see that love doesn’t just win — it transcends.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Meg York: Reflections on 10 years of marriage equality.","This commentary is by Meg York of Montpelier. She is director of LGBTQ+ family law and policy and senior policy counsel at Family Equality. She recently advocated for updated protections for LGBTQ+ families in Vermont — confirmatory adoption — a bipartisan effort signed into law by Gov. Phil Scott in May.


Jocelyn hugged her knees to her chest as she sat on the floor. I sprawled on the industrial carpet, gazing at her curling hair, her soft blue eyes, her awkward cuteness. It was a queer-straight alliance meeting. She was there as queer. I was a straight ally, or so I thought.
Raised in a conservative, evangelical home, being queer never crossed my mind. When something’s not an option, you don’t consider it. But in my mid-twenties, I began to reconsider myself.
Jocelyn and I became fast friends, doing everything together. We spent time outdoors, organized reproductive rights demonstrations and marched in the streets over the unjust outcome of Proposition 8, which banned same-sex couples from marrying in California where we lived. We laughed. We cried.
I came out as a lesbian.
My parents were shocked. They asked why I was choosing to hurt them. They admonished me not to tell my extended family. “Love the sinner, hate the sin,” they said — except none of it felt like love.
Early mornings, Jocelyn and I would walk together. We recited Mary Oliver poems and planned our wild and precious lives. Days turned into months, months turned into years. We found a new version of love. I am going to marry this woman, I thought.
We got engaged on a bridge in Central Park. I had never seen Jocelyn smile so brightly. In early spring, the trees were just beginning to bud. Jocelyn adorned her hair with little pink flowers. I took photo after photo. I couldn’t get enough of her.
We were in love, but our families were in turmoil. “It’s not God’s plan,” they cried. Though Jocelyn’s parents were more supportive than mine, their acceptance had limits. “Maybe if you just don’t call it a wedding…” We hugged, grieved, and moved to Vermont — one of the few states at the time with the freedom to marry.
We were married in 2012 in Chester. It was just Jocelyn and me. It was beautiful and painful. We longed to be surrounded by friends and family.
For several years, we enjoyed newlywed bliss and navigated administrative challenges. We hiked, swam, skied and paid extra for health insurance because federally, I wasn’t Jocelyn’s spouse. Evenings, we danced in the kitchen, the aroma of cast-iron cooking in the air. We filed taxes, jointly (Vermont) and single (federal). It was love, marriage and enough red tape to make anyone’s head spin.
In 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges affirmed the freedom to marry nationwide and struck down state-level bans. At the same time, my parents were beginning to come around. We breathed a sigh of relief.
Five years into our marriage, we shared that we were trying to get pregnant. My parents fell silent. “Kids need a mom and a dad, Meg.” It felt like the progress we had made was falling away. Like a road in Vermont. Like mud season.
But then, spring arrived: My daughter was born, and then my second daughter, and then my son. And in those years, as my parents watched us raising our three young children, something changed. Last week, my mom commented how thankful she is to have gained another daughter in Jocelyn, and how she couldn’t ask for better parents for her grandchildren.
My parents aren’t going to be marching in any pride parades anytime soon. Yet, as they have seen what marriage equality means to us and the stability it provides their grandchildren, they have come around. Our lives have touched their hearts and helped them understand that our family is as deserving of love and respect as any other family.
Today, most people in our country support marriage equality. This year, attempts to urge the Supreme Court to overturn the Obergefell decision, issued 10 years ago this month, made headlines but ultimately failed — thanks in part to Republican opposition.
Some conservative lawmakers called it cruel to revoke a right couples and families now rely on. Others, despite personal objections, said it’s not their job to invalidate this freedom. In this age of extreme division, that is a victory. 
I want people to embrace the full humanity of LGBTQ+ people like me. Like my wife. I want them to see our family and how beautiful it all is. How we must protect equality and legal family security. I’ll never stop working toward that goal. At Family Equality, I work daily to protect LGBTQ+ families and our children in Vermont and nationwide.
Acceptance can be long, slow and complicated. I know this at the core of my being. I know this in my bones. But I’ve seen that living authentically can open hearts and minds. Love is raw and beautiful and uncomfortable and real.
Like marriage, love unites. And, ten years after Obergefell, I’ve come to see that love doesn’t just win — it transcends.

“I’m concerned that if we were to go as expansive as you’re suggesting that these schools, police stations, fire stations that would likely close in many communities because of lack of revenue,” said Supreme Court Justice Christopher Goff.
  Indiana Supreme Court Justice Christoper Goff asks a question during a hearing on June 24, 2024. (Screen shot from oral arguments)
But homeowners would save money if more acreage was classified under the 1% percent cap. It would also put an additional administrative burden on assessors to examine the use of property — rather than the one-acre limit in effect today.
Hoosier voters approved property tax limits in 2010 capping bills at 1% of the property’s assessed value for homesteads; 2% for other residential property and farmland; 3% for business. Increases from separately approved referendums are outside those limits.
Plaintiffs in the case believe the corresponding state law limiting the 1% cap to your dwelling and one acre of land conflicts with the constitutional provision.
There were no estimates on how much land the case might impact. The median lot size in Indiana is 9,200 square feet while the average is closer to 13,000 square feet. An acre is 43,560 square feet.
Lawmakers recently passed a bill to reduce homeowner property taxes next year but income taxes could make up the difference.
The case at hand
Taxpayers in this case – Dr. Tulsi and Kamini Sawlani — have 3.9 acres of land. The Lake County Assessor has limited the 1% cap to one acre, leaving the remaining 2.9 under 2% cap. Their attorney said this costs them about $ 1,000 annually.
Gerold Stout, arguing on behalf of the Sawlani’s, said most Hoosiers assumed when voting for the tax caps that their entire property would count as their homestead regardless of size.
The Indiana Tax Court found the one-acre limitation unconstitutional because it conflicts with the constitutional language that includes “curtilage” as part of a principal place of residence.
  Chief Justice Loretta Rush highlighted court accomplishments with lawmakers during the annual 2023 State of the Judiciary. (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)
By definition, a curtilage is the area of land attached to a house — typically including the yard, garden, and outbuildings, and considered legally part of the dwelling. But state law doesn’t define it.
Instead, lawmakers used the one-acre limitation, which Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush noted dates back to 1979.
She and other justices noted that the Tax Court decision makes it a case-by-case decision by assessors in 92 counties, meaning it could apply differently from community to community even though there is also a constitutional mandate for a uniform and equal property tax system.
Rush asked Stout to define curtilage, which he could not. He instead said it depends on how a homeowner is using the land.
“How many times did you play volleyball? What if you didn’t mow it?” Rush asked. “It seems a little happenstance.”
Stout conceded assessors would have to talk to homeowners to decide how they use it.
Defending the law
That’s why lawyers for the Lake County Assessor and the Attorney General’s Office argued the tax court decision should be reversed.
Ayn Engle, representing Lake County, said lawmakers were well within their exclusive authority to define curtilage at one acre.
“The tax court usurped the legislatures’ broad authority … and acted more as a legislative body than a judicial branch.” she said.
While Engle conceded the court could narrowly rule against the specific homeowners in the case because they didn’t provide evidence supporting their curtilage claim, she encouraged the court to decide the merits of the one-acre limitation.

“I think if assessors are required to look at more than one acre, you’re going to have assessors doing things differently across counties,” Engle said.
She said waiting would just kick the can down the road a year or two and assessors need clear rules now.
“I’ve been a judge a long time. That’s just the way it works. People come coming, people keep bringing cases,” Goff said.
Deputy Solicitor General Jenna Lorence conceded there “might” be specific circumstances in which the one-acre limitation could be found unconstitutional, but said that is for another day.
Justice Mark Mass said, “I’m a little confused. As I understand you are tasked with defending the constitutionality of state statutes. And here, today, you’re suggesting that this statute could be unconstitutional as applied … You seem to be arguing both sides of this.”
Several groups have filed briefs in the case and also participated in the arguments, including the Association of Indiana Counties and the Indiana Association of Realtors.

(Photo: Alejandra Rubio for Nevada Current)Legislation expanding protections for reproductive health providers, offering support around breastfeeding, and requiring schools to release data when law enforcement use force against students are among the bills taking effect July 1.
There are 191 bills slated to take effect next month, with a significant portion making appropriations to various state departments and agencies.
Among the list of laws going into effect is Assembly Bill 266, which prohibits people who are breastfeeding from being denied access to public accommodations.
The legislation also requires Nevada Department of Health and Human Services to provide online resources around breastfeeding, including information about Medicaid coverage for counseling and lactation support.
Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, the bill’s sponsor, told her colleagues in May that there are enough challenges to breastfeeding. Lacking protections to breastfeed in public or information about available community resources shouldn’t be another barrier, she said.
An original version of the bill sought to make denying accommodations to people breastfeeding a misdemeanor but that provision was removed.
The bill received strong support in both chambers, six Republicans – Assemblymembers Jill Dickman, Lisa Cole, Rich Delong and state Sens. Carrie Ann Buck, Robin Titus John Ellison – voted against the bill.
“This bill is important because it acknowledges the struggles that many new mothers face and it aims to provide the support they need to succeed in their breastfeeding journeys,” González said during the hearing in May. “By increasing access to resources to lactation consultants, peer support and workplace accommodations, we can ensure that no mother feels alone or unsupported during one of the most challenging and rewarding times.”
 Protections for medical providers

Since the overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022, reproductive health workers have seen “increased violence and harassment,” including stalking and death threats, Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth of Reno said in a May hearing.
Assembly Bill 235 would ensure employees and volunteers of reproductive health care facilities would be better protected. 
The bill, sponsored by Roth, allows those who work or volunteer in reproductive care the ability to request a court order that keeps their personal information confidential on otherwise public records within the offices of county recorder, county assessor, county clerk, city clerk, Secretary of State, or Department of Motor Vehicles. Their spouses, domestic partners or minor children could also request a court order.
Alexis Solis, the interim director of Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, told lawmakers in May that the political environment in the last few years has become more divisive, hostile, “and in some cases for our staff, dangerous.”
“Providers and Planned Parenthood staff in Nevada have been targeted with religious mail, have had anti-abortion propaganda physically dropped off at their homes, have received numerous threatening phone calls and have experienced numerous threatening incidents in Planned Parenthood health centers in Las Vegas,” Solis told lawmakers.
The legislation passed the Assembly 33-9 with bipartisan support. In the upper chamber, only Republican state Sen. Lori Rogich joined Democrats in support.
 FAFSA for incarcerated

Assembly Bill 153 offers assistance to people incarcerated within the Nevada Department of Corrections in completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to potentially receive aid, such as pell grants, to pay for prison education programs.   
People leaving prisons who are able to find meaningful employment are less likely to recidivate, said the bill’s sponsor, Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller. 
“By equipping individuals with knowledge and skills, educational programs within the correctional facilities can significantly improve their prospects upon release,” she said.
AB 153 passed out of both chambers nearly unanimously. Only Republican state Sens. Robin Titus and Lisa Kranser voted against the bill.
 Other bills going into effect


Assembly Bill 420, also by González, requires school districts in Clark and Washoe counties to report data on use of force against students and when police officers use pepper spray or tasers. The first annual report is due before the first day of the 2026-27 academic year and will cover the 2025-26 school year, which begins in August.
Senate Bill 348, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Julie Pazina, increases the fee hospitals pay the Nevada State Public Health Lab for newborn screenings. The additional funds will be used to expand the number of rare but treatable conditions newborns in Nevada are screened for. The prior rate had been the same for more than a decade and kept Nevada behind what the federal government recommends for newborn screening.
Senate Bill 116, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Skip Daly, establishes a formula to authorize the pay raises for the elected county positions such as district attorney, sheriff, county clerk, county assessor, county recorder, county treasurer and public administrator. The formula keeps those public servants’ pay above the highest paid person in their office. The raises will go into effect July 1 with the new fiscal year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/little-flags-scaled-e1717251573683-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

“You know, as I stand here, I’m reminded about the things that make Indiana an amazing state, one of the best states in the union, by far, because of integrity, hard work, dedication and excellence. I think there is not a better group of students that embody that than FFA members and students,” he said.
Beckwith recalled growing up in the world of agriculture with his father as president of the Michigan Dairy Association.
He encouraged the students to think beyond themselves.
“What are you leaving? What are you giving back? What are you doing to serve your fellow man, your community, your friends, your family and those that will come after you?” Beckwith asked.
He said the best leaders in his life were the ones who would sacrifice themselves to uplift others.
“That is the mark of a true leader … And those are the people that everybody wants to be around.”

Beckwith also encouraged the young Hoosiers to have empathy and be sensitive to what others are going through on life.
“You need to be walking with them, doing life with them, you know, linking arms with them. And if you do that, you’re going to be somebody that for years to come, will be very successful. No matter where your steps take you, you will be successful in everything you do.”
Braun started his speech by talking about his time in the U.S. Senate and then told the teens that he gets up early each day — without using an alarm clock — to pack as much into his day as he can.
He said most people know him as running a successful automative business, but one of the most enjoyable times of his life was as a farmer. And he stressed how important it was for he and his wife to return to their hometown of Jasper.
“You’re going to have a lot of forks in the road, and the more you get involved in what you like, it’s gonna prepare you for whatever you choose to do,” Braun said.
“You never know where life is going to take you. All I can tell you, is you’re showing right here that you’re going to be a mover and a shaker. You’re probably in the arena that I’ve enjoyed most, being a tree farmer and involved in the row crop side of it, having that turkey farm. If you get up each day, you view it with opportunity. You work hard. You never know where life might take you. Someday, you might even decide to get into public service.”
The governor ended by telling the students not to afraid of challenges.
“Always be willing to stick your neck out and take a little risk, otherwise, you’ll get down the trail and maybe be disappointed that you didn’t do more.”
I know these aren’t the kind of speeches that elected officials can give every day. They have to focus intently sometimes on budgeting, taxes and policy. But for one day it was a fond departure. And I hope the kids enjoyed it as much as I did.

But earlier this month, the Trump administration threw this process into flux when it overhauled guidance on how states nationwide should select applicants for the more than $42 billion in funding. The move effectively nullifies hundreds of applications already received, and sets Washington and other states on a tight timeline to figure out who should get money. 
“Two years of working on it and all of a sudden we’re supposed to switch on a dime or less, on a pinhead,” said state Rep. Cindy Ryu, a Democrat from Shoreline who chairs the House Technology, Economic Development and Veterans Committee.
Perhaps the biggest change to the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment, or BEAD, program concerns what technology will be prioritized. 
The program originally favored expanding fiber-optic cables, but the new rules require a “technology neutral” stance because “the full force of the competitive marketplace must be utilized,” according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
This agnostic approach creates room for satellite, fixed wireless and other technologies, which has the potential to send billions more to Elon Musk’s Redmond-based Starlink internet service. Musk served previously as a top adviser to President Donald Trump and spent upward of $200 million to help get Trump elected last year.
The BEAD program was created under the federal infrastructure law that former President Joe Biden signed in 2021. It was fashioned as a way to expand high-speed internet service into rural areas and other parts of the country where it was unavailable or lacking.
In Washington, local applicants looking to get some of that money include private companies, public utilities, tribes, nonprofits, local governments and more. The state has said it will offer $300 million in matching funds for local governments and tribes.
This year, Washington’s broadband office received hundreds of applications from across the state, and provisionally awarded money to some applicants. 
Other states were further behind than Washington, and now face application rounds as short as four days to meet new deadlines set by the Trump administration, said Aaron Wheeler, director of the Washington State Broadband Office, in a webinar last week.
“We were coming to the end, so we’ve got kind of a few of these things in place, but it does mean that there were some things that needed to be adjusted on the fly,” Wheeler said.
Washington expects to open up the next round of applications in early July. States have until early September to submit final plans on how to spend their portions to the federal government. The feds say they’ll review those plans within 90 days. 
The guidelines from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration aim to streamline the process, reduce costs, speed up deployment and increase marketplace competition, according to the agency. They eliminate a mandate to analyze climate resilience, and provisions related to open access, low-cost service plans and labor requirements.
State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen noted that Musk’s Starlink is a Washington-based company.
“Over 60% of the satellites currently in orbit are made right here in our state,” he said.
“As the federal guidelines evolve to allow more alternative technologies, we will continue to work closely with partners across the state to make sure we do not miss this generational opportunity to deliver broadband access to every community,” Nguyen added.
An applicant’s perspective
The Kitsap Public Utility District remains laser-focused on fiber-optic cable as the solution to poor internet access. 
Experts see wired service as the gold standard for fast, reliable internet. 
Claire Ward, a telecom strategist at the Kitsap County utility, fears it’ll now be a “race to the bottom” for other applicants seeking cheaper options to expand access. To her, while there is room for satellite and fixed wireless as solutions, they would serve more as band-aids than long-term fixes.
On Wednesday, two members of Washington’s congressional delegation, Sen. Maria Cantwell and Rep. Suzan DelBene, made that point to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
“We made the decision to invest larger sums now in broadband infrastructure that would be resilient and capable of meeting Americans’ growing digital demands for decades,” reads the letter they signed alongside dozens of lawmakers.
Ward hopes Washington will still lean into fiber under a provision in the original bipartisan infrastructure law that says “priority broadband projects” funded under BEAD must be designed “designed to provide broadband service that meets speed, latency, reliability, consistency in quality of service, and related criteria” that can be scaled to meet evolving technology needs. 
Only fiber could meet that requirement, Ward and others say.
The moving goalposts have left Ward feeling tired. She’s worried applicants who now need to reapply for funding will run out of resources and give up on the program. 
“I hope that they will be able to dig in their heels,” she said.
She doesn’t want to see the broadband program fall the way of the federal Rural Digital Opportunity Fund started under the first Trump administration, which has seen many providers default and rural areas left without any improved service.
In six months, Ward thinks, the state will know how well BEAD will serve Washington.
In the background
Broadband officials are also grappling with an unpopular provision tucked into the massive tax cut and spending bill Republicans are considering in Congress. 
The sweeping legislation, now in the Senate, would impose a 10-year ban on state regulation of artificial intelligence. If states don’t follow the prohibition on enforcing new or existing laws, the federal government would rescind the federal broadband funding. 
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown has said the ban would jeopardize the state’s laws on deepfakes in political advertising and fabricated sexual images known as “revenge porn.” Dozens of attorneys general from Republican- and Democratic-led states oppose the measure, arguing they can’t rely on Congress to adequately regulate artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, at this tumultuous moment, Wheeler, the director of Washington’s broadband office, is stepping down Friday. Wheeler, who was appointed in March 2024, is taking a job with the Suquamish Tribe. The state Department of Commerce, which houses the broadband office, expects to name an interim director while recruiting for a permanent leader.
“That person’s preferences of technology are going to have a big impact on how the Washington state BEAD program plays out,” Ward said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/laptop-internet-broadband-computer.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Jackson Public Schools will take them. 
The district, in partnership with Women for Progress of Mississippi, is hosting its annual “Stuff the Bus” event, where people can drop off much-needed classroom supplies for JPS teachers. 
Volunteers are taking donations from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday at the Interstate-55 Kroger and the Walmart near Mississippi Highway 18. Buses are stationed at both sites to collect supplies. 
Items in high demand include dry-erase markers, scissors, staplers, hole punchers, pencils, pens, crayons, notebooks, tissue and paper of all kinds. In lieu of supplies, the district is also accepting gift cards to be used for classroom needs.
“We are incredibly grateful to our lead sponsors and all community members who step up each year to support our teachers,” said Thea Faulkner, director of the district’s Partners in Education program that focuses on connecting the community to the schools, in a statement. “Your generosity makes a real difference in our classrooms.”
The donations might be especially important this year. Schools across the country and state are preparing for the upcoming school year with a tighter purse than usual, thanks to the Trump administration’s decision to freeze some federal funds.

Balloons, unicorn headbands and crayons adorned the inside of the Michigan Hall of Justice, where the state supreme court meets, as members of the judicial system and child welfare system joined reunified families to celebrate the work it takes to restore families.
Through coordination between courts and child welfare professionals, parents who are struggling and need support in order to reunify with their children are given opportunities in family courts to be met with opportunity, not punishment, Cavanagh said. 
“It is not an easy journey for these parents or their children, but their resilience and strength in staying the course makes it all the more worthwhile when they get to live together as a family. At the center of all of it is love,” Cavanagh said. “Love is what brings families back together against all odds. Love is what makes Reunification Day possible, and love is what puts the smile on these faces and the tears in our eyes.”

In order to promote healing in the state, the child welfare system in Michigan needs to continuously ask hard questions on how things can be improved to best serve communities, Demetrius Starling, senior deputy director of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ Children’s Services Administration said. 
But at the heart of child welfare, Starling said the goal is to make Michigan a state that not only protects children, but restores families.
Separating children from their parents for the family’s welfare can be a traumatic experience for everyone involved, and is not a decision made lightly, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Lisa McCormick said. As the judge that presides over the county’s family division, McCormick thanked the child welfare professionals, foster parents and family relatives in the room that have stood with parents as they navigate reunification.
Reunified families who received support in family court in Ingham County joined in sharing their stories of how the services they received during the reunification process changed their lives.

Jamie Hodge told the crowd she still remembers forcing a smile and waving at her children so they would be less scared while child protective services took them away.
“When I became a mother, I experienced a kind of love like nothing I’d ever felt before, a kind of love that made me want to be the best mom I could possibly be. I would have never believed then that I would ever struggle with homelessness, addiction and my children being removed,” Hodge said.
Nothing in her life has been more heart-wrenching than watching her kids be taken away, Hodge said, and the experience left her bedridden for days. She said the only thing that motivated her to continue was the hope of reunification.
Family recovery court in Ingham County was a guiding light to recovery, Hodge said. It provided support and guidance on how to navigate getting her children back.

While working towards reunification, Hodge said the resources the court provided helped her get into treatment for addiction, gain employment and rent a house.
“I had a judge who believed in me and who helped me learn to advocate for myself and never gave up on me. I had a village. I was able to take such a hard time and turn it into an opportunity,” Hodge said, joined by her children at the event Thursday.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)While utility consumers grapple with skyrocketing costs, lawmakers say they are looking for ways to keep electricity affordable and demand accountability from power companies. 
Led by Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Somerset), a group of bipartisan lawmakers announced a package of six bills intended to modernize New Jersey’s electric grid and keep rates stable. The state has previously relied on utility companies to upgrade the grid, but things haven’t moved fast enough — leaving it to the Legislature to act, Zwicker told reporters Thursday at the Statehouse in Trenton.
“Our transmission lines, as I’m sure some of you have heard, are unprepared to deal with the skyrocketing demand for energy. New innovations, such as electric cars, appliances, AI-based technology, all require massive amounts of electricity,” Zwicker said. “We are right now plugging 21st-century technology into a 20th-century energy grid, and the problems continue to mount.”
Democrats have blamed PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization that oversees and controls the electric grid for 12 states, including New Jersey, for the spike in electric bills seen starting this month. They have called for an investigation of the company’s capacity market auction, a price-setting auction that saw a nearly tenfold increase over the previous sale last July.
“If you’re hearing, as you drive through New Jersey, blood-curdling screams, they’re real, and they’re from the citizens of the state,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex). “People are going to be unbelievably angry, and they should be unbelievably angry.” 
Some of the bills in the package announced Thursday would: 

Require artificial intelligence data centers and crypto mining facilities to submit an energy plan to the Board of Public Utilities and mandate certain renewable energy for AI and crypto newly coming to New Jersey. 
Establish a program to “facilitate the development of energy-related projects.”
Create a new incentive program to redevelop decommissioned power plant sites into fusion energy hubs. 

Lawmakers said three other bills would be filed Thursday.
Smith stressed that New Jersey has to work in conjunction with the 13 states and the District of Columbia that PJM also oversees. Even if New Jersey rejected data center plans here, he noted, they could still be built in places like Virginia using the same electric grid New Jersey relies on. 
He suggested that without major reforms at PJM, New Jersey should considering working with another regional transmission organization. These organizations are supposed to keep power costs as low as possible, “and clearly, that’s not working with PJM anymore,” Smith added.  
Smith said New Jersey could absolutely remain with PJM, but “they know they have a problem.” 
“It’s unfair, inherently unfair to everybody out there in New Jersey. So I think putting that out there — let’s investigate,” he said. “Could we have a better deal someplace else? Should we do it ourselves? It’s smart for New Jersey to do it.”
New Jersey Republicans have blamed Democrats and Gov. Phil Murphy’s energy policies for the price hike, criticizing Murphy’s focus on offshore wind projects that have yet to materialize and have been blocked by the Trump administration.
Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) said New Jersey is “being held hostage,” echoing other Democrats who have claimed PJM is keeping prices high by refusing to connect various renewable energy sources to its grid.
“Bottom line is very simple — Legislature has to concentrate on what we can do and be effective. Modernizing the grid is real. It should happen,” he said. “We shouldn’t have to tell the utilities to do it. We should not have to direct the BPU to do it.” 
PJM has previously blamed the current price spike on a divergence between supply and demand.
“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” Dan Lockwood, a spokesperson for PJM, told the New Jersey Monitor earlier this month.

Regardless, a report issued Thursday by the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan estimated that the proposed cuts would result in at least 200,000 state residents no longer having health care coverage either through directly losing access to their plan, or by service providers that rely heavily on Medicaid funding to operate going belly up.
The report noted that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to approximately a quarter of Michigan’s more than ten million residents and has taken on a larger role over the past two decades, mainly due to enrollment spikes from economic downturns following the 2009 Great Recession and 2020 COVID pandemic, as well as the 2014 expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to certain low-income, non-disabled adults. Michigan was one of 40 states that exercised that option.
“We want to help establish the public understanding of how Medicaid works,” Eric Lupher, the council’s president, said. “Medicaid has such a large impact on the state, both as a share of the state budget and in terms of how many people have health insurance through the program. This paper gives people the information they need to understand the debate and prepare for what might happen if the legislation is enacted.”
The council’s report, which was issued prior to the parliamentarian’s ruling that the GOP proposal violated the Senate’s rules, was based on the original numbers. It says if substantial cuts are made to Medicaid as currently being proposed in the “big, beautiful bill”, Michigan stands to lose at least $2 billion per year in Medicaid revenue, and as much as $4 billion, resulting in policymakers having to decide between drastically cutting back the program, making reductions elsewhere in the state budget, or finding new revenue sources to make up the shortfall, “none of which are attractive options.”
Memo1180-Federal_Medicaid_Cuts_Will_Have_Big_Consequences_in_Michigan
Additionally, the proposed Medicaid cuts would likely have a negative outcome on local hospitals, particularly in rural areas. 
“If Medicaid spending is reduced substantially, some rural providers are likely to become unviable, which will not only impact those losing Medicaid coverage but also affect people living in those areas who have secure, private coverage,” the report stated.
The GOP bill is intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts made during President Donald Trump’s first term, as well as make spending reductions in an effort to vastly shrink the size of the federal government.
A report released in May by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services estimated as many as 700,000 Michiganders could lose coverage if the Medicaid cuts were to win approval, with calculations indicating that upwards of 40% of them would be dropped due to the implementation of work requirements.
The research council’s report concurred in that overall assessment, saying that while the precise estimates vary, expanded work requirements will result in significantly less people being eligible for Medicaid coverage. However, it said that would mostly be due to the “administrative burden” of fulfilling the requirements, not necessarily because the recipients did not truly have a need for assistance.
“Differing opinions exist as to whether the people who will be unenrolled due to work requirements should receive benefits from the program, but the fact that the requirements will decrease enrollment is intentional,” the report stated.
The council said one goal of the report was to provide insight into the complexity of the federal-state Medicaid partnership in delivering health care coverage while also supporting the state’s health care system.
“As a matter of policy, Medicaid is relatively complicated, so it is not always easy to understand how a change in the law might impact the actual delivery of health care on the ground,” Karley Abramson, the research council’s associate for health policy said. “If you are not familiar with how Medicaid eligibility and funding work, you would not necessarily realize how dramatically the proposed legislation could impact people and health care providers in the state.”

Now, the U.S. Congress plans to extend a 2017 federal tax law that would hand even more benefits to the richest few, while hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians face the loss of health care and food assistance, as well as rising costs. 
North Carolina state leaders will soon have a choice: Will they accept the harm being forced on our communities and slash essential services? Or will they step up to protect people’s health, stability, and financial well-being?  
So far, signs point in the wrong direction.  
Some state lawmakers have introduced proposals this session which indicate the legislative majority will embrace plans that take health care away from North Carolinians. Legislators in both the House and Senate introduced proposals that fast-track Medicaid work reporting requirements — an unnecessary and punitive measure that could strip health care from up to an estimated 496,000 people as soon as federal law allows. These proposals push the state’s Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to begin planning for the implementation of Medicaid work reporting requirements on an expedited timeline, requiring DHHS to notify the legislature of the funding necessary for implementation within 30 days of approval by the Center for Medicaid Services.  
But there is another path, and we must demand that state legislative leaders choose it for the health and wellbeing of us all.  
Our state legislators should be unwilling to accept a future in which more North Carolinians are uninsured, sick, and hungry. They must recognize that when federal leaders walk away from their responsibilities, the consequences fall on states like North Carolina. And state lawmakers have the tools to respond.
Here’s one simple step for them to take: They can establish a higher income tax rate on incomes over $1 million.
A millionaire’s tax at 7 percent on incomes over $1 million — a rate still lower than the highest rates pre-2013 — would provide more than $980 million in additional revenue every year. That revenue could protect North Carolinians from harmful federal cuts.   
Right now, North Carolina uses a flat income tax rate — the same rate for someone living in poverty and a millionaire. The flat income tax rate means the richest would receive the biggest windfall from any future tax cuts.   
In contrast, adopting a higher rate on higher incomes wouldn’t impact the rate paid by the vast majority of North Carolinians, and even millionaires would still pay the lower rate on their first $1 million in annual income. That’s how graduated income tax rate schedules work to ensure fairness and adequacy — necessary functions of a tax code that provides funding for the health care, child care, housing, and education that delivers better outcomes for people and a stronger economy. 
As congressional leaders push for more federal tax breaks for the rich — shifting the costs of essential programs onto states — everyday North Carolinians will be expected to pick up the slack. Estimates of the tax break from the U.S. House package find that the richest 1 percent of North Carolinians, whose annual income averages about $1.9 million, would receive an average annual tax cut of nearly $65,000 (3.5 percent of their income), a disproportionately larger cut relative to that received by the worst-paid North Carolinians, who would receive a tax cut of just $80 (just 0.6 percent of their annual income).

Here in North Carolina, state Senate leaders have signaled where they stand. Rather than fight for the wellbeing of every North Carolinian and keep costs low for us all, they would continue to cut taxes for millionaires. In their budget proposal, the Senate leaders propose reducing the personal income tax rate to 1.99 percent as soon as 2031 if certain revenue triggers are met. To be clear, for more than a decade, millionaires have reaped significant benefits from state income tax cuts and, once again, they would reap the lion’s share of this next state income tax cut.
According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, this Senate proposal alone would deliver an additional average annual tax cut of $64,700 to millionaires in North Carolina, on top of their federal tax cuts and more than a decade of state cuts. This is more than 52 times the average amount received by non-millionaires, who would see roughly $1,200.

At a time when so much is at stake for our communities, it’s essential that leaders make sure the wealthy pay what they truly owe. State leaders can protect North Carolinians from the losses Congress is proposing by implementing a millionaire’s tax now.   
A budget that hands out more tax breaks to millionaires at a time when essential federal supports are being dismantled isn’t just short-sighted — it’s dangerous. 
North Carolina needs a better plan than what Senate leaders are offering us. When lawmakers choose people over profits, our state can build a future where everyone has the freedom and opportunity to thrive.

“We really are pleased that the Legislature and Gov. (Mike) Braun moved forward and approved an increase in these tobacco taxes,” said Mike Seilback, who is the national assistant vice president for state public policy at the American Lung Association.

He called the hike — the first since 2007 — a “win-win-win.”
Rising prices can discourage people from using the products and developing nicotine additions, but current users may also seize on the sticker shock as a reason to try quitting. And those who don’t stop will fill the state’s coffers.
“Most tobacco users want to quit, but nicotine is highly addictive — the average tobacco user tries to quit, you know, seven times before they’re successful,” Seilback said. “By increasing this tax, we expect many Hoosiers to take the opportunity to make another quit attempt and be successful.”
The American Lung Association estimates that 38,000 adult Indiana smokers will successfully quit in response to the tax boost.

“It usually starts with less heart attacks,” Seilback said, as well as fewer secondhand smoke-induced asthma attacks. Lung cancer takes longer to develop, but he also anticipated seeing sales flag and quit line calls rise.
That’s a boon for the chamber, which has been pushing an increase for nearly 15 years.
“This is a workforce issue … A healthy state and healthy Hoosiers is good for business,” President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders said.
She cited a 2020 fact sheet from Indiana’s Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission that found workers who smoke each cost their employers an estimated $5,800 more in health care and lost productivity annually than non-smoking workers. Collectively, smoking costs Indiana upwards of $6 billion annually in health care and lost productivity.
A lower smoking rate, Sinders said, improves employee wellness, lowers health care costs and cuts absenteeism.
Change takes effect the sooner people are aware of the tax increases, according to Seilback. Quit line advertising can help.
That’s why the Chamber’s Wellness Council of Indiana on Thursday released an updated version of its Quit Now Tool.
“It’s a much-strengthened playbook designed to help employers act on this unique moment,” Ashley O’Rourke, the council’s executive director, said in a news release.

The web-based platform offers ready-to-use modules and printable course completion certificates. It’s now easier for managers to invite employees online and see their progress. The tool also added accessibility features.
“We feel like this is an important opportunity for us, the Indiana Chamber, to be out there with resources for employers and Hoosiers who, again, see that … $2-a-pack increase, and want to take that next step,” Sinders said.
Seilback warned that the General Assembly’s job isn’t done yet.
He noted the recent proliferation of nicotine pouches and heated tobacco products, particularly among younger Hoosiers.
“This is an industry that survives on addicting their next generation of customers,” Seilback said. “So, unfortunately, the industry is always coming up with new products that aren’t covered by current policies.”
“That’s why it’s so important that the Legislature continues … to make sure that (new products) are taxed appropriately,” he added. “Because we’re not going to achieve the gains we need to, from a public health perspective, if (people) are just switching. We want to make sure that they never start and that current users quit.”
Another increase
Transportation infrastructure will also get a boost after Indiana’s gasoline excise tax hops another penny higher. It’s indexed to inflation, but the annual increase is statutorily capped to a cent.
It will now add 36 cents to the price of every gallon of gasoline.
Sinders said the tax funds roads — and more — that are “really important to the state, to our future economic prosperity.”
The chamber, as the state’s largest broad-based business advocacy organization, has members who like and dislike the increase.
But, Sinders said, “all business cares about infrastructure and wants to make sure that our roads are … funded in a way that kind of sets us up for success, and sets these businesses up for success.”
The gasoline sales tax, which is updated monthly, will increase July 1, too. It’s up by about a cent, and will cost 17 and a half cents per gallon.
Federal gas taxes add 18.4 cents per gallon and there is also an oil inspection fee of one cent.
That brings the total of state and federal taxes per gallon to 72.9 cents.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Schools nationwide, including across Oklahoma, are still waiting for federal funds supporting English learners and migrant students while the Trump administration seeks to eliminate both programs.
As schools prepare their annual budgets for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins Tuesday, the Oklahoma State Department of Education reported this week it hasn’t yet received money from the federal government for migrant education and English language acquisition, along with a few other funds typically awarded annually to all 50 states.
The U.S. Department of Education, under Trump Cabinet Secretary Linda McMahon, has suggested eliminating the $375.6 million fund designated for children of migrant workers who travel from state to state within the school year and the $890 million for students learning English as their non-native language. McMahon’s budget proposal also suggests sweeping changes to other funding initiatives. 
The federal agency is yet to disclose a funding estimate for English learners, migrant education and Title II teacher-development programs for the 2025 fiscal year, which for the federal government ends Sept. 30. Education advocacy groups say the delay is cause for alarm and hinders districts’ ability to prepare for the coming school year.

Oklahoma received $6.43 million from the federal government for English language acquisition and $240,000 for migrant education in the 2024 fiscal year. About 13% of Oklahoma’s 700,000 public-school students are English learners, according to state records. The most recent national data available counted 79 migrant children in Oklahoma and 267,643 across the country.
The federal Department of Education has said it’s still finalizing funding decisions for FY 2025 and “remains committed to meeting its statutory responsibilities and stewarding taxpayer resources responsibly.”
Oklahoma state Superintendent Ryan Walters said he intends to “implement President (Donald) Trump’s America First reset” in public school classrooms, but he noted the U.S. Department of Education, not the state, controls federal allocations to schools.
“Our guidance to districts is to only budget for allocations (the U.S. Department of Education) has already rewarded,” Walters said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice.
In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal, the Trump administration specifically recommended eliminating funding for migrant education, also known as Title I Part C, because it “encourages ineligible non-citizens to access taxpayer dollars stripping resources from American students.”
“Elimination of this program is part of the administration’s overall effort to restore fiscal discipline and reduce the federal role in education,” the proposal reads.

Walters similarly has referred to immigrant students as a “taxpayer burden” crippling schools. He proposed a now-defeated policy to require public-school families to verify their citizenship status during school enrollment.
The federal agency said it isn’t requesting funds for English learner programs, either, because “states and localities, not the federal government, are best suited to determine what evidence-based literacy instructional materials will improve outcomes for all students.”
That connects with the Trump administration’s larger goal of turning over broad control of federal education dollars to the states. 
If Trump succeeds, it could be more challenging to maintain the same level of financial support for English learner programs in states like Oklahoma where political leaders espouse rhetoric similar to Walters’, said Jeff Hutcheson, director of advocacy and public policy for TESOL International Association.
“I am concerned that, especially in some states, there may be some steps backward in the service and support of English learners,” Hutcheson said.
TESOL stands for teaching English to speakers of other languages, and the federal government has been an invaluable source of professional development and support for teachers who work with this student group, Hutcheson said. The U.S. Department of Education also holds states and schools accountable for upholding English learners’ civil rights.

Not all 5 million English learners attending U.S. public schools are immigrants, Hutcheson said, but this group does have some overlap with migrant children, whose federal funding also is in doubt.
The migrant and English learner programs together provide about $218,000 to Frederick Public Schools, a district of 700 students in southwest Oklahoma. 
Superintendent Shannon Vanderburg said his district educates children of migrant laborers working on farms in the area.
The district already rehired employees who provide migrant and English learner services for the next school year. To lose federal support for either program would be a “big hit,” Vanderburg said.
The migrant education funds are flexible, he said, which allows Frederick schools to provide tutoring, summer and weekend reading academies, eye doctor and dentist visits for students, and GED programs for their parents.
Just under a quarter of Frederick students are learning English as their second language, state records show. The district received high marks on state report cards for these students’ progress toward English proficiency.
“The awful part of this is, you can see through our kids’ test scores that it’s working,” Vanderburg said. “What we’re doing is working and working well, and I just don’t want to lose that momentum with our kids.”
A letter from 82 advocacy organizations and education-focused groups, including the TESOL International Association, urged Congress not to cut English learner funding, also known as Title III. 
Instead, the letter’s cosigners, led by UnidosUS, encouraged federal lawmakers to increase Title III funding from $890 million to $1 billion to keep up with economic inflation and growth in the number of English learners. 
“Congress must not betray their commitment to English learner education, as our nation cannot afford the consequences of leaving these students behind,” the May 23 letter states.
The letter also criticized the U.S. Department of Education’s decision to abolish its Office of English Language Acquisition. A federal judge has since overruled the agency’s mass layoffs, but the matter is still tied up in court.
Future of rural education program in doubt
Other programs, though funded this year, could be eliminated in the future. 
Rather than doling out money into “numerous small, poorly designed programs,” the federal Education Department aims to consolidate funding into larger, more flexible block grants given to every state. These grants would grant individual states more control over how they spend their federal education funds, a measure Oklahoma state leaders welcomed.
Funds designated for rural schools, homeless children, gifted and talented programs, and school safety are among the many programs the Trump administration suggested for consolidation into state grants. 
That means the federal government would no longer require states to continue funding most of these initiatives, if state officials don’t wish it. 
The administrative work and auditing that come with federal dollars are “just burdensome,” said Jeff Thompson, superintendent of Sharon-Mutual Public Schools. 
The district of 220 students in northwest Oklahoma receives about $115,000 a year in federal funds, including about $20,000 from the Small, Rural School Achievement Program, which the U.S. Department of Education aims to end with consolidations in 2026.
“If they could find a way to get us the money and let local control take over, that would be the best way,” Thompson said.
However, these programs provide essential services that would be nigh impossible for many rural schools to replace. 
That’s the case in Sharon-Mutual schools, too, Thompson said. The district uses the money to pay for technology needs and its parent communication system.
The neighboring Mooreland Public Schools in northwest Oklahoma receives about $40,000 from the rural achievement program. 
Superintendent Theron Graybill said this money allows the district to provide an updated Chromebook to every student.
“It’s pretty vital for us in keeping us up-to-date on technology out here,” Graybill said.

NEZ PERCE RESERVATION, IDAHO – Long before the American government removed them both from their ancestral homelands, wolves and Native Americans coexisted side-by-side for centuries.
Those connections run deep for Shannon Wheeler, the chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee.
Wheeler remembers growing up as a boy, hearing elder members of the Nez Perce Tribe tell stories about wolves.
One story involves a young boy talking with his grandfather.
“They were talking and the grandfather told him that each of us have a wolf inside of us.
We actually have two wolves inside of us. 
One’s a good wolf, and one’s a bad wolf.
And they’re constantly fighting one another. 
And the grandson asked him, ‘Well, Grandpa, which wolf wins?’ 
And he says, ‘Whichever one you feed the most will win,‘” Wheeler said.
The story of the two wolves is one that Wheeler carries with him to this day.
“We’re able to utilize that lesson and our teachings to our younger ones coming up as we continue to try to grow our people and to fit into part of a world that is outside of who we are and outside of our culture and so we need those strengths,” Wheeler said. “We need to know that we’re feeding the good wolf inside of us so that we are that strong.”

In addition to the stories, some members of the Nez Perce Tribe develop even deeper spiritual connections with wolves.
“What I can tell you from my position as the Tribal chairman is the wolf has always played a significant part in who we are as people, based on even the names of our people,” Wheeler said. “Many of our people have gone out for wéyekins … A wéyekin is something where you go and fast and you get your animal spirit, and it’ll come to you. And sometimes it’s a himíin, it’s a wolf. Himíin is the name for us for wolf.”
Nearly 70 years after the U.S. government drove the wolf population to near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, that spiritual connection is what led tribal members to work to bring the himíin back to Idaho, Yellowstone National Park and the West. This is the story of how the Nez Perce pulled off a task no one else wanted – and why they’re still fighting for wolves today.
 An opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land

For thousands of years the Nez Perce Tribe has lived, hunted, fished and traded in what are now parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Wyoming.
Over time, members of the Nez Perce Tribe developed a deep connection to the land and animals, said Allen Pinkham, a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who was born in 1938.
“To us, we are given the opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land that we’re at right now, and then we’re supposed to take care of the land and all the species that we utilize because it’s a life source,” Pinkham said. “It’s an opportunity to believe and have faith in your Creator. That’s what we do, and we’re supposed to take care of everything else, because it provides and sustains life for ourselves.”
Today, the Nez Perce is a federally recognized tribe that has about 3,500 members and governs the Nez Perce Reservation that is located in north-central Idaho.

The Tribe’s headquarters is located in the town of Lapwai, Idaho, and the reservation sits on a fraction of the Nez Perce’s ancestral territory. Lapwai is a working-class town nestled in a valley and the reservation is a mix of grassland, forested mountains and rural communities anchored by the Clearwater River.
An 1855 treaty between the Nez Perce Tribe and the U.S. government set aside about 7.5 million acres of land for the tribe.
But after gold was discovered on the reservation, additional treaties shrunk its size to less than a tenth of what it was. It’s now about 770,000 acres
 The Idaho Legislature wanted no part of the federal governments plan to reintroduce wolves to Idaho

Thanks to bounties, trapping and widespread poisoning, by the 1930s the U.S. federal government all but killed off wolves that used to roam the U.S. Rocky Mountains from the Canadian border to Mexico.
But in the 1990s the U.S. government undertook one of the most controversial wildlife programs in history – capturing wild wolves in Canada and reintroducing them in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.

On Jan. 14, 1995 – in the aftermath of a major snowstorm, Suzanne Asha Stone was part of a convoy of vehicles that made a white-knuckle drive across icy roads to release four wolves at Corn Creek at the edge of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Central Idaho. At the time, Stone was an intern on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s wolf capture and reintroduction team.
Conditions were so sketchy that some members of the team unbuckled their seatbelts as they worried about plunging into the freezing Salmon River below, Stone said.
“If you slid off the road into the river, you wouldn’t have had time to disconnect your seat belt,” Stone said. “It was kind of like the decision of what’s the worst that could happen, and preparing for that.”
The wolves, which had been flown from Canada, were placed in kennels and driven in the back of U.S. Forest Service pickups to the Frank Church Wilderness.
When they arrived at Corn Creek, the wolf team opened the kennel doors and immediately released the wolves into the wild.
Those first four wolves reintroduced in Idaho had only been running wild for three days when the Idaho Legislature nearly derailed the entire operation.
On Jan. 17, 1995, the Idaho Legislature rejected the Wolf Recovery and Management Plan developed by the Legislative Wolf Oversight Committee.
The move blocked the state from leading wolf recovery in Idaho.
And it left the federal government without a local partner to monitor and oversee the first wolf population to call Idaho home in more than half of a century.
What happened next is a largely untold story of how the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho.
Even now, 30 years later, many people in Idaho don’t know the role the Tribe played.
 ‘A song for the wolves:‘ How the Nez Perce Tribe saved wolves in Idaho

Even as the Idaho Legislature said no to wolves, the Nez Perce Tribe was demonstrating its connection to wolves and investment in wolf reintroduction.
Just before wolves were reintroduced to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in January 1995, the late Horace Axtell, who was the spiritual leader of the traditional Nez Perce Seven-Drum religion, and Tribal member Allen Pinkham traveled to Missoula, Montana.
Axtell and Pinkham came to offer blessings for the wolves that had been captured in Canada and were being kept in kennels at an airport hangar before their release. They met the wolves just before they were transported over the final leg of their journey for reintroduction.
During the ceremony, Axtell welcomed the wolves back home to Montana, Idaho and Yellowstone.
“And so he sang a song for the wolves,” Pinkham said.
About that time, the late Nez Perce leader Levi Holt traveled to Boise to meet with policymakers, said his nephew, James Holt.
Levi Holt delivered a speech at the Idaho State Capitol pushing to have the Nez Perce Tribe take responsibility for the new wolf program in Idaho, James Holt said.
“My uncle Levi, being very active at that time, made that impassioned speech before decision makers to actually push them to have the Tribe be the managing partner for that reintroduction effort,” James Holt said.
It worked.

Because of the Tribe’s connection to wolves and history of coexistence, the Nez Perce Tribe was ready to take over wolf reintroduction and conservation after the Idaho Legislature said no.
“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was looking for a partner, and we became that partner,” said Aaron Miles Sr., who has worked as natural resources manager for the Nez Perce Tribe since 1999.
Miles was still finishing his forestry degree at University of Idaho when the Nez Perce took over the program in Idaho. He took pride in seeing the Tribe taking a lead role in protecting a species that had shared a homeland with his ancestors.
But Miles also heard plenty of stereotypes and lots of misinformation about the Tribe – even among college students he was helping tutor.
“I’d hear all the chatter about, well, can the Tribe do this? How can they do that?” Miles said. “They’re all these questions, and sometimes it was racist. It wasn’t just the fact that they were asking an honest question. But it had to be like, ‘OK, these Indians, this or that,‘ and here I am helping some of these guys with their homework, and that really upset me.”
 Hiking and howling, the jaw-dropping work of monitoring Idaho’s new wolf population

Biologist Marcie Carter is a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who served on the Tribe‘s wolf project starting in June 1997.
Carter got her start while she was still a student at Lewis-Clark State College and helped put together the first wolf management plan.

“Our goal was to go into the field, find paired up wolves that potentially had pups, and document the reproduction of those wolves, and also count how many pups were out there,” Carter said.
“That summer I don’t even recall how many, we probably had maybe five or six pairs of wolves that had puppies that year,” Carter said. “So they started out very well.”
Carter and another biologist spent their summer hiking around Central Idaho in places like Stanley and the Bear Valley area near the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, looking for wolves.
The wolves had been fitted with radio collars that allowed the wolf project team to track their location.
Typically a pilot and another team member would fly overhead, locate the wolves from the air and then use a radio to relay the animals‘ location to the biologists on the ground.
At that point, the biologists would hike in and locate the wolves.
“We worked 10 days in a row, and then we’d take four days off,” Carter said. “And we camped out, we backpacked and lived in a tent and slept on our Therm-A-Rest and ate packaged noodles. And every day for those 10 days, that’s what we were doing. We were up, out and looking for any type of sign of wolves.”
Although she grew up in Idaho and had spent time in the woods, Carter hadn’t really ventured into the wilderness until she joined the Nez Perce‘s wolf project team.
Before setting out, she had to borrow a backpack, sleeping bag, tent and cook stove.
A typical assignment during her first summer in 1997 involved flying into Central Idaho’s remote Chamberlain Basin with a team of other biologists.
Located within the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the Chamberlain Basin was the site where one of the first wolf packs in Idaho established territory following the reintroduction of wolves. That pack became known as the Chamberlain Basin Pack.
“That was basically our lives during that time,” Carter said. “It was just backpacking, walking, hiking, listening. It was a great time.”
The reason they spent so much time in wolf country is because that is the best way to get an idea of how the wolves are doing and what they are up to.
Carter and the team conducted howl surveys. With hands cupped over mouths, researchers threw their heads back and let out their best imitation wolf howls.
They hoped to get live wolves to howl in response, which helped them track the wolves’ location.
As the team hiked and drove across wolf country, they scoured the ground for wolf tracks and droppings that researchers call scat.
They analyzed data from wolves fitted with radio collars.
They documented the newborn pups.
And they counted the wolves that were killed.
Once a year the team packed all that data into a report documenting Idaho‘s wolf population.
“It was all very positive and very, very jaw-dropping type work,” Carter said.
Although the wolf project started as a cool summer job for her, it became more than that.
Carter soon began asking one of her grandfathers about wolves.
They talked about how himíin, the Nimíipuu language word for wolf, comes from the word for mouth. That’s because wolves talk to each other, Carter said, with their howls.
When older members of the Nez Perce Tribe began to find out about the wolf project, they asked Carter about her work and shared stories about the Tribe’s history.
When they talked about losing wolves from the landscape, sometimes the older Nez Perce members talked to Carter about other losses the Tribe experienced.
“It was a learning experience for me, not just in the field, but culturally,” Carter said.
“It’s just that it goes back to the loss of the connection that all Tribal people went through, with being moved to the reservation, being forced to stop speaking our language,” Carter said.
“It did kind of raise that awareness – also for other Tribal people – that loss that we had experienced and continue to experience,” Carter said. “And then that reconnection – it happened with wolves. It’s happening with salmon. Maybe someday it’ll happen with grizzly bears.”
Over six years on the wolf project, Carter documented growth and stabilization in Idaho’s wolf population.
And as she observed wolves in their natural habitat, Carter saw a very different side to the animals that people warned her about.
“I saw these families of wolves taking care of each other and playing, and they are not this evil that people think,” Carter said.
 As the wolf population increased in Idaho, calls for change grew

During Carter’s time monitoring wolves, the population increased significantly.
Compared to the original 15 wolves released in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in 1995, the Nez Perce Tribe reported a minimum of 192 wolves in the central Idaho recovery area in the fall of 2000.
At the end of 2005 – a decade after wolves were reintroduced to Idaho – the Nez Perce team and Idaho Department of Fish and Game biologists had identified 59 resident wolf packs in Idaho.
Biologists observed a minimum of 370 wolves in 2005, and estimated the state’s wolf population to be 512 in 2005.
By 2005, wolf territory in Idaho stretched from near the Canadian border, south to Interstate 84 and east from the Oregon border to the Montana and Wyoming borders, the wolf team noted in its annual report.
During 2005, Wildlife Services officials said 26 cattle, 218 sheep and nine dogs were reported as “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills.
As the number of wolves and wolf kills increased, so did the calls to remove the wolf from the Endangered Species List and turn management of wolves over to the states.
Under the Endangered Species Act, animals that are listed in danger of extinction are given protections – like the protection of critical habitat and prohibitions on hunting – and recovery plans. For species protected by the Endangered Species Act, the animals’ recovery and stabilization is the priority.
Animal species that have been saved by Endangered Special Act protections include the bald eagle, the California condor, the whooping crane and grizzly bear, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Once species are removed from Endangered Species Act protections, regulations can be eased and states can approve hunting rules or other management and lethal population control methods.
In January 2006, then-Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Interior transferring day-to-day management of wolves to the state of Idaho.
After about a decade, the Nez Perce Tribes’ role leading wolf recovery in Idaho had come to an end.
“I think we would have kept it, but the funding was going away, and so we did not have the money to keep a program going,” Carter said. “And so I think the only way was basically to hand it over to the state.”
 Removing wolves from protections under the Endangered Species Act

By 2007, the state of Idaho was officially planning for its first wolf hunts since reintroduction in 1995. At that same time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife put forward plans to remove the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List.
A series of legal battles ensued, where wolves were removed and then returned to the Endangered Species List.
In January 2009, Samuel N. Penney, the then-chairman of Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee, wrote a letter expressing the Tribe‘s full support for removing wolves from Endangered Species Act protections in Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, northern Utah and eastern Washington.

Penney told then-Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar that wolves met recovery goals for the Northern Rocky Mountain region in 2002.
By 2008, Idaho’s wolf population was estimated at over 800 wolves in 88 packs, Penney wrote.
“The Tribe wants, and understands that citizens of United States also want, wolves to be conserved,” Penney wrote. “The Tribe is confident that you understand the importance we place on being able to make decisions locally about how to wisely manage this resource in combination with all our other wildlife resources.”
Ultimately, wolves were removed from Endangered Species Act protections in 2011 after Congress inserted language into the federal budget requiring the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove wolves in Idaho, Montana, eastern Washington, eastern Oregon and north-central Utah from the Endangered Species List.
By May 2011, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game had taken over management of wolves in Idaho, and put wolf hunting tags up for sale.
Then in 2021, the Idaho Legislature expanded wolf hunting and trapping by removing the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters can buy, allowing trapping on private land year round and allowing the state to enter into contracts with third parties to kill wolves.
The state of Idaho had officially set out to reduce the wolf population by killing the predators.
Now Marcie Carter and other wolf advocates worry the government is starting to go down the same road it did 100 years ago when wolves were eradicated from the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” Carter said.

Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis are also backing Trump’s decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. 
The post After criticizing ‘warmonger’ Liz Cheney, Hageman backs U.S. intervention in Iran appeared first on WyoFile .","More than two years ago, Wyoming welcomed then-former President Donald Trump for his first political visit to the state. At a rally in Casper, Trump urged voters to choose Harriet Hageman over Liz Cheney in the race for Wyoming’s lone seat in the U.S. House. Chief among the reasons Trump highlighted was Cheney’s interventionist stance. 
“The Cheneys have never met a war they didn’t like,” Trump said, referring to both the congresswoman and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who played a pivotal role in the U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
“Wyoming deserves a congresswoman who stands up for you and your values, not one who spends all of her time putting you down, going after your president in the most vicious way possible and loving endless, nonsensical, bloody, horrible wars that never end,” Trump said. “They just never end.”
Hageman, too, cast Cheney as a “warmonger” for her “interventionist ways” during the 2022 campaign, and promised voters she would be a different kind of congresswoman for Wyoming.
Now, in her second term, Hageman joins U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis in backing the Trump administration’s intervention in the Middle East. 
The three members of Wyoming’s federal delegation have made public comments supporting Trump’s decision on Saturday to bomb three Iranian nuclear facilities. 
While a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is reported to be holding, Trump has said the conflict is both “over” and that it could start again “soon.” There have also been conflicting reports about the extent to which the U.S. strikes destroyed Iranian nuclear sites. 
Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiry asking to what extent they would support additional U.S. intervention in the conflict. 
Background
Before her ousting, Cheney supported U.S. intervention in the war between Ukraine and Russia. 
“America cannot defend and maintain our own freedom and security if we think that we’re simply going to withdraw from the world and not lead,” Cheney told CBS in February 2022.

In response, Hageman condemned the Russian invasion to Cowboy State Daily but pushed back on Cheney’s stance. 
“It’s also alarming to see that Liz Cheney simply can’t resist falling back into her interventionist ways. In her remarks, she came awfully close to calling for American military intervention, which would be extraordinarily dangerous and something that I strongly oppose,” Hageman said. “We must do whatever we can to support the Ukrainians, but inserting American troops squarely into the conflict would be a horrible idea.”
Since then, Hageman has voted against Ukrainian aid while supporting assistance for Israel. 
More recently, Hageman said, “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”
Ahead of Saturday’s strikes, Barrasso gave an interview to Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is a former co-host of the weekend show. During his TV appearance, Barrasso defended Trump for “doing absolutely the right thing to keep America safe.”
“He has been very consistent for 10 years, saying Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. He said it strongly. He’s read it repeatedly, because he knows that Iran with a nuclear weapon is a threat to the people of the United States, and we stand with the people of Israel,” Barrasso said. 
After the Saturday strikes, the Wyoming senator reiterated his position on X. 
“The greatest threat to the safety of the United States and the world is Iran with a nuclear weapon,” Barrasso wrote in a post. 
As Senate Majority Whip and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Barrasso has advocated for increased defense spending.
“Republicans will rebuild our military, improve military readiness, expand shipbuilding, and invest in new technologies to keep America safe, including an Iron Dome for America,” Barrasso said on the Senate floor in March. “All of this makes our military more lethal. Americans strongly support these policies. They know that this is the path towards safety and security.”
In 2023, Barrasso split with Lummis over whether to repeal the resolutions that gave the executive branch permission to wage decades of war in the Middle East, according to the Jackson Hole News and Guide. 
Lummis supported the repeal, describing the resolution as a move away from the model of “forever wars.” Generally speaking, Lummis has held a
cautious stance regarding American military intervention, recently citing concerns over spending levels. 
In the case of Iran, Lummis supports Trump. 
“For years, Iran has openly chanted ‘death to America’ and has acted as the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism. Iran having nuclear weapons is a threat to our country and allies. President Trump was right to order this strike on their nuclear facilities,” Lummis posted on X. 
“May God continue to bless our troops.”

An Albany County tornado this month proved a harmless weather event. Unless, that is, you’re part of southeastern Wyoming’s passionate and growing mountain bike community. 
The post Laramie’s Windy Windy gets very windy appeared first on WyoFile .","Amid a dramatic summer storm that brought hail and thunderstorm warnings, a tornado touched down June 17 outside Laramie and was on the ground for around five minutes, according to Albany County Emergency Services. 
The tornado ran 1.6 miles and its maximum wind speed reached an estimated 105 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Its path cut through a section of U.S. National Forest land, and there were no injuries or damage to structures.
A harmless weather event. Unless, that is, you’re part of southeastern Wyoming’s passionate and growing mountain bike community. 
The tornado spent its brief time on Earth knocking down a dense swath of trees across a beloved and critical piece of the growing Pilot Hill trail network. 
That trail section’s name? Windy Windy. 
The title invokes two homonyms, Richard Vercoe, one of the volunteers who maintains the trail network, told WyoFile — it is windy, as in curving across the landscape, and also windy, as in buffeted by Wyoming’s steady blow. 
“It’s the only section of trail named after the wind, and that’s where the tornado hit,” Vercoe said.

Windy Windy is a stretch of the trail connecting the pathways of the Pilot Hill area, a grouping of public land owned by various government entities and managed to the benefit of recreationalists, with the sprawling forest service land that includes the Happy Jack trail network. It’s a principal thoroughfare for mountain bikers linking together trails for long rides, Vercoe said. 
Windy Windy climbs and descends gently as it carries cyclists between forest and wide-open, high-country views, according to Vercoe, earning it devotion from area riders both for the flow of its trail and its aesthetics. 
But when a long-distance rider reached Windy Windy the day after the funnel struck, he found downed trees layered on top of each other. 
Vercoe, who visited the site the next day, said the tornado left the downed trees in a pattern so circular it made him think of the otherworldly crop circles that puzzle farmers and intrigue UFO enthusiasts. He estimated the diameter of the circle at about 200-300 yards. 
According to NWS, the tornado’s path was 450 yards wide, with the heaviest damage occurring along the connector trail.

Vercoe belongs to a volunteer group called the Trail FAIRIES (short for Fast Acting Initial Response Indefatigable Environmental Stewards). Those stalwart cyclists, through arrangements with the agencies that own the public land and the nonprofit that stewards the Pilot Hill biking area, clear downed trees and other trail obstacles quickly. The idea is to keep the cycling community from having to wait on the timelines of government agencies.  
It was two U.S. Forest Service sawyers who first worked to restore Windy Windy, Vercoe said. They began their work the day the rider reported the damage. Using chainsaws, the government sawyers cleared as many as 60 downed trees that first day, Vercoe said. The following day, he and two other volunteers resumed the task and cleared a similar number. The following day, two more volunteers repeated the performance. All told, Vercoe said they might easily have had to saw through 200 downed trees to reopen a 6-foot wide swath of trail through the damage zone.
“You’re sawing trees at multiple heights — chest high, ground level, head high,” he said. Some trees had their tops snapped off 20 feet up, others were tossed entirely out of the earth, he said.

Four days after the storm, bikers were again passing along Windy Windy. 
The tornado hasn’t ruined the scenic stretch, Vercoe said, especially for those who call the area home. 
“As we ride through there you will see these crazy acts of physics, and then soon these really unique ecological processes,” he said. “Over the next 10 years, you’re going to get to watch a tornado ecological succession story. I think it added a whole new flavor to Windy Windy.”

NPR and PBS may suffer with Congressional funding cuts, but rural, red America will be most impacted, writes KHOL Executive Director Emily Cohen.
The post Public media is local journalism. Let’s get the facts straight about defunding it appeared first on WyoFile .","We’ve missed the mark about how we’re talking about Congress’ attempt to defund public media.

Opinion

Here’s what’s getting lost: Public radio and television stations are independent and community-owned. One-third of public radio stations are not NPR affiliates, and most aren’t located in big cities. In fact, the people who will be most hurt by these cuts live in rural, often conservative parts of the country — places like much of Wyoming, where news deserts have crept in, local journalism has dried up and public media is often the only newsroom left.
Federal dollars allocated by Congress to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are redistributed to 386 public radio stations via annual grants. To qualify for CPB funding, stations must show significant local support and investment. KHOL, the station I manage, didn’t qualify for a CPB grant until 2020, 12 years after we first went on the air. 
Once awarded a grant, those stations decide how to spend their money. The federal Communications Act — Congress’ own rules! — requires that 25% of these grants are spent on “national program acquisition or distribution.” Some stations chose to pay for NPR with these dollars, akin to how newspapers license wire stories from AP or Reuters. The intent is to supplement, not substitute. Unfortunately, the public often doesn’t realize this distinction — apparently, neither do many lawmakers — and local stations are suffering as a result. 
At KHOL in Jackson, the station I lead, we air some national shows like Marketplace and The Daily distributed by American Public Media and Left, Right and Center distributed via NPR, but we’re not an NPR affiliate. 
Like the 386 public radio stations supported by CPB grants, we’re independent. Our reporters live in the community we serve. Our daily newscast, feature stories and public affairs shows are for, and about, the people who live and work here. 
The role of public media
In an era when journalism is increasingly polarized, with clickbait and social media often driving ideological divides, public media remains a rare public good. It’s free, locally grounded and committed to facts and civic life.

As local newspapers have closed, people are turning to national news and “influencers” who view the world through whatever lens they choose. (This May, social media surpassed television as the most popular news source.) There’s a structural reason behind the polarization of the press: Straight news doesn’t really pay for itself anymore. 
Americans are pinned between paywalls at legacy outlets like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal and free content from The Daily Wire or Breitbart that have explicit political alignments.
That’s where public media comes in. It offers high-quality journalism that’s free, widely accessible and local. 
Let’s reframe the debate
This is a moment for public media to reclaim its community-centered identity, but first we need to do a better job talking about what we do and who we are. We are community newsrooms serving places the national press rarely reaches. We’re often the only journalists in town. We’re watchdogs, storytellers and public servants.
Defunding public media won’t fix bias in media. Instead, it will tear down the infrastructure that brings independent, free, local news to the places where it is most needed.

(Courtesy of Rhoades for Public Service Commission)OMAHA — The Democratic primary for the U.S. House seat in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District might soon get more crowded.
Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades told the Nebraska Examiner this week that she is “testing-the-waters” for possibly jumping into the race in the Omaha-based 2nd District now represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon. She said she could be interested whether Bacon stays in the race or retires. 
“It’s certainly not a secret that I’m considering it,” Rhoades said. 
People ask her to consider
She said “some folks” have been lobbying her to get in, and her campaign shared internal polling indicating her and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha within the margin of error for Democratic primary voters in NE-02. The polling has former political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell at what Rhoades called a “distant third.”
“John and I are starting from the same place,” Rhodes said. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh running for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd District

Earlier this month, Cavanaugh, the son of a former Democratic congressman from Omaha, formally announced his candidacy. Powell, the daughter of a leader in Spanish-language news, announced her bid in May. Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running.  
Republicans are waiting in the wings for Bacon’s decision, a list that local conservatives have said includes former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding and perhaps Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei. 
Background in politics
The lifetime Omahan was the last Democrat elected to a statewide position as a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all regulator for topics as varied as telecommunications and pipelines. She also has a history of helping local Democrats win elections as a political consultant, including a significant role in helping John Ewing Jr. become the first Democrat to lead the largest city in Nebraska in roughly a decade. 
She pointed to her working-class background and her record of “doing the right thing even when it’s hard” as a plus for voters. Rhoades said the main issues she would focus on would include protecting and growing the middle class, creating jobs that pay a living wage jobs and protecting democracy.
Rhoades told the Examiner that Cavanaugh and an unnamed potential candidate had asked her and her husband, Ben, to work on their campaigns. She said she would only join the House race if she sees data that shows her in the strongest position to defeat whichever Republican emerges.
“Ben [Onkka] and I are in the process of evaluating who the strongest candidate is for the district. If it’s me, I’ll run,” Rhoades said. 
What the district wants
The polling indicates that potential Democratic primary voters in the district want someone who would fight President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, someone who can win and someone with a proven record. Rhoades described herself as a “check, check, check” on those.

In recent weeks, Rhoades was rumored to be a candidate to replace Ewing in his former position as Douglas County treasurer, but the Douglas County Board this week hinted at wanting a “non-political option” to fill the remainder of Ewing’s term, someone who won’t run for the office. 
Rhoades said her experience differentiates her from the two high-profile Democrats in the House race. She said she has held multiple elective positions for over 20 years and knows how to help Democrats win elections. 
She said that Cavanaugh could have some baggage as part of a political dynasty, and there are concerns about his potentially vacating a statehouse seat, because Republican Gov. Jim Pillen would get to appoint his replacement. 
Rhoades said Powell’s inexperience could make the race a “very difficult time.” 
“I think that this may not be the right time and the environment for … a rookie,” Rhoades said. 
Rhoades has faced some criticisms from her years in service and work with Democrats in Douglas and Sarpy Counties, including for butting heads with some fellow Democrats and some co-workers in the Douglas County Courthouse.
Rhoades emphasizes that her decision on whether to run will be “data-driven.” She says she lacks the hubris to believe that she is the only Democrat who can win. She said she would decide whether to form a federal fundraising committee or jump into the race in the coming weeks.

By virtually any measure, the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribal Nation is an incredible success story against all odds. Forcibly removed from their homeland in the Bitterroot Valley, despite not having waged war against the white settlers or army, their own “Trail of Tears” brought them to the Flathead Valley to live within the boundaries of the vastly reduced lands they retained in the Hellgate Treaty of 1855.
Although the Hellgate Treaty is widely regarded as one of the best treaties signed by any of the nation’s Indigenous people, even land supposedly reserved for the exclusive habitation of the Salish-Kootenai was opened to purchase by non-tribal settlers by the Dawes Act of 1887.  
The act’s intentions were to allocate reservation lands the tribes already owned to individual families as private property and, as part of the “civilization” of Native Americans, it required tribal members to register with the federal government to receive their “allotment.” 
The entire debacle was part of the Allotment and Assimilation Era from 1887 to 1934.  Simply put, the federal government’s plan was to force Native Americans to be “assimilated” into European-American culture.  
Importantly, any reservation lands not allocated to tribal members was deemed “surplus” land and opened to purchase by non-tribal settlers.  This excursion into reservation lands was further exacerbated by the ability of tribal members to sell their allotment parcels to non-tribal members.  
The fracturing of the Salish-Kootenai’s tribal lands through sales to non-tribal members continues to cause serious problems today, including the long and on-going battle to retain their water, hunting and fishing treaty rights.  
Article III of the Hellgate Treaty could not be more clear regarding the Tribe’s fishing rights:  

        “The exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams running through or bordering said reservation is further secured to said Indians; as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places…”    
Yet, just this week the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribal Nation issued a very serious warning to tribal members regarding the fish they have treaty rights to catch because they are poisoned.  
The Fish Consumption Advisory urges “all tribal members to avoid consuming all species and sizes of fish harvested from the lower Clark Fork River from the Bitterroot River near Missoula to the Flathead River near Paradise. Recent testing has confirmed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins and furans in fish at levels that are unsafe for consumption by Tribal peoples.  It is also advisable to avoid consuming rainbow trout and northern pike harvested from the Bitterroot River and the upper Clark Fork River above the Bitterroot River to Rock Creek, and, to avoid consuming rainbow trout from the Blackfoot River.
As the Advisory explains: “These contaminants pose a health risk to all fish consumers, and an even greater health risk to the most sensitive members of the Tribal population including women of child bearing age, pregnant nursing women, and young children. These contaminants have been linked to negative health effects in the immune, and nervous systems and may be associated with birth defects…PCBs and dioxins are classified as probable and definite human carcinogens, respectively.”
So what good are treaty fishing rights if you can’t eat the fish because they’re poisoned?  Are they really “rights” — or is this just another in our nation’s long and shameful history of abrogating its treaties with Native Americans?  
Moreover, Montana’s poison fish affect us all. Just as our government has failed the Salish-Kootenai, they have likewise failed to uphold our rights to the “swimmable/fishable waters” guaranteed by the Clean Water Act — because no one, tribal or non-tribal, is immune to poisoned fish.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Salish-men-tipis-1903.jpg,,,2025-06-27 07:00:38.061133

Wes Moore (D) is turning to a strategist with close ties to a potential rival in the 2028 White House election to helm his 2026 reelection campaign in Maryland – and possibly a national campaign beyond that.
Moore has hired Ron Owens, a Michigander who has worked as a political operative and statehouse aide for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) to run his reelection campaign.
Many Democrats – in Moore’s political orbit and beyond – had expected Ned Miller, who ran Moore’s 2022 campaign, joined his administration and later oversaw his super PAC, to head the reelection effort. But Miller has moved to Georgia, to run former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ 2026 campaign for governor.
“I’m thrilled to have Ron Owens leading our reelection campaign as our campaign manager,” Moore said in a statement provided to Maryland Matters. “Ron brings immense experience to Maryland from his work all across the country – with him on our team we will create the most aggressive statewide operation in history to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot all across Maryland.”
Though only 29, Owens is a seasoned operative who worked most recently as a campaign adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, helping Democratic Senate candidates, including now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), with strategy and campaign management.
Potential 2028 presidential hopefuls Moore, Walz steal show at South Carolina Democratic weekend

In 2023, he was campaign manager to Brandon Presley, a former state utility regulator – and cousin of Elvis Presley’s – who was the Democratic nominee for governor of Mississippi. Presley ran a surprisingly strong race in a red state, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves by just 3.2 points.
Most of Owens’ political experience, however, is in Michigan, his home state. After a stint as a legislative aide to the state House Democratic leader, Owens was the deputy political director on Whitmer’s successful 2018 campaign for governor.
He spent two years as Whitmer’s public affairs specialist in her gubernatorial office, then was political director in her 2022 reelection campaign.
After Owens was hired to run Presley’s campaign, a leading Mississippi Republican cited the operative’s ties to Whitmer as a way of blasting the Democratic contender.
“COVID showed Americans that it certainly matters who serves as governor,” Henry Barbour, the Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, told the Magnolia Tribune in 2023. “Democrats such as Gretchen Whitmer advanced their elitist, government-knows-best agenda that restricted Americans’ liberty. And Brandon Presley hired her top political operative.
“Don’t believe him for a minute when he tries to persuade you he’s not of the same political persuasion,” Barbour said.
Whitmer and Moore are both seen as top-tier potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. But while Whitmer is termed out of office at the end of 2026, Moore must first win reelection next year before he can fully focus on any hypothetical national campaign.
Still, in the early skirmishing leading up to the 2028 White House primaries, Owens’ decision to cast his lot with Moore, one of Whitmer’s potential rivals, is noteworthy, if only significant to insiders.
In a 2018 interview, Owens highlighted his work ethic and life philosophy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“One thing that my mom instilled in my siblings and me was to, one, always be kind to other people, two, always work twice as hard as anyone else and, three, whenever you’re working you should always be doing something that is benefiting others,” Owens said in an nterview with Pride Source, a Michigan LGBTQ+ publication.
“We are fortunate to have him as our leader as we seek to continue our mission to create a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said.
At this stage, Moore still has a pretty skeletal campaign operation as the 2026 election ramps up, though that is likely to change soon. But he will enter a potentially perilous campaign season without Miller, who, after guiding the governor’s first statewide campaign, became a senior adviser and director of engagement for his administration.
In the middle of last year, Miller left state government to oversee Moore’s Unity First PAC and also played a leadership role in Freedom in Reproduction – Maryland Inc., the entity that helped pass the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Moore appears to have also lost the services of his finance director, Patrick Denny, who was with the campaign since 2021.
The Moore campaign has not yet indicated who will replace Denny as finance director and it is not known who will oversee the governor’s PAC, which he largely used during the 2024 election cycle to attack Republican congressional candidates in Maryland. The PAC is now airing ads touting Moore’s economic record.

Even though he has publicly insisted in recent weeks that he is not running for president in 2028, Moore continues to behave like a possible national candidate. His trip in late May to South Carolina, site of an early and critical presidential primary, won wide attention from national political insiders and commentators.
Strategists on the popular “Hacks on Tap” podcast subsequently called Moore a “top 10” contender for 2028, and Chuck Todd, the former political director of NBC News, recently opined that Moore has the strongest resume and most gold-plated Rolodex of any of the hypothetical Democratic presidential candidates.
Moore appeared last week as a guest on “Pod Save America,” the breezy podcast hosted by former Obama administration officials. There, he explained why he’s not making plans to run for president, saying he never anticipated a career in politics and is enjoying serving as governor after starting the 2022 campaign as a relative unknown.
“I’m playing with house money right now and I love the work we’re doing in Maryland,” he said. The governor added that he will “go anywhere and everywhere” to tout the state’s progress.
Bold-faced names
Moore’s out-of-state travels continue this month, and include a recent gathering with Democrats in Virginia, which is holding closely watched statewide elections this year.
Moore is headed to a fundraising brunch in Aspen, Colorado,on Saturday, hosted by Damian O’Doherty, the former Maryland political operative and co-founder of KO Public Affairs in Baltimore, who lives now in the Rocky Mountains but often returns to his home state.

From sunup to sundown, we’ll explore critical issues and uncover ideas that spark wonder.”
The festival schedule shows Moore discussing “bold, purposeful leadership” on Saturday afternoon with Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, moderated by CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.
“Big thinkers and doers share fresh ideas, challenge assumptions and ignite conversations that ripple far beyond [the Aspen conference venue],” the conference website says of the panel discussion with Moore and the other dignitaries. “Curiosity required.”
Moore is then scheduled to travel to Detroit, where he will deliver the keynote address at the Detroit NAACP’s 70th anniversary dinner on Sunday evening.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Jay Waagmeester | Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.











Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance



Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The run-away success of 33-year-old Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayor’s race shook the political establishment across the country. In Wisconsin, where Democrats are hoping to regain control of at least one legislative chamber in 2026, and where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has not yet announced whether he’ll seek a third term, Mamdani’s overthrow of the uninspiring establishment candidate and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo should trigger some serious thinking about how Democrats win in the Donald Trump era, and who they represent.
On Wednesday, the morning after the New York City primary, the Republican Party of Wisconsin put out a press release attempting to connect Mamdani to Rebecca Cooke, the Democrat planning to run in a rematch race against U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden in Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District. The through-line between Mamdani and Cooke is that Sen. Bernie Sanders has endorsed both candidates. The Wisconsin GOP seized on what it saw as a political opportunity to defend Van Orden in a statement bashing “radical Rebecca” and asking: “Does Democrat political operative Rebecca Cooke agree with her fellow Bernie endorsed candidate on his radical positions? … Keep in mind, President Trump carried WI-03 by 8 points just last year.”
Cooke, contrary to Republican campaign propaganda, is a middle-of-the-road Democrat who earned the endorsement of the Blue Dog Coalition, the most conservative Democratic group in the U.S. House. She certainly agrees with Mamdani that the housing crisis and high prices are key issues for working class voters, but she’s unlikely to support his bolder proposals like publicly owned grocery stores. And Wisconsin Republicans are wrong to think they can easily beat Democrats by accusing them of being “radical” and tying them to Mamdani and Bernie Sanders.
The real radical in the 3rd Congressional District is Van Orden, a MAGA diehard who voted to take away medical care and nutrition assistance from his own constituents, and who likes to make a spectacle of himself, yelling at pages in the U.S. Capitol and mocking Democrats who expressed grief after the assassination of a state legislator in Minnesota.
It seems likely that by 2026, when the “big, beautiful” destruction of public goods from Medicaid to the Forest Service to infrastructure and education to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy have begun to bite, voters will have had more than enough of that brand of radicalism.
Wisconsin voters have a strong independent streak. 
Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary here by 13.5 percentage points. Sanders’ anti-establishment, progressive populist message resonated particularly strongly with voters in the 3rd District, in the same counties that ultimately went for Donald Trump that year and again in 2024. 
As Democrats in our swing state try to figure out how to win again, they should take a lesson from the voters in New York City who rejected the arrogant and deeply compromised Cuomo and chose an inspiring progressive populist, catapulting him to leadership of a new generation of Democrats. 
That doesn’t mean Mamdani would win in the 3rd District, or that he’s the model for Democratic candidates everywhere. But it does say something that he triumphed over his detractors from both political parties despite their money and clout, by connecting directly with voters who were worried about housing and high prices. Like both Sanders and Trump, Mamdani presented an alternative to the political establishment and listened actively to voters’ actual concerns. He bravely stood up to big money and stale conventional wisdom. He recognized the urgency of the moment. He leveraged the enthusiasm of young people and beleaguered working people who feel overlooked. He inspired people. He was a breath of fresh air.
What does that mean for Wisconsin? 
This week the latest Marquette Poll reported that 55% of voters don’t want Evers to run for a third term as governor. Various political commentators have compared Evers to ex-President Joe Biden, warning that at 73 (almost a decade younger than Biden) he might be too old to win. The poll helped fuel a new round of that sort of speculation.
But the question for Democrats is not whether Evers should run again. Presented with no alternative, 83% of Democratic voters told Marquette pollsters they want Evers. 
The real question is, what is the party’s vision for its own future and the future of our state? For a long time, Democrats in Wisconsin have lacked a bench. If Evers decides not to run, there is no obvious candidate to take his place. Meanwhile, Evers is currently engaged in backroom negotiations with Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on the state budget. Embarrassingly, Democratic leaders in the Legislature are not included in those talks and appear not to know what’s being traded behind closed doors. 
Asked whether she thinks the closed door sessions are OK, Senate Minority Leader Diane Hesselbein told reporters, “I think this is probably normal. I’ve talked to other majority and minority leaders in the past, and this is kind of how it’s happened in the past.”
That’s it?
As legislative Democrats conduct what some have called a dress rehearsal for real power, preparing to step into the majority for the first time in more than 15 years, it’s not clear how they will govern. Will they still let a Democratic governor call all the shots in budget negotiations? Will they play hardball if a Republican takes Evers’ place — following the example of the current Republican majority and blocking every initiative the governor proposes and seizing his powers whenever they get a chance? What are their bottom-line issues? How will they transform the lives of the people of our state? 
We badly need a more functional government and a more cohesive Democratic Party in Wisconsin.
More than anything, we need bold, progressive leadership that articulates a strong vision for a government that serves the interests of the majority of voters, not just rich people and insiders. Mamdani showed that there is real hunger for that in the electorate. That should be an inspiration to Wisconsin’s future leaders.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Congress is debating many important issues as part of the “big beautiful bill.” One very concerning proposal that may be flying under the radar compared to the other provisions is a section in the U.S. House version of the bill that would impose a 600% tax increase on charitable foundations. Thankfully, this massive tax increase is not included in the U.S. Senate version.
As explained by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation: “Federal law requires grantmaking foundations to pay out 5% of their assets each year, to pay full income tax on unrelated business income (UBI), and to pay a 1.39% federal tax on investment income. OBBBA adds some well-crafted reforms (a floor to corporate charitable contributions, and closing some loopholes on UBI) but it would convert this flat tax to a progressive one based on asset size, where larger foundations pay a higher tax rate up to 10%. This tax increase will have unintended consequences, sweeping thousands of community and faith-based foundations into its scope. Large and bad are not the same thing (particularly when it comes to charitable endeavors. The Senate should avoid setting a precedent for wealth taxes and remove this tax increase.”
  Sen. Julie VanOrden, R-Pingree, conducts committee business during the Senate Health and Welfare Committee meeting on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Idaho State Sen. Julie VanOrden, R-Pingree, recently wrote an op-ed warning of the possible consequences of this tax increase on the Gem State. She said: “Idaho’s broader charitable ecosystem is equally essential. The Idaho Community Foundation has distributed more than $177 million in grants across all 44 counties. This year’s Idaho Gives campaign alone raised over $5 million for local nonprofits. These organizations thrive not because they have to, but because they choose to give. They are on a mission to serve our communities and the most vulnerable among us. Taxing that generosity is not only shortsighted; it’s self-defeating.”
Mountain States Policy Center agrees that this tax increase is the wrong approach. That is why we joined a coalition letter on June 23 to House leadership, encouraging them to remove this massive tax increase on charitable foundations from the bill as the Senate wisely did.
That coalition letter says (in part): “The draft Senate bill rightly eliminates the private foundation tax increases included in the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA). The House-passed bill would raise taxes on charities by more than 600%, allowing the IRS to take nearly $16 billion from private charitable foundations that would otherwise help improve the lives of many Americans. Countless programs and services that provide for the needs of people in every state are funded by the generosity of private citizens. Without them, we would see more Americans reliant on government, which ultimately costs us all more for what is often an inefficient bureaucratic solution.”
The letter continues: “Charitable giving helps form the bedrock of a resilient America by supporting organizations committed to creating a stronger, healthier society where every person has the opportunity to thrive. We support our nation’s long history of encouraging private initiative and generosity that benefits the common good, and we will work to advance conservative and free market policies that continue this legacy.”
Congressional leaders plan to vote on the final version of the bill before the Fourth of July. There is nothing beautiful about imposing a big 600% tax increase on charitable foundations. Let’s hope we’re also celebrating the defeat of this misguided tax increase when the fireworks go off on Independence Day.

It happened just a few weeks ago: Jim Obergefell was moving things in his office when he came across the ashes of his late husband, John Arthur, now 12 years gone. Arthur had last wishes for his ashes. Obergefell had yet to fulfill them.

This story was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“And it struck me that, oh, I am actually now mentally, emotionally ready to take care of John’s ashes,” Obergefell told The 19th. “It was the first time that I had that feeling so clearly and so strongly.”
Obergefell, 58, is ready to move on. Not exactly from the love of his life or the history-making Supreme Court decision that came after Arthur died. But certainly from the insecurities straight America was grappling with a decade ago about same-sex unions.
Obergefell is that Obergefell: the named plaintiff in the landmark lawsuit that extended marriage equality to every state in the nation in 2015. Ten years later, he celebrates that win and the many ways it rewrote his life. And in a time when LGBTQ+ rights are again under assault, he is looking to the future — of the queer rights movement and also his own.
A journey to the Supreme Court
Obergefell’s journey to the Supreme Court was hardly destined. It began 12 years ago, on June 26, 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that prohibited the government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
Obergefell and Arthur had been together for 21 years at the time. The two had discussed getting married before. But they wanted it to be legal, and their home state of Ohio didn’t offer same-sex marriages.
Arthur was gravely ill with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he barely left his home hospice bed.
After the ruling, Obergefell leaned over to Arthur, hugged, then kissed him.
“Let’s get married,” he said.
Arthur agreed.
Trump administration to end national LGBTQ+ suicide hotline

The logistics were not easy. Arthur was in no shape to travel, and the couple could not wed in Ohio. Obergefell researched and found that Maryland would let him get a marriage license even with only one of them present. But both would need to arrive in the state for the ceremony.
When friends and family learned about their predicament, they pooled together money to charter a medical jet for Arthur. The two flew to Baltimore. Over the course of 45 minutes, they exchanged vows on the tarmac before flying home.
“In the days that followed, we said the word ‘husband’ hundreds of times a day,” Obergefell said on the Decidedly Podcast in 2023.
But just five days later, their joy was muted when civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein informed them that because of Ohio’s ban on same-sex marriage, Arthur would be listed as single in death.
Arthur and Obergefell were angry. The couple sued the state of Ohio in federal district court and won. Three months later, Arthur died.
The following year, Obergefell, still in mourning, lost on appeal. But he refused to believe he might lose altogether.
“I just kept going,” Obergefell said. “It was the right thing to do.”
On June 26, 2015, he won. For the country, the win was immensely practical. Many told Obergefell it gave them so much hope it saved their lives. For Obergefell, it meant a legacy for the man he loved.
“I made promises to John to love, honor and protect him, and I was going to keep doing that,” he said.
Changing history
It’s difficult to overstate the impact of Obergefell’s case on the nation or the world. Since the 2015 ruling, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates, 591,000 queer couples have wed, generating an estimated $5.9 billion in wedding spending for state and local economies.
It has also radically transformed Obergefell’s life. Introverted and unassuming, he has spent the last decade campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights. He helms Equality Vines, a wine company that donates its proceeds to advancing civil rights causes.
It’s a position that makes him deeply proud if not a little fatigued.
“I’m not tired of talking about it,” he said of the 10-year anniversary of the ruling. “I’m just physically tired from all of the interviews and the photographers and the speaking gigs and the events. Yes, I’m exhausted.”
For 12 years, Obergefell has kept Arthur alive through retelling their story countless times in courtrooms and for the media. That exercise, of telling and retelling, helped Obergefell process his profound loss.
But he has never recoupled. It wasn’t that Arthur didn’t want him to. In fact, Arthur told him regularly that he wanted him to find love again. He asked his friends and family to tell Obergefell that he wanted him to find love after he was gone.
“I know it was sincere, because he told me that he had other people tell me that,” Obergefell said.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors

It isn’t about the pressure he feels as the face of marriage equality, he said, though part of him wonders what it would be like to date after making history.
“I don’t know how to date,” he confessed. “I’m clueless when people flirt with me, and as much as I hate it, and I don’t go into any conversation or anything like this, but you know, there’s that part of me that sometimes wonders, you know, are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in me as Jim Obergefell, named plaintiff?”
Obergefell’s name has become synonymous with marriage equality in the United States, an issue that has not always united the LGBTQ+ community. Some queer activists have argued that same-sex marriage was a misguided goal for the movement as queer youth continue to face high rates of homelessness and transgender people grapple with police violence and incarceration, among other issues.
More work to do
Obergefell, too, is worried that the needs of the community’s most vulnerable have gone unmet. He has watched horror-struck over the last five years as state legislatures have moved to restrict transgender rights.
“We need to fight for every marginalized community, because the queer community includes every marginalized community, and equality for one is pointless without equality for all,” he said. “I didn’t go to the Supreme Court just so White, cisgender, gay men like me could get married.”
Despite all of the setbacks in LGBTQ+ rights, and even threats to Obergefell’s game-changing victory, he is hopeful — and feels stronger than ever. People assume his case was difficult for him. It was, but the path was also obvious, to him and to Arthur. They loved each other.
“If we weren’t willing to fight for each other and for what was right, then what’s the point?”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents riled up folks when they conducted a dragnet in a South Nashville neighborhood a month ago and detained nearly 200 people.
But city streets aren’t the only place where federal agents are picking up immigrants for deportation. The Davidson County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Thursday it has released 283 inmates to ICE custody in 2025, notably higher than last year’s number.
Oddly enough, the sheriff’s office doesn’t have information on whether those inmates have legal documentation to be in the country. It sends fingerprints collected in the booking process to national databases, including those ICE is able to access, according to spokesman Jon Adams.
ICE contacts the sheriff’s office to request a detainer, then picks up the inmate, leaving the local agency with nothing but a number of people released to federal custody.



				Based on the 283 inmates released by the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Metro Nashville appears to be cooperating with the federal agency on deportation, despite claims to the contrary by Republican lawmakers. 			


The Davidson County Sheriff’s Office hasn’t participated in the 287(g) screening program for immigrant inmates since 2012 when Sheriff Daron Hall said it was so successful it was no longer needed. For the five years the department used the program, it processed more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants for removal from the country, according to a WPLN report.
But based on the jail pickups, Metro Nashville appears to be cooperating with the feds, even though Republican lawmakers are hammering at Democratic Mayor Freddie O’Connell after he raised concerns about the Nashville sweep. Metro inadvertently posted the names of three ICE agents, then removed them, and O’Connell updated a years-old executive order requiring personnel to notify the mayor’s office if they encounter any federal agents, including those from ICE. Those moves spurred Republican legislation to punish governments that ID ICE agents, and GOP leaders have called on O’Connell to rescind the notification order.
Tennessee GOP Congressman calls for investigation of Nashville mayor amid immigrant detentions

Since opting out of the program, the sheriff’s office no longer serves as an extension of the federal ICE program. But based on the number of jail deportations, they have quite a few encounters with the federal agents. 
Republican leaders have said repeatedly over the last few months that new laws are needed to remove undocumented criminals who pose a public safety threat. 
Those have been under way, though, for nearly two decades. 
Former President Barack Obama removed more than 4 million people, earning him the moniker “deporter in chief.” Former President Joe Biden deported 271,000 immigrants in 2024, according to a BBC report. Over the first four months of this year, the Trump administration removed about 200,000 people from the country.
Based on those numbers, undocumented immigration is nothing new, and neither are deportations. Some just cause more chaos than others.
Trying to get off the radar
Tennessee State University broke ground Thursday on two academic buildings for the College of Agriculture, but the historically Black college will remain under a state microscope for a good minute.
As part of an agreement signed last week with state leaders, the university must meet several financial requirements in order to shift more than $90 million from a 2022 capital grant to campus operations over the next three years.

In addition to making a quarterly report to the Tennessee Board of Regents, comptroller and commissioner of Finance and Administration, TSU must meet deficit reduction goals and cut yearly expenses, fix state audit findings, come up with a space use and real property plan, and set find an enrollment figure it can handle without going broke.
State officials reached the agreement with TSU and interim President Dwayne Tucker after forcing out former President Glenda Glover and replacing the board of trustees in 2024. 
TSU and Glover caught the ire of Republican senators when the university sought last-second approval to lease apartments for student housing when it started an aggressive scholarship program after the COVID pandemic. The university used a federal grant to fund the scholarships, then ran out of money.
In the last year, state leaders have been micromanaging the university’s money with Tucker, who is working without pay, to put TSU on stronger financial footing.
The estimated $90 million buildings for the Food and Animal Sciences and Environmental Sciences programs will support the university’s academic, research and agriculture extension missions.
“This project underscores the state’s continued confidence in our university and the strength of our land-grant mission,” Tucker said in a statement.
  “The hard work starts now,” state Comptroller Jason Mumpower recently told Dwayne Tucker, interim president of Tennessee State University. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout 2024)
Republican senators have said consistently they want TSU to succeed, yet they didn’t show any confidence in the administration until recent months. State officials allowed TSU to take an advance last fall on the $250 million in capital funding, just to make payroll and stay afloat.
A state study found TSU had been shorted by as much as $500 million over many decades, while a federal report said the university was shorted by more than $2 billion, a figure Republicans are rejecting. Either way, TSU has battled with finances for years, struggling to balance the books and resolve audit findings, even if state investigations found no wrongdoing. 
State Comptroller Jason Mumpower, one of Glover’s biggest critics, said he has confidence in Tucker. After the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding, Mumpower said he told the interim president that “the hard work starts now.” 
The question is whether they can repair decades of underfunding, bad management and, some might say, neglect on the part of a lot of people in high positions.
Cepicky’s pick
Republican state Rep. Scott Cepicky said on a podcast this week he’s picking House Speaker Cameron Sexton to win the 7th Congressional District seat expected to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Mark Green.
“The wild card here is Sexton,” Cepicky said on “3 Dudes with a View,” a Columbia production. He added that his “gut feeling” is Sexton will win if he gets in.
Sexton’s office has consistently declined comment, but he is set to make a big announcement in August. 
For the second time, Green announced his decision to leave the post, once Congress votes on the president’s budget plan. 
Cepicky declined to comment Thursday to the Lookout on whether Sexton told him he will run for the post.
The prediction is tempered somewhat because Cepicky also said Sen. Bill Powers could be a strong candidate, even though Powers announced last week he won’t run.
While Sexton’s potential candidacy is bandied about, former Tennessee General Services Commission Matt Van Epps announced this week that Nashville car dealership magnate Lee Beaman and his wife, Julie, will be finance co-chairs for his 7th District campaign. 
Beaman also served as treasurer of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles’ first campaign when he was late filing his Federal Election Commission report and reported raising much less money than he initially claimed. The FBI was investigating him, but Trump squashed that probe when Ogles came to his defense.
Beaman also was the sole donor of $50,000 to Volunteers for Freedom PAC, which put $24,000 into an ad buy backing Ogles, raising questions about illegal coordination between the campaign and PAC.
AI argument
State Sen. Bo Watson joined Republican lawmakers from across the country Thursday in urging Congress not to approve a 10-year moratorium on artificial intelligence laws as part of the president’s budget bill.
Watson, chair of the Senate finance committee, adamantly opposes a ban on states and local governments regulating artificial intelligence systems, models and decision systems for children’s online safety, consumer protections, transparency and accountability measures and “generative AI harms,” which could build up societal biases in data and potentially allow sensitive personal data to be stolen. (This is making my brain hurt.)










For an administration who has really been focused on returning authority back to the states, this is one aspect of this piece of legislation that I’m quite disappointed in.


– Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson


Watson invoked Tennessee’s new law preventing “deep fakes” and the ELVIS Act, which protects artists from infringement on their voices and images, during a Thursday webinar on the subject with lawmakers nationwide who oppose the federal ban. The moratorium would withhold broadband funding in exchange for doing nothing.
“For an administration who has really been focused on returning authority back to the states, this is one aspect of this piece of legislation that I’m quite disappointed in,” said Watson, a member of the state’s council overseeing AI policy.
Watson, a Hixson Republican, added that Congress is so slow to act that by the time it deals with problems stemming from AI, the states will be left to “wrestle” with the consequences.
“That’s why it’s critically important that this part of the bill be removed,” Watson said, and states be allowed to work with the feds on AI laws.
It might not be the only rough part of the federal legislation.
Congress also is considering cutting Medicaid spending that could cause Tennessee’s TennCare program to lose $16 billion in federal funding, according to U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, brother of former Tennessee state Rep. Rick Tillis.
The pending and potential budget buster for Tennessee is accompanied by a massive uptick in national spending for ICE and border patrol and an overall increase that even former DOGE director Elon Musk opposes. 
This proposed expansion of federal control over AI coincides with U.S. deportation efforts nationwide despite opposition in many states, renewing the age-old states’ rights argument that was supposedly put to rest 160 years ago. Some folks want the states to prevail only when it’s politically expedient, presenting a bit of a contradiction.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Pedestrians and bicyclists along the Colorado Riverfront Trail in Grand Junction may have noticed something out of the ordinary this spring. In some fenced-off sections near Blue Heron Lake, 700 goats are grazing on an array of invasive species such as tamarisk, Russian olive, kochia, and Russian knapweed.
Grand Junction is using goats to combat noxious weeds to make more room for native plants like cottonwood trees and willows. At the same time, they are lowering the risk of wildfire in this hot, dry, high-desert landscape by reducing the vegetative fuel load. 
“It can be hard to stop a fire where there’s lots of vegetation,” said Rob Davis, Grand Junction forester and open space supervisor. “If it gets going on a windy day, and there’s lots of downed debris …with 9 inches of precipitation a year, and high summer temperatures, the fire risk is high. Using goats for grazing is an environmentally-friendly strategy to help us reduce fire risks and knock down some of our invasive weeds.” 
Plus, people out recreating enjoy seeing the goats, Davis added.
“There’s that added benefit that people just like it,” he said.

A goatherder watches over the goats and nudges them down the trail after they’ve sufficiently grazed a patch of dead or unwanted vegetation. Goats will typically leave the mature cottonwoods and willows alone. However, the city sometimes places a fence around young trees to keep the goats from munching on the saplings.
On the Front Range in Boulder County, the town of Superior has brought in a herd of 300 goats to graze on its open spaces for both weed control and fire mitigation. The catastrophic Marshall Fire in 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the region.
Superior first began using goats in 2019, as a sustainable method for vegetation management. After the Marshall Fire the town “doubled down” on using goats for fire mitigation, said Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space. 
Superior evaluates its open space properties annually to prioritize where to graze the goats each summer and winter, Clark said. Properties are monitored to gauge results before and after grazing. 
“Initial results look positive,” Clark said. “People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural. The city later reseeds the areas with native species to improve biodiversity and reduce the number of noxious weeds.”










People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural.


– Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space


Using goats for weed control and fire mitigation is not new. Lani Malmberg, owner of Colorado-based Goat Green, said she was the first company to offer this type of fire mitigation work 25 years ago. She and her goats have been featured in The New York Times, the L.A. Times, and other national publications. She now runs her Goat Green grazing business with her son Donny Benz and his fiancée.
Malmberg, 68, said she conceived the idea of using goats decades ago while studying botany, biology and environmental restoration at then-Mesa State College in Grand Junction. She said she watched how knapweed took over a cornfield while working a summer job in Colorado. 
It occurred to her then, “Someone ought to run a business to eat the problem,” Malmberg recalled. “Now there are a lot of goat businesses” — and she has trained people at some of them.
Lockheed Martin uses 1,200 of Malmberg’s goats for fire mitigation at its facility in Littleton. Goat Green has done grazing projects for many Colorado cities in the past, including Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Castle Pines, Broomfield, Golden, Glenwood Springs and Carbondale.
“Over the past 30 years I have worked in all the Western states, doing fire mitigation in California, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana and Nebraska,” Malmberg said. 
When asked where her company is based, she replied, “Under my hat — wherever I’m on contract.”
“Fire mitigation is a big deal. Open space (managers) are clamoring to get goats. People are jumping into it. It’s an alternative to machinery and chemicals.”
More environmentally friendly than chemicals
Superior pays for the goat service via grants from FEMA and Boulder County, with matching grants provided by the town of Superior. The program is funded from 2025 through 2027. 
Louisville has used goats to control noxious weeds for several years, said Nathaniel Goeckner, the city’s natural resource supervisor. Louisville contracts with Goats on the Go, in Boulder County, to graze 200 goats on open space around Louisville. Depending on the vegetation, the city also uses cattle for fire mitigation work, Goeckner said. Its grazing program is paid for with grants from Boulder County and a city sales tax.
Longmont also uses goats — though not for fire mitigation, said Jim Krick, ecosystem manager for Longmont’s Parks and Natural Resources. The city has brought in goats since 2023 for weed control — targeting kochia in particular, where it competes with native plants. The goats are brought in just before the weeds form and spread their seeds, Krick said. Longmont typically grazes goats on an acre per year based on its budget.

Grand Junction contracts with Ecological Grazing Service, owned by Jennifer Studt, who, along with her husband, raises goats and sheep on a ranch in nearby Loma. She hires a goatherder who stays with the goats the entire time, moving his small camper, and the goats, down the trail when an area is sufficiently grazed. 
Studt says goats do particularly well here because they have a more resilient stomach. They can eat poisonous plants like Russian knapweed, which is highly toxic to most animals — but not goats, she said. And, whereas Russian olive seeds pass through other animals’ dung, which then gets repopulated elsewhere, in a goat’s gut the seed won’t survive, Studt said. Therefore, goats don’t spread noxious weeds.
Studt’s goats began grazing along the riverfront May 23 and will finish eating their way along the trail by the end of this month. They’ll return in late October, when other annual weeds begin to germinate. 
“There are bucket loads of dead noxious weeds here,” Studt said. “And while goats will eat live plants too, they really like the crunchy, dead material — a lot of other animals not so much. Goats like a lot of roughage in their diet. We’re taking something noxious, poisonous to other animals and turn it into fertilizer which helps overall soil health — which helps the native plants come back.”
Using goats to reduce fuel loads, and invasive plant species is a more environmentally friendly method than using chemicals, Davis said. The Grand Junction program is funded through the city’s operating budget.
Although using goats doesn’t necessarily eliminate the use of herbicides, it reduces the amount of chemicals used in grazing areas, said Grand Junction spokesperson Kelsey Coleman in an email to Colorado Newsline. 
The town of Superior contracts with Goat Bros, which Clark said offers educational days when the public can meet the goats close up, and learn how goats improve the environment. 
“It’s an opportunity to get closer to the goats,” Clark said. “We don’t want people interacting with them, otherwise — they’re working.”

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Standing behind a sign that read, “Education Not Indoctrination,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey celebrated a bill Thursday that he says will “reinforce civic values” in education by putting a new learning center on West Virginia University’s campus.
For Morrisey, the legislation is a part of his priority to combat what he says is the “woke agenda.” The Republican governor already banned diversity initiatives in state government, and, as a result, WVU closed its Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and opened a new, rebranded office.
House Bill 3297, passed by the GOP-led legislature in April, mandates that WVU operate the “Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship” focused on teaching constitutional studies and “great debates of Western civilization.” It will also present the “fact-based instruction on America’s founding,” according to the governor’s office.
“We need to make sure that students are learning how to think, not what to think,” Morrisey  said.
Morrisey gets to choose its initial director, according to the bill. He is required to make that decision in consultation with the Senate and WVU’s Board of Governors. 
“Unfortunately, a lot of our schools and higher education institutions they’ve turned into indoctrination factories for radical, anti-American thinking. That can’t happen in West Virginia,” he said. 
  Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock
Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, sponsored the Washington Center legislation.
“I just want something established … to start allowing an option for students that attend higher education … to study all these different subjects under their humanities as they’ve been traditionally taught,” he said at the press conference.
Along with a director, the bill requires the university to hire five additional faculty, which comes in the wake of WVU eliminating around 300 faculty and staff jobs for financial reasons. 
The Washington Center can use existing faculty and courses to accomplish the bill’s requirements of civics instruction. The measure says it should advance the “understanding of American constitutional thought and institutions.”
Shauna Johnson, WVU’s executive director of strategic communications, said the university looks forward to building on its programs and long history of civics instruction. 
“As our nation prepares to celebrate its 250th anniversary next year, West Virginia University looks forward to building on its programs and long history of civics instruction,” she wrote in a statement. “The Washington Center will give us the opportunity to enhance our work to develop responsible and informed citizens and highlight the importance of our institutions and democratic framework.”
Democratic lawmakers in the House of Delegates and Senate who represent Morgantown voted against the legislation, citing concerns about government mandates for a university and a political appointee overseeing academics. 
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, told House members during bill debate that he worried about who might want to fund the school if the state doesn’t. 
“Who will want to pay to have a say in how we educate the next generation?” he asked. 
Senators amended the bill to require that Washington Center’s curriculum be approved by WVU’s Board of Governors. They also added in language that banned lawmakers, during or up to two years after the end of their service in the legislature, from serving as the center’s director or being employed by the center in any capacity. 
While the bill initially didn’t come with funding for the center’s director and faculty, the final budget bill contained $1.5 million for WVU to use on the center. 
Johnson didn’t respond to a question from West Virginia Watch about whether it would take additional university funds to get the center up and running. 
The legislation goes into effect July 11. 
“We appreciate the governor and legislature for including $1.5 million in the fiscal year 2026 budget to support the creation and operations of the Washington Center,” Johnson wrote. “More details will be available at a later date.”
Earlier this year, McGeehan was involved in a controversial move by the West Virginia Water Development Authority to give $5 million to an Ohio-based Catholic-affiliated career and vocational college to create a right-wing think tank. The Parkersburg News and Sentinel reported that McGeehan helped the College of St. Joseph the Worker with their application for WDA funds. 
The water development authority, which made the decision without a required recommendation from one of three state officials, said the deal is constitutional because it will serve a non-religious economic purpose of teaching trade skills. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia sued to block the water development authority from using the money in Ohio, and a judge recently ruled that the suit can move forward in court.

That’s according to Department of State Police spokesperson Shanon Banner, who told Michigan Advance in an email that Nugent had a weapon on him due to a breakdown in security screening. Nugent appeared Wednesday before a joint hearing of three different House committees mostly to rail against deer-bating and other conservation regulations from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission.
Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livionia), who called his testimony and invitation to speak before legislators “absurd,” posted on TikTok Thursday that it appeared that Nugent had a weapon on him while he stood and practically yelled at members of the House for more than 10 minutes. Pohutsky’s seat at the large dais in the House Appropriations Room at the state Capitol was directly in front of where Nugent was sitting.

Open carry and concealed carry of firearms are both banned on Capitol grounds, with limited exceptions.
Banner later confirmed that Nugent did have a weapon on him.
“Mr. Nugent was screened at the north entrance of the Capitol [Wednesday]. The weapons detection system functioned correctly and alerted to a possible weapon; however, the trooper staffing the entry point did not see the alert until after Mr. Nugent left the screening area,” Banner said via email. “Upon completing his meeting, MSP personnel contacted Mr. Nugent and notified him of the weapons policy, and he complied. We are still evaluating how the weapons detection alert was missed and will be following up to ensure this does not happen again.”
Banner did not say what kind of weapon Nugent had on his person when testifying before legislators.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)To marry an old idiom to modern jargon, “can’t see the forest for the trees” is a bandwidth problem. 
Cognitive bandwidth; that is a fancy way of saying “limited attention ability” in people, as opposed to the computer version and definition of bandwidth. This is natural for human beings. Focusing on a few things intensely as opposed to a broad array of things is just how most folks are wired. Add in modern technology where focus is personally curated exactly to what folks want to see on their screens, and you get a populace of folks who can stream their favorite trees 24/7, forest be damned. 
Getting the right kind of trees in front of the right kind of voters means the forest is ripe for harvest. Just a matter of bandwidth. 
The post-COVID vaccine debate takes up oodles of bandwidth. This past legislative session saw considerable time, effort and coverage to the ultimately rejected Senate Bill 460. That failure, the culmination of years’ worth of efforts by activists, was followed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey issuing an executive order on religious exemptions for vaccines on his second day in office. Thus, we have the sequence of events that led to the Beckley press conference. The podium had a placard made up stating “protecting religious liberty” to add another layer of search engine optimized branding to the program. The purpose of the proceedings was for Morrisey to publicly throw his support behind a very convenient lawsuit that highlights this very issue and will move the vaccine exemption matter into the courts and around the legislative and state school board impasse. 
 In review, the sitting governor, the legislature, the court system, the news media coverage, the social media attention and all of those views being terraformed by the national news cycle on the same topic… that is a whole lot of bandwidth on this one issue. Which gives the impression it is an issue enormously affecting a whole bunch of West Virginians.
But does the noise match the numbers? In 2023, 53 exemptions were requested with the West Virginia Board of Public Health,  with nine permanent and 24 temporary exemptions granted.  With all the attention on the issue, 321 exemptions were requested for the past school year, as reported by Lori Kersey. That is 321 requests out of 245,047 total students. With some calculator help for my Frametown Elementary math skills, which comes out to 0.130995278% of the students in West Virginia. 
 That’s a lot of bandwidth for a number that is percentage-wise on the south side of zero. 
Medically, when dealing with the infectious disease vaccines are designed to prevent, that small percentage could be enormous if it — God forbid — would involve a polio or measles outbreak. Constitutionally, every citizen’s rights are supposed to be equal under the law as is their right to redress any grievances they might have with their government. Morally, in a perfect world every person would matter just as much as every other person. But we don’t live in that world. Which is why fights over rights are so important. These are vital, foundational issues wrapped up in the messaging of the moment. 
Politically, though, this is an exercise in how focusing a political base on a certain kind of tree while broader focus gets fuzzy is vital to modern electoral engagement. Religious freedom rhetoric, mixed with recently well-earned distrust of the marriage of health science and government, poured into a “for the children” mold makes political dynamite. Lighting off that stick of dynamite doesn’t sound as justified when it is framed as making a large explosion that affects the many under the extremely specific projected needs of the decimal point few. A large socio-political boom chiefly made because such a bang will be particularly useful to the folks with ambitious plans. 
Principles do not have to exist at odds with proportionality in our popular politics. When politicians insist they must, it is a red flag that something is going on in the rest of the forest and we should step back from the tree at hand to see what it is. Being able to say, “This is an important issue, but…” and taking in the full context of not just the issue but the moment is the first basic step in not being railroaded into action just because so-and-so said so. Using all of one’s bandwidth on one or two issues leaves a perspective that is not only skewed, but susceptible to undue influence.
Increasingly, that’s the standard operation procedure for our office holders, media coverage and personal policy opinions. Entities that have incentives to keep all the focus only on the trees they want the focus to be on. Like debates over a few hundred vaccine exemptions that distract from the dozens of school closures. An issue that, when you look closely, is becoming a platform for giving the governor more power over the state school board. A power struggle over schools and who controls them that comes as a larger fight over the ever-increasing state burden to fund school choice looms. All of that coming after a half-century of school consolidations for the majority of West Virginia that isn’t the panhandle or Potomac Highlands. There are a whole lot of trees in this particular policy forest that can be stared long and hard at.  
It would be ridiculous to be in West Virginia and never notice the forests that blanket the hills for lack of bandwidth to see it. Yet many are doing that with politics, losing all perspective to the power of the moment. There is no vaccine to keep from losing perspective and proportionality in our politics. Only prevention.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Vaccine-GettyImages-1344323367-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

That’s when we were a tariff country.” More recently, at a University of Alabama commencement, he proclaimed the graduates were “the first of the Golden Age of America,” suggesting they could become “the greatest generation” of Americans.  While his nostalgia is […]","President Donald Trump speaks during a special commencement event on May 1, 2025, in Coleman Coliseum at The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. (Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)President Donald Trump recently declared, “We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were a tariff country.” More recently, at a University of Alabama commencement, he proclaimed the graduates were “the first of the Golden Age of America,” suggesting they could become “the greatest generation” of Americans. 
While his nostalgia is clear, it’s essential to recognize that the so-called “Golden Age” he envisions closely resembles the Gilded Age — a time when America’s wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority struggled with poor working conditions, low wages and limited opportunities. 
The economic boom of that era, fueled by monopolies and unregulated capitalism, was far from the broad-based prosperity that Trump’s “Golden Age” would seem to promise.
Yes, during the Gilded Age, America’s GDP grew swiftly. Steel output soared, railroads expanded, and millions of immigrants were welcomed to the U.S. But beneath the surface was a society defined by extreme inequality, labor exploitation, monopolistic power and systemic political corruption. These weren’t merely side effects of rapid growth; they were central to how the U.S. political economy functioned at the turn of the 20th century.
The danger of deregulated nostalgia
In “Why Nations Fail,” Nobel Prize-winning economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson explain that long-term prosperity comes not from tariffs or deregulation, but from inclusive institutions, meaning institutions that provide broad access to opportunity, protect property rights, invest in public infrastructure and empower people to shape their future. By contrast, extractive institutions are designed to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few — exactly what defined the Gilded Age President Trump’s “Golden Age” so clearly seeks to model.
Advocates of resurrecting that era often praise interstate competition through “race-to-the-bottom” deregulation and minimal federal oversight as keys to success. In reality, regulatory competition of the Gilded Age forced states to gut labor protections and enable corporate exploitation. Far from fostering inclusive growth, this “race to the bottom” entrenched extractive systems that crushed social mobility, stagnated wages, and concentrated wealth and power in the hands of a few. It wasn’t a model of progress; it was a system built to benefit economic elites at the expense of the working majority.
It wasn’t until the Progressive Era that the U.S. began confronting the damage. Reforms such as child labor laws, antitrust regulations and food safety measures started the shift away from extractive norms. While leaders like Theodore Roosevelt played a role in breaking up monopolies and expanding basic protections, the broader transformation came from a growing demand for fairness and economic inclusion.
These reforms didn’t just tweak the system; they largely dismantled an economy rigged for elites and began building one that served the many. The New Deal and postwar investments in infrastructure, education and health care weren’t acts of charity: They were strategic moves that transformed the U.S. into a global powerhouse. As “Why Nations Fail” makes clear, it is inclusive institutions — not trickle-down fantasies of a renewed Gilded Age — that drive real prosperity. They unleash innovation, expand opportunity and create growth that benefits an entire society, not just those perched at the top.
Fiscal warnings and misguided solutions
Today, that inclusive foundation is under threat from rising inequality, debt-driven growth and a creeping nostalgia for policies that favor power and wealth consolidation over competition, like many embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie’s recent floor speech offers a needed warning: The current trajectory of fiscal irresponsibility — massive spending increases without real planning — is unsustainable. “We’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg,” he said, blasting what he called “fantasy math.” His critique of growing deficits and deceptive budgeting is valid. But the answer is not a retreat into Gilded Age austerity.
Slashing investments in education, health care, food security and infrastructure undermine the very foundations of inclusive growth. Fiscal discipline should mean aligning spending with long-term, broad-based investments — not dismantling the systems that support families, such as Medicaid for health care, SNAP for food assistance, Job Corps for workforce training, and federal grants for access to higher education.
Real greatness requires looking forward, not back
The real lesson of the Gilded Age isn’t that less government is better: It’s that bad government enables extraction, corruption and exclusion, eroding a nation’s future from within. President Trump’s calls for a new “Golden Age” echo the same flawed logic that underpinned the Gilded Age: Prioritize corporate power, promote race-to-the-bottom interstate deregulation, and treat public investment as waste. It’s not a vision of shared prosperity; it’s a blueprint for repeating one of the most unequal and unstable periods in U.S. history.
Today’s challenges, from deindustrialization and climate risk to a rapidly aging population, demand more than misguided nostalgia. They require systems built for resilience, fairness and broad participation. That means not dismantling institutions and disengaging, but doubling down on smart, inclusive institutions that empower the many rather than protect the privileged few.
If we want true American greatness in the 21st century, we must invest wisely, govern inclusively, and stay clear-eyed about the past. The Gilded Age was not a golden era; it was, as Mark Twain famously observed, gilded: shiny on the surface, but hiding rot beneath. Even HBO’s “The Gilded Age,” with all its glamorous fashion and opulent parties, doesn’t shy away from showing the bitter realities of the era — systemic inequality, exploitation of labor, and entrenched power structures that served the wealthy few.
President Trump may try to brand this chapter of American history as a “Golden Age,” but no amount of nostalgic gloss can hide what this age may truly be: an economy built on exclusion and extraction. History should remind us that it’s a path we cannot afford to walk again. The Gilded Age is history, so let’s work to keep it that way.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

It was my first time teaching high schoolers, and I was nervous.
But Carter — confident, articulate, and full of charm — quickly put me at ease. He spoke with sophistication, shared his dream of becoming an interior designer, and talked excitedly about acai bowls and fashion trends. So when a reading pretest revealed he recognized just 23% of letter sounds and was reading and writing at a kindergarten level, I was shocked.
Carter’s story is not unique—and that’s exactly the problem. According to the 2024 Nation’s Report Card (NAEP), a staggering 71% of Pennsylvania eighth graders scored basic or below basic in reading. While headlines often focus on early elementary reading struggles, too many older students quietly slip through the cracks, lacking foundational literacy skills by the time the curriculum shifts to “reading to learn.”
By then, the help they need is often unavailable. Teachers are expected to bridge these enormous gaps without the training or tools to do so. They want to help students succeed, but too many are entering classrooms without the tools they need to support children who read and write years below their age-appropriate grade level.  We are losing a generation of students to a literacy crisis that is both preventable and solvable.
Here’s where we can start: Require every teacher, regardless of grade level or content area, to receive evidence-based training in the science of reading. My personal struggle to access high-quality science of reading training, despite scholarships and grants, highlights a widespread systemic barrier for dedicated teachers. Our state must prioritize professional learning initiatives, partnering with experts to provide the essential skills educators need. No teacher should face such obstacles when striving to improve student literacy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
We can leverage the Pennsylvania Reading Leadership Council, formed in January 2025 to advise the Pennsylvania Department of Education on the development and maintenance of reading instruction and curriculum. This council can help ensure that all teacher training aligns with the science of reading.
During my 16th year as a teacher, I completed the AIM Institute for Learning & Research’s Pathways to Proficient Reading course, which provided me with a deep, research-backed understanding of how children learn to read, practical strategies, and ongoing support to implement that knowledge effectively, ultimately leading to improved literacy outcomes for my students.
The course content is explicitly designed around the vast body of research on how the brain learns to read. This includes critical components like phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
Before completing this course, I lacked the strategies to help students like Carter — students who had missed out on explicit instruction in phonics, spelling patterns, and syllables. This course gave me a clear understanding of how children learn to read and what to do when they struggle.
With this knowledge, I was able to give Carter what he’d been missing: instruction grounded in structure, not guesswork. In just six weeks, he gained six months of reading growth. On the last day of our program, Carter smiled and said, “I used to hate reading, but I kind of like it now.” He even asked to take home some of the stories we’d read together, “Beds for the Kids” and “On the Job With Bill”— and he added “kindergarten teacher” to his list of possible careers.
If that’s what six weeks of structured literacy can do, imagine what’s possible with sustained, statewide training and support for all teachers.
In 2024, Louisiana’s fourth-grade reading scores soared 32% above the national average after partnering with the AIM Institute. Louisiana isn’t the only state driving change through teacher training. Mississippi, also collaborating with experts in the field, achieved a stunning feat: first in the nation for 4th grade and 8th-grade reading on NAEP results. Pennsylvania must follow suit. We need a similar partnership with the AIM Institute to equip every educator to teach reading and writing effectively.
It’s time for Pennsylvania to stop waiting and start leading.
By encouraging the Literacy Leadership Council to partner with science of reading experts to train teachers in effective literacy instruction, we can ensure every child learns to read and write, building a stronger future for our Commonwealth.  Every student should be able to walk into a classroom and be met by a teacher who knows how to teach them to decode words, understand language structures, and unlock the world of reading, just like I did with Carter.

The top priority: to send more hurricane aid west, as the mountains recovered from the deadliest storm in state history. And lawmakers had to meet a regular obligation, approving a state budget for the next two years.
But as so often happens on Jones Street, compromise did not come easily.
As the final days of regular business ticked by six months later, the General Assembly found themselves unable to agree on either issue — stuck in closed-door negotiations, bogged down in procedural debate and besieged by angry shrimpers.
A final breakthrough on Helene relief came Thursday — an agreement between the House and Senate to send $500 million to the western mountains.
But Republicans, who maintain strong control of the legislature, failed to find a middle ground on the budget. They left Raleigh without a new deal, and with a gulf wide enough to be branded “philosophical differences” by the Speaker of the House.
“We’re kind of holding tight right now,” Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters. “And making sure we’re not spending too much until we get the taxation resolved.”
The session was Hall’s first as speaker, and his fifth overall. He’s waved away questions of productivity and pointed to past budget struggles to say that the current stalemate is nothing new. His counterpart across the building voiced a similar sentiment.
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), in his second decade in the role, was frank in his assessment of where budget negotiations stand.
“I think the whole thing boils down, in many respects, to insistence on the part of the House to try and renegotiate agreements that we’ve made in the past,” Berger told reporters. “And we were not willing to do that.”

Democrats remain in the minority in both chambers, though modest gains in the House have at times complicated the math for Republicans.
But both Democratic caucuses left the Legislative Building Thursday exasperated — arguing that the nonexistent budget was a result of GOP dysfunction and bad priorities.
“This is what happens when you’ve got supermajorities,” House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said. “Suddenly it becomes about everything but trying to help out folks. Because here’s the thing, at some level, you’ve got to govern.”
Democrats entered the session with a new leader of their own — as Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) took the reins of the Senate caucus after Sen. Dan Blue’s (D-Wake) long tenure in the role.
“I think they’ve actually been at a stalemate,” Batch said of Republican leaders. “And they’ve been using each other’s bills to go ahead and fight with one another.”
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday evening that the state faced “urgent challenges” that “need to be addressed through a fiscally responsible, full budget.”
What’s done: Helene aid, phones in schools & more
All told, the current General Assembly has sent over $1 billion in state dollars to western North Carolina for hurricane relief. That came in the form of two aid packages — one in March, and another this week.
Combined with two bills approved last fall, the legislature has spent around $1.9 billion to help the mountains recover from the record shattering disaster.
Republican leaders remained adamant that it was their top priority — but also stressed caution, not wanting to front-run federal aid or plunge the state into difficult financial straits.



That approach resulted in some long-requested line-items, like a grant program for small businesses, being left on the cutting room floor. Democrats, who frequently pushed for more investment but were seldom consulted, backed the aid bills but said they wanted to see more.
Among the other bipartisan-backed bills that crawled across the finish line: regulations on cell phone use in schools.
House Bill 959 requires districts to set cell phone policies. At minimum, students are barred from using them during class time. And the bill also asks districts to establish guidelines on internet use for students.
It received just one vote in opposition (Sen. Ralph Hise, R-Mitchell).
Other proposals now sitting on Stein’s desk proved far more contentious.
A trio of bills aim to wipe diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from all corners of the public sector — targeting K-12 schools, higher education and state government.
Republicans have taken after the Trump administration’s focus on the issue, aiming to eliminate diversity trainings and inclusive hiring practices. Democrats strongly opposed the measures, calling them harmful and chilling to academic freedom.
And one of the most controversial bills of the session started as a broadly popular plan — to crack down on “revenge porn” and sexual exploitation.
But when House Bill 805 reached the Senate, it took on a new identity: one loaded with conservative measures defining biological sex, recognizing just two genders and regulating school library books.
“We cannot ignore the biological realities,” Sen. Buck Newton (R-Wilson) said during floor debate.
Senate Democrats, infuriated by the changes, began to tie the chamber in procedural knots. An hour-long rules debate culminated in Batch waving a stack of cash in the air, declaring she would pay her members’ fines for failing to vote “yes” or “no.”
Batch called the culture war amendments a “poison pill.”
“They’re not going to go ahead and kill it themselves,” she said. “They just put a lot of other things on it, instead of letting bills just die or get passed on [their] own.”
In the end, the bill did pass, changes and all. The House approved of the changes — this time without Democratic support.

Veto battles: Immigration and guns
It took months into his first term for Stein to finally uncap his veto pen. Now that he has, Republicans will attempt to override him.
As of Thursday evening, the governor had vetoed three bills. Two of them deal with immigration.
One closes what Republicans have called a “loophole” in a 2024 law requiring sheriffs to comply with ICE “detainer” requests. The other requires state agencies to cooperate with ICE and bars undocumented immigrants from receiving state-funded benefits, among other things.
The ICE detainer bill is unconstitutional, Stein said, as he issued his veto. And the other immigration enforcement bill, he argues, “would … make us less safe.”
Stein also vetoed a bill allowing those over 18 to carry concealed firearms without applying for a permit.
A three-fifths majority vote is required in both the House and Senate to override a veto. Senate Republicans will likely meet that threshold with little difficulty, but the House GOP will have to count votes carefully — they’re one vote short of a supermajority.

Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) previously voted for the ICE detainer bill. If she and every Republican are present, the House can override Stein’s veto.
The math is less favorable on the concealed carry bill, which received two “no” votes from Republicans.
Both chambers can call up override motions at any time when they return for session over the coming months.
What’s fallen short: State budget and shrimping ban
Throughout the final week of session, visitors clad in white t-shirts flooded the hallways of the Legislative Building, and at one point, trucks circled the block honking.
They were business owners and advocates for North Carolina’s coastal shrimping business. And they desperately wanted to kill a bill banning inland shrimp trawling.
Proponents say the bill bans a practice that harms juvenile fish and ruins habitats. The shrimping industry says the bill would be ruinous for their businesses.
On Wednesday afternoon, two of the most vocal Republican opponents to the bill left a private caucus meeting and were greeted with deafening cheers.
The bill was dead, Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort) told the group of advocates. He raised his arms in the air as Sen. Bobby Hanig (R-Dare) embraced one visitor after another.
“God bless America!” one person shouted.

Meanwhile, budget writers in the House and Senate struggled to find any common ground whatsoever.
It had become apparent in the weeks prior that the chambers’ full budget proposals were too far apart to quickly come to an agreement. So in a last-ditch effort, both chambers began fast-tracking what are commonly called “mini-budgets’: slimmed down spending bills that bridge the gap until a full two-year agreement is reached.
The Senate unveiled a bill that funded key economic development projects, enrollment growth for schools, and an array of other items.
The House promptly rejected it, countering with two bills of its own. One of them would have given teachers and state workers raises, while cutting 20% of state jobs (many of them vacant). Those, too, were dead on arrival in the Senate.
Those salary bumps are one of the key sticking points between the House and Senate. But arguably the most important gap revolves around state income taxes. Berger and Senate Republicans are staunchly opposed to changing a series of gradual cuts to the personal rate over the coming years. Hall and House Republicans have said some adjustment is likely necessary to avoid a budget shortfall.
In the meantime, the government will keep running — despite no budget being agreed to by July 1, when the new fiscal year starts. But new projects will stay in limbo, and teachers and state workers won’t see any raises for now.
“Our teachers, law enforcement, and other state employees deserve real pay raises so we can recruit and retain the best,” Stein said in a statement Thursday evening.
“In addition, at a time when the federal government is proposing severe cuts to Medicaid, leaving Raleigh without taking steps to fully fund North Carolina’s Medicaid program is irresponsible. I stand ready to work with the General Assembly to invest in our people and expand opportunities so every person can succeed.”
The final days’ GOP back-and-forth caused some Democrats to voice their exasperation.
“It’s a shame the other house is led by someone who wants to hold it up,” Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said as the House took a vote on their bill to raise salaries for teachers and state workers. “That we had to break it out of the main budget, and broke this way … what a shame.”
Rep. Mitchell Setzer (R-Catawba), presiding over the House, was less moved.
“It’s been done that way since the beginning of time, sir,” he replied.

But far fewer — about 300 when discounting resolutions extending congratulations and condolences, and granting officiants’ wedding rights — survived the six-month session.
Some were killed outright, while others were left to languish in political purgatory known as legislative committee, or without the necessary budget funding to survive. 
On Thursday, we brought you five wins from the legislative session. Now, here are five losses.

1. Gas tax hike not enough to layoffs and service reductions at RIPTA
Cuts are coming soon to the state’s public bus service. That’s even after the General Assembly propped up the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) with nearly $15 million in the fiscal year 2026 budget, including with revenue from a 2-cent increase in the state’s gas tax.
It wasn’t enough to fill what was a $32.6 million shortfall when Gov. Dan McKee released his version of the budget in January. After state lawmakers reduced the deficit to $18 million, RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand said 90 layoffs and a 20% reduction in service may be necessary.
Durand told reporters Thursday afternoon that the deficit was down to $10 million after the agency identified another $8 million in savings from a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan.
When cuts would take effect is still to be determined. The agency plans to hold a series of public hearings on potential service changes starting July 28. But RIPTA already has a guide available — an efficiency study of its operations and financial situation mandated in the state’s fiscal 2025 budget. The governor and legislative leaders wanted the agency to finish the study by March 1, but the board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
The final report is expected to be complete no later than mid-July, Durand told the agency’s board of directors Thursday. Transit advocates said they believed the late efficiency study hurt RIPTA’s chances of getting additional state funds.
“Our hope was that the efficiency study would point out a menu of options for reducing costs before the session ended,” McKee spokesperson Olivia DaRocha said in an email Thursday. “Now, the vendor and RIPTA must continue the work of right-sizing operations to protect taxpayers.”
The efficiency study has been released in phases. A May 30 draft report identified underperforming routes, including the 88 bus, which travels between Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
A June 16 draft memo suggested fare increases and rerouting rural routes to low-income areas, along with “reverse commutes” from Providence to other municipalities.
RIPTA was not without its champions in the General Assembly this year. On the final night of the session, Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, sought to raise an additional $10 million via a floor amendment that would have tapped a bit more into the gas tax and highway funding shares that would normally go toward the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. But the proposal was defeated by a 12-16 vote.

2. Building decarbonization dreams deferred 
Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak beamed after the House of Representatives passed her bill requiring the state to track energy usage from large private and public buildings over 25,000 square feet. Kislak has been trying to set up a state building decarbonization program for four years. 
But her celebration of the June 20 vote was short-lived.
As the hours stretched from night into early morning during the marathon session finale, it became clear the Senate would not take up the legislation, ultimately dooming the measure advocates had viewed as crucial to meeting mandatory state emissions reductions.
The Senate instead passed a resolution asking the state’s Office of Energy Resources to recommend how to begin measuring large building energy use. Lawmakers had received a letter from Chris Kearns, the state’s acting energy commissioner, citing concerns about the bill’s “aggressive” timeline and lack of staff to achieve its mandates.
Deadlines for carbon reductions under the state’s 2021 Act on Climate Law are approaching. The first legally enforceable benchmark calls for cutting emissions 45% from 1990 levels by 2030. Preliminary modeling already suggests the state might miss its 2030 target if it doesn’t take action, including in the building sector, which accounted for nearly half of annual emissions in 2022, the most recent data available.
“We are absolutely ready to do this,” Kislak said in an interview. “We should already be doing this.”
Meanwhile, the city of Providence has laid the framework under a municipal building energy benchmarking program, with an inaugural December 2024 report documenting the energy and emissions usage for 63 city-owned buildings above 10,000 square feet. 
Much like the capital city’s program, Kislak’s bill, having already been revised, doesn’t prescribe target emissions for buildings; instead, it seeks to get a handle on how much energy they use now.
Yet even in her own chamber, lawmakers fretted over the burden on business owners, with 20 representatives — all 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats — voting against the bill.
Kislak acknowledged the bill’s name — “the Building Decarbonization Act of 2025” — might have caused some confusion.
“I should have called it the ‘building energy use measuring bill,’” she said. “That’s what it is, a measuring bill.”

3. Administration v. public records reform 
Advocates for legislation to reform Rhode Island’s Access to Public Record Act, unchanged since 2012, steeled themselves for criticism from McKee’s office. But the force and breadth of opposition — spanning a dozen state agencies, each with multiple points of contention — surprised even Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat and bill sponsor.
“In my 17 years as a lawmaker, I have never seen that many agencies respond to something on their own,” DiPalma said, referring to the letters and testimony to the Senate during an initial May 22 bill hearing. 
The legislation was held by the Senate Committee on Judiciary following the hearing. The House companion never received an initial hearing. 
DiPalma insists McKee’s office orchestrated the takedown, an allegation McKee’s office has not directly addressed in inquiries for comment.
“Transparency is in the public’s interest—that’s not in dispute—but the state must balance transparency with privacy rights and costs to the taxpayer,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office said in an emailed response. 
The 15-page legislation encompassed minor language tweaks and major updates meant to protect and expand access to affordable public information, while integrating new data sources like traffic accidents, police body-worn camera footage and text messages between officials into the definition of public records.
Based on the onslaught of administration criticism, DiPalma had already accepted defeat long before the Rhode Island General Assembly went on recess June 21.
“I’m going to spend my energy and calories where they are needed,” DiPalma said. 
But, he pledged to resuscitate the public records reform bill in the same form next year. Nor was DiPalma willing to meet with McKee’s office to talk over his concerns.
“I am not meeting again to hear them tell me the same thing, ‘no no no,’” he said.
Seconds later, DiPalma added a caveat: “But I am willing to meet with anybody if they are willing to figure out how to make something better.”

4. Universal school meals not on the menu
Lawmakers’ recurring appetite to provide free meals to all Rhode Island schoolchildren went unsatiated yet again in 2025. 
Three bills this year would have provided free breakfast and lunch for every kid attending public school, regardless of their family’s income. All three bills were heard by committees in their respective chambers of origin. And all three bills died before making it to a floor vote, just like last year. (The legislation did pass the Senate in 2023.) 
Rep. Justine Caldwell, an East Greenwich Democrat, led the legislation in the House of Representatives, just like she did last year. Caldwell’s bill was mirrored in the Senate by Sen. Lammis Vargas, a freshman Democrat from Cranston. Also in the Senate was another bill by Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat.Co-sponsored by many of the same senators who signed on to support Vargas’ bill, Acosta’s bill sought to flex more regulatory muscle, with stricter rules around participation for local school districts. 
All three bills would have taken effect on July 1, 2026, and would have phased in universal school meals over three years.   
The push for universal school meals is not unique to Rhode Island and derives from programs adopted during the COVID‑19 pandemic with two years’ worth of federal waivers. As of May 2025, nine states had made this pandemic-era reform permanent by taxation, ballot initiatives, or maneuvers in the budget. 
McKee included $800,000 in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget in January to upgrade approximately 6,500 Rhode Island students from reduced-price meals to gratis ones. 
And as a new legislative session dawned in January 2025, then-Majority Leader Valarie Lawson named school meals as one of her policy priorities this session. Lawson co-sponsored both Senate bills, and in April, the East Providence Democrat became Senate president. 
But even a friend in a high place was not enough to uplift the bill in the chamber.
“The Senate President continues to support this bill and believes that it is a worthwhile investment,” Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, said in an email Thursday. “She will continue to support it when it is re-introduced next year, and will monitor if developments at the federal level impact the program.
Those federal developments could leave a crater-sized impact. The budget outlined in the “Big Beautiful Bill” has free school meal advocates worried that school meal programs could be severely delimited by changes to eligibility requirements.

5. McKee’s priorities forced to take a backseat
Gov. Dan McKee railed against legislative leaders for passing a “bad budget” that included higher taxes and fees he deemed unnecessary and burdensome to working families.
Many of his priorities were also stripped from the final $14.3 billion tax-and-spend plan, or significantly reduced.
Take, for example, the governor’s pledge during the 2024 State of the State address to raise residents’ incomes by $20,000 by 2030. The “Rhode to Prosperity” plan remained merely an outline until a year later, when McKee unveiled his proposed fiscal 2026 budget. The governor wanted to spend $9 million from state coffers and employer taxes to train secondary and higher education students, and the existing workforce, with the goal of boosting their income.
These programs are “crucial” to help residents adapt amid nationwide economic uncertainty, DaRocha, a McKee spokesperson, said in an email.
But lawmakers did not sign on to the funding needed for new apprenticeship programs at the Community College of Rhode Island and expansion of existing training programs through Real Jobs Rhode Island and PrepareRI. 
Initially, the fiscal 2026 budget unveiled by the House Committee on Finance also scrapped any new money for McKee’s signature Learn365 program, though state representatives agreed to add back $1.5 million for the after-school municipal learning program just before approving the spending plan on June 17.
Shekarchi in a June 10 briefing with reporters explained the cuts were necessary because of competing priorities and requests that exceeded available funds.
“What’s obvious was part of the solution was not doing the expenditures that the governor wanted,” said Michael DiBiase, former state administration director who now serves as president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. “That’s how they reached balance.”
Meanwhile, both chambers took another swipe at McKee over his role in steering a 2021 state education contract to the ILO Group, with overwhelming support for a bill banning bid-rigging and penalizing public officials and vendors who flout the rules. McKee has not yet signed the legislation into law, though he indicated at an unrelated press conference Wednesday that his concerns with the bill were addressed.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Jessica Schneider, a member of Chesterfield County’s Board of Supervisors, was about to address a growing crowd of people protesting area immigration raids outside the Chesterfield County Courthouse Wednesday morning when her phone buzzed with news that visibly shook her.
Another immigrant, Salvador Calderon-Cuella — whose immigration status remains unclear at this time — had just been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and quietly whisked away through the courthouse’s back entrance.
Calderon-Cuellar had pleaded guilty in April to two misdemeanor traffic offenses — driving without a license and failing to yield when entering a highway. The fines totaled $130, according to Chesterfield General District Court records. On Wednesday, he arrived at the court to make the payment.
“As we are just here, someone was being taken out the back,” said Schneider, her voice cracking during an interview with The Mercury.

“He had no prior arrests. Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained? This is a person that is here, working in our communities, and why are we punishing him?” Schneider said. 
Since Friday, at least 14 immigrants had been arrested by ICE agents in and around the courthouse, according to reporting by Virginia Scope and other local media outlets. The arrests occurred over the course of several days, many following minor court appearances like Calderon-Cuellar’s. Immigration advocates say some of those arrested had no criminal convictions at all. 
The rash of immigrant arrests in Chesterfield comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has bolstered federal efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants, actions Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares have pledged to support. 
Schneider sees the sweep as part of a broader, politically charged campaign by the president and his allies.
“Trump says he wants to get rid of violent criminals and gang members,” she said in the interview. “But that’s not what’s happening now. This is just all about the cruelty and the racism. To purify our country is what I believe they’re trying to do.”
She grew more emotional as she reflected on her husband’s family history in Germany.
“We’ve been through this. We know what happens when people start to say that we’re better than them, and that we have to get rid of those people. And if we turn a blind eye, look at what happened then,” she said, holding back tears. “We need to stand up for our immigrant friends, neighborhood members and community members.”
 Community and economic toll

The arrests, which are also happening in many other parts of Virginia, come amid growing concern about the ripple effects of stepped-up ICE activity in the state. 
A recent study by the Commonwealth Institute and the Immigration Research Initiative warned that mass detentions of undocumented immigrants not only fracture families but could damage Virginia’s economy.
According to the report, released on Tuesday, undocumented immigrants are central to several key industries. They make up 28% of child care workers, 25% of construction workers, and 25% of cooks. Deporting just 10% of this population would result in a $69 million annual loss in state and local tax revenue — not to mention labor shortages and rising consumer costs, the study found.
“Forcibly removing community members en masse rips the fabric of our communities, erodes trust in law enforcement, and is costly for all of us,” said Freddy Mejia, policy director at the Commonwealth Institute and a co-author of the report.
Shamier Settle, a senior analyst with the Immigration Research Initiative and co-author, warned that deportations don’t only harm undocumented families. 
“Our economy is not a zero-sum game — when immigrants are deported the number of jobs for U.S.-born workers declines.”
 A courthouse, not a ‘sanctuary’

The courthouse arrests have also rattled local officials, even those with no formal oversight of immigration enforcement.
Amanda Pohl, chief clerk of the Chesterfield County Circuit Court, told The Mercury she only learned of the ICE presence after the first arrests occurred. While her office does not control operations in the General District Court — where many of the detentions happened — she immediately began reviewing policy with her staff.
“They’ve been in plain clothes, and so I don’t actually have an accounting of how long they were here, who was here, and how many were here,” she said of the federal agents. “Since I’ve been here, we do not call ICE on anyone, we do not ask for immigration status, and we will continue to implement that practice.”

While Pohl emphasized that her staff does not coordinate with ICE and wants the courthouse to be welcoming for all, she acknowledged the limitations of her authority. 
“We are not able to stop [ICE] if they come to the building,” she said. “But we are going to do our best to make sure that ICE is not in our office and not lurking about.”
Pohl disputed social media rumors that Chesterfield had declared itself a “sanctuary” county — suggesting such misinformation may have drawn ICE’s attention.
“Chesterfield is not a sanctuary county at all,” Pohl said. “But I firmly believe that this is hallowed ground, this is a sacred area. We have to respect the rule of law and due process, and that’s not what’s happening here.”
 Residents rally in response

About three dozen county residents and news media gathered outside the courthouse Wednesday in a protest organized by local civil rights groups and community leaders. Speakers condemned the ICE arrests as inhumane, excessive and a betrayal of democratic ideals. A lone passer-by who yelled out “God bless Donald Trump” was quickly shouted down.
Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, addressed the crowd first.
“Let us be clear, courthouses are sacred places in a democracy,” she said. “When ICE conducts raids in courthouses, we do more than just dispute legal proceedings. We undermine the very foundation of due process.”
Martin warned that courthouse raids don’t only impact immigrants.
“Imagine being a victim of domestic violence, showing up to court to seek a protective order, and instead being detained by ICE. Or think of a key witness in a criminal case who now refuses to testify out of fear of deportation,” she said. “These are not hypothetical situations. They are happening and happening right now.”
Among the speakers was Christian Martinez Lemus, a policy analyst with CASA, a national immigrant advocacy group.
“What we are seeing in the courts, which are supposed to be the places of law and order, is the full erosion of due process and constitutional rights,” Lemus said. “Make no mistake, this is not an issue of illegality. This is an issue of poor people being sent away for political purposes.”
Lemus framed the arrests as part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda driven by Trump-era ideology.
“President Trump’s vision is to wipe out the diversity melting pot this country is known for,” he said. “If ICE agents can wear masks, abduct people in courts, and send them to undisclosed prisons, do you think you are safe? No. We will fight darkness and fear through hope.”
Chesterfield resident Curtis Smith said he attended the protest out of concern for civil liberties.
“What ICE is doing is despicable,” he said. “I shouldn’t be in terror of walking out the courthouse and then wondering if I am going to get dragged off to a detention center because ICE agents saw that I have a Spanish name or something.”
He called the courthouse sweeps a “horrible ambush tactic,” adding that “people should have a chance to go to court without fear of something else that might happen to them when they go to court.”
 Political reactions split

Earlier this week, Youngkin defended the arrests, linking them to a broader law enforcement strategy. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the governor said Virginia’s Homeland Security Task Force had carried out over 2,000 arrests in collaboration with ICE, the FBI, DEA, and state police.
“The fact that there have been some arrests at the Chesterfield County Courthouse makes sense, because they clearly have been arrested, they clearly are here illegally,” Youngkin said. “It’s working. And most importantly, we’re getting really tough bad guys off the street.”
Miyares, whose office played no role in the arrests, nonetheless offered support for the federal operation. 
“These individuals fall into one of two categories: they’re either here illegally and have committed violent felonies, or they’ve already been ordered to be deported by a federal judge,” Miyares said in an email.
But civil rights leaders and Democratic lawmakers expressed alarm.
Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond, released a blistering statement denouncing the courthouse operations as a “rupture in the social covenant” and a violation of constitutional values.
“The courthouse stands as hallowed ground within our constitutional republic — a sanctuary where justice is sought,” Jones said. “When ICE agents transform this space into a site of apprehension, they desecrate the very temple of justice their oath of office obligates them to uphold.”
Jones warned that such enforcement “engenders a climate of fear that permeates entire communities” and proposed several reforms, including designating courthouses as “sensitive locations” where ICE action would be restricted.
“These enforcement tactics do not occur in a historical vacuum,” he said. “They violate basic dignity. Justice without mercy isn’t justice at all — it’s just power masquerading as righteousness.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator is monitoring developments and stressed the importance of transparency. 
“ICE officers should be clearly identifiable to the public as law enforcement to mitigate risk — including risk to themselves if people misunderstand what’s happening,” the spokesperson said.
In the meantime, the full scope of ICE’s presence in Chesterfield and other parts of the state remains unclear. Neither ICE nor the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has responded to The Mercury’s requests for comment.
 Statewide operations

However, the Chesterfield detentions are part of a broader pattern of stepped-up immigration enforcement across Virginia in recent months. 
In Sterling, ICE arrested 10 individuals outside the Northern Virginia Immigration Court earlier this year, prompting similar concerns from advocates about courthouse-related detentions undermining due process. 
In Albemarle County, ICE agents detained two men inside the Albemarle County Courthouse, sparking outrage from local attorneys and activists who said the operation put public safety and legal access at risk.
Additional raids have occurred outside traditional courthouse settings. 
In Northern Virginia, ICE and the FBI jointly detained seven undocumented individuals in what the agency called a “targeted enforcement operation” focused on alleged public safety threats. 
A separate joint operation in Richmond led to the arrest of an undocumented Egyptian national with a prior criminal history, though ICE did not release the individual’s name or further details. 
Overall, federal data cited by Axios indicates Virginia has seen a significant increase in deportation and detention activity in 2025, with the state now among the top 10 nationally for total ICE removals.
Also in Virginia, the Youngkin administration in February launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force (VHSTF) through a partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice and the commonwealth. 
Drawing in more than 200 agents from federal (FBI, ICE, DOJ) and state departments (Virginia State Police, Department of Corrections), the VHSTF was created to blunt transnational organized crime, gang violence, and immigration violations. 
Within two months, it recorded its first milestone — 521 arrests, including 132 individuals with alleged gang affiliations such as MS‑13 and Tren de Aragua — underscoring Youngkin’s description of the initiative as a model “federal-state collaboration” in law enforcement.
Top officials praised the task force’s rapid progress. Youngkin lauded the joint effort as a blueprint for national enforcement efforts, stating that its success “should be replicated all across the country.” 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the operation as evidence of “unprecedented collaboration,” FBI Director Kash Patel called it “a tremendous success,” and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons pointed to the expansion of the 287(g) program — authorized by Executive Order 47 on Feb.  27 and operational within 20 hours — as a key driver of the early results. 
The VHSTF continues to pursue long-term investigations into narcotics trafficking, transnational organized crime, and gang-related activity across Virginia.
Meanwhile, immigration advocates say they are hearing of similar arrests in other parts of the state and are preparing for legal challenges.
Standing outside the courthouse in the aftermath of Wednesday’s protest, Pohl, Chesterfield’s Circuit Court clerk, said as the struggle continues, the nation’s constitutional credence must take precedence.
“We have to respect the rule of law in due process, and that’s not what’s happening here,” she said.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Efforts to redevelop the aging State Center Complex in Baltimore have spanned decades and seen governors and legal battles come and go. Now Gov. Wes Moore (D) wants to try his hand at fixing up the campus.
Moore on Thursday issued a request for proposals on how the state can best transform the aging state-owned complex into a “mixed-use, transit-oriented” development.
“This next chapter for State Center will expand our mission to create jobs, build housing that’s affordable, and create new pathways to work, wages, and wealth in all corners of the state,” Moore said in a written statement on the endeavor.
The 28-acre State Center complex is currently home to several state agencies, including the departments of General Services, Health and Labor.
Due to the decaying conditions at the State Center buildings and the expectation that the property would eventually be redeveloped, thousands of state workers have been moved to offices in other parts of Baltimore in recent years, with the Health Department becoming the latest to join the exodus.
Officials: State Center settlement marks the end of one era and the beginning of another

It’s an involved project, with the departments of General Services and Transportation and the Maryland Economic Development Corp. (MEDCO) all involved in the request for proposals on the property. The agencies hope to land on a consultant this fall, who would spend the next two years on the project.
“The primary goal is to retain a qualified development partner that will implement the redevelopment vision, with a focus on maximizing the economic development and housing potential of the site,” according to the proposals request. “The proposed work schedule estimates a 2.5-year timeline to execute the necessary activities leading to a Master Developer Agreement (MDA) with a potential development partner.”
Talks on redeveloping the campus go back as far as 2005, during the administration of Gov. Bob Ehrlich (R). The Board of Public Works first approved a redevelopment project in 2009, under Gov. Martin O’Malley (D).
That project ultimately fell apart, and then-Gov. Larry Hogan (R) filed a lawsuit in 2016 to terminate the $1.5 billion project. The ex-developer countersued.
Last November, the Moore administration brought an end to the saga by agreeing to pay a $58.5 million settlement, hoping to create a fresh start on development efforts.
When asked during a briefing for reporters Thursday morning, DGS Secretary Atif Chaudhry said that new efforts to revamp the location won’t repeat past mistakes, but will be “more collaborative” and informed than previous attempts.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We’re going from a very structured process – we’re not starting from scratch,” Chaudhry said. “We’re taking older studies that have been done as early as 2024, some dating back to 2018 and before, and we’re looping all those in to make sure that we take all that as an informed process and map out the future that will be in the best interest of the community.”
He said that details such as a timeline for redevelopment and the price-tag for the overhaul project will not be known until they are further along in the consulting process. Part of the consultant’s assessment will include decisions on whether buildings will be reused or demolished, along with other factors that could sway the costs of redevelopment.
State and city officials hope to capitalize on State Center’s proximity to a Metro Subway station and a Light Rail stop in the redevelopment.

“Conveniently located between two transit stations, the State Center Complex is a prime site for transit-oriented development to create a vibrant, dense, walkable community that helps connect Baltimoreans to jobs, affordable housing and opportunities,” Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said in a written statement.
Most of the campus’s buildings were developed in the late ’50s. The Fifth Regiment Armory building, the oldest building in the complex, dates to 1901. The consultant is expected to work with a qualified historic building consultant to assess the armory.
“Today marks a major turning point in how we imagine our State Center Campus,” Chaudhry told reporters, “no longer as an antiquated government complex, but more as the future. To be a walkable, transit-oriented, community-centered place that serves the people of Baltimore and Marylanders.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_statecenter4_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)About 60 Maryland landowners are looking to block a federal district court ruling that said workers for the proposed Piedmont power line could go on private property to survey for the project without the landowners’ permission.
In their appeal Tuesday to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the landowners said the ruling last last week by U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson has “sweeping provisions and consequences” that will affect landowners for the “months or years” it will take Maryland regulators to consider the power line proposal.
Abelson’s injunction should be stayed while the case is on appeal, the landowners asked the 4th Circuit
“This is about protecting our homes, our land, and our constitutional rights,” said a statement from Joanne Frederick, president of the advocacy group Stop MPRP Inc. and one of the sued landowners. “We support the landowners’ decision to appeal, and we urge the courts to halt PSEG’s actions before lasting damage is done.”
The landowners represent about half of the 117 property owners in the path of the proposed power line who were sued in April by PSEG, the project developer, after they refused to let surveyors on their property.
Abelson last Friday agreed with PSEG in an order that said landowners could not deny access to the surveyors as long as the workers posted notice at least 24 hours in advance of their intention to come on site to do the work.
Federal judge grants Piedmont power line company access to land for surveys

The appeal is the latest development of in what is likely the early stages of a legal battle over the proposed 67-mile Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project transmission line, which would stretch from Frederick County to northern Baltimore County, through thousands of acres of largely rural land.
Residents along the line’s proposed path have balked at its impact on their properties and the landscape. They argue that the overall project places an undue burden on Maryland, largely for the benefit of energy-hungry\ data centers in Northern Virginia.
“This appeal gives the courts a chance to restore fairness and rein in overreach,” Frederick said in her statement. “Marylanders should not be forced to surrender their land rights for a project that serves out-of-state corporate interests.”
But officials at PSEG and at PJM — the electric grid operator serving Maryland and 12 other states — say the MPRP is necessary not only because of a surge in demand from data centers, but from rising demand for electrical power generally at a time of declining supply, thanks to the retirement of older coal- and oil-fired power plants.
The Maryland Public Service Commission, which regulates state utilities and power projects, is only just beginning to consider the transmission project, and decide whether to issue a key certification.
In a directive issued Thursday, the PSC cited Abelson’s order allowing surveys to take place, and called for its staff to set a schedule in the case in the next 30 days.
In their appeal, the landowners argued that by getting the preliminary injunction, “PSEG has secured the ultimate relief it sought in this case,” but without all the procedures that would ordinarily take place prior to a final decision.
The injunction was “issued without the benefit of discovery or an evidentiary proceeding during which Respondents could test the factual underpinnings for PSEG’s positions and the Court could weigh the evidence,” read the property owner’s appeal.
Absent a stay in the case, PSEG will likely begin surveying properties, using Abelson’s orders, the residents argued.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If the Fourth Circuit later rules in favor of Respondents, that ruling cannot undo the invasion of Respondents private property rights, which PSEG will infringe under the guise of a preliminary injunction,” the property owners wrote. “The damage will have been done.”
They also worry that PSEG will apply Abelson’s injunction as a justification to enter all of the affected tracts of land along the proposed route of the power line — an additional 292 landowners, according to their appeal.
In assessing PSEG’s application for environmental effects, the Maryland Power Plant Research Program determined that several things were missing, including field studies and information that would show “why route alternatives were rejected, including those with minimal environmental impacts, and why PSEG did not address rebuilding or using existing parallel transmission lines for the project,” the PSC said in a Thursday news release.
“In light of the federal court’s decision affirming PSEG’s right-of-access, the Commission has directed its Staff to facilitate between PSEG and PPRP regarding the time required to produce the field studies and the feasibility of proceeding without them,” read the news release.
The Commission will make the final call on the procedural schedule. The PSC also directed PSEG on Thursday to turn over information about the alternative routes that were not ultimately selected within 30 days.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/federalappealscourt-richmond-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)It could have been called a productive day in the office for the board overseeing the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. But the Accountability and Implementation Board still doesn’t have an office.
After three years of mostly remote work, the board in March approved a 10-year lease on a 3,012-square-foot office on West Street in Annapolis, with hopes of moving the first 10 staffers in this fall.
But AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise told the board at its meeting Thursday that permit and construction delays could push a move-in date off until early next year.
“Once the permits are issued, then obviously the renovation [and] construction on the space will begin,” she said. “It would be great if we could get in there before the end of this current calendar year, but we don’t know how long it will take for the permits to be issued.”
A project summary says it could take 120 days to complete construction and renovations to the office, followed by a final inspection by the Department of General Services before AIB staff can move in.
The board voted unanimously to take $140,000 that had been set aside in this year’s budget for supplies, furniture and other equipment, and shift it into the budget for fiscal 2026, which begins Tuesday.
Maryland Board of Education approves agreement to clarify roles on Blueprint reform plan

Office or no, the board had a productive day Thursday, welcoming new staff, saying farewell to some board members, finalizing an agreement with the state Board of Education and broadening a contract for an outside assessment of the Blueprint’s progress.
Taking a closer look at career counseling
The contract originally called for the nonpartisan research organization NORC, at the University of Chicago, to conduct an interim evaluation on the overall 10-year Blueprint reform plan and report back to the board by Dec. 1, 2026. The board in January approved a $766,709 contract, out of a $1 million allocation, for the contract.
The board Thursday voted unanaimously to appropriate most of the rest of that $1 million, increasing the contract with NORC by as much as $223,209 because of new state requirements for the scope of the study.
The expanded contract requires a review of the career counseling program for middle and high school students. The additional work was mandated as part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act that takes effect July 1, tweaking parts of the Blueprint.
That will include assessing whether counseling services are preparing students for post college and career readiness pathways, determining the percentage of students who completed a career readiness assessment and the number applying to postsecondary education, training programs or registered apprenticeship programs.
For high school students, NORC will also review long-term metrics such as how many students were employed in a field of interest or related industry within a year of graduation, and the number of students who may be unemployed or not participating in a postsecondary education program.
A report on the effectiveness of the career counseling program must be submitted to the governor and General Assembly by Jan. 1, 2027.
The board also voted unanimously to give final approval to a memorandum of understanding with the state Board of Education, clarifying roles and responsibilities of the two organzations on the implementation of the Blueprint plan.

The Board of Education approved the memo Tuesday. It comes three years into the Blueprint’s implementation, following years of constant frustration from local school systems who were never sure which board was in charge of what parts of the plan.
Staff hellos, board goodbyes
The board introduced three more full-time employees who started Wednesday — one day after Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a state hiring freeze would take effect next week, part of a package of measures aimed at trimming $121 million in personnel costs from the fiscal 2026 budget.
Hise said board staff are still determining how the hiring freeze might affect the Blueprint board. Meanwhile, she said, staff are still looking to hire a policy analyst for the Blueprint’s college and career readiness priority, along with two administrative positions. The AIB also has two contractual employees.
“We’re still working through the details of that [hiring freeze] and the impact, but we’re hopeful that we will be able to still get fully staffed in the next few months,” she said. “We will talk more about that next month, as we move into the [new] fiscal year. At this time, we feel like it’s manageable.”
The employees who started Wednesday are Alex Baum, who worked with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ preschool program and will be a policy analyst focused on early childhood education — the first of five “pillars” in the Blueprint.
Liz Smith and Simone Hall come from District of Columbia Public Schools, where Smith handled strategic planning and Hall was a liaison to the District on school budgeting. Smith joins AIB as a policy analyst on governance and accountability, and Hall will work as a financial analyst.
Before the 2 1/2-hour meeting ended, two board members received a virtual “thank you” to Mara Doss and Laura Stapleton, whose final meeting was Thursday.

Stapleton’s term expires Tuesday, but she chose not to reapply. She chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park.
Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, plans to resign Monday, with a year left on her six-year term.
Both had been on the board since its first-ever meeting in November 2021.
“It is important for you to know how much I appreciate your time and your efforts,” said board chair Isiah “Ike” Leggett. “I think that you will be very proud of what you’ve done, what you’ve accomplished, not only for the individual student, but the state of Maryland.”
Board member Joseph Manko, an education program officer at the Abell Foundation, also has a term that expires Tuesday, but he has applied for reappointment for a second term.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As the federal government considers transitioning from using a funding formula to dole out money to public schools nationwide to providing block grants instead, the proposition is stirring debate among Virginia lawmakers and education leaders. A House of Delegates committee and school leaders convened last week to talk about the possible shift in education funding and the continued impacts of federal funding cuts statewide.
Supporters of block grants, or large sums of federal funding, argue that they would give states more flexibility to address individual issues. Critics, meanwhile, are concerned about whether the block grants would be appropriately and equitably distributed, including to English learners and at-risk students from low-income families.
The grants could also help school divisions know months earlier in the state budget process how much federal funding they will receive.
Suffolk Public Schools Superintendent John Gordon III said after the meeting that if the federal government switches to the block grant concept, Virginia lawmakers and education leaders need to create an action plan for implementation in schools here, including webinars and presentations for all school divisions facing massive federal funding cuts.
“What I do like about the idea of a block grant is that it would give school divisions some flexibility, but there’s also going to need to be some parameters on specifically what the grant can be used for,” Gordon said in an interview following the meeting.
Gordon, along with other division leaders from Cumberland County and Newport News Public Schools, spoke last Friday to the House committee studying the impacts of the federal workforce and funding reductions at their meeting on the campus of Norfolk State University. 
In February, the committee was established as Virginia braces for broader effects on its federal workforce and potential funding reductions. These changes are a response to executive order by President Donald Trump and his administration’s actions aimed at eliminating what they consider “wasteful” government spending.

Friday’s discussion broached impacts to Virginia’s coastal resiliency efforts, emergency management programs, rental assistance programs and tariffs on port operations. 
The discussion on the impact on state and local K-12 funding rounded out the meeting.
According to the state superintendent’s report for the 2023-24 school year, Virginia schools received $2.4 billion in federal funds.
Dr. Denelle Wallace Alexander, dean of Norfolk State University’s School of Education, said that while state and local funding make up most of the funding for public schools, federal funding also plays a crucial role in maintaining programs and staffing, providing resources, and supporting vulnerable populations. To put the funding in perspective, state and local funds comprised about 75% of total funding during the 2023-24 school year. Federal funds make up 10%, with the rest being loans and bonds. 
Wallace Alexander also said two university programs, in particular, have been impacted, which have helped increase the pipeline for school counselors and teachers.
“Our support for education must be paramount because we know that education is the foundation for everything else,” she said. “We must educate in order to stay ahead. We must educate to stay innovative, and we must educate to make sure that the health of the commonwealth of Virginia continues to stay strong because its citizens are well educated and they are able to take us beyond the 21st Century.”
Superintendents Chip Jones, formerly from Cumberland Schools, Michelle Mitchell from Newport News, and Gordon also shared with lawmakers grim details of how the changes in Washington could impact their respective school divisions.


 Appeals for relief funds

The meeting also comes as the Virginia Department of Education and several school divisions wait for the U.S. Department to decide whether to release schools’ relief funds back to them. The deadline to spend all allocated funds was abruptly moved to March 28 of this year; the original deadline had been set for March 2026, leaving schools scrambling to make plans for the money. VDOE is seeking $8 million and the school divisions are in line for $25 million.


In Suffolk, Gordon said the school division is facing a $11.3 million loss, impacting 100 positions that provide services to socioeconomically challenged families and students, as well as 15% of students in special education and the JROTC program, which serves 400 students.
Cumberland schools also face a $1.7 million reduction, with special education, after-school programs and career and technical education taking a hit.
“The majority of my federal funding funds people,” Jones said, adding that “people are where you cut … and it’s very hard to sit across from someone and tell them you’re losing your job.”
In Newport News, Mitchell said an area of concern for the school division is the impact of furloughed employees at the shipyard.
“While that’s not directly related to the federal cuts, it adds to the economic concerns because the shipyard is our largest employer in our school division,” Mitchell said. “So the federal cuts, in general, impact the city, which, in turn, of course, impacts the city’s ability to support our schools.”
Newport News is expected to face a loss of $700,000 for an adult education program and grants for English Language Learners, Mitchell said.
Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, the committee chair, described the changes as a “double whammy” for lawmakers, as they will try to balance the prospect of fully funding public schools while also managing other areas impacted by cuts.
Lawmakers have worked to address the lack of state funding for schools, most notably after researchers for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, found that the state had been underfunding schools since the Great Recession started in 2007.
The committee has a meeting scheduled for Aug. 14 at the General Assembly Building.
“We are very cognizant that these cuts are going to affect our local school districts,” Bulova said. “We’re just getting our arms around what the order of magnitude of those cuts will be and so we’ve got to make sure that we don’t set back public education after we have worked really hard over the last couple years, based on the JLARC report, to be able to catch up with K-12 education.”

Shuttered Norfolk brewery at center of ‘woke mob’ controversy needs nearly $2 million in 20 days

The company’s board has been gutted with only Alan Beal, the chief executive officer, still present after closing its Norfolk brewery in early March. In recent emails to potential investors, Beal said he is pressing on, looking for a new home in Texas or Florida and negotiating with a contract brewer despite not raising the capital he said the company needed to continue. 
Beal told investors in April that the company needed to raise seven figures by the end of the month. 
He pledged that if the company did not raise at least $1.7 million by April 29 — or raised less and could not negotiate payment plans — that it would refund the new investments.
“If we fall short of this goal, we will likely be forced to completely reorganize the company, or even terminate operations,” he wrote in an April 14 fundraising email. “And remember, all funds are going to be held in escrow until we know we have raised sufficient funds to pay off or restructure the existing debt, and to relocate and to move forward with the new business plan.” 
That campaign raised only $268,000, according to an email from Beal. Some of that paid former employees, a claim confirmed by one former staffer.

In email after email since April, Beal has blamed the company’s failure on a “woke mob” that spoke out after the Armed Forces July 2023 purchase of the former O’Connor Brewing for $3 million. Opponents pointed to social media posts by Robert O’Neill, Armed Forces’ former brand ambassador, board member, and the SEAL Team 6 member who claims to have killed Osama bin Laden, as offensive and reason not to support the company. O’Neill’s social media posts criticized the Navy for using a drag queen in a recruitment ad and mocked transgender people. 
But former employees laid the company’s problems on Beal. Interviews with nine former employees and contractors for Armed Forces said the Norfolk taproom did not reach its revenue potential partly because of the controversy. Armed Forces suffered setbacks selling beer, notably losing market share after failing last year to pay Brew Hub, a Florida contract brewery it had been using since before the Norfolk purchase.
“The closing of AFBC had nothing to do with a “woke mob,” former mid-Atlantic sales manager Tim Labbe wrote on Facebook in March, saying he was part of a team growing sales in seven states. “We had great relationships with the major chain grocery stores in those states as well as big distributors. When Alan (Beal) stopped paying bills and stopped complying with the agreements in place that all dried up.”
Prior to the latest request for funders, the company raised about $8.5 million from more than 10,000 investors who contributed a minimum of $200. They were supposed to get rewards ranging from stickers to hats, but an April Securities and Exchange filing said the company may not be able to fulfill that promise. Armed Forces suffered a net loss of $1.76 million for the first six months of 2024. The company has failed to file its annual 2024 financial report to the SEC. 
The majority of cash from investors over two years covered operating losses.
Armed Forces and Ironbound, which owns the property on 24th Street, remain in arrears on other bills. The city’s website shows that Armed Forces has unpaid property, food, and beverage taxes for 2025, but does not reveal the amount. Ironbound AFBC, which owns the brewery, owes $13,500 in real estate taxes dating back to December. 
A city spokesman said the amount of the food, beverage, and property taxes owed is exempt from Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act. The city has padlocked the building with “a large amount of beer on the premises and in the tanks,” according to an April SEC filing. That means the company has no way to generate revenue fulfilling orders to distributors.

The SEC filing also reveals Armed Forces has liens against it for construction costs totaling nearly $110,000 and has been sued in Norfolk by two former employees for $15,800 over unpaid salaries. A filing by a lawyer from Oliveri & Larsen, a debt collection firm, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, seeks to recover a “large claim” owed Barnes Beverage Group, a consulting firm. A lawyer for the firm declined to comment. Armed Forces has also been threatened with lawsuits for failing to pay three lenders a total of more than $335,000, according to the filing. Beal personally guaranteed two of those loans totaling nearly $250,000. 
The three loans are in default and the filing says, “there is great uncertainty as to whether the Company will be able to pay off or pay down the loan.”
Beal has continued making promotional appearances on sympathetic, small-audience media, showing up on Real American Blue, a streaming webcast hosted by Robert “Curly” Flanagan, a retired Arizona Maricopa County sheriff and a forthcoming FloBilly Swamp Wear episode filmed in Florida.

The industry is highly dependent on foreign workers: More than 800,000 immigrants and naturalized citizens comprise 28% of direct care employees at home care agencies, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care companies.
But in January, the Trump administration rescinded former President Joe Biden’s 2021 policy that protected health care facilities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The administration’s broad immigration crackdown threatens to drastically reduce the number of current and future workers for the industry. “People may be here on a green card, and they are afraid ICE is going to show up,” said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofits that care for older adults.
Existing staffing shortages and quality-of-care problems would be compounded by other policies pushed by Trump and the Republican-led Congress, according to nursing home officials, resident advocates, and academic experts. Federal spending cuts under negotiation may strip nursing homes of some of their largest revenue sources by limiting ways states leverage Medicaid money and making it harder for new nursing home residents to retroactively qualify for Medicaid. Care for 6 in 10 residents is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health program for poor or disabled Americans.
“We are facing the collision of two policies here that could further erode staffing in nursing homes and present health outcome challenges,” said Eric Roberts, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

The industry hasn’t recovered from covid-19, which killed more than 200,000 long-term care facility residents and workers and led to massive staff attrition and turnover. Nursing homes have struggled to replace licensed nurses, who can find better-paying jobs at hospitals and doctors’ offices, as well as nursing assistants, who can earn more working at big-box stores or fast-food joints. Quality issues that preceded the pandemic have expanded: The percentage of nursing homes that federal health inspectors cited for putting residents in jeopardy of immediate harm or death has risen alarmingly from 17% in 2015 to 28% in 2024.
In addition to seeking to reduce Medicaid spending, congressional Republicans have proposed shelving the biggest nursing home reform in decades: a Biden-era rule mandating minimum staffing levels that would require most of the nation’s nearly 15,000 nursing homes to hire more workers.
The long-term care industry expects demand for direct care workers to burgeon with an influx of aging baby boomers needing professional care. The Census Bureau has projected the number of people 65 and older would grow from 63 million this year to 82 million in 2050.

In an email, Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency “is committed to supporting a strong, stable long-term care workforce” and “continues to work with states and providers to ensure quality care for older adults and individuals with disabilities.” In a separate email, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said foreigners wanting to work as caregivers “need to do that by coming here the legal way” but did not address the effect on the long-term care workforce of deportations of classes of authorized immigrants.
Goodwin Living, a faith-based nonprofit, runs three retirement communities in northern Virginia for people who live independently, need a little assistance each day, have memory issues, or require the availability of around-the-clock nurses. It also operates a retirement community in Washington, D.C. Medicare rates Goodwin House Alexandria as one of the best-staffed nursing homes in the country. Forty percent of the organization’s 1,450 employees are foreign-born and are either seeking citizenship or are already naturalized, according to Lindsay Hutter, a Goodwin spokesperson.
“As an employer, we see they stay on with us, they have longer tenure, they are more committed to the organization,” said Rob Liebreich, Goodwin’s president and CEO.
Jackline Conteh spent much of her youth shuttling between Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana to avoid wars and tribal conflicts. Her mother was killed by a stray bullet in her home country of Liberia, Conteh said. “She was sitting outside,” Conteh, 56, recalled in an interview.

Conteh was working as a nurse in a hospital in Sierra Leone in 2009 when she learned of a lottery for visas to come to the United States. She won, though she couldn’t afford to bring her husband and two children along at the time. After she got a nursing assistant certification, Goodwin hired her in 2012.
Conteh said taking care of elders is embedded in the culture of African families. When she was 9, she helped feed and dress her grandmother, a job that rotated among her and her sisters. She washed her father when he was dying of prostate cancer. Her husband joined her in the United States in 2017; she cares for him because he has heart failure.
“Nearly every one of us from Africa, we know how to care for older adults,” she said.
Her daughter is now in the United States, while her son is still in Africa. Conteh said she sends money to him, her mother-in-law, and one of her sisters.
In the nursing home where Goodness and 89 other residents live, Conteh helps with daily tasks like dressing and eating, checks residents’ skin for signs of swelling or sores, and tries to help them avoid falling or getting disoriented. Of 102 employees in the building, broken up into eight residential wings called “small houses” and a wing for memory care, at least 72 were born abroad, Hutter said.
Donald Goodness grew up in Rochester, New York, and spent 25 years as rector of The Church of the Ascension in New York City, retiring in 1997. He and his late wife moved to Alexandria to be closer to their daughter, and in 2011 they moved into independent living at the Goodwin House. In 2023 he moved into one of the skilled nursing small houses, where Conteh started caring for him.
“I have a bad leg and I can’t stand on it very much, or I’d fall over,” he said. “She’s in there at 7:30 in the morning, and she helps me bathe.” Goodness said Conteh is exacting about cleanliness and will tell the housekeepers if his room is not kept properly.
  Grooming Goodness is one of Conteh’s daily tasks. (Photo by Alyssa Schukar for KFF Health News)
Conteh said Goodness was withdrawn when he first arrived. “He don’t want to come out, he want to eat in his room,” she said. “He don’t want to be with the other people in the dining room, so I start making friends with him.”
She showed him a photo of Sierra Leone on her phone and told him of the weather there. He told her about his work at the church and how his wife did laundry for the choir. The breakthrough, she said, came one day when he agreed to lunch with her in the dining room. Long out of his shell, Goodness now sits on the community’s resident council and enjoys distributing the mail to other residents on his floor.
“The people that work in my building become so important to us,” Goodness said.
While Trump’s 2024 election campaign focused on foreigners here without authorization, his administration has broadened to target those legally here, including refugees who fled countries beset by wars or natural disasters. This month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the work permits for migrants and refugees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who arrived under a Biden-era program.
“I’ve just spent my morning firing good, honest people because the federal government told us that we had to,” Rachel Blumberg, president of the Toby & Leon Cooperman Sinai Residences of Boca Raton, a Florida retirement community, said in a video posted on LinkedIn. “I am so sick of people saying that we are deporting people because they are criminals. Let me tell you, they are not all criminals.”
At Goodwin House, Conteh is fearful for her fellow immigrants. Foreign workers at Goodwin rarely talk about their backgrounds. “They’re scared,” she said. “Nobody trusts anybody.” Her neighbors in her apartment complex fled the U.S. in December and returned to Sierra Leone after Trump won the election, leaving their children with relatives.
“If all these people leave the United States, they go back to Africa or to their various countries, what will become of our residents?” Conteh asked. “What will become of our old people that we’re taking care of?”

Image: Legal Aid NCThe North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill that would impose a freeze on the use of a major legal aid fund for anything other than administrative fees Thursday. The measure would place a hold on millions of dollars used for public assistance until 2026.
The provision, included in three bills that passed the House Wednesday, was approved by the Senate on Thursday as part of Senate Bill 429, the “2025 Public Safety Act.” It stipulates that no money from the North Carolina Interest on Lawyers’ Trust Accounts (IOLTA) fund, established in 1983 to fund legal aid throughout the state, may be used to issue grants or other public assistance programs.
IOLTA operates by pooling funds that lawyers are required to hold in trust so that they may collectively generate interest, which is used to fund aid programs for individuals who cannot otherwise afford legal assistance. Since its inception, IOLTA has awarded $134 million in grants supporting these efforts, helping in areas such as education, healthcare access, and housing.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) moved to remove the IOLTA restrictions from all three bills Wednesday, noting a lack of relevance to the subject matter of the bills. The IOLTA provision was added to all three bills the day prior to their vote on the House floor.
“This is private money that accrues interest on lawyers’ trust accounts, and what this amendment will do, it will freeze it,” Morey said. “All the grants that could be started in 2026 will be frozen. All of you in your districts benefit from many of the grants that the State Bar puts out.”
She cited the importance of grants for victims’ compensation, elder law, and foreclosure prevention, as well as numerous other civil matters. “On January 1, there will be no money coming into these organizations that have been helping people in civil matters.”
Though the Senate rejected two other bills containing the provision Thursday, it ultimately passed the Public Safety Act, which includes the IOLTA freeze alongside dozens of noncontroversial changes to criminal procedure, such as increased penalties for soliciting minors, greater access to protective orders for victims of domestic violence, and creating new criminal offenses for habitual domestic violence and exposing children to controlled substances.
The bill heads to Governor Josh Stein’s desk for his decision on whether to approve or veto it. Should it become law, IOLTA funds will be frozen from July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2026. Grants issued in 2025 would still be paid out, but none could be issued in 2026.
In a January press release, IOLTA announced it would disburse roughly $12 million in grants in 2025, including $5,325,000 to Legal Aid of North Carolina, $1,160,000 to Pisgah Legal Services,
$1,070,000 to the North Carolina Justice Center. Smaller grants were allocated to groups like the Home Defense Project, Disability Rights North Carolina, and the Council for Children’s Rights.
The funds have also proved invaluable in the past in funding legal aid services to people impacted by natural disasters, with $970,000 being issued in 2024 for legal aid to victims of Hurricane Helene, that went toward helping indigent North Carolinians navigate insurance claims and evade consumer fraud attempts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Legal-Aid-NC-logo-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

Between new rounds of redistricting and even more restrictive voting legislation, Republican state lawmakers seem poised to engineer an easier path for their party’s candidates, they say.
“I think Ohio has become something of a test subject state for seeing just how far a super majority can chip away at access to the ballot and our rights to direct democracy,” Kelley Dufour from Common Cause Ohio said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With Republicans notching several wins in 2024, the “sensationalized” version of voter restriction rhetoric has taken something of a back seat, Dufour said.
“But forces are still working behind the scenes, right? At an administrative death by 1,000 cuts,” she said. “It’s a quieter process, but it’s significantly harmful to voters.”
One example is a sharp uptick in provisional voting.
In 2024, Dufour explained, 34,000 had to vote provisionally — roughly 40% more than in the last presidential election.
Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers are considering new measures that would require proof of citizenship to register and open the door to challenging a voters’ citizenship status on Election Day itself.
Proof of citizenship would require voters gathering birth certificates, divorce records, name-change records, or other paperwork.
This has already presented difficulties, for instance, for some trying to obtain a National I.D. card for air travel.
How it plays out on the map
But the “cherry on top,” Dufour said, is redistricting. Ohio could see a major shakeup to its congressional map ahead of next year’s midterms because lawmakers here are legally required to draft a new map.
Right now, Ohio has 15 districts with five represented by Democrats and 10 represented by Republicans, or 33% to 66%.
Ohio U.S. Congressional redistricting is on the agenda for 2025, with advocates preparing

Midterm elections typically serve as a kind of referendum on a new presidential administration. Historically it has not been kind to the president’s party. That’s particularly concerning in the U.S. House, where Republicans are clinging to a thin 220-2012 majority.
Redistricting in GOP-controlled states like Ohio and Texas could turn that vulnerability into an advantage.
Common Cause Texas Executive Director Anthony Gutierrez explained, in his state, the governor has already announced a special session in July.
The governor hasn’t shared what will be on the agenda, but at a recent press conference the state’s lieutenant governor was enthusiastic about the idea.
“He was asked about redistricting, and he said that he does think that if there’s any opportunity for Republicans in Texas to pick up some seats, that he does think that they should do it,” Gutierrez said, “So, nothing confirmed, but senior Republicans who probably have some insight into what’s going on, have been giving indications that they do think this is going to happen.”
In Ohio, lawmakers have to come up with a new map because the last one was approved along party lines.
The General Assembly has until the end of September to come up with a map but has shown little inclination to do so thus far. If lawmakers don’t act, that would put the task back in the hands of the seven-member Ohio Redistricting Commission.
“Currently, we have five Democrats and 10 Republicans that Ohio sends to D.C.,” Dufour said. “The map-making process could eliminate a few Democratic-leaning districts.”
What that might look like in Ohio
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno is eager to see it happen. Moreno told Punchbowl News he thinks the GOP will pick up two additional seats and that Republicans controlling 12 of 15 districts — 80% of the delegation — “reflects the state.”
Moreno reasoned there’s “a recognition” that big cities like Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland will be represented by Democrats.
Moreno won his statewide race with just 50.09% of the vote, a far cry from the 80% share he thinks Republicans should control in the U.S. House. In addition to losing the three Cs, Moreno lost counties anchored by Toledo, Akron, Dayton, and Athens.
Sitting in the crosshairs of Ohio’s redistricting effort are Ohio Democratic U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes. Kaptur’s Toledo-area district and Sykes’ Akron-based seat are the two most closely divided districts in the state.
Both lawmakers have drawn familiar challengers. Republican former State Rep. Derek Merrin has joined a crowded primary field for a rematch against Kaptur. State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., has thrown his hat in the ring, too.
In Sykes’ district, her 2024 opponent, Republican former state Rep. Kevin Coughlin, is running to face her again, as well.
In both contests, even minor tweaks to the map could have a significant impact on the outcome. Sykes only beat Coughlin by about two points. Kaptur’s margin was even tighter. She beat Merrin by just 2,382 votes — less than a percentage point.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.











I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert



The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.











We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey



Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Steep fines in Iowa set off state-federal showdown over child labor laws

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Estimates show $190M more revenue, right after budget is adopted",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/ct-budget-legislative-session/,"Once again, Gov. Ned Lamont's administration found a big pile of money shortly after lawmakers closed the regular legislative session.","Once again, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration has identified a big pile of money, almost $190 million, shortly after legislators have adopted a new budget and closed their regular legislative session.
Leaders who’ve already watered down new investments in health care and special education while scrapping income tax relief for middle class families are getting frustrated.
Over the past seven years, Lamont’s budget office has upgraded revenue estimates an average of $285 million in the first 2 ½ months after lawmakers leave the Capitol.
In other words, there’s often considerably more money available than projected. And leaders from both parties this week said it’s time to reevaluate Connecticut’s forecasting process.
“It’s occurring year after year, said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. It’s a pattern now.”
Connecticut lawmakers can’t invest in new programs, cut taxes or otherwise craft a new state budget without knowing what’s available to spend. But their most crucial forecast — delivered just 15 days after the mid-April income tax filing deadline — has being viewed by some as unreliable.
Gilchrest: ‘We need to have an honest conversation’
The $285 million average variance between what Lamont’s analysts reported in late April of the past seven years and what they projected by mid-July is more than three times the $92 million average gap lawmakers dealt with between 2011 and 2018 under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, according to state budget records.
The coronavirus pandemic may have inflated Lamont’s numbers somewhat. The traditional April 15 income tax filing deadline was pushed to July 15 in 2020 and to May 15 in 2021, severely limiting data for analysts to use in projections.
But even after excluding those two years, the average gap during Lamont’s tenure is almost $200 million.
And sometimes, legislators say, the timing on these changing projections is particularly hard to swallow.
The administration increased this year’s tax receipts estimate by $188 million on June 20, 16 days after the regular 2025 session ended and 18 days after lawmakers adopted a new state budget, which Lamont hadn’t even signed into law by Thursday night.
Surging revenues just before the fiscal year closes on June 30 typically translates into extra revenue in the next year or two.
“Had we been aware of the likelihood of that money,” Looney added, “clearly there would have been advocacy to fund some of our priorities at a higher level.”
Majority Democrats, already frustrated by budget controls that save aggressively at the expense of core programs, watered down several big initiatives. Administration officials note budget caps might have blocked more spending anyway, but lawmakers used several accounting maneuvers to work around those, often collaborating on them with the governor.
An Appropriations Committee proposal to add $84 million for special education grants next fiscal year became just $30 million, well below what local school districts need to meet rising costs.
Hopes for a new $600-per-child state income tax credit aimed at hundreds of thousands of households eventually became a flat $250 payment — and only to families making about $67,000 per year or less. It would distribute about 1/8th of the projected $300 million cost for a full child tax credit.
“When we find money like this, after the budget is done but before the end of the new fiscal year, it’s going to raise concerns among my members,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said of the administration’s new projections.
“We need to have an honest conversation about Connecticut’s revenue and our budget,” said Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, who watched in disappointment as 80% of a planned $75 million increase in long-neglected Medicaid rates for doctors who treat the poor vanished from the first year of the new budget.
“People pay their taxes so that government can support them when they need that” help, Gilchrest said. “It’s just very frustrating.”
And with Congress and President Donald Trump debating massive cuts in state assistance for Medicaid and other human services programs, Connecticut can’t miss opportunities to bolster its safety net because of outdated revenue projections, said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of the progressive grassroots coalition Connecticut For All.
“This money needs to immediately be invested in many programs our communities are crying out for — housing, health care, education — to safeguard us from Trump’s cuts,” she said.
Republican leaders, who often are hoping for a revenue surge to finance tax relief, were equally annoyed.
The House and Senate minority leaders, Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford and Stephen Harding of Brookfield, said unsuccessful GOP efforts to block tax hikes on corporations would have been aided by the knowledge that revenues already were on the rise.
Under the new budget, corporations will pay an extra $213 million in taxes over the next two years combined due to changes in income reporting and other rules. And a corporate tax surcharge that was supposed to expire would be extended to 2028, raising another $128 million over the coming biennium.
“I think that this budgeting process has now become political rather than policy-oriented,” Candelora said, adding he fears Democratic efforts to circumvent budget caps have prompted Lamont to become hyper-conservative when projecting revenue.
“I think a siting governor has joined that chorus and is trying to outmaneuver the legislature,” Candelora said.
The Lamont administration irked many legislators earlier this year when the Connecticut Mirror disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars in interest earnings on federal COVID grants, dating back to 2021, weren’t deposited into the General Fund until January 2025.
The governor’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, said it stemmed from a misunderstanding with the treasurer’s office.
GOP lawmakers were frustrated in June 2022 when they pitched a plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in income, fuel and transportation taxes but were blocked by Lamont and Democrats, in part by arguments that revenues wouldn’t support the cuts.
By mid-July 2022, the administration identified an extra $568 million in tax revenues.
“I always believe in transparency,” Harding said. “I know the governor says he believes in transparency. … There’s something that’s not adding up.”
Revenue forecasting isn’t an exact science
But the Lamont administration noted that revenue forecasting is hardly an exact science, and receipts from the income tax — which generates more than $11 billion annually or roughly half of the resources for the General Fund — can vary significantly in a short period of time.
“These are estimates, and there has been significant international macroeconomic uncertainty over the past several years, including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and wars,” said Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee.
And given how much the income tax generates, he added, a variance of $285 million isn’t unusual.
The legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis recently confirmed revenue growth like what Lamont’s staff reported on June 20. 
Analysts for the governor and the General Assembly, working largely off data provided by the Executive Branch, jointly prepare an April 30 report, projecting revenues for the current fiscal year and the next three. Legislators chiefly rely on this forecast to craft new budgets and make any final adjustments to the outgoing one.
But many years that work isn’t finished until early June. And by then, the revenue numbers often seem to change.
Legislative leaders didn’t accuse the Lamont administration of intentionally withholding data on revenue growth, but they did say it’s time to revisit the process and ensure lawmakers have more up-to-date information before they make decisions.
Connecticut’s legislature meets for roughly three months, from early February to early May, in even-numbered years. But during the longer sessions, which run from early January to early June, legislators could receive an updated revenue projection entering the final week or two, Looney said.
“I think we need to find a way to adjust the calendar to gather as much information as we can,” he said.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, noted legislators imposed new reporting mandates this spring to better anticipate growth in program costs. 
A natural next step, she said, is better estimates on the revenues that can support new investments or finance additional tax relief.
“Obviously, as you negotiate a budget,” Ritter added, “this is pretty critical information to have.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

Tax policy can be maddeningly complex and confusing. Indeed, keeping it that way is one tool the super-rich use to avoid paying their fair share.
As Alexandra Sirota of the nonpartisan North Carolina Budget and Tax Center recently observed, however, it doesn’t have to be that way.
As she notes, there’s a simple and commonsense solution that would dramatically improve our state’s regressive tax system and raise close to a billion dollars per year – a millionaire’s tax.
By raising the state personal income tax rate on annual incomes over a million dollars to seven percent – a rate that would still be lower than what millionaires paid as recently as 2013 – North Carolina would realize an annual boost in state revenue of around $980 million. That would be enough to help insulate the state from the massive cuts in federal dollars that are about to be enacted in Washington.
The bottom line: Right now, North Carolina taxes people of fabulous wealth and those living in poverty at the exact same rate. A simple millionaire’s tax would do much to cure this grave inequity.

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine, and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months, or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states, including New Hampshire, have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork, or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases, and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when, and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Compromise budget language hashed out this week by an Ohio House-Senate committee will make problems hurting Ohio pharmacies infinitely worse, the leader of a group that represents them said Thursday.
He added that the Ohio Chamber of Commerce — which advocated part of the legislation — seemed blind to the effect it would have on member businesses by making it more difficult for employees to access medicine.
As it works against a June 30 budget deadline, a House-Senate conference committee approved an amendment that keeps part of a bill meant to help ailing pharmacies but slashes another. 
The result, said Dave Burke, a pharmacist, former state senator, and executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, will be that pharmacies will go from earning scant profits to none at all.
“It’s any pharmacist’s suicide bill,” he said Thursday.
Ohio pharmacies have been in trouble for years. 
They’ve complained of high fees and low reimbursements from huge middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Last year, Ohio lost 215 pharmacies and their total number dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory, according to an online tracker launched by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. 
As pharmacies disappear, they create a lack of access that is particularly hard on the poor, elderly and disabled. Not only do they get their medicine at what are often main-street businesses. They also get professional medical advice about chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.
PBMs, the middlemen, decide which drugs are covered, and they use a non-transparent system to decide how much to reimburse pharmacies that dispense them. The three biggest control nearly 80% of the marketplace.
As pharmacies close, Ohio Chamber blasted for siding with middlemen

Each of those companies is part of a Fortune 15 health conglomerate that also owns a top-10 health insurer. CVS owns the largest retail pharmacy chain and all three own mail-order pharmacies.
So, when the big PBMs decide reimbursements, impose rules and charge fees, they’re doing so for their own pharmacies and their competitors. That’s a glaring conflict of interest, their critics say.
There have been abuses in Ohio. In 2018, the Ohio Department of Medicaid peeled back the curtain and learned that a year earlier CVS and UnitedHealth’s PBM, OptumRx, charged taxpayers $224 million more for drugs than they paid the pharmacies that had dispensed them. The Medicaid department fired the PBMs. 
In 2022 it got rid of their hidden, seemingly arbitrary system of reimbursement in which the same companies sometimes pay 500 different prices for the same drug. Instead, prices are determined by a public survey published by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — the National Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC. 
With pharmacies no longer losing money on some drugs and making it on others, the Medicaid department set a $10 per-prescription dispensing fee to cover pharmacies’ overhead. Even with the increased dispensing fees, an analysis said the state saved $140 million from the reforms.
Ohio state Rep. Tim Barhorst, R-Fort Laramie, this year proposed to use the same arrangement in many non-Medicaid transactions. That measure made it into the Ohio House budget, but then ran into opposition in the Ohio Senate, where the Ohio Chamber had been telling members the dispensing-fee requirement was a tax.
What emerged from the conference committee late Wednesday might have seemed like a compromise to its members. It kept the provision that drug reimbursements would be based on NADAC, the publicly available price list, but it got rid of dispensing fees.
To Burke and other Ohio pharmacists, it’s the worst of both worlds. Not only couldn’t they profit from over-reimbursements under the traditional, non-transparent system, they also couldn’t cover overhead from a fixed dispensing fee.
Of the measure agreed to by the conferees, Burke said, “That proposition only works with a second proposition — the dispensing fee. Because the bag, the bottle, the lid, the pharmacist, the tech, the lights, the heat and the air conditioning all have a cost. In any business model, whether it’s medications, pizzas or cars… you can’t buy ingredients for a dollar and sell pizzas for a dollar and stay in business.”
He predicted that if it becomes law, there will be a mass exodus from the already depleted ranks of Ohio pharmacies.
“If pharmacies can’t make any money — this legislation makes it so that you’re not making any money at all — it would probably force the closure of the overwhelming majority of pharmacies in this state,” Burke said. “Even a child mowing yards is not going to buy a dollar’s worth of gas and accept a dollar to mow your yard.”
Once conferees agree on a budget, Gov. Mike DeWine has the power to veto line-items in it. Burke said he hoped the governor would consider such a move.
“I think the governor’s office would be well placed to consider a veto and we will be expressing our concerns that the legislation is flawed, and that if he doesn’t, the amount of pharmacy closures in Ohio in the next weeks if not months will explode,” Burke said.
Dan Tierney, DeWine’s press secretary, was non-committal when asked about the matter.

“We have not received final budget language but will be reviewing the final language when received,” he said in an email Thursday.
Burke didn’t accuse any of his former colleagues of ill-intent in agreeing to the measure.
“I think they believed that if they stepped in and said we’ll make sure you get paid what you paid for the drug that will fix everything,” Burke said. “But this legislation takes everything you made a profit on and brings it to zero.”
However, he did say he was mystified about the Ohio Chamber’s reasons for intervening in the matter.
“I don’t know where the chamber adopted its stance from, but it’s hard for me, as an independent business owner, to understand why major employers would want to increase their employees’ difficulty getting medications.”
Burke was incensed that the Ohio Chamber would call dispensing fees — payments to cover overhead — a tax.
“It’s amazing to me that the chamber should take the position that business owners should not make a profit,” he said. “I thought the Ohio Chamber was all about profit, pro-business and competitive markets. But they’ve adopted the position that this particular sector of business owners should not make any money. They consider the dispensing fee to be a tax. So apparently, any profit that any business makes is a tax. Maybe they’ve gone socialist over there. I don’t understand. Maybe they’re not looking at their own pharmacy benefit with any understanding.”
The Ohio Chamber didn’t immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment. But earlier this week, Senior Vice President Rick Carfagna said the goal was to protect Ohio businesses from paying too much to underwrite employees’ drugs.
There are, however, questions about the body’s relationship with the giant conglomerates that own the PBMs. For example CVS Health was a “presenting sponsor”  of the Chamber’s 2024 Healthcare Summit, 
Among the questions the Ohio Chamber didn’t immediately respond to was how much CVS paid to sponsor the event — or how much the chamber had received from the big-three conglomerates over the past five years.
In earlier responses, Carfagna didn’t address the growing number of pharmacy deserts in Ohio, or that struggling independent and small-chain pharmacies are themselves small businesses that the Ohio Chamber says it wants to protect.
Burke said all the Ohio Chamber’s members will be harmed if the conference committee language becomes law and mass closures result. That would mean sicker employees with difficulties getting medicine.
“I hope the Chamber actually goes and speaks with the people they’re supposed to represent and see if this policy position is reflective of the way they want to treat their employees,” Burke said.

Obergefell, 58, is ready to move on. Not exactly from the love of his life or the history-making Supreme Court decision that came after Arthur died. But certainly from the insecurities straight America was grappling with a decade ago about same-sex unions.




Obergefell is that Obergefell: the named plaintiff in the landmark lawsuit that extended marriage equality to every state in the nation in 2015. Ten years later, he celebrates that win and the many ways it rewrote his life. And in a time when LGBTQ+ rights are again under assault, he is looking to the future — of the queer rights movement and also his own.
 A journey to the Supreme Court

Obergefell’s journey to the Supreme Court was hardly destined. It began 12 years ago, on June 26, 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that prohibited the government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
Obergefell and Arthur had been together for 21 years at the time. The two had discussed getting married before. But they wanted it to be legal, and their home state of Ohio didn’t offer same-sex marriages.
Arthur was gravely ill with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he barely left his home hospice bed.
After the ruling, Obergefell leaned over to Arthur, hugged, then kissed him.
“Let’s get married,” he said.
Arthur agreed.
The logistics were not easy. Arthur was in no shape to travel, and the couple could not wed in Ohio. Obergefell researched and found that Maryland would let him get a marriage license even with only one of them present. But both would need to arrive in the state for the ceremony.


When friends and family learned about their predicament, they pooled together money to charter a medical jet for Arthur. The two flew to Baltimore. Over the course of 45 minutes, they exchanged vows on the tarmac before flying home.
“In the days that followed, we said the word ‘husband’ hundreds of times a day,” Obergefell said on the Decidedly Podcast in 2023.
But just five days later, their joy was muted when civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein informed them that because of Ohio’s ban on same-sex marriage, Arthur would be listed as single in death.
Arthur and Obergefell were angry. The couple sued the state of Ohio in federal district court and won. Three months later, Arthur died.
The following year, Obergefell, still in mourning, lost on appeal. But he refused to believe he might lose altogether.
“I just kept going,” Obergefell said. “It was the right thing to do.”
On June 26, 2015, he won. For the country, the win was immensely practical. Many told Obergefell it gave them so much hope it saved their lives. For Obergefell, it meant a legacy for the man he loved.
“I made promises to John to love, honor and protect him, and I was going to keep doing that,” he said.
 Changing history

It’s difficult to overstate the impact of Obergefell’s case on the nation or the world. Since the 2015 ruling, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates, 591,000 queer couples have wed, generating an estimated $5.9 billion in wedding spending for state and local economies.
It has also radically transformed Obergefell’s life. Introverted and unassuming, he has spent the last decade campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights. He helms Equality Vines, a wine company that donates its proceeds to advancing civil rights causes.
It’s a position that makes him deeply proud if not a little fatigued.
“I’m not tired of talking about it,” he said of the 10-year anniversary of the ruling. “I’m just physically tired from all of the interviews and the photographers and the speaking gigs and the events. Yes, I’m exhausted.”
For 12 years, Obergefell has kept Arthur alive through retelling their story countless times in courtrooms and for the media. That exercise, of telling and retelling, helped Obergefell process his profound loss.
But he has never recoupled. It wasn’t that Arthur didn’t want him to. In fact, Arthur told him regularly that he wanted him to find love again. He asked his friends and family to tell Obergefell that he wanted him to find love after he was gone.
“I know it was sincere, because he told me that he had other people tell me that,” Obergefell said.
It isn’t about the pressure he feels as the face of marriage equality, he said, though part of him wonders what it would be like to date after making history.
“I don’t know how to date,” he confessed. “I’m clueless when people flirt with me, and as much as I hate it, and I don’t go into any conversation or anything like this, but you know, there’s that part of me that sometimes wonders, you know, are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in me as Jim Obergefell, named plaintiff?”
Obergefell’s name has become synonymous with marriage equality in the United States, an issue that has not always united the LGBTQ+ community. Some queer activists have argued that same-sex marriage was a misguided goal for the movement as queer youth continue to face high rates of homelessness and transgender people grapple with police violence and incarceration, among other issues.
 More work to do

Obergefell, too, is worried that the needs of the community’s most vulnerable have gone unmet. He has watched horror-struck over the last five years as state legislatures have moved to restrict transgender rights.
“We need to fight for every marginalized community, because the queer community includes every marginalized community, and equality for one is pointless without equality for all,” he said. “I didn’t go to the Supreme Court just so White, cisgender, gay men like me could get married.”
Despite all of the setbacks in LGBTQ+ rights, and even threats to Obergefell’s game-changing victory, he is hopeful — and feels stronger than ever. People assume his case was difficult for him. It was, but the path was also obvious, to him and to Arthur. They loved each other.
“If we weren’t willing to fight for each other and for what was right, then what’s the point?”

The group of forty travelers evacuated Israel after missile attacks earlier this month. (Submitted)Lydia Schwartz and Alexa Litwin point to the same moment.
The moment when their cultural trip to Israel this month shifted. The moment that separated a lighthearted, tourist trip from an impromptu war-time evacuation. The moment that triggered days of shattered travel plans, hours in bomb shelters and frantic text messages.
Schwartz, 22, and Litwin, 21, recent college graduates and Jewish Kansans, traveled to their religious homeland as the conflict between Iran and Israel escalated into rocket attacks. 
The moment that changed their trip arrived June 14 at — of all places — a Tel Aviv nightclub.
Litwin was partying at an outdoor club with her brother Sam, who had been in Israel on a separate trip for a month. She was a bit late for the tour group’s appointed curfew when an alert rang out on nearby phones warning of a missile threat. The notification came from an app that participants were asked to download when they arrived in Israel.
“I didn’t even download the app,” Litwin said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, this is stupid. Nothing’s gonna happen. I’m not downloading this dumb app. I don’t have storage on my phone.’ ”
The notification came as Litwin was waiting outdoors for an Uber ride with her brother. Neither had a place to shelter. The best they could do was press themselves against a nearby wall for cover.
When Litwin’s Uber ride eventually delivered them to the group’s lodgings, the Grand Beach Hotel, she saw the trip’s tour guide.
“He was so frantic,” Litwin said. “He’s waving us inside. I’m thinking I’m in trouble because I broke curfew. That’s why he’s waving the way he’s waving. We’re all like, ‘We’re about to get in trouble.’ ”
Instead, he was directing them to the hotel’s shelter. Litwin and her brother ran toward the hotel entrance. Moments later, in the stairwell of the 12-story hotel, Litwin, a little tipsy and very scared, was reunited with Schwartz.
“It was the biggest juxtaposition of all time,” Litwin said. “Here I am partying in one of the coolest cities I’ve ever been in, and then here I am in a bomb shelter with hundreds of other Jews from all over the world.
“And that’s why it’s crazy living in Israel. It’s sad and it’s awful, but that’s what they do. And that’s not going to change any time soon.”
Litwin called her mother in tears, surrounded by other young Jews on the trip who were hugging and comforting each other. Litwin and Schwartz remember telling their parents, “I’m going to die tonight.”
“I’m in the stairwell,” Litwin recalled during an interview this week. “There are missiles being shot out from the sky. I was like, ‘Oh my god, I’m gonna die, and it’s gonna happen in 10 seconds. And everything’s gonna be over, and I’m gonna have no idea that I just died like that.’
“And I couldn’t get that out of my mind. I could literally be dead at any second and not even know it. I was spiraling about that.” 
After hours of waiting, they returned safely to their rooms at 6 a.m.
“Everyone was definitely pretty freaked out,” Litwin said. “Just because it also was not only our first time in Israel having that happen, but our first time in all of our lives having something like that happen. So everyone was definitely on edge a little bit.”
Almost everyone in the stairwell, including Schwartz and Litwin, was in Israel on a Birthright trip, an effort to bind worldwide Jews to Israel. The original 10-day itinerary navigated to holy and scenic spots, while allowing the young people to meet fellow Jews among their group of 40 travelers. The conflict with Iran derailed the itinerary.
However, Litwin and Schwartz said the experience of visiting Israel while it was under attack bound them even more closely to Israel.
Now back in Kansas, they say that even a flawless 10 days in Israel — perfect weather, timely travel connections, amazing new friends, parties every night — couldn’t have strengthened their bond to the nation as well as this chaotic trip filled with sleepless nights, rocket launches and arduous travel.
“Looking back on this trip now, I think I place my Jewish identity on a higher pedestal than I did before walking into this,” Litwin said. “Maybe it’s because I’m just coming out of it, or maybe it’s just everything that happened in Israel. But now my Judaism is in a more important place of who I am than before.”

A community of two
Litwin and Schwartz, best friends who grew up together in the suburbs south of Kansas City, often finish each other’s sentences.
“She’s my No. 1 person for everything,” Schwartz said. “Literally everything.”
Their friendship was knitted together with childhood Jewish cultural and religious activities: church lessons on Sundays and Wednesdays, summers at Jewish sleep-away camps and local meetings of Jewish teens.
“Judaism and the Jewish community has always been a huge part of my life,” Schwartz said.
They attended Blue Valley High School in Overland Park together. This month, both graduated college, Schwartz with an undergraduate degree in clinical psychology from Indiana University and Litwin with a political science degree from the University of Wisconsin. Schwartz will attend law school in the fall.
They signed up for the trip together. Schwartz remembers the uncertainty of visiting a nation that has been in tumult since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered widespread violence in the region.
Schwartz was reassured by a phone call with a woman who worked for the Birthright tour company. She remembers being told: “Israel is always in war. Birthright continues to happen every single year. Everyone is always safe. And if there’s a threat, there’s gonna be a quick pivot, and most of the time we won’t even know.”
The trip began festively. A flight from New York City gave Litwin and Schwartz time to meet other young Jews, mostly from the East Coast.
“We’re talking to our neighbors,” Schwartz recalls. “Everyone’s always up, talking to random people. And everyone’s excited. There just is that feeling of connection, getting on that plane knowing that everyone here is Jewish, and everyone’s going into this with the same intentions that you are.”
Once they landed in Israel, the tour aimed to take them to Tiberius, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the coastal town of Eilat. Even with the missile attacks, their tour group would eventually reach Eilat, but not on the sightseeing itinerary they had saved on their phones.
The first few days, spent mostly in Tiberius, were what they anticipated from the trip. There was only one surprise: a fellow traveler left the group urgently. His father hastily arranged a flight to Dubai to remove him from Israel, fearing the potential attacks that would soon come. At the time, Litwin and Schwartz thought the father and son were overreacting.
Following the night of missile attacks in Tel Aviv, their tour guide gathered them to let them know that the remainder of the trip had been canceled. The goal now was to get them safely home.
 
Everything upside down
The upcoming days were a disorienting blur.
Schwartz described a pleasant dinner at a Jerusalem hotel on June 14. While they had planned to go to a restaurant, they gathered in what they thought was the hotel’s dining room.
“The sirens go off. And everyone’s like, ‘Just stay here. This is actually a bomb shelter,’ ” Schwartz recalls. “So we just continued to have a lovely Shabbat dinner. And I look around. No one’s panicking. And that was so strange, because everyone was panicking” earlier that day.
That feeling of calm was pierced in Eilat the next day. The sounds of missile launches at 4 a.m. woke Litwin from her sleep. They also startled Schwartz, who couldn’t sleep and was making ramen noodles. Their assigned roommate, Mika, was most scared.
“I saw Mika go flying across the room,” Litwin said. “I’ve never seen someone jump the way she jumped across the room. And then I heard it. It sounded like a plane was right next to our ears, but faster than a plane — like a jet.
The town of Eilat was also the port city where they would eventually board a cruise ship that would take them to safety in Cypress.
However, before boarding the ship they again received a threat alert. At the time, Litwin and Schwartz were sitting and listening to music on one of the many buses holding 1,500 young people being evacuated from their Birthright trips. The alerts forced them off the buses. Organizers told them to lie face down on the ground for safety.
Schwartz remembers one girl saying: “Cross your legs and cover your major arteries!”
“Yeah. She was not helping the situation,” Litwin said.
It had been much easier to feel secure in shelters than under a threatening sky, Schwartz said.
“When you’re laying on the ground with 1,500 kids, you just have to pray,” Schwartz said. “Everyone was taking it very seriously. And I think that was where (I realized) in these circumstances, you just have to hope you’re lucky.”
Arriving in Cypress, Schwartz and Litwin knew they had avoided the threat of missile attacks, but they were still far from home.
“I remember talking to my mom on the phone,” Schwartz said. “And I was like, ‘I just can’t be here for another day.’ And she was like, ‘Honestly, I’m not worried. You’re safe. I’m so sorry you’re still there and know how exhausted you are. But you are not in Israel anymore. That’s the most important thing.’ ”
The travel home was a maze of canceled and delayed flights.
“I was exhausted,” Litwin said. “On one part, because of sleep deprivation. On one part, just because you feel very helpless. I felt helpless. I felt like no one was listening.”
Litwin’s flights would take her from Cypress to Cologne, Frankfurt, two airports in New York City, plus Chicago before arriving in Kansas City. Despite fewer flights, Schwartz would arrive in Kansas City about 30 minutes after Litwin.
“You’re constantly not knowing what’s gonna happen,” Litwin said. “You just have so much adrenaline. And then the second I was home, it just depleted. And then I was just exhausted.”
Just days after returning to Kansas, the two friends sat together, reflecting.
“The trip didn’t go the way that it was planned,” Litwin said. “In a way though, I’m thankful for it too. I think it really changed me. It fundamentally reshaped me as a human being. I view things differently now. I appreciate things in a different way.”
Schwartz added: “We were there for this event which put things into perspective. All the little problems that you have on a daily basis don’t matter as much. That directly relates to pride and community. The only thing you have at this moment is your Jewish identity and your connection to the Jews around you. That’s the most important thing that you’re thinking about — that everyone in Israel is thinking about in times like these.”

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). During the lame duck session of 2022, the Ohio legislature passed HB 507, a bill ostensibly about the sale of baby chicks, but loaded up with last-minute oil and gas amendments — including one that required fracking of Ohio state parks and public lands. 
Since then, the Oil and Gas Land Management Commission has sold out our ne public land after another for fracking — including thousands of acres of Ohio’s iconic Salt Fork State Park. Frack well pads are now beginning to surround the park.
Fracking has begun at Valley Run Wildlife Area, and slated to begin soon at Zepernick, Egypt Valley, Keen, Leesville, and Jockey Hollow wildlife areas.  
Flat tax and budget cuts
Shortly after Gov. Mike DeWine signed HB 507, then-Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman told the Ohio Oil and Gas Association that fracking our public lands is a “great revenue generator” for tax cuts. 
“We’re talking about a flat tax right now, perhaps eliminating it,” Huffman said. “Well, where’s that revenue going to come from?”
Now we know the answer.  
This week, a Conference Committee comprised of leaders from the House and Senate finance committees met at 10:30 p.m. — with only 19 minutes notice — to amend and pass HB 96, Ohio’s two-year operating budget bill. It contains a bevy of favors for the oil and gas industry — including fracking our state parks to fund tax cuts for the rich. 
During the final days of testimony in the months-long budget bill process, the Ohio Senate amended HB 96 to include a flat tax — cutting taxes for Ohioans making over $100,000 per year from 3.5% to 2.75% — then cutting agency budget lines to make up the difference. 
Among items on the chopping block is Fund 730321, the Parks and Recreation budget for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. This is money used to staff and maintain our state parks and wildlife areas. The Senate budget cut this fund in half for 2026 — from $55 million to $27.5 million. 
Where did the Senate tell ODNR to make up the difference? From Fund 5BJ1 ALI 7256A6, the State Park Land Royalties Fund — or money that ODNR gets from fracking.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fracking revenue becomes operating revenue
Until now, fracking royalties have been used only for special projects that improve state parks. Now the money will be used for half the parks’ operating expenses — making ODNR even more dependent on fracking for basic revenue, and making the Oil and Gas Land Management Commission even more likely to approve fracking operations. 
This is folly. The oil and gas industry is notoriously boom and bust. Fracking revenue is not guaranteed, and production at frack wells often drops steeply within a few years. 
In addition, wells can be shut down on short notice. Accidents happen — public records show that an oil and gas incident in Ohio every 1.5 days. In addition, ODNR recently shut down a frack pad in Noble County because of increased earthquakes caused by high-pressurized fracking.
Further, fracking puts at risk an industry near our parks that reliably produces income: tourism. Who wants to compete with thousands of brine trucks on rural roads to visit a park surrounded by the noise, light, and pollution of the fracking industry?
Finally ,contrary to statements by state Sen. Jerry Cirino, the people of Ohio who own and use our public lands do not want to see these lands fracked. Public comments on nominations to frack public land routinely run 98% opposed. 
Even more oil and gas favors
Making our parks dependent on fracking isn’t the only favor to the oil and gas industry in the hastily approved state budget. Other fossil fuel goodies include: 

Lengthening fracking leases on public lands for up to 10 years, instead of the current three years.
Requiring ODNR to fast-track fracking leases in 30 days, rushing a process that is supposed to include multiple provisions to protect our public lands.
Prohibiting state agencies from requiring any additional fees beyond those specified in the lease, which could prevent fines for pollution or cleanup after an accident.
Allowing fracked gas projects, now defined by our legislature as “green energy,” to receive air quality revenue bonds, despite their methane pollution.
Cutting the Oil and Gas Well Fund responsible for plugging orphan wells by eliminating filing fees. 

Next steps for the state budget
HB 96 now goes to Gov. DeWine, who has until June 30 to sign it. Unlike for most bills, the governor has line-item veto power for anything budget related. In past budget years, DeWine has not hesitated to use his veto power. 
Will DeWine, who professes publicly to love our state parks, veto the items that will degrade and destroy them? Or will he blithely stand behind the supermajority legislature that favors fossil fuels over renewable energy like wind, solar, and geothermal?
One thing is clear: The people of Ohio own and use our state parks, wildlife areas, and public lands – and we do not want them to be fracked just to provide tax cuts for the rich.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
 Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.










The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares


“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
 Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
 Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

Don Bacon, U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer and U.S. Rep. Mike Flood on June 19, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)The partnership established by the federal government and universities to support high-level research has been a success story for our country.
That investment has produced a return — measured in technology, innovation and the nurturing of generations of scientific leaders — that has positioned the United States as a global leader across nearly every industry.
The University of Nebraska-Lincoln contributes to this progress by pursuing world-class research as a core part of its land grant mission. Our research outcomes drive economic growth in the state and region and are shared directly with Nebraskans through Nebraska Extension and other outreach.
It’s important to highlight this success as federal support for higher education and university research faces growing scrutiny. Cuts to research funding, freezes on active projects, and delays in grant reviews put America’s global leadership at risk and weaken
our ability to drive innovation and economic growth.
This partnership for research developed in World War II and expanded during the Cold War, the space race and the rise of biomedical research on cancer and other diseases. Universities became leaders in research and innovation with the establishment of the National Science Foundation, the growth of the National Institutes of Health and the creation of NASA and other technology-focused government agencies.
States and universities shared in scientific advancement by investing federal and state funding in the infrastructure and facilities to conduct cutting-edge research. These investments helped train future scientists, ensuring continued expansion of technological advancements.
This research partnership is a source of strength for the U.S., enabling us to dominate in entrepreneurial activity stemming from ongoing discoveries and technological advancement.
Research in agriculture and natural resources has been a central part of this partnership since 1887, when the Hatch Act established a framework for state agricultural experiment stations at public land grant institutions. This legislation provided federal
funding to land grant universities, matched by the states, to conduct research on agriculture and support the health and welfare of rural populations.
The USDA, through programs in its National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), has expanded this research support, providing our producers and communities with science-based practices that deliver on the original promise of the 1887 legislation.
In Nebraska, that landmark legislation has delivered tangible progress in agricultural productivity through practices and technology based on NU research in agriculture and natural resources. Our corn and soybean producers have reduced their pesticide costs and yield losses, thanks to the university’s research and development of crops engineered for traits like insect resistance, herbicide tolerance and drought tolerance.
Our researchers have been leaders in developing precision agriculture technologies and tools — including GPS-guided equipment, yield monitors and variable rate technology for irrigation and fertilization.
The cattle industry has a long, productive history in Nebraska, and producers in the state continue to be leaders in the use of innovative approaches. NU research focusing on cattle nutrition has demonstrated the value of feeding ethanol coproducts to beef
and dairy cattle, a research output that benefits major sectors of our state’s economy.
Research in beef cattle genetics provides cattle breed associations with valuable information for the selection of desirable traits and increased profitability.
These are just a few examples of how University of Nebraska research is delivering real-world benefits for producers and communities. From crop resilience to livestock efficiency, our work is rooted in science and designed for impact. These efforts exemplify the value of sustained investment in research — investment that keeps Nebraska agriculture strong.
The research partnership between universities and the federal government has been vital for American competitiveness and prosperity. The reduction of federal funding for research is not just a problem for our university. It is a problem for America’s status as a global leader in innovation.
Other countries are not standing still. Every year we have a reduction in research funding, we risk losing ground to our competitors.
To continue to advance, we must continue in our global leadership role and invest in all aspects of research and discovery. We lead by focusing on our mission and innovative thinking. Supporting research funding is essential for a bright future for our state and
nation.

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderWhile the Peach State is no stranger to high temperatures, this week was hotter than most. A National Weather Service heat advisory warned of high temperatures and humidity across the state. 
“We basically have an area of high pressure over our area that is allowing these temperatures to be in place,” NWS Peachtree City meteorologist Carmen Hernandez said. “With high temperatures in the upper 90s, along with increased dew points, we are seeing heat indices in the 105 to 109 range.” 
The heat index measures humidity and air temperature to more accurately represent what the temperature feels like to the human body, and it’s considered dangerous after reaching 105 degrees. Georgia reached these levels this week, causing heat advisory to take effect Tuesday and stay in place for most of Georgia through Wednesday evening. The advisory extended through Thursday in the Northwest corner of the state with some areas still feeling as hot as 105 degrees. 
Traditionally, Georgia experiences a couple of heat waves each summer. Even with triple digit heat indices, this week’s weather was not considered abnormal or concerning for weather experts. As the heat wave scorched the state, Atlanta’s NWS shared suggestions to stay cool. Top recommendations included minimizing exposure by staying inside or out of the sun, drinking extra fluids and wearing light colored clothing.
Even with suggested coping mechanisms, dangerous exposure levels put some Georgians at higher risk. According to the NWS, vulnerable groups include the elderly, young children, pets and people who work outside.
While air conditioning remains one of the top recommendations to combat the heat, this is not a luxury afforded by all. Unsheltered populations face increased risk when exposed to high levels of heat. Cooling centers across metro Atlanta helped some avoid extended heat exposure. A Cobb County cooling center at Must Ministries’ Hope House has opened their doors every day this week.
“We operate whenever the temperature is above 90 degrees, and we provide lunch and dinner,” said Falecia Stewart, vice president of housing operations.
Last Friday was the first day of the season above this temperature. Traditionally, the Cobb County cooling center sees its busiest days during the month of July. On Tuesday, when the heat advisory began, the cooling center saw 25 people throughout the day. Visitors are welcomed between 9 A.M. and 6:30 P.M. 
Employees who work outside or inside under harsh temperatures are also a high-risk group. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is an environmental advocacy group, an estimated 1.8 million Georgians work in high-risk jobs that leave them vulnerable to heat-related illness. Farm, food processing, outdoor tourism and construction workers are some of the top occupations prone to heat related illness.
“Heat waves like the one the Southeast and most of the eastern U.S. in general have been facing over the last few days puts additional stress on not only outdoor workers, but indoor workers in hot conditions like kitchens or warehouses,” said Juanita Constible, NRDC senior advocate. “Along with the heat comes the risk of everything from mild heat related cramps and dehydration, to potential death from heatstroke or even cardiovascular illnesses that can be exacerbated by heat.”
Regular rest breaks, shade or air-conditioned spaces and staying hydrated remain the best options to protect people working through heat waves. Constible said she believes that companies with workers who face increased risks should have a written safety plan in place before a heat wave arrives.
A number of animal advocacy groups also echoed NWS’s warnings in hopes of spreading awareness on how to protect Georgia’s four-legged friends. 
Unlike humans, dogs are unable to regulate their body temperatures by sweating. This makes them more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Panting serves as an alternative allowing water to evaporate from their mouths in an attempt to cool down. However, panting can be insufficient in the level of heat currently encompassing the state. 
Dr. Jaclyn Luckstone, president of the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association, recommends walking pets during cooler times to avoid risks.
“If you’re going to take them for a walk, check the pavement with your hand and feel how hot it is, because pets can easily burn their paws on it,” Luckstone said. “If you put your hand on the pavement, and you can’t leave it there for more than a few seconds, then it’s too hot for them to walk on.”
Claudine Wilkins has worked in the animal advocacy world for 37 years. As the executive director of The Animal Protection Society, as well as co-founder of the Georgia Pet Coalition, Wilkins regularly works to fight against animal cruelty. 
“Georgia is well known to have lots of problems when it comes to summertime with animals and heat stroke,” Wilkins said.
With the exception of fish and most pests, animals are legally protected in Georgia. This means that leaving animals in hot vehicles can lead to a criminal charge. Wilkins urges bystanders to call local police for assistance if they encounter an animal trapped in a hot car during the heat wave or any warm day. 
“Our habits stay the same, and we get used to our air-conditioned cars, houses and workplaces (so) we don’t think about the animals as much,” Wilkins said.
Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper also encouraged Georgians to look out for their pets and livestock.
“With extreme heat expected for the remainder of the week, I am encouraging all Georgians to take steps to protect their pets and livestock from heat stress,” Harper said. “GDA has resources available to help you identify signs of heat stress in your animals and how you can prevent it.”
Much of the East Coast and Midwest joined Georgia underneath a heat dome encompassing large parts of the country this week. As of Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Atlanta was one of 62 major cities with forecasts showing dangerous levels of heat.
After a long week of sweltering temperatures Georgians can look forward to some relief with forecasts showing highs in the 80s through the entirety of next week.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The cost of exclusion for CT is high,Melvin Medina,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/the-cost-of-exclusion-is-high-melvin/,"The cost of exclusion is high, but the cost of letting it define Connecticut's future is even higher.","Gov. Ned Lamont’s veto of HB 5002—a housing bill aimed at encouraging modest, statewide growth —sent a loud message: we will wait for local consensus, even if that means affirming the same local resistance that got us here. 
In doing so, Lamont breathed new life into what I’ve come to call the No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition—a powerful and persistent force committed to freezing Connecticut in place.
This isn’t a political abstraction. It’s a real, measurable cost. I know, because I’m paying for it.
My family and I moved to Woodbridge last July, from Hartford. We’re raising one child and are proud to have made a home in a town known for its beauty, its schools, and its promise of opportunity.
I didn’t grow up thinking I’d ever live in a place like this. I was born and raised in Waterbury, Puerto Rican, and poor— the kind of poor that teaches you how fragile opportunity can be. I worked hard. I had help. And I earned the chance to make a choice my mother couldn’t: where to raise my child.
We came to Woodbridge to build a future —and to believe that belonging wasn’t reserved for those born behind an invisible curtain of opportunity.
Moving here peeled back that curtain. Within months, we received a mailer from a local group pushing hard against modest local housing proposals —signaling loud and clear that, for some, growth is something to resist, not plan for.
That mailer pushed me to act. I joined the Woodbridge Democratic Town Committee because I wanted to fight back.
And what I found gave me hope: neighbors already in the fight —for fairness, for more housing, for a future that includes more families like mine. But they were swimming against a tide of organized resistance —too often drowned out by voices determined to keep the door closed.
That resistance doesn’t wear a party label. It doesn’t show up with signs. But it shows up in every delay, every deflection, every denial of change. It insists that any step forward is a threat, and any new neighbor is a burden.
That’s the quiet mission of the No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition: preserve everything, change nothing, and hope the math works out.
A few months after moving in, our property tax assessment shot up —a financial shock that felt less like a welcome and more like a warning. It didn’t take long to understand what was happening. And it’s happening across Connecticut.
Woodbridge isn’t failing – it’s choosing not to grow. Choosing to keep the door barely open. Choosing exclusion — quietly, structurally — and passing the cost onto the very people it claims to welcome.  
Some in our community love this town so much, they’ve tried to freeze it in time. But protectionism is exclusion. 
I don’t question the motives. I question the outcome. A town that refuses to grow doesn’t stay the same. It just shifts the burden—until fewer people can afford to stay, and fewer still can come at all.
Rejecting growth didn’t pause our bills. It blocked our ability to spread them fairly—across a broader, stronger, more diverse community already knocking at the door.
That’s not preservation. It’s exclusion. And it’s expensive.
I didn’t come to radically change Woodbridge. I came here because I believed in its promise – a promise now at risk. Not just for newcomers like me, but for longtime residents who want their kids nearby, for seniors who want to downsize without leaving, and for families who want a future here, not just a past. 
At a recent Democratic Town Committee meeting, I overheard someone share a story: their grown child had expressed frustration that they couldn’t afford to come back home —to buy a house in the very town they grew up in. That’s not just a loss for one family. It’s a quiet warning for us all.
To those who fear that growth will change the character of our towns, I ask: isn’t it already changing?
When longtime neighbors can’t afford to stay?
When their children can’t afford to return?
When young families can’t afford to come?
When tax hikes on a frozen grand list become the only tool left?
You don’t have to have all the answers. You don’t need to be an expert in zoning or budgets to know that this isn’t working for everyone. Even if you’re just starting to ask the questions—there’s room for you in our movement for a fair and affordable Connecticut.
The cost of exclusion is high, but the cost of letting it define our future is even higher.
The No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition may be loud. But they are not the majority. It’s time for those of us who believe in fairness, in inclusive growth, and in towns that welcome —not withhold— to speak up, to act, to lead.
Let’s build better Connecticut communities —169 united for growth and opportunity—so that working people, young families, seniors, and longtime residents alike can belong and grow together. That’s how we take down the invisible curtain of exclusion.
We can build a future that includes all of us. Everyone has a role, and I want to build with you.
And so should Lamont.",,,,2025-06-27 00:58:58.051514

Ned Lamont’s decision to veto the bill that would have extended unemployment benefits to workers engaged in a labor strike. 
We thank the Governor for recognizing the concerns of Connecticut’s business community and for prioritizing the long-term stability of the state’s economic and workforce systems.
Connecticut’s unemployment trust fund is funded entirely by businesses. Expanding eligibility to include striking workers would increase costs for employers across the state at a time when many are still recovering from the economic disruptions of recent years. These added costs would be especially difficult for small and mid-sized businesses, as well as other employers that already operate on thin margins.
Throughout this process, chambers of commerce, trade associations, and business organizations from across the state came together to express their shared concern about the bill’s impact. Our message was consistent and collaborative: any changes to the unemployment system must be made carefully and with full consideration of the economic ripple effects on local employers.
Governor Lamont’s decision reflects that understanding. By maintaining the integrity of the unemployment insurance program, his veto sends a signal that Connecticut is committed to a strong, stable economic climate that supports both workers and the employers who create jobs and opportunity.
The Greater New Haven Chamber remains focused on advancing policies that strengthen our region’s economy, support innovation and growth, and ensure that Connecticut is a competitive and welcoming place to do business. We look forward to continued dialogue with state leaders on ways to support our workforce, grow our economy, and build shared prosperity for the long term.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed four bills into law on Tuesday, including two related to child care, one addressing big-game hunting, and one that updates the state’s insurance laws.
Senate Bill 96 creates a tax credit program that rewards companies that offer child care programs for their workers. 
Senate Bill 95 raises the income limit for families eligible to receive state child care aid, expanding the number of people who may receive it. It also allows the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development to distribute grants to the highest-quality child care centers in the state, as determined by whether a center is part of the state’s ranked system.
The Legislature passed both bills last year, but each were stymied by a lawsuit that challenged the way that lawmakers combined bills in an effort to pass them more speedily. The Alaska Constitution limits bills to a single subject.
The governor’s signature on Senate Bill 97 creates a hunting concession program for big-game hunting guides. The federal government already sells hunting concessions on federal land, and SB 97, drafted with the help of the state’s Big Game Commercial Services Board, implements a similar system for state land.
Dunleavy also signed Senate Bill 132, the state’s omnibus insurance bill. That lengthy measure includes changes to the way the state handles pharmacy benefit managers, middlemen who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurance plans.
The bill also expands the types of health insurance that employers can offer their workers, requires financial reporting by insurers, includes consumer protection improvements and makes changes for nonresident insurance adjusters in Alaska.

Though Utah Sen. Mike Lee scaled back his public lands sale proposal, protesters gathered in Cheyenne to demand Wyoming's congressional delegation oppose the plan.
The post Public lands rally draws large, varied crowd to Wyoming statehouse appeared first on WyoFile .","Though broad pushback already drove Utah Sen. Mike Lee to scale back his public lands sell-off proposal for the Republicans’ big budget bill, a large and boisterous crowd still gathered Thursday evening in front of the Wyoming State Capitol to send the message “not for sale.”  
The group of hunters, anglers, snowmobilers, hikers, wildland firefighters and scientific researchers numbered well into the hundreds and was likely one of the largest protest groups to gather at the statehouse in recent years. The high turnout in Cheyenne showcased what Lee’s proposal has once again reminded the West — selling off public lands sparks fierce political opposition. 
Though organized by Democratic state representative Karlee Provenza and other well-known Wyoming progressives, a handful of attendees told WyoFile they were conservative voters outraged at the land sale. 
“I’d like to thank Sen. Mike Lee for bringing us all together,” Provenza told the crowd. “I’m just kidding,” she continued, “let’s boo that son of a bitch.” 
And so the crowd did, loudly.
After initially pushing a sale that could have topped more than 3 million acres across 11 western states, Lee stripped U.S. Forest Service lands from his proposal and refocused it on Bureau of Land Management parcels within 5 miles of cities and towns. Lee has described the sale as a measure to boost the construction of affordable housing. His bill language was light on enforcement requirements for affordability, however. Lee’s longtime crusade to trim down the amount of federal land in the country also made his suggestion that the sale could mitigate a housing shortage difficult to swallow for his opponents. 

Rep. Karlee Provenza, D-Laramie, leads the crowd at a Thursday rally for public lands in a chant, while leaving a voicemail for U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman. 
Conservation groups, hook-and-bullet advocacy organizations and other opponents are watching this week to see whether Lee’s new language will pass muster with the Senate Parliamentarian, a legislative referee of sorts who has been ruling on what measures can and can’t go into the budget bill. 
The parliamentarian rejected Lee’s previous proposal.
In Cheyenne, rally goers listened as speakers described the bond Wyomingites have to public lands — whether that’s the iconic peaks and canyons or the parcels close to town that give the state its unique character. Those latter lands are the ones Lee now seeks to put on the chopping block, some speakers said. 
David Wilms, a former staff member for Republican Gov. Matt Mead who now works as an attorney for the National Wildlife Federation, said Lee would sell off plots of land where young kids catch their first string of trout and new hunters bag their first deer. Though Lee may have backed off the more drastic sale, Wilms urged public land advocates to keep up the fight both for the length of the current debate and beyond. 
“He only needs to win once,” Wilms said of Lee. “We need to win every time.” 
Among the crowd was James Schick, a Cheyenne pharmacist who said he considers himself an independent voter but leans more conservative than liberal. He criticized Lee for trying to ram policy with such intense public interest into law through a budget bill that Republicans in control of Washington, D.C. see as a must-pass measure. 
“We need to have these types of conversations in a reasonable and gracious manner,” Schick said. “Don’t try to force an agenda that is industry-based, it seems like, on our public land.” 
Another attendee held a sign that said, “if there was ever a hill to die on, it’s a public land hill.” He declined to share his name with WyoFile, saying he worked in government and did not want to face reprisal. But he described himself as feeling betrayed by Sen. John Barrasso after backing the Casper doctor in every campaign he’s mounted. 
“Apparently, Barrasso, [Sen. Cynthia] Lummis and [Rep.] Harriet Hageman back this,” he said, “because Hageman said ‘don’t worry your wildernesses, your national parks, your national monuments, you can still hunt and fish them.’ Well, who hunts on wildernesses but tourists? Outfitters take tourists into the wilderness. I’m not going to pack my kid 14 miles in for his first [deer]. This is Wyoming, are you kidding me?” 
Under Lee’s original proposal, designations like national parks and wildlife refuges were exempted from sale. Though Wyoming’s congressional delegation has not explicitly backed Lee’s proposal in public comments, they have not criticized it either, and all have expressed support for some level of federal land sell-off. 
At the rally, Provenza and other speakers called on Wyoming’s congressional delegation to push back explicitly on Lee to keep the public lands surrounding Wyoming towns intact.
“Why the hell is Harriet Hageman, or John Barrasso or Cynthia Lummis not with us here today?” she asked.

The state’s minimum wage increased to $11.91 this month and will rise to $13 in July. (Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The minimum wage will increase in 15 states and cities in July, though lawmakers in other states have worked to slow down wage hikes.
Wage floor increases beginning July 1 in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will benefit more than 880,000 workers by collectively raising their earnings by more than $397 million, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
In Alaska, the $11.91 minimum wage will increase to $13 per hour. Oregon’s $14.70 standard figure will rise to $15.05 (the state has separate rates for urban and nonurban counties). And the $17.50 minimum in the District of Columbia will move to $17.95.
Another dozen cities will see minimum wage increases this summer, including Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Currently, 30 states and D.C. have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
In many states, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted upward as inflation rises. But voters in several states last year elected to significantly increase their minimum wages.

The institute noted that lawmakers have pushed to “water down” some of those voter initiatives.
In Missouri, for example, voters approved a November measure to mandate paid sick time for many workers and boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026, with future hikes tied to inflation. But lawmakers in May eliminated the sick leave requirement and nixed the inflation adjustment, meaning the minimum wage will not automatically increase as voters approved.
“Our side of the aisle has great concern for the burden that this would place on businesses,” Missouri Senate Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican, said in May about the ballot measure, “and if we’re going to promote economic growth and jobs, we need to really be cognizant of that.”
Similarly, Nebraska lawmakers this year aimed to cap future wage increases approved by voters in a 2022 ballot measure. That legislation failed to advance.
Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a national network of business owners and executives, said in a Thursday news release that increased minimum wages are good for employees and businesses alike.
Steven Dyme, CEO of Flowers for Dreams, said higher base wages encourage low-wage workers to spend more locally. The flower store has locations in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.
“Building our business with living wages has ensured the best floral talent, a product quality that’s truly cared for, and a trusting customer base,” he said in the news release.

The injunction only applies to employees of the Division of Labor Standards and Statistics within the state’s labor department, which is directed by lead plaintiff Scott Moss. 
The lawsuit alleged that disclosing the data would violate a state law against data sharing with ICE unless it is for a criminal investigation or under a judge-signed subpoena. Two unions that represent state employees, Colorado WINS and AFL-CIO, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

“Judge Jones has protected these state workers by blocking this order that would have implicated them in breaking a state law,” Diane Byrne, president of Colorado WINS, said at a press conference at the Colorado Capitol Thursday. “This protection is critical, especially when these orders come from your boss, and in this case, the governor himself.” 
Byrne said the union asked Polis in a letter Thursday “to confirm that he will not direct any state employees to assist with the search or production of personal identifying information” to comply with the ICE subpoena. 
“Once we get that confirmation in, we will celebrate this as a victory for all state workers and for all workers in Colorado, because it will demonstrate that the law can protect you, even when dealing with the biggest boss in the state,” Byrne said. 
The letter, written by Colorado WINS executive director Hilary Glasgow, says that while the “preliminary injunction pertains to employees of the Division of Labor‬ Standards and Statistics, it is clear that if it is a violation of the statute for these employees to comply with the subpoena, the same holds true for all state employees.”
“ICE is violating human rights every minute. The governor should be stopping this horrific behavior, not facilitating it,” Dennis Dougherty, executive director of the Colorado AFL-CIO, said. “We are disappointed that this had to go to court … to shed light on this illegal coordination. Had a brave state employee not come forward, these caregivers and children would have been rounded up, possibly violently, and had their lives destroyed while Coloradans didn’t know anything about it.” 
Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said in a statement that the governor’s office is reviewing the court’s preliminary ruling as well as the letter from Colorado WINS. 
“Governor Polis remains committed to fully and promptly cooperating with federal criminal investigations into child trafficking and exploitation, while protecting unaccompanied children in Colorado,” Wieman said. “We hope that if information is needed for criminal investigations, going forward, (ICE investigators) will provide subpoenas for state information consistent with this ruling to ensure prompt processing.”
Colorado in recent years has enacted state laws, including legislation Polis, a Democrat, signed in 2021 and earlier this year, that limit the sharing of data about immigrants with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Byrne said state employees are concerned about retaliation if they report that they were asked to comply with the ICE subpoena. Laura Wolf, a lawyer who represents Moss in the case, said it’s likely that other state employees were asked to produce records for the subpoena, and plaintiffs created a website where those employees can report their experiences, even anonymously if desired. 
Wolf said the governor’s office provided no notice to the people listed in the subpoena that their information would be turned over to ICE. 
“The court said that it would be ‘very problematic’ if they were to ever turn over this information to ICE without first notifying these individuals so they could assert their rights, and that is a huge victory,” Wolf said. “And we need to be sure everyone in this state knows and that the governor knows that he is required to notify these individuals and can no longer act in the shadows, behind the scenes, in darkness, and instead needs to inform people before he hands over personal identifying information for deportation efforts.”
The ICE subpoena, which was not signed by a judge, seeks personal information, such as addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and employment history, on the sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant children, purportedly in order to check on the children’s welfare and investigate any potential child abuse. Polis decided to comply with the subpoena in late May after some deliberation. His lawyers argued that complying with the subpoena was permissible under a criminal-investigation exception in state law, though the subpoena does not mention a specific investigation.
State Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat who sponsored both laws adding protections for immigrants, said Colorado law “has been tested,” so government employees around the state should say something if they see a potential violation. 
“This law is meant to ensure that prior to any personally identifying information (being) shared with any federal agency for the purposes of immigration enforcement, that they go talk to a judge,” Gonzales said. “That they go get a warrant. That the administrative subpoena that happened to mention the word ‘criminal’ or ‘crime’ doesn’t cut it.”
State Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat who sponsored the 2025 law strengthening protections for immigrants, said ICE’s job is not to ensure child welfare, so if there are actual child welfare concerns, the state should use the appropriate channels and state agencies to do so.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Australian company seeking to develop a large oil discovery on Alaska’s North Slope may be purchased by a consortium based in Abu Dhabi.
Santos Ltd. announced earlier this month that XRG PJSC, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., has made a buyout offer. Terms are still being negotiated.
The value of the proposed deal is $36 billion, including Santos’ debt.
Santos is one of Australia’s oldest and biggest oil and gas companies. It has operations in Australia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Timor-Leste – and in Alaska, where it owns 51% of the Pikka prospect on the western North Slope and is the project’s operator. Repsol, based in Spain, owns 49%.
Pikka, if developed, would produce up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day, according to Santos. The field holds about 400 million barrels of oil, and Santos in 2022 issued its formal approval to proceed to project development. The capital cost was estimated at $2.6 billion at the time.
Pikka is located near the ConocoPhillips-operated projects within the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Pikka and ConocoPhillips’ huge Willow project, which is in development, are both connected to the Nanushuk geologic formation, a layer of oil-bearing rock underlying areas of the central and western North Slope.
Aside from its share of Pikka, Santos has part ownership of another oil property on the North Slope. It owns a 25% share of the Sockeye prospect on the eastern North Slope, where operator and 50% owner APA Corp. made a discovery that was announced in March.
If the acquisition by XRG PJSC goes through, the impacts to the Alaska projects are yet to be determined.
State officials have been following the process.
John Boyle, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, by email: “The Department of Natural Resources sees new entrants/investors into Alaska’s oil and gas sector as a positive development.”
There were reports last year about efforts by Santos and Repsol to sell some shares of their Alaska holdings. 
In Australia, the idea of Santos being acquired by an Abu Dhabi company has created some controversy. Government and labor union officials there have raised concerns about the takeover, with one regional government proposing some conditions on the transaction.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The minimum wage will increase in 15 states and cities in July, though lawmakers in other states have worked to slow down wage hikes.
Wage floor increases beginning July 1 in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will benefit more than 880,000 workers by collectively raising their earnings by more than $397 million, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
In Alaska, the $11.91 minimum wage will increase to $13 per hour. Oregon’s $14.70 standard figure will rise to $15.05 (the state has separate rates for urban and nonurban counties). And the $17.50 minimum in the District of Columbia will move to $17.95.
Another dozen cities will see minimum wage increases this summer, including Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Currently, 30 states and D.C. have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
In many states, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted upward as inflation rises. But voters in several states last year elected to significantly increase their minimum wages.

The institute noted that lawmakers have pushed to “water down” some of those voter initiatives.
In Missouri, for example, voters approved a November measure to mandate paid sick time for many workers and boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026, with future hikes tied to inflation. But lawmakers in May eliminated the sick leave requirement and nixed the inflation adjustment, meaning the minimum wage will not automatically increase as voters approved.
“Our side of the aisle has great concern for the burden that this would place on businesses,” Missouri Senate Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican, said in May about the ballot measure, “and if we’re going to promote economic growth and jobs, we need to really be cognizant of that.”
Similarly, Nebraska lawmakers this year aimed to cap future wage increases approved by voters in a 2022 ballot measure. That legislation failed to advance.
Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a national network of business owners and executives, said in a Thursday news release that increased minimum wages are good for employees and businesses alike.
Steven Dyme, CEO of Flowers for Dreams, said higher base wages encourage low-wage workers to spend more locally. The flower store has locations in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.
“Building our business with living wages has ensured the best floral talent, a product quality that’s truly cared for, and a trusting customer base,” he said in the news release.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Attorneys for the North Dakota Legislature on Thursday rebuked an attorney general’s opinion of a veto error and outlined possible next steps, which could include a special legislative session or legal challenges.
Lawmakers asked Legislative Council to research options after an error with a line-item veto Gov. Kelly Armstrong issued May 19 in the budget for the state Industrial Commission. 
Armstrong’s veto message said he objected to a $150,000 one-time grant for a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. But his staff also crossed out $25 million for housing projects and programs and $10 million to combat homelessness in a bill markup, which he later said he did not intend to veto.
Armstrong asked Attorney General Drew Wrigley for his office’s opinion on whether the veto message would be considered the official document instead of the marked-up bill.
Wrigley found that the unintentional markup does not change the substance of the veto because Armstrong’s written veto message was “clear and unambiguous” about what parts of Senate Bill 2014 he intended to cut.
Lawmakers and the governor agree that the $35 million should be spent, but legislators are worried about the precedent that would be set and possible future implications.
North Dakota governor’s veto ‘clear and unambiguous,’ attorney general says

Emily Thompson, legal division director for the Legislative Council, pushed back on the findings of the attorney general’s office in a new memo presented to the Legislative Management Committee Thursday.
The analysis called the attorney general’s opinion inconsistent with the state constitution, judicial precedent, a previous attorney general’s opinion and the practice of former governors.
Thompson pointed out that Wrigley’s opinion did not mention the most recent North Dakota Supreme Court precedent that involved a similar issue with former Gov. Doug Burgum. 
In that case, the court stated the governor may strike words or numbers while exercising a veto, but may not insert them. Thompson argued Wrigley’s opinion is in direct contrast to the court’s ruling.
She said the opinion sets a precedent allowing the governor and attorney general to come to an agreement on what the governor intended to veto. Thompson said future governors could write extremely vague veto letters.
“You have more or less two members of the executive branch determining what was or wasn’t vetoed based on the agreement on what that intent was,” she said.
The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to requests for comment Thursday on the new Legislative Council memo. Wrigley previously said Legislative Council has no role in determining the exercising authority of the governor’s veto.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said he and House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, plan to talk to Wrigley about the opinion.
“I assume there’s no prohibition on us going to the attorney general and saying, ‘Are you sure?’” Hogue said.
The $35 million in housing funds are set to be disbursed as soon as Tuesday when the new fiscal year begins. Armstrong said in a news release after Wrigley’s opinion was issued that the $35 million “will be disbursed as approved.” 
‘Prudent remedy’ for veto error is special session, Legislative Council advises

Lawmakers questioned how the full $35 million could advance when Armstrong said he intended to veto $150,000 of that.
“That’s a headscratcher,” Hogue said.
Lawmakers directed Legislative Council to do additional research over the next seven days to help them determine next steps. Thompson presented some options to legislators:

Lawmakers could petition the North Dakota Supreme Court to review the matter. 
Lawmakers could call themselves back into session and consider overriding the governor’s veto. That would require a two-thirds majority vote of elected members in each chamber.
Lawmakers could do nothing and allow Wrigley’s opinion to stand as precedent. Legislators said they could consider new legislation in 2027 to clarify the governor’s veto powers.

A special session of the Legislature costs about $65,000 per day, according to Legislative Council. However, members of the Legislative Council said attorney’s fees for a court case could rise to that level or surpass it.
Lawmakers did not make a decision Thursday but appeared inclined to take some kind of action.
“We’re dealing with the separation of powers, which is a really important thing,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg.
Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, said legislative leaders hope lawmakers won’t have to return to Bismarck for a special session. But he also recognizes the importance of protecting the Legislature’s authority.
“Some things were ignored in the opinion,” Weisz said. “It’s up to us to make sure that we keep our authority as the Legislature and we need to understand what the governor is vetoing and not have to rely on, ‘OK, what did he veto? Well, I guess the AG will tell us what he vetoed.’ It’s not the way it’s supposed to work.”

(Screenshot)The Republican primary for Kentucky’s open U.S. Senate seat just got more crowded. 
Nate Morris, a Lexington businessman who founded waste and recycling company Rubicon, announced his candidacy in a 20-minute interview on Donald Trump Jr.’s “Triggered” podcast Thursday evening. 
“After careful reflection and prayer talking to my wife, Jane, I’ve decided to run for the United States Senate to replace Mitch McConnell here in Kentucky, and finally, bring this seat back to the people,” Morris said. 
Morris joins a Republican field that already includes U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and former Attorney General Daniel Cameron. They announced their candidacies earlier this year after longtime U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell announced he would not seek reelection in 2026. 
In his podcast appearance with Republican President Donald Trump’s son, Morris carved himself out as the total opposite of McConnell, who is also the longest serving U.S. Senate party leader. 
“Well, everyone has an expiration, Don, they have an expiration date, just like the things you find at the grocery store or anywhere else, and Mitch McConnell has hung around way too long,” Morris told the president’s son. “And I think your father put it best: The stench of Mitch has been something that you cannot ignore.” 
Morris added that McConnell is the “final boss” for the president to defeat. McConnell and the president have clashed in the past, but as the Senate Republican leader, McConnell paved the way for Trump’s federal judiciary appointments, including floor votes for three key Supreme Court appointments. 
 During the podcast, Morris tried to hitch his primary opponents to McConnell’s legacy. Cameron, who was often referred to as a McConnell protege during the 2023 governor’s race, “completely botched” that election, Morris said. As for Barr, Morris highlighted a recent TV interview in which he referred to McConnell as a mentor, and the podcast also aired that video clip. 
Barr quickly released Thursday evening statements attacking Morris’ campaign, saying he did not support the president in the 2024 presidential primary. 
“Nate Morris is pretending to be MAGA now, but he can’t run from all the liberal trash in his past,” Barr said. “Kentucky conservatives won’t fall for this fraud.”
Barr also tied himself to the president, pointing out that he was the state chair for Trump’s campaign in the 2024 primary.
“When I’m in the Senate, I’ll be President Trump’s biggest ally. Others in this race have opposed the President in the past and give lip service to supporting him now. I am the only candidate in this race who has a proven track record of actually delivering for President Trump and our America First movement.” 
Cameron’s campaign pushed a website it launched, FakeNate.com, to criticize Morris’ record, particularly on the 2024 primary and his business record. 
“Nate is an America First pretender trying to pull the wool over your eyes. Nate’s money might buy him likes on social media, but we’re not going to let him buy him an election,” the Cameron campaign said. 
The three Republican candidates have been courting President Trump’s endorsement for months. Cameron had the president’s backing in the 2023 governor’s race before losing to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Barr has repeatedly voiced support for Trump’s agenda. Morris himself has been included in a recent White House press release. 
Trump Jr. said Morris has “a very similar sort of life story to JD Vance,” the vice president from Ohio who has ties to Appalachian Kentucky. Morris’ family is from Morgan County, he was raised by a single mother and he looked up to his grandfather, who was the head of the local auto union, according to his website. Morris said that he and Vance became “very fast friends” because of their backgrounds. 
On the Democratic side, Kentucky House Minority Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, has mounted a campaign to run for U.S. Senate. In 2023, she was the Democratic nominee for attorney general but lost to Republican Russell Coleman.

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle Charges against a Spanish-language journalist who was arrested while covering a protest in metro Atlanta earlier this month have been dropped, though he continues to face potential deportation.
Mario Guevara, who is originally from El Salvador, was arrested at a June 14 protest held to demonstrate opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration policies. He was charged with unlawful assembly, obstruction of a law enforcement officer and improperly entering a roadway, all of which are misdemeanors. 
DeKalb County Solicitor-General Donna Coleman-Stribling announced Wednesday that her office has dismissed those charges.
A review of the video evidence showed that Guevara was generally in compliance with the directives of law enforcement agencies at the protest and did not appear to intend to disregard any of those directives, according to a press release from Coleman-Stribling’s office.
“After carefully reviewing the evidence, including video evidence surrounding his arrest, I have determined that while there was probable cause to support the initial arrest, the evidence is insufficient to sustain a prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said in a statement.
Guevara was wearing a vest marking him as a member of the press when he was arrested. He can also be heard on his livestream of the protest identifying himself as a reporter to law enforcement.
Guevara’s arrest and detainment has alarmed First Amendment defenders. The Committee to Protect Journalists and other free press advocates sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem urging her to facilitate Guevara’s release.
Guevara has lived in the U.S. for about 20 years. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported that Guevara has work authorization and the ability to gain a green card through his son, who is a U.S. citizen, but Guevara does not have permanent legal status here. 
He is currently being held at the Folkston Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center in South Georgia.
“This El Salvador national is in ICE custody because he entered the country illegally in 2004,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement.
In the same statement, McLaughlin encouraged anyone here illegally to “take control of their departure.” The Trump administration is offering people $1,000 and a free flight to self-deport.
Guevara’s attorney did not respond to a message seeking comment Thursday. But the attorney, Giovanni Díaz, told Atlanta Civic Circle that he is optimistic Guevara will secure a bond when he appears before a federal immigration judge for a hearing set for Tuesday.
Diaz also told Atlanta Civic Circle that he is trying to get additional unrelated charges in Gwinnett County dismissed. Guevara was charged with distracted driving, failure to obey a traffic control device and reckless driving while filming ICE activity there, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.
Guevara was one of 29 people arrested at the DeKalb County protest on June 14.
DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson issued the findings from an internal review done on the handling of the protest. She noted the protest was one of three held that day in DeKalb County as thousands of Georgians turned out for “No Kings” events, though the protest where Guevara and others were arrested was not affiliated with the national movement.
“We’ve heard from residents over the past week, especially members of our immigrant community, who are hurt, angry, and scared,” Cochran-Johnson said in a statement. “I want to acknowledge that pain. The right to protest, to speak out, and to be treated with dignity. In DeKalb County, we remain deeply committed to those values.”

Increasing egg imports, enhancing biosecurity, researching vaccine options and providing financial relief to farmers were all elements of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ plan to combat HPAI and lower the cost of eggs. 
Rollins said her five-pronged plan “has worked,” noting a 64% drop in wholesale egg prices and more than 900 completed biosecurity assessments at poultry farms across the country. 
Rollins announced the $1 billion plan to combat the bird flu in February after three years of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu had eliminated nearly 170 million poultry birds and caused domestic egg prices to skyrocket.

From January 2024 to June 2024, the U.S. imported around 2.36 million shell eggs and just over 9.2 million egg products, according to an egg markets report from USDA. 
The USDA release said the U.S. had imported more than 26 million shell eggs, by the dozen, from Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, Turkey, and South Korea and imported an additional 14 million egg products, measured in dozen shell-egg equivalents since January 2025. 
A USDA egg market report from May showed the majority, 57% of imported shell eggs came from the nation of Türkiye. 
The USDA press release said the efforts to increase imports have helped to “bolster domestic supply” and said by comparison, domestic egg production in 2024 totaled 109 billion eggs. 
Iowa remains the top egg producing state in the country and to date has lost more than 29 million birds associated with commercial table egg production impacted by HPAI, according to data from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
Biosecurity improvements 
As part of Rollins’ plan, producers could have free biosecurity assessments at their facilities and receive USDA assistance for biosecurity improvements. 
According to the release from USDA, nearly 1,000 facilities have received the assessments, including 162 facilities in Iowa. 

Producers can email poultry.biosecurity@usda.gov or call 844-820-2234 to request these assessments.

Iowa ranked second on the list of states with the highest number of biosecurity assessments, behind Ohio at 214 assessments and above Pennsylvania at 144, Indiana at 129 and Missouri at 80 assessments. 
Of the assessments completed, 372 have looked at wildlife biosecurity according to APHIS.
Rollins encouraged poultry producers to utilize the free assessments before the fall when wild bird migration will increase the potential for bird flu outbreaks. 
“While we are proud that over 900 biosecurity assessments have been conducted to date, resources remain available, and we are urging poultry farmers of all sizes to get your assessments done today before a potentially challenging fall,” Rollins said in the release. 
USDA has paid farmers more than $70 million to replenish their flocks since February when USDA increased the indemnity values available to producers with layer flocks affected by HPAI.  
The department also announced a grant challenge opportunity in March for research projects to support HPAI prevention, therapeutics, and potential vaccines. The Thursday release said the department received requests for more than $793 million in funding and the awards will be finalized in the fall. 
“When President Trump entered office, the cost of eggs was at a record high, seriously denting consumers’ wallets after years of awful inflation,” Rollins said in her statement. “On my first day as secretary, we got to work to implement a five-pronged strategy to improve biosecurity on the farm and lower egg prices on grocery store shelves. The plan has worked, and families are seeing relief with egg prices driving food deflation in the April Consumer Price Index.”

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)A political committee that helped defeat last year’s ballot measure to repeal a Washington climate law was fined $20,000 on Thursday for not disclosing how it spent $1 million until after the election.
The state Public Disclosure Commission levied the civil penalty on Green Jobs PAC, which admitted to the violation and two other breaches of Washington campaign finance laws as part of an agreed upon settlement.
On a 4-0 vote, commissioners imposed the civil penalty of $20,000. It suspended half the sum as long as $10,000 is paid in 30 days and the group does not commit any more violations in the next four years. 
“This was a serious error,” said Dmitri Iglitzin, attorney for the political committee whose major donors were bp America and Amazon. But, he told commissioners, there was no “intent to deceive. It was the classic definition of a ministerial screw-up.”
Green Jobs PAC opposed Initiative 2117, which sought to repeal the Climate Commitment Act. That’s the state law that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by requiring companies and others to buy allowances for their air pollution. 
The repeal measure was the handiwork of Let’s Go Washington, a conservative political committee founded and funded by hedge fund manager Brian Heywood. In November, nearly 62% of voters rejected the initiative.
Green Jobs raised and spent $3.2 million during the campaign. Its largest donors were petroleum giant bp America, which gave $2 million, and Amazon, which put in $1 million.
It was one of four major committees that collectively shelled out $26 million to oppose the statewide measure.
Three weeks after the election, Let’s Go Washington filed a complaint alleging Green Jobs violated disclosure rules.
The commission investigation found that in mid-October, as campaigning crescendoed, the political committee spent nearly $1.1 million on mailings and commercials. But a report detailing the expenditures due Oct. 29 did not get filed until Nov. 13, days after the election. That was the major violation.
Staff also concluded Green Jobs did not provide requisite information on its sub-vendors and did not make clear on six monthly reports that its purpose was to oppose the initiative.
Assistant Attorney General Susie Giles-Klein told commissioners the violations were serious because they deprived voters of important information before the election. But she said there was no evidence the actions were intentional and noted the committee’s leaders amended the reports to comply without prompting from the commission.
The fine imposed Thursday is the same amount levied against Let’s Go Washington last fall after the commission concluded that the group failed to report spending by sub-vendors involved in gathering signatures for Initiative 2117 and five other statewide measures in 2023.
Before voting on the settlement with Green Jobs, Commissioner Douglass North voiced concern that the fine, while sizable, was becoming “a cost of doing business for large campaigns” whose employees should know how to follow the state’s campaign finance laws.
In recent months, the commission has fined Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW for late reporting of contributions to candidates and AARP for not disclosing contributions it received for its campaign against a statewide initiative to make a long-term care benefit program voluntary.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ballots-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 20:04:28.714674

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Republicans in the House and Senate narrowly passed the New Hampshire budget Thursday, overcoming weeks of disagreement with Gov. Kelly Ayotte over spending priorities and sending her an amended document that resolved some of her concerns.
The budget, passed in two bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, would spend $15.9 billion over two years, a $700 million increase from the last biennium. Republicans hailed it as a responsible reaction to a difficult environment for state business tax revenues. Yet it fell short of the spending Ayotte had originally proposed in February and reduced funding to some programs championed by Democrats. 
Ayotte praised the final package Thursday and said she would sign it.
“Today, we delivered on our promise by protecting our most vulnerable, creating an even brighter future for our children, and standing up for those who have made our state the safest in the nation,” Ayotte said. She raised the budget’s continued funding of Medicaid and the developmental disability waitlist, the “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban in schools, reforms to speed up state permitting of housing construction, and the universal expansion of education freedom accounts to all income levels. 
But Democrats condemned it, pointing to a series of “back-of-the-budget” cuts to state agencies and some layoffs, the introduction of premiums for Medicaid recipients, and the expansion of education freedom accounts, which they said were unnecessary and expensive.
“It raises costs on everyday Granite Staters while padding the pockets of the privileged few,” said House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson, at a press conference after the votes. 
The process laid bare some divisions among New Hampshire Republicans over fiscal policy at a time of tighter economic conditions. 
In order to head to Ayotte’s desk, the two-year spending agreement first had to overcome a challenge from a faction of conservative House Republicans that nearly doomed it. HB 1 was initially voted down by the House Thursday afternoon, prompting the body to pass a continuing resolution to keep government running, before it was resuscitated. The dissenting Republicans, led by Rep. Mike Belcher, of Wakefield, objected to the increases in state spending over the previous year’s biennium.
Other Republicans said it was the best package possible.
“This bill is too huge to please everybody,” said Rep. Ken Weyler, a Kingston Republican and the chairman of the House Finance Committee. “There’s things I don’t like in it. There’s things I love in it. That’s the way every budget bill has been in all of the 15 budget bills I’ve worked on.”

A pivotal compromise
The final budget agreement came after both chambers passed a compromise amendment designed to address concerns by Ayotte — and to smooth over a public disagreement between the governor and Senate President Sharon Carson. 
The compromise satisfies two out of three of the issues Ayotte raised last week, when she vowed to veto the budget if it weren’t changed. It restores funding to the Manchester School District for the next two years by pushing back the start date of a cap on that funding to 2027. It brings back much of Ayotte’s preferred changes to retirement benefits for a group of police officers and firefighters whose benefits were reduced in 2011 to address a deficit in the state’s pension fund.
Carson, who as a senator helped craft the 2011 change, argued it was a necessary reduction to move the retirement system toward solvency and prevent “spiking,” in which employees are incentivized to work more overtime in the final years of their career to boost their retirement income.
Ayotte said the change had shortchanged people who were relying on a certain level of retirement benefit and that those people should be made financially whole.
In the end, the compromise agreement included some provisions to prevent spiking while also improving benefits for those eligible by instituting a more generous calculation method for employees’ compensation. 
“Certainly, we all want to recognize the contribution our first responders make to the state,” Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican, said on the Senate floor. “But we also want to do it responsibly. I believe that this amendment accomplishes those goals.”
The compromise does not, however, take out a $51 million back-of-the-budget cut to the Department of Health and Human Services. That cut requires the commissioner of the department to choose which programs or personnel might be reduced or eliminated in order to adjust for the funding decrease, and it was one that Ayotte had opposed.
While the Senate passed the compromise bill easily, some in the House had qualms with the increase in spending for retirees. 
Speaking to his colleagues, Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican, sought to assuage those concerns. McGuire said that while he does not like the additional spending that goes to Group II in the compromise, he saw it as necessary to save the underlying budget, which he said was a good agreement.
“I prefer the Group II language in the committee of conference report on House Bill 2,” McGuire said. “But I know that in order for House Bill 2 as a whole to pass, this bill is going to have to pass as well, and House Bill 2 and House Bill 1 are $15 billion and lots and lots of policy. And this bill … it’s important, but it’s not everything.”

A rebellion over spending
Democrats raised a host of objections to the budget. They argued the Medicaid premiums amounted to an income tax on low-income families, that the budget did not send enough to public schools, and that it cut out potential funding to child care and affordable housing initiatives. 
“Granite Staters have asked us for housing, for child care, to lower their monthly health care bills and utility bills, and this budget does almost nothing for any of this,” said Senate Minority Leader Rebecca Perkins Kwoka at a press conference after the budget passed. “It’s going to make life less affordable in New Hampshire.”
Meanwhile, some of the sharpest disagreements within the House Republican caucus centered on accusations it spent too much. In a speech urging fiscal conservatives to vote down the budget, Belcher said the increasing spending would eventually lead to authoritarianism.
“Does this bill continue to increase spending another 7% over the last biennium, which itself was about a 20% increase over the one before it, inevitably spending us down over time toward that decline to tyranny? Yes, it does so,” Belcher said. 
House representatives initially voted down House Bill 1, the spending bill, 183-182. Anticipating the spending proposals to no longer be viable, the House also passed a continuing resolution that had been proposed by the Senate. 
Had that continuing resolution taken effect, state agencies would have been authorized to continue operating at 90 percent their current spending rates for the next six months. And lawmakers would be forced to negotiate through the summer on a new spending package.
Weyler, a fiscal conservative, urged his colleagues against that outcome, and said those on the right should not destroy the budget to achieve their aims.
“There were three things that I really wanted in the times I’ve spent in this Legislature,” he said. “Each of them took 10 years, and that’s what you have to do. You have to have patience and you have to have persistence. If there’s something you really want to get changed, it doesn’t happen the first time it’s filed. So if there’s something in this budget you didn’t like, don’t kill the budget over it.”

Their accounts raise potential legal questions about the government’s operation.,"The masked agents pull up quickly. They jump out of unmarked vans or trucks. They wear blue jeans or battle fatigues. They approach Latino men, at times yelling and carrying assault rifles. When someone runs, they’re taken. When they don’t answer a question, they’re taken. When they can’t produce papers, they’re taken. 
Their families won’t know what happened to them. They’ll be shackled, whisked away to another state, forced to subsist for days on potato chips, apples, water, and the occasional cold sandwich. They’ll sleep on the floor with mylar blankets, without access to showers or even working bathrooms. These are not enemy combatants in a war zone, but people living and working in America’s second largest city.
In the last three weeks, federal agents have swarmed Los Angeles County, rounding up 1,600 people where they work, where their children play, where they shop for food. They have driven entire families into hiding. Videos of these encounters, shared on social media, have offered quick, shaky glimpses of the chaos. 
But few details have emerged about what happens to those who are taken. CalMatters spoke with a number of men who were detained on the streets of Los Angeles during the first weekend of the raids. These are the stories three of them told about how they were arrested, how they were treated in government detention and, ultimately, how they were pressured to voluntarily leave the country. 
***
At 3:10 p.m. on Sunday, June 8,  Mauricio Oropeza was waiting for the 33 bus on the corner of Lincoln and Venice boulevards, in Santa Monica. He was headed back from his job cleaning apartment buildings for a maintenance company. It was a two-bus commute, and he was halfway home. 
There were a few other people – three men, a woman and her daughter – waiting for the same bus. No one seemed to know what to make of the truck that suddenly pulled up in front of them, or of the men in jeans and baseball caps that stepped out of the vehicle. One of them was holding a photo of a Latino man with the word “BUSCA” – Spanish for “WANTED” – printed across the top. 
“Have you seen this person?” he asked.  
When two of the commuters began to run, Oropeza did the same. That’s when several Border Patrol vehicles stopped in front of them, he said, and armed men in tactical gear jumped out. One of the agents tripped Oropeza and pinned him to the ground. 
“Don’t resist,” he told him.

The agents took his cell phone and Mexican passport. He was loaded onto one of the vehicles along with the other men from the bus stop, all of them struggling to adjust to their new reality. They would not be going home that night. They would not get to call their families to explain. 
As they drove away, the agents spotted two Latino men walking on the sidewalk. Oropeza said they got on their radio, said “two more,” and then another vehicle peeled off to pursue them. 
***
Less than two hours later and exactly a mile away, Omar Sanchez Lopez left his apartment on Rose Avenue and Lincoln Boulevard, in Venice, with his apron draped over his shoulder. He was on his way to work bussing tables at a nearby Italian restaurant when a Honda Civic pulled into the apartment complex parking lot. Lopez thought the driver, who was in jeans, t-shirt and baseball cap, was there to visit one of his neighbors. But then the man stepped out of the car and approached him. He was holding a piece of paper with photos of four Latino men, and he asked Lopez, in Spanish, “Do you know these people?” 
Lopez, 27, didn’t answer. But the man continued: “Do you speak English? Where do you work? How old are you? Are you a citizen? Do you have papers?”
When Lopez asked, “why are you asking me these questions,” the man pulled out his badge and said, “ICE.”
Lopez thought about turning around to go back inside, but a masked Border Patrol agent got out of the vehicle and told him to put his hands behind his back. Within minutes he was handcuffed and sitting in the back of the car.

“What are you doing in the United States?” he said the agent asked him as they drove away. “It’s not your country.”
Lopez didn’t answer. He looked out the window at the traffic as the sedan pulled him farther and farther away from his home, his family, his life. 
***
By the time Lopez and Oropeza were taken, Juan Flores Morales had been under arrest for more than 24 hours. He had been taking a lunch break on Saturday with three other men on his construction crew, eating a pizza outside the restaurant they were renovating in Inglewood, when masked Border Patrol agents rolled by in a truck.  
Morales felt, for an instant, as though he was paralyzed. “The fear is crazy,” he said. 
Then two agents got out of the vehicle, and Morales, 27, ran into the restaurant. He searched frantically for an escape, but a Border Patrol agent burst through the door and pinned him down.
“Tranquilo,” the agent told him. “Don’t move.”
They handcuffed him and asked whether he had participated in the immigration protests that had started the night before, following the first raids. 
“I don’t get involved in that,” he told them. “You got us at work. You got us while working.”
They took his cell phone, he said, and plugged it into a device that unlocked it, which allowed them to look through his contacts and communications.
Morales thought his lack of a criminal record would help him. But it didn’t. “I don’t know why they don’t want us in Los Angeles,” he thought.  
The agents drove him away, leaving his tools at the restaurant. 
***
Lopez, Oropeza and Morales are now in Chiapas, Mexico City and Puebla, respectively, and we spoke to them by phone. Their accounts of their arrests, detention, and rapid removal suggest federal agents are working from a new playbook, one that dispenses with the longstanding practice of targeted arrests and relies on only the thinnest pretext, like a wanted poster, for approaching people who appear Latino. 
In April, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring the Border Patrol from conducting warrantless raids in the Central Valley. “You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston said, finding the warrantless stops likely violated the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable searches.
The man who led that operation, El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, is now in charge of the operations across Los Angeles.

The men’s stories also suggest that agents are pushing people to sign removal forms before they can call home or speak with an attorney. Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law, said those tactics would be “blatantly illegal.”
“You can’t condition phone access on anything,” Arulanantham said. “They have a right to call their family. They have a right to call a lawyer.”
He also raised concerns about the treatment the men described in government facilities. “It’s not permissible to manipulate the conditions of detention to encourage people to give up their rights,” he said.
Migrants can challenge the legality of their arrest and detention, he said, but they usually have to be in the country and be able to call a lawyer. 
The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Immigration detention centers are well above capacity, and the men we spoke with were almost immediately moved to an ICE tent camp in Texas and, within days, across the border to an immigration facility in Ciudad Juárez. 
Before the Trump administration began its mass deportation campaign, many immigrants arrested away from the border were released on bond with a notice to appear in immigration court. Those with criminal histories were typically held in detention facilities. 
Now, Bovino has made clear, he considers anyone who crossed the border without documents – the farm worker, the day laborer, the paletero – a criminal. 
“Bad people,” he called them during a press conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this month. 
New Immigration and Customs Enforcement data from June 1 to June 10, analyzed by the Los Angeles Times, shows that 69 percent of the people detained in the LA area had never been convicted of a crime. 
A criminal records search in Los Angeles and the California state prison system for Oropeza, Lopez and Morales returned no results. Oropeza and Lopez said they had been caught at the border and deported years before.
***
From the bus stop on Venice Boulevard, Oropeza was taken to a parking lot in Santa Ana where the agents put him in shackles. He had chains on his wrists, his ankles, and around his waist. Then they loaded him onto another vehicle and drove him to a place he described as a kind of jail. There were no beds, he said, and everyone slept on the floor. Lopez and Morales were there as well. 
At 5 am the following day, all three were taken to an airfield near the Mojave Desert, where they boarded a plane to Texas with around 35 other men from Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.

For the next few days, they were detained in an ICE tent camp in El Paso. Lopez said he was given a small bottle of water, potato chips and an apple. The cells were kept uncomfortably cold, he said, and the detainees were given only mylar blankets. When he asked to make a phone call, he was told he would need to share detailed information about the person he was calling – their name, address, place of work. He decided against it. 
He said the agents told him that if he tried to talk to an attorney, he would be stuck there, under the same conditions, for eight months to a year. On Wednesday, just two days after he arrived in El Paso, he agreed to sign the voluntary deportation papers.
“How they treated you there, I would rather leave,” he said. 
Oropeza signed the voluntary removal forms that day as well. Thirty minutes later, he was allowed to make his first call. 
“I have a family, I have to provide for them,” he said. “I didn’t want to be stuck there.” 
The next day, Lopez, Oropeza and Morales were driven across the border to Juárez, they said, along with dozens of other men from their cells who agreed to sign the forms. There, at a shelter set up by the Mexican government, they were able to shower, eat a hot meal and call their families.
They were also given 2,500 pesos – the equivalent of around $130 dollars – to make their way to somewhere else.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062625-Juan-Flores-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 20:04:28.714674

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Providence’s budgeting season won’t conclude in time for the July 1 start of the new fiscal year. But city officials have found a way to lessen the pain of increased taxes — at least for residents who own multifamily homes.
A revised fiscal 2026 budget seeks a proposed tax levy hike of 5.85% instead of the 7.5% proposed in April by Mayor Brett Smiley and the maximum cap of 8% authorized last week by the Rhode Island General Assembly. The change was announced Thursday by Providence City Council President Rachel Miller and Finance Chairwoman Helen Anthony after negotiating an agreement with Smiley.
The legislature had to get involved because state law caps municipal tax levy increases at 4% annually. Providence officials needed more than that to comply with a $15 million settlement last November between the city and the state education department over funding of the city’s public schools. About $11 million of that settlement needs to be accounted for in the 2026 budget, which is why Smiley proposed increasing the levy — and absorbing as much tax revenue as possible — to cushion the blow without affecting city services too severely. 
Smiley’s original proposed budget drew ire from residents and some Providence lawmakers, who argued it unevenly distributed tax rates, and would disproportionately affect small landlords more than commercial properties — the latter would still see a slight reduction in taxes under both versions of the budget.
“We heard residents loud and clear: protect city services and limit the impact of increased taxes, especially on those who can least afford it,” Anthony said in a statement. “Our negotiated agreement with Mayor Smiley does just that.” 
The revised budget reduces the average property tax increase on owner-occupied, multifamily homes from 16% to 6%, aligning it with the average increase for owner-occupied single-family homes. City officials estimate the revised structure would save property owners in this category about $400 on their tax bills, compared to the mayor’s original plan.
Tax bills delayed
Providence’s revised fiscal year 2026 budget is not yet finalized and is pending final approval by the City Council. A public hearing on the revised budget will be held Monday, June 30, at 5:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers. Spanish translation and free child care will be available. Residents can also submit written testimony by emailing the city clerk.  
Once the budget moves out the Finance Committee, it needs to pass the full City Council twice. The two votes are tentatively scheduled for July 7 and July 14. Until then, tax bills for the new fiscal year will be delayed, said Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for the mayor, in a Thursday email. 
“If FY26 property tax bills are not issued by mid-July the City will need to delay payments to vendors, grantees and the School District in order to fulfill the City’s debt service, payroll, medical and utility financial obligations,” Estrella wrote. “We have already delayed issuing $15M in pension payments and anticipate we will be unable to make the July PPSD appropriation on time.”
Both Smiley’s original proposal and the newly amended version actually lower tax rates across property types, but the readjusted rates are nullified by dramatic increases in property assessments during the recent revaluation.

“Revaluations are sky high and Providence is making up for decades of underfunding schools in just one year,” Miller said in a statement. “But that doesn’t mean working families should carry the burden. These revisions make the system fairer, protecting homeowners, renters, and small local landlords.”  
Non-owner-occupied properties with two to five units will still see the highest increase of all, at an average of 13% — a reduction of only 3%, compared to Smiley’s rendition of the budget.
Owner- and non-owner-occupied single-family homes will see a slight increase compared to Smiley’s plan, from 4% to 6%. 
“This was a very difficult budget to develop and an even more difficult budget to vet with financial uncertainties at the state level,” Smiley said in a statement Thursday, noting that he respected the City Council for helping to distribute the burden more evenly among the city’s residents. 
“Together we developed a streamlined, cost-effective budget that addresses the city’s severe budget shortfall and lessens the burden on our taxpayers,” Smiley continued. “As a result, I am happy to support a budget that underscores my administration’s continued commitment to responsible financial management while supporting the evolving needs of our neighbors.”
In addition to the levy bill passed by the General Assembly and signed by Gov. Dan McKee on Tuesday, state lawmakers also OK’d legislation with a more surgical approach to the city’s tax code: S1116, sponsored by Sen. Jake Bissaillon, and H6394, sponsored by  Rep. Rebecca Kislak.   
Unlike the blanket increase in property tax revenue, these bills allow for finer detail in how the city defines and taxes properties, allowing them to shift more of the burden onto commercial property owners. The city’s tax assessors will be allowed to target investor-owned or pricey industrial properties by breaking them off into separate categories.
The legislation does rely on the one-year levy cap exemption to absorb any extra revenue that would be generated, but its provisions for tax code are more lasting and could allow the city to more accurately target pricier properties in future taxation schemes. 
McKee allowed the legislation to become law, albeit without his signature, on Thursday.

Proposed by Texas Republican Sen.

States that choose to receive these funds would be required to pause enforcement of any laws or regulations related to AI models or systems. The enforcement ban would last 10 years.

According to the committee, the moratorium will prevent states from “hindering AI deployment through needless” regulation. 
Utah has passed a number of AI-related laws in the last two years, perhaps the most significant being SB149. Passed in 2024, the bill created the Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy, intended to be a regulatory sandbox where the private sector works with the state’s Department of Consumer Protection to identify ways in which AI can be used for good, and bad.
In 2025, lawmakers built on that initial law and passed HB452, which regulates mental health chatbots that use AI. Lawmakers also passed bills that regulate how police departments use AI in writing police reports; require upfront disclosure for AI chatbots that offer financial and legal advice; and target the use of AI in creating deepfakes or edited images that use a person’s name or image without their consent for commercial purposes. 
Utah lawmakers say the moratorium would effectively make these bills obsolete.  
“This federal moratorium would freeze this kind of forethinking work. It would prevent Utah and other states from responding to new developments, refining guardrails and learning through hands-on policy innovation,” said Rep. Doug Fiefia, R-Herriman. 
Deepfakes, policing, mental health and more: Lawmakers look to further regulate AI

Fiefia, a freshman lawmaker and former Google employee, worked on a number of tech-related bills during his first legislative session. Speaking during a press conference with other state lawmakers on Thursday, Fiefia said a 10-year moratorium could permanently handicap states’ ability to regulate AI. 
“That’s a lifetime in technology and would really hurt not only states and states’ rights to act, but at the end of the day, I think would hurt consumers,” he said. 
Fiefia is one of many Utah lawmakers and public officials who oppose the moratorium. Earlier this month, the Herriman representative penned a letter to Utah GOP Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis, asking them to oppose the provision in the budget bill. The letter was signed by most of the state House, including Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper. 
Utah Attorney General Derek Brown also signed on to a letter in May with dozens of other state attorneys general opposing the moratorium, calling the policy “wholly destructive.” 
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox acknowledged the intent of the moratorium during his PBS news conference earlier this month, telling reporters that different regulatory approaches across 50 states could stifle the technology. But Utah’s laws, he said, are different. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“There’s this misunderstanding, I think, of what the Utah law does,” he said. “Our law does not impact the development of AI … this is just normal consumer protection.” 
Cox said he has concerns about the moratorium — he’s hoping Utah’s congressional delegation will create some kind of a carveout for laws that take a lighter touch to AI regulation. 
“Our hope is that the last version of this bill that passes, whatever that looks like, will allow for the kind of regulation that we’re doing in Utah and prevent the bad type of regulation that would stop AI from reaching its fullest potential,” he said.  
Sen. Heidi Balderree, R-Saratoga Springs, who also spoke during Thursday’s news conference, said the proposal goes against the idea of federalism. 
“I’m baffled how this even made it into the big, beautiful bill,” she said, noting that Utah’s AI bills mostly received unanimous approval. “In the state of Utah, this is a nonpartisan issue.” 
Balderree likened AI to a dam that’s about to burst — “a moratorium isn’t a reinforcement, it’s turning your back on the water and hoping it holds,” she said.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041025_UND-Capitol_27-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 19:05:24.226906

May 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Lancaster County District Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit seeking to void Nebraska’s medical cannabis laws on the grounds that they violate federal laws against marijuana.
Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong, in a 16-page opinion Thursday, ruled that John Kuehn, a former state senator and longtime marijuana opponent, could not prove injury to sue, the legal term of art known as “standing.” 
Strong, citing past case law, said such injury would need to be “concrete,” “distinct and palpable” and “actual or imminent.”
“Plaintiff admits that he has not suffered an injury-in-fact resulting from defendants’ actions, and the court finds that he lacks standing under any of the exceptions to the rule requiring an injury-in-fact,” Strong wrote.

Instead, Kuehn sought to get his foot in the courthouse door arguing that any Nebraskan should be able to challenge ballot measures (even after an election), that he has standing as a taxpayer to prevent the “illegal expenditure” of public funds and that he should have standing because the laws constitute a “matter of great publicconcern.”
Strong ruled against Kuehn on all three points.
More than 71% of Nebraskans approved legalizing medical cannabis, and 67% approved a regulatory system.
On the election-related challenge, Strong said Kuehn isn’t challenging the legal sufficiency of a ballot measure. Strong ruled over a separate Kuehn case last fall where she upheld the legality of the measures to legalize and regulate medical cannabis after Kuehn, and later top state officials, accused campaign workers of fraud and malfeasance. She rejected those claims.
“It is much too late to stop the secretary of state from putting the medical cannabis initiatives on the ballot,” Strong wrote.
Nebraska Supreme Court appeal pending
Kuehn had targeted Evnen and the trio of ballot sponsors of the 2024 medical cannabis campaign in the earlier case and again added them to this one.

Despite being a defendant, Evnen and his state attorneys, including Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, all but embraced Kuehn’s arguments and sought to overturn Evnen’s placing of the ballot measures on the 2024 ballot just months before. 
That earlier case, Kuehn v. Evnen et al., heads to the Nebraska Supreme Court this fall on appeals from Kuehn and Evnen.
This time around, Kuehn also targeted Gov. Jim Pillen, initially seeking to stop the governor from ceremoniously declaring the ballot measures successful. Strong did not let Kuehn do so, and Pillen certified the new laws, effective Dec. 12.
In January, Kuehn added CEO Steve Corsi of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, State Treasurer Tom Briese, Tax Commissioner Jim Kamm and the members of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that voters overwhelmingly approved creating in November to regulate the medication.

Among Kuehn’s main contentions in the federal preemption case was that Nebraska shouldn’t be able to create a medical cannabis program because of federal law classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug. A Schedule I drug is one that the federal government says has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical uses. A bipartisan swath of advocates has called for rescheduling the drug for decades. 
Nearly 40 states, including Nebraska, have laws on the books for medical cannabis.
‘A clear message’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, one of the three ballot sponsors targeted in the Kuehn cases, said she appreciated Strong’s “thoughtful decision.” She said the ruling “should send a clear message to the opposition that they have lost.”
Eggers said Strong’s dismissal upholds many years of hard work and hints “that we will finally see the day that we, and all Nebraskans, have fought for.”

Daniel Gutman, who represented the ballot sponsors in both Kuehn cases before Strong, said her order was consistent with other dismissals nationwide on procedural and substantive grounds.
“This is yet another failed attempt to undermine the will of Nebraska voters,” Gutman said in a statement.
The AG’s Office, representing all state defendants except for the Medical Cannabis Commission members, as well as a separate attorney representing the commission, declined to comment on the dismissal.
Kuehn’s attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.
An ‘exception’ vs. a ‘rule’
Strong called Kuehn’s allegations of “taxpayer standing” “remarkably broad,” ranging from allegations that Briese or Kamm would illegally be expending funds by collecting sales taxes on medical cannabis or by issuing guidance or investigating complaints against doctors who recommend cannabis. Medical cannabis would be sales tax exempt under current law. DHHS had not issued guidance or investigated complaints as of earlier this week.

Strong did say that Kuehn’s “strongest case” for taxpayer standing is against the commission itself, though Strong she noted none of the members are compensated for their duties and that the voter-approved laws did not give specific funds to the Medical Cannabis Commission. 
The Legislature set aside an additional $30,000 in spending authority for Liquor Control Commission employees who might take on joint duties with medical cannabis regulations. Strong’s ruling noted that the new state budget didn’t earmark any specific funding for the Medical Cannabis Commission.
Strong said that if “employee time” was enough for taxpayer standing, it would no longer be an “exception,” which attorneys for the Medical Cannabis Commission and ballot sponsors had argued.
“It would be the rule anytime a statute requires a government employee to do anything,” Strong wrote. “That result would be inconsistent with the principle that ‘[e]xceptions to the rule of standing must be carefully applied in order to prevent the exceptions from swallowing the rule.’”

On standing for a “matter of great public concern,” Strong said it’s unclear whether the Nebraska Supreme Court has applied the exception since it was created in 1979.
“If the proliferation of gambling and harm to the state’s natural resources are not matters of great public concern, then the court is hard-pressed to say that the legalization and regulation of medical cannabis is,” Strong wrote, citing cases from 2000 and 2015.
No shortage of ‘strong political opinions’
Strong said it is also relevant that other people could challenge the medical cannabis laws in court, one of which she said “obviously” is the federal government to enforce the federal Controlled Substances Act.
Nebraska commission approves emergency medical cannabis regulations

Others could sue, too, such as a landowner near a registered cannabis establishment if property valuation, use or enjoyment is impaired or someone fined by the Medical Cannabis Commission, Strong said.
Another party that has voiced intentions to sue if establishment licensing begins by an Oct. 1 deadline, as required under law, is the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Hilgers and his staff, including in this case, have repeatedly said they plan to sue if licensing begins, part of why his office supported dismissing Kuehn’s latest case.
Strong said she does not decide in the present lawsuit whether Hilgers and his office would have standing to challenge the medical cannabis laws.
“Nebraska, like other states, has no shortage of citizen-taxpayers with strong political opinions. That is not necessarily a bad thing,” Strong wrote. “But it would be bad if all those citizens could sue whenever a law requires a government employee to do something.”

The board voted Thursday to approve a joint agreement to resolve and dismiss lawsuits with two school districts that sued over similar transfer issues. 
Its agreement with Jenks Public Schools, which the district provided to Oklahoma Voice, states both parties agree the board’s decision is unenforceable because of a procedural error. 
Jenks and Bristow Public Schools filed nearly identical lawsuits after the state board voted June 27, 2024, to overrule the districts’ refusal to keep two boys enrolled as transfer students. About half of the board’s membership has changed since the decision.
Both students live outside of Jenks and Bristow boundaries. The districts denied the boys’ requests to continue as transfer students because of behavioral issues. 
State law allows districts to deny a transfer request for disciplinary reasons, as well as for poor attendance and because of a lack of school capacity.

The student attending Jenks High School had been suspended for possessing drugs on school property, the district’s lawsuit states. The Bristow student was arrested and suspended after claiming multiple times to have a bomb in his backpack while in a crowded classroom, according to court documents.
The families of both students appealed the denial to their local school boards and, when rejected again, raised the matter to the state Board of Education.
After speaking privately with district officials and the students’ families, the state board voted to uphold the students’ transfers to stay in Jenks and Bristow. Both districts contend the board’s “arbitrary and capricious” decision violated Oklahoma’s open transfer law and proper administrative procedures.
“Jenks Public Schools is pleased to reach this conclusion and will continue to act in accordance with the law regarding transfer applications and transfer appeals,” district spokesperson Rob Loeber said in a statement.
Bristow schools’ superintendent did not return requests for comment, nor has the district provided documents of its agreement.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who leads the state board, declined to comment on the details of Thursday’s vote until more documents are filed in court, but he acknowledged in a statement that “yes, there is an agreement in place to resolve those two lawsuits.” 
Jenks filed its dismissal agreement in Tulsa County District Court on Thursday, Loeber said.
It’s not immediately unclear whether Bristow’s has been filed in Creek County District Court. It’s also not clear where either student involved attended school over the past year while the cases were pending.

Members of Teamsters Local 728 in Cumming say their employer, Republic Services, is forcing them to work in dangerous conditions for too little pay. Along with Republic employees at several locations around the country, they’re demanding a new contract with better pay – 7% for the first year – and more benefits and protections. If they don’t get it, there could be a strike – which could mean trash piling up in metro Atlanta yards just as the summer heat is broiling the state.
The teamsters represent just under 400 Republic drivers in Georgia, according to Chuck Stiles, director of the Teamsters’ waste division. If a strike does take place, residential customers in Alpharetta will be the most affected.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists refuse and recyclable material collectors as the occupation with the third highest rate of fatal work injuries, below only fishing and hunting workers and roofers.
Sanitation workers say the risk often comes from faulty equipment, like trucks with brakes that don’t hold on hills or without functioning air conditioning in the sweltering heat. Stiles said if managers come in under budget for repairs, they get a portion of the money they didn’t spend, incentivizing them to put off necessary fixes.
Workers also have to deal with physical wear-and-tear from heavy lifting and repetitive motions as well as all sorts of hazardous refuse, from exploding paint cans to used needles and other medical waste.
“They look at workers no more than they look at a hydraulic hose or a tire,” Stiles said. “When it’s wore out, we’ll get another one. They don’t care about maintaining stability long term. It’s all about profit. If they hire a guy and he works six months and says ‘to hell with this, I’m out,’ they’re happy. They don’t care. They just keep churning. They keep churning workers.”
Charles David has been in the industry for 29 years and with Republic for 24, and he said the pay has not kept up with inflation.
“I live by myself and I go grocery shopping once, maybe twice a month and I spent $450 by myself. That’s one person,” David said. So if you got four people in the household, five people in the household, it gets rough, especially when it’s depending on one income.”
David said it’s even harder for younger workers just starting a family.
Stiles declined to comment on when a potential strike might come, though the Teamsters say it could be any day.
“It’s on the company. They’ll be the one that decides whether there’s a strike or not,” he said.
In a statement, Roman Blahoski, Republic’s director of external communications, said the company takes care of its workers and is negotiating in good faith.
“We have a best-in-class safety program and quickly address any concerns that may arise,” he said. “We respect the rights of our employees to engage in collective bargaining, and we will continue to meet with the union to reach a fair and competitive contract that is beneficial to our employees, our customers and our company.”

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin announced the settlement share Wednesday, and said the state would begin receiving the money next year. The annual payments will continue until 2040.
“I am pleased to see Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family held accountable for their actions that perpetuated the opioid crisis across the country, including here in Arkansas,” Griffin said in a press release. “These funds will further opioid abatement in Arkansas and will help provide treatment, research, and prevention.”
Arkansas receives first payment in $26 billion national opioid settlement

A third of the award will go to the state. The remaining funds will be evenly split between Arkansas municipalities and counties, and managed by the Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership.
Purdue Pharma is the producer of OxyContin, a painkiller that public health experts and government officials say was the catalyst for the broader opioid epidemic that began in the 1990s. The Sackler family is the owner of Purdue, but would be forced to give up their ownership under the settlement agreement.
The settlement is the latest in a years-long saga that started in 2019 when Purdue, facing thousands of lawsuits over OxyContin’s role in the epidemic, filed for bankruptcy protections. The agreement resolves these lawsuits, but does not shield the Sacklers from opioid lawsuits in the future. 
A previous settlement that included such protections was scuttled last year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the family couldn’t be protected by a settlement in bankruptcy court since the family itself hadn’t filed for bankruptcy.
Arkansas has the second-highest opioid dispensing rate in the nation, according to an Arkansas Department of Human Services report published in 2024. Arkansas’ rate was 72.2 per 100 people in 2022, according to the report. The national average was 46.8 per 100 people.
“Rates of opioid misuse in Arkansas were consistently in the top ten highest rates in the country among all age groups,” the report said. “4.1% of adults reported misusing opioids in the past year…Arkansas ranked 15th for individuals who reported being diagnosed with opioid use disorder in the past year.”
Particular disparities were noted in counties with greater income inequality, where “overdose death rates for Black individuals more than double those in counties with less income inequality,” according to the report.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)At least $100 million in federal grants have been canceled for North Dakota state agencies under the Trump administration so far, according to an analysis presented Thursday to state legislative leaders.
The analysis may not be a complete picture of the state impact, but it’s the first time such a list has been compiled since the Department of Government Efficiency began cutting costs.
“It is constantly changing and no guarantee that it is comprehensive,” Grant Gader, fiscal analyst for Legislative Council, said during a meeting of the Legislative Management Committee.
Health agencies scramble as North Dakota loses federal grants

The state Department of Health and Human Services has seen the bulk of the federal funding cuts with 12 grants that were canceled in March.
The agency lost about $69.5 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was awarded for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, vaccines for children and grants to address COVID-19 health disparities for underserved populations. 
Another $6.3 million in grants to address mental health and substance abuse also was canceled.
Those funding cuts have affected public health agencies and other organizations statewide.
The next largest cut was the loss of about $20 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency grants that were designated for various North Dakota infrastructure projects. Lawmakers during the session approved a Bank of North Dakota loan of about $9.7 million to fund wastewater projects in two communities after the grants were canceled.
The analysis, which Gader said comes from federal sources, shows about $8 million has been canceled for various state agencies as of this month, including:

$4.5 million to the state for digital equity planning and capacity
$2 million for the University of North Dakota for a school safety grant
$990,000 for the Department of Environmental Quality for radon awareness, testing and mitigation to reduce radon impacts to low-income homes
$580,000 to the Department of Agriculture for local food purchase agreements
$105,000 National Institute of Health grant to UND for an undergraduate training initiative

Gader said his analysis does not include federal grants awarded directly to local agencies.

Also this week, the Budget Section of the Legislature approved spending nearly $190,000 in contingency funds to cover an education-related grant that was no longer available after the funds had been spent.
The dollars were part of Governor’s Emergency Education Relief funding authorized by Congress through the COVID-19 stimulus package. It supported initiatives such as the North Dakota Commission on Juvenile Justice and the Teacher Retention and Recruitment Task Force. 
The deadline to spend the funds was extended through March, but the state was notified in March that the funds were not available, said Joe Morrissette, director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
“We’re somewhat of a victim here of the federal Department of Government Efficiency efforts,” he said.
Morrissette told lawmakers Thursday that staff tried repeatedly to get in touch with the U.S. Department of Education to inquire about the grant, but they usually received responses that the employee no longer worked at the department.
“So, we have not gotten any resolution from the feds on this and as we get close to the end of the biennium now, we’re a little bit stuck in how we handle this,” Morrissette said. 
Lawmakers on Thursday asked the Office of Management and Budget to also start tracking federal funding cuts. There’s a possibility lawmakers could reconvene in a special session to consider state funding to replace lost federal dollars.
“We’re going to need a big picture,” said Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
Hogan also asked legislative staff to research more details about the impact of the funding cuts.
“If you cut $75 million, somebody’s going to be impacted by that,” Hogan said. “And I don’t think we know exactly who that is yet.”
Lawmakers also are preparing for a state impact from the “big, beautiful bill” under consideration in Congress.
North Dakota could lose about $1.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding over 10 years, if the U.S. House version of the legislation is signed into law, according to a Legislative Council memo presented Thursday. Medicaid enrollment in North Dakota would be reduced by an estimated 18% by 2034, with some of the reduction attributed to mandatory work requirements.
The memo analyzed reports issued on the bill by the Congressional Budget Office and the Kaiser Family Foundation. The analysis does not take into account changes to the bill as it’s being debated in the Senate.
The bill as approved by the House also would force states to contribute to a cost-sharing formula for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beginning in 2028. Under current law, the federal government pays the benefits for the program and states only cover the program’s administrative costs. 
The North Dakota impact of that legislation is unclear as the details are still being debated. Legislative Council projects that the state would have to pay an additional $18 million every two years to administer the program. However, that doesn’t take into account changes to the program that may require additional staff to implement.
Donna Aukland, chief financial officer for the state Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers the agency may have to hire additional people or delay other work to accommodate the new eligibility requirements for federal programs.
Lawmakers saved six legislative days of the 80-day limit in case they need to reconvene to address impacts of federal funding cuts. 
“This is something we need to keep our eye on,” Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said. “I suspect when the final ‘big, beautiful bill’ project emerges, there will be more updates.”

The Vermont Supreme Court heard arguments Thursday in the appeal of Aita Gurung, who was found guilty by a jury following a trial of first-degree murder and attempted murder stemming from the 2017 attack at his home.

The attorney for a Burlington man sentenced to serve at least 27 years in prison for killing his wife and seriously injuring her mother with a meat cleaver in 2017 argued Thursday that the convictions for murder and attempted murder against him should be thrown out. 
Rebecca Turner, a public defender for Aita Gurung, contended during an hourlong hearing before the Vermont Supreme Court that the jury selection process in her client’s trial was flawed.
Turner also told the five justices that the trial court’s interpreter who provided Nepali translation throughout the trial for Gurung, who is Bhutanese, did not adequately perform that service. 
“The right to challenge prospective jurors runs deep in our common law tradition,” Turner said at the start of her roughly 30 minutes of arguments. “As our United States Supreme Court has confirmed in the late 1800s, it is a necessary part to ensure fairness of a jury trial.” 
Turner told the justices that during the jury selection process leading up to the trial in 2022, Judge John Pacht held a portion of the proceedings — in which attorneys raised concerns about certain jurors being assigned to the case — in his chamber, away from public view.

“Mr. Gurung, without explanation, was excluded, as were the public,” Turner said, adding that the alleged errors violated her client’s rights to an open and fair jury selection process and warranted a reversal of his convictions.  
Assistant Attorney General Sophie Stratton, one of the prosecutors in the case, countered in her argument to the justices Thursday that the issue did not meet the standard requiring the tossing out Gurung’s convictions.
Stratton said that Gurung’s defense team during the trial did not object to that portion of the jury selection process taking place outside of the courtroom. 
Additionally, Stratton said that the part of jury selection that took place in the judge’s chambers was limited to about 90 minutes out of the entire roughly four-day process it took to seat in the jury in the case. 
Gurung was found guilty by a jury in November 2022 of first-degree murder in the death of his 32-year-old wife, Yogeswari Khadka, at their home in Burlington on Oct. 12, 2017. He was also found guilty of attempted second-degree murder for seriously injuring his mother-in-law, Thulsa Rimal, in the same attack.
Pacht later sentenced Gurung to 35 years to life, with 27 years to serve and the remainder suspended on probation.
Gurung’s mental health has played a critical role in the case. 
In 2019, Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George dropped the charges against Gurung, as well as two other defendants in high-profile cases, when she said she could not rebut insanity defenses based on expert opinions.
Gov. Phil Scott called on then-Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan to review each of the cases, and the state’s top prosecutor refiled charges in all three cases, including the one against Gurung.
During Gurung’s trial, his defense attorneys argued that he was not guilty because he was insane at the time of the attacks on his wife and her mother. 
The prosecution disputed that contention, maintaining it was a case of domestic violence, saying Gurung was fueled by anger after his wife would not get him a beer.
Despite rejecting the insanity defense and finding Gurung guilty of the charges against him, following the verdict nine of the 12 jurors signed a letter to the judge stating that it was their unanimous opinion that his mental condition significantly influenced the events leading to the charges against him.
Turner, one of Gurung’s appeal attorneys, cited during Thursday’s appeal hearing several other reasons why her client’s convictions should be thrown out in addition to flaws she alleged in the jury selection process.
Among those reasons, Turner pointed to the court’s Napali interpreter who translated the trial as it was happening to Gurung, who listened to the interpreter’s voice through headphones.
Turner said the issue with the court interpreter during the trial was raised by Gurung’s attorneys with the judge during that proceeding.
“The counsel told the court that the interpreter was not completing sentences, missing entire sentences, putting words together that are not exact,” Turner said. 
In addition, Turner said, the interpreter included English words in the Nepali translation for legal terms, such as “defense” and “testimony.” 
“When the trial court heard these concerns, the trial court was hostile and immediately dismissive,” Turner said. 
The Vermont Supreme Court took the arguments Thursday under advisement and are expected to issue a written opinion. The justices gave no timeline for when that decision would be issued. 
Gurung, 42, is serving his prison sentence at the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield.

The 105-page plan submitted by Hazelett Strip-Casting Corporation outlines five “cottage-style” buildings for “a 20-room inn” with a restaurant and event space at the lakefront site of a former motel.

An $8 million lakefront proposal for a hotel with a fitness center, restaurant and event space currently under town review has some Colchester residents concerned.
Named The H at Malletts Bay, the development would be out of scale for the area and could exacerbate traffic and environmental issues on West Lakeshore Drive, residents said at a packed Development Review Board public hearing June 11 that ran almost four hours. 
“Any development on the water’s edge will cause more damage to the bay. It’s just common sense. Any development like this will increase traffic problems on West Lake Shore Drive. Any development like this will negatively affect our visual access to the bay,” said resident Jeff Spengler at the meeting.
Nothing like it exists anywhere on the bay, resident Kelly Baker wrote in an email to VTDigger this week. She is particularly concerned about the project’s potential impact on the water quality of Malletts Bay and fears it would change the look and feel of that scenic stretch.
Others told VTDigger they were not aware of or didn’t grasp the scale of the development planned at the site until recently.
“I only learned of this proposed development by chance. Very few people know what’s going on, even now,” said resident Jeanne Welch, adding that the amount of information filed so far is “daunting.”
The 105-page site plan submitted by Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp. outlines five “cottage-style” buildings for “a 20-room inn” (plus a manager’s room), a standalone rental building, a 48-seat restaurant and a 60-person event space at 166 and 180 West Lakeshore Drive.
The project plan includes a 1,536-square-foot maintenance building and a 67-space parking lot at 135 West Lakeshore Drive across the street. It also has space for a future building that could sleep six to be approved in a separate process.
Built on a slope, the buildings would appear as two stories from the road and three stories from the bay side. The main building would include a restaurant on the lower level, an event space on the ground floor and a fitness spa on the top level, according to consultants that represented the plan for the developer at the meeting.

The town board is reviewing the application for the proposed  plan — which is about the mid-stage of the review process. The developer “updated the submission extensively” since April 9, said Zachary Maia, development manager for the town, by adding a new building, a fire hydrant and adjusting shoreland encroachment, among other changes.
Because the developer added “critical review items” late on the day of the meeting, town officials had not had the time to review it, he said at the meeting.
Benjamin Avery, principal at Greenfield Growth Consulting LLC (and formerly a developer with Black Rock), who represented the developer with a team of four other consultants, gave a brief overview of the changes.
He said they addressed some of the town’s concerns from the last hearing such as reducing some encroachment items, realigning the “cottages” and adding the fifth building “just so the project you’re reviewing is in its totality.”
“Where the alignment of the original five buildings has moved around, those buildings have not changed from an elevation standpoint,” Avery said.
Growing concerns
About 45 residents packed the continued public hearing on June 11 and questioned consultants about the height, density, stormwater and wastewater capacity and took issue with a filed winter day traffic study that does not account for summer vehicular traffic nor bicycle or pedestrian traffic.
“Why wasn’t a study done in the summer?” resident Julie Collins said.  “As it is now, it’s hard to get home in the summer with all the campers and the boaters and the swimmers.”
Jennifer Conley, director of transportation in Vermont for VHB, an engineer and planning firm, said they added new counts from April, in addition to the ones submitted from January. They “followed the typical steps of a traffic study,” considered peak times and provided a conservative analysis, she said.
Tom Berry said he would like to know more about the new easement set aside for the bike path.
“I think it’s the most significantly needed piece of infrastructure in Colchester right now and what’s, you know, probably the most dangerous piece of road for a bicyclist between Colchester village and downtown Burlington.”
While the plan may meet regulations for the amount of stormwater that must be treated for the size of the project, it would still allow untreated water to flow directly into the bay, according to Baker. 
“I’m also concerned about wastewater,” she wrote. “They are accounting for the minimal amount of numbers in their projection.”
She said she believes the new building has been counted as one unit when it is a two-bedroom addition that could easily house six or more. 
“That is a big discrepancy as far as the amount of waste water that could be created from just that space alone,” she wrote in the email.
Consultants at the meeting said they have provided accounts of the wastewater capacity for the project which meet the town’s limits for the parcel. Board members said it amounts to a little over 4,000 gallons per day.
Several residents have submitted letters to the review board since the meeting, outlining their growing concerns regarding the proposed development.
“In no way does the proposed development of five large buildings along the lake in the small area preserve or enhance views of the bay,” Faith Brown wrote to the Development Review Board, referring to language in the 2019 Town Plan that serves as a guiding document for land use. “Driving by people will see the buildings and be bothered by the foot traffic across the road to those buildings, not enjoying the magnificent views of the bay.”
The developer is looking to merge two lots. Several residents at the meeting expressed concerns that that would allow more intense development on the merged parcel.
“For instance, sidewalk setbacks would go away. They’d be able to build a building right on top of the property line,” said John Louchheim. “So my question for the development review board is, in light of the 2019 town plan, why would you approve that murder of the parcels that’s going to increase development?”
The property owned by the developer currently has a marina and recreational space for Hazelett employees that would remain after the proposed buildout. Residents wondered if it would expand in use as a commercial marina once the development is approved, and whether moorings would be used by guests or available to the public.Resident Jeanette Berry asked in an email to the board whether the use of the marina, which has historically operated as a small private facility for Hazelett employees and become “essentially a commercial marina,” would be reviewed for compliance in light of the project.
Some residents criticized language used by the developer to describe what they said looks like a resort-style hotel that belongs in a city rather than an “inn” with “cottages” in a bedroom community. They wondered how much access the public would have.
Consultants at the meeting said the marina would remain as it is, the restaurant would be open to the public, the rooms and meeting space would be up for rent and the spa would be available for guests only. They offered no details about marina use nor cost estimates of what bookings could cost.

Residents have also expressed concern the proposed development could circumvent local regulations.
“It would behoove the town to close these loopholes that are being exploited,” Welch wrote in an email to the Development Review Board.
“It’s already a David and Goliath situation: developers with the will, unlimited financial resources, time and manpower deluging a very capable yet understaffed small town planning and zoning with 100+ page applications,” Welch wrote. “Just tell them if it’s not in the regs they can’t do it!”
Some residents said they are worried the details are murky.
The developer’s filing estimated 47 sleeping spaces in the rooms, 48 seats in the restaurant, 69 in the spa and meeting space for an estimated total of at least 164 people at capacity plus six more in future for the sixth building planned.
“By blending modern hospitality offerings with a deep respect for the natural landscape, ‘The H’ is poised to bring fresh energy, innovation, and year-round activity to this iconic waterfront location,” the filing reads.
The public hearing will continue on July 23 at 7 p.m. If approved by the town, the project would also have to pass the Act 250 process that governs statewide development review.

[…]","A Pennsylvania mail ballot envelope (Capital-Star photo)A federal judge sentenced a Delaware County elected official who admitted his role in an ultimately unsuccessful scheme to steal a mayoral election to nearly two years in prison.
Sentencing for Md Munsur Ali, 48, of Millbourne came about a week after U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III sentenced his two co-conspirators to federal prison.
In addition to 21 months behind bars, Bartle ordered Ali to serve a year of supervised release and pay a $2,500 special assessment. Ali, who remains a member of Millbourne Council, pleaded guilty in April to 25 charges against him — one count of conspiracy, 12 counts of giving false information in registering to vote, and 12 counts of fraudulent voter registration.
According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia, Ali and co-conspirators Md Nurul Hasan, 48, and Md Rafikul Islam, 52, also of Millbourne, agreed to fraudulently submit write-in votes to elect Hasan mayor, after he was knocked out of contention in the 2021 Democratic primary election. Hasan and Islam also pleaded guilty in April.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bartle sentenced Hasan, the former council vice president, to three years behind bars and Islam, a former member of council, to one year in prison.
“These defendants sabotaged the democratic will of their fellow citizens in deciding Millbourne’s next mayor,” U.S. Attorney David Metcalf said. “Public trust in the electoral process is critical, and my office is committed to ensuring that our elections remain free and fair. As this case shows, should we find instances of fraud, we won’t hesitate to prosecute those responsible.”
Hasan also faces prosecution in Delaware County Court for 16 counts each of unlawful voting, voting fraud and obstruction of government.
“Free and fair elections are the bedrock principle that defines American democracy. I appreciate the partnership between my office, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to bring these criminals to justice,” Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said in a statement.
The investigation began after the winner of the race, Mayor Mahabubul A. Tayub raised concerns about non-residents who had registered to vote in Millbourne before the election, Stollsteimer said.
Stollsteimer said in March that his office has investigated and filed charges in four election fraud cases since he took office in 2020.
“In each case the fraud was aided by failures in our current election system,” Stollsteimer said. “I understand the desire to allow people easy access to participate in our democracy through the use of modern technology, but in my opinion our legislature should be putting safeguards in place to address the issues raised in these prosecutions.”
According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office: After his 2021 primary loss, Hasan decided he would run for mayor as a write-in candidate in the November election. Ali and Islam agreed to support him, prosecutors said. 
To do this, all three worked to obtain the personal information of people who did not live in Millbourne and used it to fraudulently register them to vote in the borough at various addresses using the commonwealth’s online voter-registration system, prosecutors said.
They then used the voter registration website to request vote-by-mail ballots that were sent to the addresses used to create the fraudulent voter registrations. Hasan, Islam and Ali retrieved the mail-in ballots from mailboxes at the addresses, completed them with write-in votes for Hasan and returned them to the county board of elections to be counted, prosecutors said.

Hasan and Ali persuaded acquaintances who lived outside Millbourne to provide their personal information to carry out the fraud and assured them they would not get into trouble if they didn’t try to vote anywhere else. They also obtained personal information from other sources, including Hasan’s business, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. 
Islam allowed Hasan to use his email addresses to submit fraudulent voter registrations and request ballots through the state website.
In total, Hasan, Ali and Islam conspired to falsely register and submit ballots for nearly three dozen non-Millbourne residents as Millbourne voters. Hasan lost the election by a vote of 165-138, prosecutors said.

Through a press release, Ruud expressed deep appreciation for the Carroll community and said he was grateful for the warm welcome and support he received throughout the search process. However, he is “stepping away to focus on personal matters that will require his full time and attention.”
Carroll College’s 18th president, John Cech, retired at the end of the school year.
The Carroll College Board of Trustees has appointed Jennifer Glowienka, Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, and Bishop Austin Vetter, Bishop of the Diocese of Helena, to serve as interim co-presidents for the 2025–26 academic year.
“Carroll is entering a new chapter,” said Rev. Patrick Beretta, Chairman of the Carroll College Board of Trustees. “Dr. Glowienka and Bishop Vetter offer strong, complementary leadership and a deep understanding of our mission. This is a pivotal time for the institution, and their combined experience positions us well to meet the challenges ahead. We are confident in their ability to lead Carroll with clarity, compassion and strategic focus.”
The co-presidency model, college leaders said, reflects Carroll’s commitment to collaborative leadership, institutional stability, and thoughtful stewardship during a year of significant institutional work.
Carroll College said it will provide further updates in the future, including developments related to presidential leadership beyond the interim period.
According to the release, in the year ahead, Carroll College will remain focused on strengthening academic excellence, advancing financial sustainability, and supporting long-term accreditation goals.
Glowienka has served in her current position since July 2021. A member of the Carroll faculty since 2003, Glowienka brings over two decades of experience in academic leadership and teaching. She holds a doctorate in evolutionary botany from the University of Colorado at Boulder and a bachelor’s degree in biology from Boise State University. Her previous roles at Carroll include Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs, Assistant Dean of Instruction, and Chairwoman of the Department of Life and Environmental Sciences. She was named the James J. Manion Endowed Chair in the Biological Sciences in 2018 and received Carroll’s Distinguished Scholar Award in 2008.  Glowienka has helped secure more than $1.5 million in external grants, served as the college’s accreditation liaison officer, and remains deeply committed to Carroll’s Catholic, liberal arts mission.
Vetter has been the Bishop of Helena since 2019. He earned a bachelor’s in Philosophy from Cardinal Muench Seminary and continued his theological studies at the Pontifical North American College and the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. Ordained a priest in 1993, he has served in numerous leadership roles, including Rector of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Bismarck and Director of Spiritual Formation at the Pontifical North American College in Rome (2012–2018). As Bishop of Helena, he has played a key role in stewarding the Diocese’s mission, overseeing strategic planning, parish development, and clergy support, while advancing initiatives that align with the Church’s long-term goals.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GlowienkaVetter_collage_0-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-06-26 18:14:00.270234

U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy presided over the case.
Miguel Angel Lozada-Dominguez, 36, pleaded guilty in May 2025 to one count of illegal reentry.
According to a Wednesday U.S. Attorney’s office press release, law enforcement made contact with Lozada-Dominguez in St. Regis in April.
In court documents, the government alleged that Lozada-Dominguez appeared to be soliciting money from individuals while holding a notebook with handwritten phrases in English. He told officers he was a Mexican citizen and did not possess valid immigration documents and had no legal authorization to enter the country.
Law enforcement arrested Lozada-Dominguez who later stated he had entered the United States by crossing the border undetected through Del Rio, Texas.
Lozada-Dominguez’s records showed he was convicted for illegal entry and ordered removed from the U.S. in 2019, and he did not seek or receive authorization from the Attorney General to reenter the United States.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association. (States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector)

The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.”
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”


Moran’s communications director, Angela Lingg, said “the Senate is continuing to negotiate any changes to Medicaid, and Sen. Moran is working to make certain Kansas hospitals are at the forefront of those discussions.”


Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.”
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.”
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association president and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients.
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation.
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent.
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.”
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”

(Photo via U.S. Bureau of Reclamation)Just a little more than 12 months ago, the huge St Mary Siphon, more than a century old, which delivers water to thousands of ranchers and residents along Montana’s Hi-Line and eastern part of the state failed. On Wednesday, the United States Bureau of Reclamation announced the reconstruction project had been completed, thanks to an expedited review process by all levels of government, and emergency funding from Congress.
Montana’s senior Senator, Steve Daines, cheered the completion.
“The St. Mary Siphon provides vital water to Montana communities along the Hi-Line, and the failures last summer were catastrophic. I’m beyond thrilled to hear that Reclamation has completed repairs on the siphons and is resuming operations on the Milk River Project,” Daines said.
The siphon, is one of three siphons along the St. Mary Canal which diverts water from the St. Mary River to the Milk River  delivers a supply to more than 110,000 acres of farmland and municipalities across Montana.
“Getting this siphon back online within a year is a remarkable accomplishment and a reflection of our commitment to the people who rely on this water every day,” said Montana Area Office Manager Ryan Newman. “Reclamation, working shoulder to shoulder with the Joint Board, the Blackfeet Nation, and the State of Montana, ensured this project remained on track under extraordinary circumstances.”
The “catastrophic failure” of the siphon happened on June 17, 2024, and jeopardized the farmland as well as 18,000 people who rely on the system for water. Without the siphon and water supply, the Milk River would run dry six out of every 10 years.
Jennifer Patrick, project manager for the Milk River Joint Board of Control, had originally estimated the project at more than $70 million, and said the board was hopeful that a new siphon would be operational by Fall 2025. Despite a brutally harsh winter, which included temperatures dipping farther than -20 Fahrenheit, work continued ahead-of-schedule throughout the project.

“Bringing water back through the St. Mary Canal isn’t just a milestone—it’s a testament to what can be accomplished through strong partnerships and relentless hard work. The teams from Sletten Construction, NW Construction, and Pro-Pipe, with support from the Blackfeet Tribal Employment Office, have been nothing short of amazing. This project reflects what’s possible when local, state, Tribal, and federal partners come together with urgency and purpose to protect a lifeline of the Hi-Line,” Patrick said.
Though it has been called the “St. Mary Siphon,” the system is really two separate siphons, St. Mary and the Hall Coulee Siphon.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association. (Photos by States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector)The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.” 
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”
Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.” 
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.” 
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association President and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients. 
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation. 
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent. 
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.” 
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BeshearKelly16x9-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-26 18:14:00.270234

(Photo courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s key vaccine panel has voted 5-1 to ban thimerosal, a harmless preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, in what critics say is a nod to vaccine skeptics who have fixated on the chemical’s use. 
The move rescinds recommendations for flu vaccines containing thimerosal for children, pregnant women, and the general public. The CDC’s research shows no adverse impacts caused by the chemical.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted 5-2 to approve a monoclonal antibody shot manufactured by Merck to protect infants younger than eight months from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 7-0 to add RSV to a program that provides free vaccines to children whose families can’t afford them, and 6-0 to approve the annual flu vaccine for everyone older than six months.
The committee, which was established in 1964, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations also play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible immunizations are for the public to access. They also help guide global immunization practices.
This week’s meeting is ACIP’s first since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, several of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics.

Though certain members of the committee have embraced the label of anti-vaxxer, committee Chair Martin Kulldorff has objected to the characterization, and emphasized the need to build public confidence in the CDC’s recommendations. 
“Our central duty is to protect public health, and we understand that we must answer the call for re-establishing confidence in the scientific examination process,” the committee members said in a joint statement. 
“We came to this meeting with no predetermined ideas, and will make judgments as if we are treating our own families.”
The votes also offered insights into individual members of the committee’s stance on vaccines. Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College’s Geisel School of Medicine who has served as a past committee member, cast the sole “no” vote on the thimerosal ban. 
“The risk from influenza is so much greater than the nonexistent, as far as I know, risk from thimerosal,” he said.
Vicky Pebsworth, a registered nurse and board member of the National Vaccine Information Center, which advocates for vaccine exemptions, abstained from voting.
A controversial ingredient
Thimerosal, a mercury-derived antiseptic, has been used since the 1930s to guard against harmful fungi and bacteria in vaccines. The chemical was removed from all childhood vaccines in the U.S. by 2001 and today, only 4% of flu vaccines administered — those used in multi-dose vials — contain the compound. However, antivaccine activists have seized on thimerosal, citing unfounded arguments that link the chemical to autism and other adverse health outcomes.
Thursday’s vote to ban thimerosal from flu shots came shortly after Lyn Redwood, the former head of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, delivered a presentation to the committee centered on the ingredient. Redwood, who has long echoed conspiracy theories about vaccines, was recently hired by Kennedy to help oversee vaccine safety at the CDC, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services directory now lists Redwood as an employee.
Redwood’s presentation argued that thimerosal has been shown to cause autism, though there is no scientific evidence to support the claim. An early draft of her slides claiming that thimerosal can cause “long-term consequences in the brain,” cited a study that does not appear to exist. The draft was later removed and replaced with a version that does not include the fabricated citation.
The CDC’s own research has shown no connection between thimerosal and autism or any other potential harm. The chemical is not frequently used in U.S.-administered vaccines, but remains common in most vaccines around the world.
Jodie Guest, who serves as the senior vice chair of Emory University’s epidemiology department and as a faculty member on the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) program, criticized the committee’s emphasis on “revisiting settled science” in an effort to appease vaccine skeptics.
“Revisiting [thimerosal] and taking it out of the very few vaccines that’s left in is really scientifically not a huge problem,” Guest said. “But from a communication perspective, it continues to propagate the concept that there is a relationship between it and neurological disorders.”
There are certain situations in which using a vaccine that contains thimerosal may be a more practical choice, Guest said. Multi-vial doses of vaccines are cheaper to produce, and are more likely to be used in rural areas where vaccines are administered less frequently. 
“Our underserved communities are the places where we are more likely to see the multi-dose vials for the flu vaccine, and that’s where thimerosal still exists,” Guest said. “It was put into multi-dose vials in order to not have bacterial infections inside of the vaccine vials that were then given to patients. So it’s a protection and it’s scientifically sound to continue to use it.”
Georgia, which has a large rural population, rural health care shortages and low vaccination rates, could be disproportionately impacted by any messaging that casts doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, Guest added.
“Anything that makes it harder to find a flu vaccine or to get one — or makes you question how safe they are — will drive our numbers down,” she said.

(Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Industrial Commission is looking for ways to help farmers who lost storage and other infrastructure in last weekend’s severe storm prepare for harvest season.
“Harvest is coming, and some of these farms may only have one or two bins left,” Agricultural Commissioner Doug Goehring, who sits on the commission, said during a Thursday meeting.
A storm on Friday and Saturday generated multiple tornadoes, high winds and hail that was devastating for agriculture producers across the state. A tornado near Enderlin in eastern North Dakota claimed the lives of three residents. A fourth death in Stutsman County was linked to a power outage that resulted from the storm.
Farmers have reported lost crops and destroyed grain bins, irrigation systems and sheds. 
The impact to grain storage could amount to a loss of tens of millions of bushels, according to Goehring.
The Industrial Commission asked the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to “develop disaster program alternatives” and present them to the commission within the next two weeks, according to an email from the bank.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the commission, suggested during Thursday’s meeting that the state can provide bridge loans to farmers so they can get started replacing lost infrastructure until they get insurance claims processed.
Bank of North Dakota Chief Lending Officer Craig Hanson said during the meeting that community bankers have reported that farmers’ corn crops are mostly OK, but that they are “thinking about reseeding options” for bean crops.
“There’s some discussion on insurance versus some seed options, on how things are covered and what costs are there as well,” Hanson said.
Armstrong said the state should also think about ways it can support small businesses in communities hit by the storm.
“If a small town business closes down, the chances of it reopening are zero,” he said.
The commission indicated it would reconvene soon to take official action on the matter.

Court filings in Gardener’s Supply Co.’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case reveal how a combination of its employee-ownership model and ill-timed investments following a surge in Covid-19-era profits ultimately led to the company’s financial collapse. They also paint an uncertain picture for the future of its employee ownership and ability to repay mounting debts.The documents trace the decline of Gardener’s to what had once been a banner period for the Vermont-based gardening company — the pandemic. Like many companies in the home and garden sector, Gardener’s saw a dramatic boost in sales as Americans took up gardening during lockdown. The company reported “significant sales and growth” in 2020, 2021 and 2022, with revenues hitting $110.3 million in 2021 and $105.4 million in 2022. The boom benefited the business and employees, whose stock values “skyrocketed,” according to the court filings. However, Gardener’s was unable to maintain this financial bloom. The company’s revenue dropped to $89.6 million in 2023 and $71.5 million in 2024 as the gardening trend wilted. These losses in revenue were compounded by several factors.

Firstly, longtime employees who had enjoyed lengthy tenures at Gardener’s retired and cashed out their employee stock. This meant the company had to pay out a five-year retirement plan for the employees who had left when stock values hit record highs, causing “significant liquidity issues” and damaging its “future projections to pay out the retirement obligations in coming years,” the filings stated. Gardener’s employee stock ownership plan is also expensive to maintain — it’s managed by an outside trust, and incurs “higher than typical annual reporting, compliance, valuation and audit costs.”Secondly, the company made a series of poor investments. Gardener’s spent heavily on  “numerous one-time systems and process improvement[s],” including a $500,000 enterprise resource system — a software suite designed to streamline business operations. But the implementation did “not go smoothly,” court records indicate. Issues with the system ended up costing the company between $5 million and $10 million in revenue.Gardener’s also invested in a new Warehouse Management System that led to significantly delayed deliveries during the company’s peak spring season. More than 60% of customer orders in May 2024 were delayed by 15 to 30 days, according to the filings.These problems lead to Gardener’s falling out of compliance with its lender, Bank of America, which provided the company’s credit line. Gardener’s entered an agreement with the bank to delay loan payments until the second quarter of 2024, and reshuffled leadership in an effort to stay afloat.
But the changes were unsuccessful. Bank of America offered a final loan extension set to expire on June 29, and ultimately ended its relationship with the company. According to court documents, the bank’s analysts noted that “cash generated during the Pandemic surge—when AGR’s [America’s Gardening Resource] ESOP-fueled share price tripled—was primarily paid out as equity to shareholders,” in reference to Gardener’s employee stock ownership plan.The company then launched a “series of strategic actions” to stabilize operations, including staff layoffs, hiring a new marketing firm and making changes to its shipping partnerships. These actions failed as well, and it “became clear” to Gardener’s leadership that the way forward “was to engage in a sale process,” the bankruptcy filing states. Gardener’s engaged the investment bank Tower Partners, which reached out to 1,115 potential buyers.Competitor Gardens Alive Inc. is now poised to purchase the Gardener’s assets for $9 million. Notably absent from the deal, however, is the employee stock ownership plan.Gardener’s ESOP trust owns the company’s stock, with employees as the beneficiaries. Since filing for bankruptcy, Gardener’s has stopped making contributions to the trust, citing its “current financial condition.” It remains unclear whether there will be any money left in the trust for current or retired employees after the deal closes.“If the company is sold … [the ESOP] is basically a plan that has no assets and gets wound down,” said Matt Cropp, executive director of the Vermont Employee Ownership Center.It’s also unclear whether Gardener’s has the money to repay most of its creditors. As it stands, the company owes over $4.5 million to 30 unsecured creditors — creditors without collateral — including four Vermont vendors. 
A Gardener’s spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on the future of the ESOP and whether the company would be able to pay back its creditors.“It goes secured debt, administrative debt, and then unsecured debt. So, [unsecured creditors] get whatever’s left over,” said Christopher M. Condon, an adjunct bankruptcy and corporate law professor at Vermont Law and Graduate School.Gardener’s currently has just $4.2 million on hand and owes $8.2 million to banks, according to court documents.Condon said there’s a chance the unsecured creditors could recoup their money if it is found  Gardener’s owes less than anticipated as the bankruptcy case continues.
“The numbers aren’t necessarily accurate on day one because the books and records change all the time. It depends on when you get the invoice, what the billing cycle is, all that stuff,” he said.Another buyer could also emerge and submit a higher bid for the company’s assets, increasing the pool of money available to pay back creditors.“It’s theoretically possible that somebody else bids and the purchase price goes up,” Condon said.However, bankruptcy documents indicate that Gardener’s wants to expedite the sale process, which may limit other bids.“[Gardener’s Supply Co.] believe that expediting approval of the Bid Procedures is unlikely to prejudice any party in interest or impair the competitiveness of the sale process,” Gardener’s lawyers wrote.“They don’t really wanna get into a bidding war… The buyers want to be in as much control as possible,” Condon said.

LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee), a member of the Joint Finance Committee, urged Republicans to work to ensure families have access to child care. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Joint Finance Committee is planning to return to its work on the state budget Friday. It will  be the committee’s first meeting since early last week when work halted due to a breakdown in negotiations between Republican Senate and Assembly leaders and Gov. Tony Evers.
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said then that his caucus objected to the amount of spending being considered in the budget negotiations. Two members of his caucus — Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) — have both publicly expressed their concerns about the budget being negotiated by Evers and Republican leaders, presenting a challenge in the Senate where Republicans hold an 18-15 majority. To pass a budget without winning Democratic votes, as they did last time, Senate Republicans can only lose one vote.
Assembly Republicans have been calling this week for their Senate colleagues to come back to the negotiating table and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said he was still in conversation with Evers and, according to WisPolitics, is optimistic the budget could be completed next week. Assembly and Senate Republicans met in a joint caucus Thursday.
The committee plans Friday to take up 54 sections of the budget, including ones related to the University of Wisconsin system, the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the Department of Children and Families, Department of Health Services and the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Tourism as part of its work wrapping up the budget. The budget would then need to pass the Senate and Assembly before it could go to Evers for consideration. 
Child care is a critical piece, as Evers has said he would veto the budget without investment in the state program to support child care providers known as Child Care Counts. The COVID-era program was launched using federal funds to subsidize child care facilities and help them pay staff and keep costs down for families, but the funds will run out in July and the program would end without state money. Republican lawmakers have said they oppose “writing checks out to providers.” 
Democratic lawmakers joined child care providers Thursday morning to echo calls for investing state money to continue the Child Care Counts program. 
Brooke Legler, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), said Republican lawmakers’ proposals are inadequate to meet the crisis and Republican arguments opposing subsidies don’t make sense. 
“They subsidize farmers. They subsidize the manufacturers,” Legler said. “Last [session] when they denied the funding for Child Care Counts … they gave $500 million to the Brewers, so I have an issue with them saying they can’t subsidize.”
Legler said that if lawmakers don’t make the investment in child care, they need to be voted out of the Legislature next year.
“The $480 million needs to happen, and if it doesn’t, then we need to help Sen. [Howard] Marklein and Rep. [Mark] Born find new jobs in the next election,” Legler said. “This is not OK, and we need to stop this from happening.”
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee), a member of the Joint Finance Committee, urged Republicans to work to ensure families have access to child care, saying the state’s economy relies on parents being able to work and that children are better off when they have a reliable, safe place to stay and learn.
“We cannot allow these critical centers to close their doors and opportunities to be lost to our children forever,” Johnson said. “If the families don’t have quality, dependable child care, if they have to remain at home, or even worse…  these are all options that we don’t want to face… and these are all options that our children don’t deserve.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said her caucus is prepared to work on the state budget and she has “continually” been in conversation with Evers and is open to conversations with LeMahieu. 
“As of right now, I have not heard from Sen. Devin LeMahieu yet, but my phone is on,” Hesselbein said. 
When it comes to negotiations happening behind closed doors, Hesselbein said it’s “probably normal.” 
“I’ve talked to other majority and minority leaders in the past, and this is kind of how it’s happened in the past,” Hesselbein said.
In order for Democrats to vote for the budget, she said, they would need to see significant investments in K-12, special education funding, child care and higher education.
“These are the three things we’ve talked about — improving lives, lowering costs for everyday people,” Hesselbein said. 
The UW system with the support of Evers has requested an additional $855 million in the budget. Vos said last week his caucus was instead considering $87 million cuts to the system, though Evers recently said that they were discussing a “positive number” when it comes to the UW budget. 
Democrats were critical of the K-12 budget that the committee approved earlier this month for not investing in a 60% reimbursement rate for special education and for not providing any general funding increases to schools.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), a member of the Joint Finance Committee, told reporters on Wednesday that a budget agreement between Evers and Republicans won’t necessarily guarantee Democratic votes.
“I think all of us are going to have to make our own decisions about whether or not the budget is one that we can support or that meets the needs of our districts, and that’s as it should be,” Roys said.
The committee will also take action on the nearly $50 million for literacy initiatives that has been stuck in a supplemental fund since 2023 and withheld by lawmakers because of a partial veto Evers exercised on a related law. The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday the partial veto was an overstep of Evers’ powers, striking it down and restoring the language in the law passed by the Legislature. The money is set to expire and return to the state’s general fund if not released by Monday.

The board approved the drilling of up to two test wells for roughly $25,000 apiece to determine the existing availability of water for the site, as well as the possibility of using local municipal water sources.
“We may just need water there to support the construction, at which time we do get more adequate water to maintain the site until we get water from Fort Smith or an alternative,” Board Chairman Benny Magness said.
Fort Smith officials have been considering providing water for the prison, which could require between 300,000 and 500,000 gallons per day, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Magness said he had been told that it would take too long for Fort Smith to be able to provide adequate water infrastructure, and “we’ve got to start moving forward on this site.” He floated the possibility of the city of Ozark providing water.
Officials at Vanir Construction Management, the company hired to oversee the prison’s construction, told the corrections board that the two existing wells on the proposed site were not working when contractors assessed them for depth and water flow.

Wells surrounding the site provided the desired data, but “the variability was so ranging that there wasn’t anything we could necessarily count on,” making new test wells the best option for the project, said Sean Murphy, a Vanir assistant project manager.
If one test well yields “adequate water,” drilling a second one won’t be necessary, but an inadequate water supply after drilling both wells would require finding a new site, Magness said.
The state purchased the land in November for nearly $3 million, drawing ire from Franklin County residents and officials who said they weren’t consulted beforehand. Additionally, the indigenous Chickamauga Nation has said the project could have a negative impact on its burial sites in the area.
Arkansas corrections panel OKs design firms for new prison; next step legislative approval

In April, lawmakers opposed to the location helped kill a bill that would have appropriated $750 million toward the proposed prison. Vanir put the preliminary cost estimate of the project at $825 million in March.
The Legislature set aside $330 million for the project in 2023 that has not yet been appropriated. The Arkansas Department of Corrections does have the authority to spend an additional $75 million that was set aside in 2022.
In May, the Board of Corrections approved a general contractor for the facility, and earlier this month, the board greenlit a $57 million contract for the design team.
Thursday’s special meeting also included the board’s appointment of Lee Watson, with Grant Hodges as his alternate, to a new executive committee with input on the prison’s construction. The committee will also include Vanir officials and representatives of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ office, Magness said.
Expanding prison capacity has been a priority for Sanders since taking office in 2023. Proponents of the new prison have said it’s needed to alleviate overcrowding. More prison space is also likely to be needed as a result of the Protect Arkansas Act, which eliminated parole for offenders who’ve committed serious felonies.

,DC,2025-06-26 21:35:52+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin urges Democrats to refocus on middle-class issues,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/michigan-sen-elissa-slotkin-urges-democrats-refocus-middle-class-issues,,"U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin outlined a middle-class-focused economic agenda for Democrats on Thursday, urging her party to take more seriously the dissatisfaction voters feel with their personal finances.The Michigan Democrat was a CIA analyst and worked on international security affairs at the Defense Department before entering politics. During a wide-ranging speech to the liberal think tank Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., she drew on that background while presenting herself as someone willing to tell hard truths to her own party and defy political expectations, even as she often endorsed traditional Democratic positions.“I believe that the single greatest security threat to the United States is not coming from abroad,” the first-term senator said.“It's the shrinking middle class here at home… This is the existential threat. As a national security professional, what do you do when there's an existential threat to your country? You get to work on a war plan, you face up to what's not working, you change course, and you ruthlessly pursue the economic security that's critical to our survival.”The speech was the first of three this year Slotkin said she would give on the major priorities she believes voters want addressed. She would lay out visions for national security and democracy later, she said.Slotkin also gave the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this year.After defeating a Republican incumbent in a House race in 2018 and winning statewide last year in a state Trump carried in the same election, Slotkin positioned herself as someone who can speak to the disaffected voters who sent Trump to the White House and as a possible leader in the party’s response to the MAGA movement.“It's not just Trump voters who are frustrated with the government,” she said. “It's Americans across the board.”She called for action on a range of domestic policies to reverse a shrinking middle class and urged Democrats to modify their messaging on key issues.'That anger, that suspicion'Democrats should prioritize the economic issues that they “have, quite frankly, lost touch with,” she said.After decades of post-war growth, American middle-class life is now further out of reach than ever for many, she said. That has inspired anger, she said, implying that was a factor in Trump’s rise.“That anger, that suspicion among Americans, that right there is what I mean by an existential threat,” she said. “Because in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracy like ours, when people don't feel like they can get ahead, when the system is rigged against them, they start blaming people who don't look like them, or who sound different, or who pray different. It's how we begin to tear each other apart from the inside.”That veiled criticism of Trump and some of his supporters — that many Democrats explicitly make a centerpiece of their public personas — is insufficient, she said. The party must instead make a positive case for what it wants to do. And that should include a laser-like focus on growing the middle class.“In order to attack that threat, we need to get government back to the basics of what it was designed to do,” she said.Democrats should build a policy platform around the goal of expanding middle-class opportunities, targeting job creation and education while restoring trust in government by installing guardrails against corruption, she said.Jobs, education, health care and moreTo create more middle-class jobs, the government should reduce barriers to small businesses, Slotkin said. Lawmakers should simplify regulations, taxes and licensing, she said.Regulatory barriers to housing construction should also be reformed, she said, to make buying a home more affordable.Certain industries critical to national security, such as rare earth minerals, microchips or batteries, should be protected with an array of policies including “targeted tariffs,” she said.And the immigration system should be reformed to allow immigrants to fill critical roles in the job market.On education, Slotkin said phones should be banned in classrooms and social media companies should face consequences for algorithms that lead to addiction in kids and teens.The national approach to workforce training should be completely rebuilt, she said. Forty programs across 14 federal agencies exist, she said.It would be more effective to “just blow it up right now,” and consolidate those programs, she said.To restore faith in government, Congress should also ban trading of stocks and cryptocurrencies by its members, she said. And it should end campaign contributions from corporate PACs.“The middle class doesn't have a lobbyist. They don't have a super PAC. They don't have a corporate PAC,” she said. “But they should have the Democratic Party.”‘Sacred cows’Slotkin, generally viewed as more moderate than most in her party, wanted to speak at the liberal think tank “frankly, because we haven't agreed on every single issue in the past,” she said, and said Democrats should “slaughter some sacred cows” in service of a ruthless pursuit of an economic agenda to grow the middle class.She had broad critiques of Democrats’ image and effectiveness.In the military and intelligence worlds, “if you see a problem, you don't just wait and let it fester,” she said during a question-and-answer session with Neera Tanden, the president and CEO of the Center for American Progress.“It's a bias towards action, right? And I think sometimes Democrats don't have a bias towards action. We have a bias toward navel-gazing,” she said. “Democrats have lost some of their alpha energy. I keep saying this, some of that bravado, some of that football-coach energy.”She voiced support for traditional Democratic issues like increased teacher pay, union membership, renewable energy and a public option for health insurance.She listed five Democratic “sacred cows” she would kill to advance her economic agenda, but she described them in relatively vague terms, instead criticizing her party’s messaging and legislative approach.“The first sacred cow I want to slaughter: Too often Democrats fail to make the distinction between small businesses and the largest multinational corporations,” she said. “And because of that, many Americans hear us as plainly anti-business. And while we're on the subject, too often as Democrats we have the habit of vilifying success.”Democrats also should update an “elitist” approach to climate change that allows some to use the issue as “a purity test,” she said.Immigration reform does not need to be “comprehensive,” a goal she said has dissuaded her party from accepting more incremental changes, but she said the country still needs “big, bold change to fix a broken system.”The party should be less focused on college as a destination for every student and instead invest in certifications and trade schools. And Democrats should acknowledge that overregulation can stymie what should be higher goals such as increasing the housing supply, she said.",,,,2025-06-26 18:14:00.270234

An unidentified man drowned in Lake Champlain near Red Rocks Park in South Burlington Wednesday, the third reported drowning in Vermont in the span of a week.
A park visitor noticed an unresponsive man underwater near the base of the Red Rocks cliffs Wednesday night and called 911. The South Burlington dispatchers received the call at approximately 7:43 p.m., and the South Burlington Fire Department arrived around 5 minutes later, according to a South Burlington Police press release. 
Fifteen fire department first responders helped locate and retrieve the man in water 10 to 12 feet deep. No form of identification was located when the man was recovered, according to police. 
The South Burlington Police Department is seeking information regarding the man’s identity and events leading up to the drowning. There is no evidence of foul play, according to the police press release.

“The deceased is described as a white male, bald with hazel eyes and a husky build, wearing a grey T-shirt with a white-over-black stripe pattern, navy blue athletic shorts, grey socks, and Cloudrunner grey running shoes with white soles,” the press release stated. 
The South Burlington Police Department, the Burlington Fire Department, University of Vermont Rescue, Colchester Technical Rescue and the U.S. Coast Guard aided in the search and recovery. The Saint Michael’s Fire Department and off-duty South Burlington personnel monitored the city of South Burlington during the crew’s absence. 
In the press release, South Burlington police reminded the public to practice water safety, including learning and refreshing swimming skills, learning CPR and water rescue techniques, wearing U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets and supervising inexperienced swimmers. 
A Burlington High School senior Eljak Menjwak drowned at Bartlett Falls in Bristol on Saturday, and Darren Kemp, 30, drowned in Lake Champlain on Tuesday night. 
Amid a heat wave in Vermont this week, people have likely sought relief from extreme temperatures in bodies of water. The Department of Health maintains a list of more than 400 places to cool off this summer.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is running for governor as a Democrat, is previewing her plan to bring Michigan’s education system from being one of the bottom 10 in the country to one of the top 10.
Benson laid out key goals during a roundtable Wednesday in Saginaw with educators, students, parents and school administrators.
She said her plan would include transitioning to a weighted school funding formula that is decoupled from property wealth, adding that “a child in Alpena has different funding needs than a child from Grand Rapids.”
Funding priorities would include infrastructure in school buildings and investing in dual enrollment and Career and Technical Education programs.
Benson said she would conduct a full audit of “outdated” school financing systems and make transparency a key focus “so that we can know where the money is going and ensure that we all, as a community, have confidence those funds are being invested strategically, wisely, with an eye towards what’s best for our schools, our educators and our kids.”
Another priority would be funding wraparound support services focused on mental health, after school programs and summer programs.
“It’s clear that families who benefit so much from the support they get from the schools in their community during the school year then lose that support during the summer, and that sets them and their kids back significantly when they start in the fall again,” Benson said.
To address that need, she said her plan would include a universal, full-day, five-day-per-week early childhood education system called MiCare that would be modeled on successful programs from other states and countries.

Benson said she also wants to expand access to ongoing training for teachers with a goal of increasing Michigan’s early literacy rates, which rank in the bottom third of the nation.
“I know it’s easy for folks to come in and have these big ideas for education, but I’m ready to get it done,” Benson said.
She added that “every day that we don’t spend trying to make Michigan one of the top 10 states for education in the country is a day where we’re falling behind.”
Concerns raised to Benson by educators and students include teachers paying out of pocket to provide supplies for students, parents not being able to be involved in their children’s education because they are working long hours or multiple jobs to make ends meet and training teachers to recognize when a student may need additional support rather than defaulting to penalizing them for outbursts or other signs of neurodivergent conditions.
Benson faces Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki in the Democratic primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Republican candidates include former Attorney General Mike Cox, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard (R-DeWitt), Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (Porter Township), former congressional candidate Anthony Hudson and William Null, who was charged and acquitted for plotting to kidnap and kill Whitmer.
Last month, independent candidate for governor Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan laid out his plan to invest $4.5 billion in Michigan’s schools.
Duggan warned that the investment would come with “punishment” for school administrators whose districts don’t show improvements.
But Benson said accountability measures should “uplift schools and put them in a position to succeed as opposed to pulling out when they don’t meet your needs.”

(Photo by Michael Swensen/Getty Images)The need for a special legislative session to address storm damage recovery in Kentucky hinges on the Trump administration’s decisions on pending disaster assistance requests, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear told reporters Thursday. 
Since February, Kentucky has faced three natural disasters, including two flooding events and a tornado outbreak. Beshear said Kentucky still has not received approval from President Donald Trump for public assistance to state and local governments for the April floods and May tornadoes. 
The president previously approved expedited disaster assistance for individuals and local governments for the February floods and individual assistance for the April floods and May tornadoes.

Beshear said the April floods could become a “$225-plus-million-dollar hit to the state and to the counties” if the federal government does not provide assistance to governments. Beshear raised concerns over the state’s ability to shelter Kentuckians following the disasters, saying without the public assistance “we may not be able to run our housing program as long as we have in the past.”
Beshear said other states that have faced natural disasters during the second Trump administration are also waiting to hear decisions about public assistance, the category of grants that go to state, local and tribal governments after disasters to help them recover cleanup costs and repair infrastructure. 
Shortly after Trump took office, he floated the idea of doing away with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and moving its responsibilities back to the states. The president said a couple of weeks ago that he wants to “wean” states off FEMA assistance after this year’s hurricane season. 
“We need the federal government to step up and to say they’re going to be there for our state, our cities and our counties in our toughest of moments, and they’re going to do what every other administration — Democrat or Republican — has done,” Beshear said. 
To Kentucky, FEMA has approved and dispersed nearly $2 million through individual and household assistance in response to tornadoes this spring, along with more than $1 million in other needs, Beshear said. As for the February floods, FEMA has dispersed more than $49.5 million in individual assistance and more than $18.1 million in other needs. For the April floods, FEMA has dispersed $24 million for individual assistance and $9 million in other needs assistance. 
The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is also still working on roads damaged from the April event. Beshear said 13 roads are still closed, mostly from mud and rock slides. Crews have assessed damage at 300 other locations, with the initial repair estimate topping $21.5 million. The governor stressed that assistance to local and state governments from the federal government could help with about 75% of that cost. 
The governor told the Lexington Herald-Leader in May that he would likely call a special session of the legislature to allocate more state funding for storm recovery. When asked about that possibility again Thursday, Beshear said his office is pulling together a final set of numbers, showing money needed both if federal funding is granted or not, and would meet with legislative leaders early next month to discuss it. A special session is still “certainly a possibility.” 
“If we’re not going to get public assistance, we’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars between the state and the city,” the governor said. “That throws all of our budgets out of whack and is just a major blow that would require some more significant action.”

Senate Republican leaders said on Wednesday during a press conference that it was still unclear if they would need to reconvene before the next regular legislative session begins in January. The next two-year state budget will also be deliberated at that time. 
Senate President Robert Stivers said that lawmakers would be ready to do a one-day session to approve funds if needed. He also said the legislators’ temporary structure, built to house meetings of the Senate and House while the Capitol is renovated, would be ready for use in July. 
According to a recent emailed FEMA update on disaster assistance, applications for support are being processed daily for all three natural disasters in Kentucky.

Philip Randolph Career and Technical High School on May 23, 2025 in Philadelphia and met with students, teachers, and legislators for public K-12 education. (Commonwealth Media Services)Following the U.S. military strike on Iran’s nuclear sites over the weekend, Gov. Josh Shapiro said he supports the action, but wants to hear from analysts about the bombing’s actual impact on the facilities.
“I want to see what the actual experts, military experts, and others, say about the mission that was carried out by these incredibly brave and courageous service members flying those B-2’s over Iran and, of course, those who planned this,” Shapiro said during an interview Thursday on the Mike Missanelli Show on 97.5 The Fanatic WPEN-FM in Philadelphia. 
“I don’t want to hear the BS that comes from Hegseth and some of these other folks,” Shapiro added, referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. “I want to see what actually happened there.”
Earlier this week, an initial intelligence report was leaked to some news organizations that indicated the strikes against Iran only set their nuclear program back by months and described the damage as limited, according to CBS News.
Hegseth and General Dan Cain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a press conference on Thursday to tout the effectiveness of the strikes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro described Iran as the “world’s largest state sponsor of terror” and as a “destabilizing force.”
“The last thing in the world we want is for Iran to get a nuclear weapon,” Shapiro said.
“If this mission was successful at knocking out their nuclear arsenal or their ability to develop a nuclear arsenal, that is really an important thing. That’s a good thing for the world, if we do not have a nuclear Iran. But I want to see what really happened,” Shapiro said.
He also called on President Donald Trump and what the governor referred to as “the experts” in the Trump administration to be honest and forthright about the military operation over the weekend, so “further judgment” can be made about the decision to bomb the nuclear sites.
Shapiro also praised the current ceasefire between Israel and Iran, noting everyone involved deserves credit.
“We do not want instability. We do not want war in the Middle East. We do not want innocent lives being lost,” Shapiro said. “We do not want Israeli citizens having to run in bomb shelters all the time when the Iranians target Israel.”
On Tuesday, Shapiro told reporters that the state was not facing any immediate threats following the attack on Iran, but the state would continue to work with federal partners to monitor the situation.
Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senators have both called the mission a success.
“Operation Midnight Hammer worked,” U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) posted on social media Thursday morning. “I’ve been calling for and fully supported those strikes, and it made the world safer. It should transcend partisan politics.”
U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said Iran having a nuclear weapon would be “very much against America’s interest” and called the military action “surgical, very targeted, perfectly executed mission,” during a telephone town hall on Wednesday evening.
“I think the way the President handled that in terms of giving Iran every opportunity for a peaceful resolution, and then supporting Israel, after Israel had taken out a lot of missile launchers with a targeted attack on the nuclear facilities, and saying, and this is not about regime change in an extended war,” he said. “I thought (it was) absolutely the right way to do that. I think that’s going to be a big move that introduces great stability in the Middle East.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/27810_gov_education_JF_028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 18:14:00.270234

(Photo by Julia Goldberg / Source NM)A panel of state lawmakers on Thursday questioned a Santa Fe official overseeing the city’s response to homelessness soon after its controversial cancellation of a long-standing overnight shelter’s contract.
Henri Hammond-Paul, City of Santa Fe director of Community Health and Safety, told lawmakers on the Legislature’s interim Health and Human Services Committee that the city intends to close Pete’s Place, a Cerrillos Road shelter with about 75 beds, within a year. 
The closure is part of the city’s effort to move away from a congregate shelter that sleeps large numbers of people and then kicks them out in the morning, Hammond-Paul said. 
That approach does little to tackle the root causes of homelessness and also leaves unhoused people to their own devices during the day, which “creates too much opportunity for riffraff,” he said. He also referenced complaints of business owners and residents near the shelter.  
New state study suggests homelessness far undercounted in New Mexico

“We don’t want folks just kind of loitering around throughout the day. We have to have a way for people to be somewhere and to engage them productively,” he said. 
The solution, he said, is to focus more on “micro-communities,” particularly tiny homes. Those allow unhoused people to have a place to store their belongings, “shut their door, be safe from kind of predatory and other influences in the community,” Hammond-Paul said. The city intends to establish between 30 and 50 tiny homes at a city-owned site in the near future, he said. 
The pivot away from congregate shelters happens as the city lacks as many as 1,300 beds for homeless residents, according to Hammond-Paul’s calculations based, in part, on a new state Health Department study suggesting a big undercount of homelessness across the state. 
The city now has 280 beds, he said. 
Lawmakers questioned Hammond-Paul about the city’s new contract with Urban Alchemy, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that provides street outreach and other services aimed at reducing homelessness. 
Earlier this month, after hours of debate, the Santa Fe City Council terminated the Interfaith Community Shelter’s lease at the city-owned building and approved a $1.5 million, one-year contract for a San Francisco-based group called Urban Academy to run it instead. The Council also approved a nearly $8 million, four-year contract for street outreach for the same group. 
Hammond-Paul touted the contracts as the city “killing two birds with one stone,” noting that Urban Alchemy is hiring 40 people locally and only hires formerly unhoused or incarcerated people. That makes it effectively a “job program,” he said.

New hires, paid $19 an hour, will be sent to two “hot spots” in the city to try to connect people with services, as well as provide first aid, de-escalation, harm reduction and other services, according to Hammond-Paul’s presentation. 
Hammond-Paul described the city’s strategy to move away from congregate shelters as an emergency response to quickly improve the lives of unhoused people and also residents and business owners. He stressed that it should not be considered a solution to the city’s long-standing challenge of chronic homelessness or lack of affordable housing. 
“It’s a set of emergency actions that we’re talking about making progress on that really affect the street conditions and the felt experience of being a resident of a city,” he said, “to make it so that  residents and businesses aren’t feeling the pain and also that individuals who are experiencing homelessness have services and access to positive pathways.”
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

State lawmakers also asked Hammond-Paul what the state could do to help. Legislators earlier this year approved more than $100 million to address the state’s housing crisis on various fronts, including funding aimed at improving housing affordability and also tackling homelessness. 
While Hammond-Paul didn’t mention new funding during his presentation, he did say the city is “constrained” in its ability to provide tiny homes and called on Santa Fe County and the state to help. He also asked lawmakers  to consider incentives to bring counties to the table to discuss anti-homelessness strategies. 
Santa Fe’s homelessness emergency reflects others across the state, particularly in larger cities. Homelessness has continued to increase in recent years, in both Albuquerque and the rest of New Mexico, according to recent point-in-time counts conducted by the New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness.

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

During a Thursday news conference at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced, alongside State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues and university leaders from Texas and South Carolina, that the states are developing a Commission for Public Higher Education.
DeSantis has focused heavily on “woke” ideologies by pushing legislation to ban state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and remaking state higher education institutions to be more conservative. 
In the way of his higher education initiatives, he has said, are accrediting agencies that may require a commitment to those values or other expectations for a university to be recognized. 
In order to “shape institutions in a positive way,” DeSantis said, “You gotta go two or three levels down sometimes. And we’ve identified this accreditation cartel as an issue for a long time.”
Florida is establishing the commission with the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, which DeSantis said will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
The layers, for example, can be shown by a 2023 law, SB 266, which outlawed state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but allowed for DEI initiatives to continue if required to maintain accreditation. 
DeSantis, who used to own an LSAT prep company, said during the “woke era” “institutions really became corrupted by ideology, and they were putting ideology ahead of the pursuit of truth during COVID.”

Timeline
DeSantis did not lay out a timeline for when the commission would be up and running, acknowledging that it has to meet federal requirements before the U.S. Department of Education can approve it. 
“We’re establishing it. You kind of got to go and actually do it for, you know, some period of time,” DeSantis said, adding, “I think U.S. DOE wants to be quick on this.”
DeSantis said he nudged Rodrigues shortly after Trump won the presidency. 
“We didn’t really have the prospects of launching anything like this successfully during the Biden years, but it’s a new day, and I think this is going to make a big big difference,” DeSantis said, adding that if it gets established during the Trump presidency, “then it’s almost impossible for a future federal administration to try to upend the apple cart.”
As recently as 2020, the year after DeSantis took office, the State University System of Florida created a workgroup that, in its final report, concluded that the universities’ “Board of Governors is making a clear and steadfast commitment to prioritize and support diversity, racial and gender equity, and inclusion.”
In 2022, Florida lawmakers approved and DeSantis signed SB 7044 to provoke institutions to seek accreditation from accreditors approved by the State Board of Education or Board of Governors.
Expecting favorability
“I think almost all the states in our region are going to be favorable to this,” DeSantis said. 
“All those states have done good stuff in higher ed anyways but, you know, it’s been more difficult when you have this accreditation cartel nipping at you all the time,” he said. “You know, now I think it’s going to be really, really smooth sailing.”
Florida’s and other southern state institutions are members of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. DeSantis and Rodrigues made jabs at SACSCOC, saying Florida institutions have problems with the accrediting organization and that its member schools’ performance has not been impressive. 
“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens. These reforms will benefit our faculty, our students, and the hardworking taxpayers who fund our public systems,” Rodrigues said.
In an emailed statement to the Phoenix, SACSCOC said, “We welcome any new accreditor as they go through a rigorous approval process. Accreditation is central to quality education; thus accreditors are held to high standards and must themselves be reviewed.”
“As for SACSCOC, we know we currently accredit institutions that serve the largest number of students in the country (approximately 5M),” the organization said. “As such, we will work with our partnering institutions to ensure and strengthen a high standard of accreditation that reflects the needs of students, our institutions, and the workforce.”
DeSantis complained that Florida law schools “should not be captive to having to bend the knee to get accreditation from” the American Bar Association, which he said “mandates explicit DEI compliance as a condition of accreditation” and “has now become a far left activist group.” The association has suspended its DEI standard until at least 2026.
The commission “will create a first-of-its-kind accreditation model for public higher education institutions that will offer high-quality, efficient services prioritizing academic excellence, student outcomes, and achievement,” according to the State University System. 
“​​Together, we are leaving behind the legacy systems and failed institutions of the past, while charting a new course in higher education, that puts student success at the forefront of everything that we do,” said Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner, who was recently named to that position following outcry from students who feared he would politicize the position. 



The commission’s announced core principles:

It is appropriate and necessary to introduce competition, aligned with state and institutional needs, into the existing marketplace of university accreditation.
It is in the best interests of all interested parties, including students, to launch an accrediting body comprised of true peer institutions focused on public colleges and universities and their governing university systems.
It is imperative to reduce bureaucracy through a more efficient and focused accreditation process, which will result in lower costs and significant time savings for member institutions, and which will translate into lower tuition prices for students and families.
It is critical to ensure that this new accrediting body is accountable to the states of the member institutions.
It is necessary for the new accrediting body to become and remain recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for the purposes of Title IV participation by its accredited institutions.

I certainly have and I try to have good answers for my grandchildren when they have been bullied. It happens to all of us and we are taught to turn the other cheek, try to make a friend of the bully, figure out why they are so angry and as a last resort, fight back.
I feel like my home, Nashville, is being picked on. I get that people outside of Nashville may not like us, however it appears a lot of folks want to visit us. The Nashville economy creates revenue that benefits the great state of Tennessee as well as Metro Nashville. 
In May, Nashville had a visit from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The fallout was fear, anger and for some, satisfaction. ICE arrived and stopped people going to and from jobs in our community and families were immediately separated. Many who were taken are scared of living in the country they came from and so many are looking for safety and economic opportunities — as a result of ICE, many Nashville businesses are now short staffed and closing early. 
House Speaker demands Nashville mayor ax order to report federal immigration interactions

In a perfect world, everyone would follow the law and enter the U.S. legally. I do not have the answer of making things fair and just but what happened in Nashville is upsetting, especially since our ancestors arrived here the same way. 
 The government — federal and state — are going after our mayor. He’s not perfect — no one is — but I defer to the legal community to explain exactly what happened.  Now our elected federal and state officials are investigating O’Connell and this Angry Grandmother thinks the conflict is all about who in the U.S. gets “due process.” 
What is “due process,” and why is my mayor requesting it for immigrants being detained by ICE agents?  It is the basic guarantee that every person is entitled to a notice and hearing about the evidence when the government claims they have done something wrong. When Congress debated the 14th Amendment after the Civil War, they did not want there to be any confusion about who the amendment protected.  Instead of applying it to “citizens’ Congress applied it to “persons” to make it universal, according to my husband, Larry Woods, who teaches Constitutional Law. 
In my opinion, that means when someone is arrested or cited for breaking the law, they have a right to go to court. I have been pulled over by law enforcement for speeding and had the right to go to traffic court, which I did. I pleaded guilty for going over the speed limit and was assigned to take a refresher case or attend “traffic school.” What would have happened if I had not had the chance to go to court? No due process for me. 
Instead of helping rural hospitals stay open, feeding the hungry, bringing jobs to the state or fixing roads, some of our leaders are holding media events to announce they are launching investigations of O’Connell. We could save a lot of time if our leaders would work together to solve the regional transportation problem. 
Appeals Court upholds state law halving Metro Nashville Council

I disclose that I have known O’Connell for more than 25 years. He visited the bookstore Larry and I owned, BookManBookWoman, frequently, because he is an avid reader. He was a great interviewer when he hosted a local radio show and he was one of the first people I knew in this century who took the bus or biked to work because of the cost of a car. When he was elected to the Metro Nashville Council he represented a large portion of our downtown and neighborhoods nearby. I served with him on a Metro government commission and he was calm and always prepared. Y’all, he makes his children’s lunch for school and volunteers as a disc jockey in Music City. 
Several qualified candidates ran for mayor when O’Connell was elected almost two years ago — but he was easily elected for a reason. When he was a council member he voted ‘no’ on the city financing a new football stadium for the National Football League and he said he wanted people who love our city to stay. Turned out that the majority of Nashville agreed with O’Connell because he easily made the runoff and won the general election. 
I roll my eyes and grit my teeth when Nashville is attacked again. State Republican lawmakers want to reduce the size of Metro council, even though we voted to keep it the size that it is. 
Just stop showing off and if you want to be in office then do the work and stop throwing hatefulness at us.  In the words of that great philosopher Charlie Brown I say: “good grief.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Freddie-OConnell-2-1024x676.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

Situated in the Mancos Shale formation in the San Juan Basin, Chaco Canyon holds paramount spiritual and cultural significance to several New Mexico Pueblos, the Hopi Indians of Arizona and the Navajo Nation.
Federal efforts to revoke buffer zone around Chaco Canyon prompt delegation letter

Since the Trump Administration took office, the federal government has moved to reverse a Biden administration policy — Public Land Order No. 7923 — that banned further oil and gas development on federal lands within 10 miles of the historic site for 20 years. This includes a Republican-backed bill in Congress to terminate the order.
On June 17, The National Congress of American Indians, a congress of American Indians and Alaska Natives, adopted a resolution calling on Congress to ratify federal legislation from the  New Mexico’ delegation to make the withdrawal permanent. The resolution further called on the U.S. Interior Department to complete a study looking at the area’s resources and consult with tribal governments before any final decision is made.
The buffer zone policy was hard-won, said Pueblo of Acoma Governor Charles Riley, who carried the resolution in the National Congress of American Indians.
“Over a thousand years ago, our Pueblo ancestors called Chaco Canyon and the Greater Chaco Region home, creating one of the most magnificent civilizations in North America,” Riley said in a written statement this week. “Today, we stand at a crossroads where we must choose between short-term energy profits and the permanent preservation of our most sacred ancestral homeland. The choice is clear – we cannot allow the desecration of this World Heritage Site for minimal energy gains.”
A coalition of more than two dozen conservation, Indigenous and historical preservation groups and 38 members of local and state government also this week submitted letters to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, urging him to reverse course on removing the buffer zone.
“Chaco Canyon transcends politics—it is a place of reverence that is beloved throughout our
nation,” the letter reads. “The 20-year mineral withdrawal represents years of careful tribal consultation, a triballyled ethnographic study, collaborative design, and thoughtful balancing of multiple uses. It provides essential protection for sacred sites and cultural resources while respecting Tribal sovereignty and development rights.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/50862D84-0799-8331-80F9D4BE18B29C20-1024x299.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

Jim Pillen gives his final green light. 
State law requires him to do so by Tuesday.
The emergency regulations, unveiled for the first time minutes before the 10 a.m. meeting, largely mirror a legislative proposal that lawmakers stalled on last month. The regulations would take effect for up to 90 days, pending Pillen’s approval. The two medical cannabis-related laws that voters approved mandate that applications must start being accepted no later than July 1.
  Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. June 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Commissioner Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, an addiction prevention specialist through Heartland Family Service, affirmed that commissioners want public feedback on the emergency regulations through July 15, to inform future, formal regulations.
Public comments may be submitted to lcc.frontdesk@nebraska.gov, the repository for the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, which will forward the messages onto the state’s new Medical Cannabis Commission.
“The input that the public provides on these emergency regulations will help us immediately begin drafting the regular regulations,” Mueting said Thursday.
Emergency regulations process
Dr. Monica Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist who chairs the commission, will send a letter to Pillen relaying the emergency regulations and stating that the “failure” to adopt them by the deadline “would force Nebraskans to seek medical cannabis or similar products from unregulated and potentially harmful sources.”
Pillen’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the emergency rules.

Licensing of new establishments must begin by Oct. 1, according to the  laws. The emergency regulations would allow licenses for, at minimum, cultivators, product manufacturers, dispensaries and transporters, and someone could be awarded only one type of license.
Justification for emergency regulations under state law can include “imminent peril” to public health, safety or welfare.
Mueting and Oldenburg will head up a subcommittee to work on the regulations in the meantime.
Commissioners also voted 4-0 to enter a legal partnership with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and Pillen’s Policy Research Office, which allows the commission to contract with DHHS for “legal services.”
Dispensary restrictions
Legislative Bill 677, which fell 10 votes short of the 33 votes needed to change a voter-approved law last month, 23-22, would have provided additional guardrails around the ballot measures that voters overwhelmingly approved in November. Up to 30 dispensaries would have been allowed under that bill, up to 10 in each congressional district.

Under the emergency regulations, no more than one dispensary would be allowed in each of the state’s 12 District Court Judicial Districts. Douglas County (Omaha) and Lancaster County (Lincoln) are the only counties that occupy a single district. Multiple medical cannabis advocates asked the commission to reconsider that specific restriction.
No dispensary could located within 1,000 feet of any school, daycare, church or hospital. At least 51% of an applicant’s business or organization would need to have resided in Nebraska and be a U.S. citizen for at least the past four years. Applicants also would need to pay to submit two legible sets of fingerprints to the FBI and the Nebraska State Patrol for a criminal background check.
Qualifying conditions and allowable products
Unlike LB 677, the emergency regulations do not specify qualifying medical conditions. LB 677 would have outlined 15 conditions eligible for the medicine. That list excluded post-traumatic stress disorder.

Nebraskans in November overwhelmingly legalized up to 5 ounces with the recommendation of a health care practitioner. 
The emergency regulations would require that a recommendation (from any provider nationwide) specify the product being recommended, the recommended dosage and potency, the number of doses, the directions for use and the name of the patient.
The regulations would allow dispensaries to sell: 

Oral tablets, capsules or tinctures.
Non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, gelatinous rectangular cuboids or lozenges in a cube or rectangular cuboid shape.
Gels, oils, creams or other topical preparations
Suppositories.
Transdermal patches.
Liquids or oils for administration using a nebulizer or inhaler.

Dispensaries could not sell raw plant or flower, food or drinks with cannabis infused into it (edibles), any products containing artificial or natural flavoring or coloring and any products administered by smoking, combustion or vaping.
LB 677 would have mandated testing of all products before they could be sold, one of the strictest testing regimes in the country. However, without a legislative change, the commission lacks the explicit authority to regulate testing under the medical cannabis laws. Instead, the emergency regulations say products “may” be submitted for testing or research for development purposes.
Packaging would need to be able to show it had been tampered with, child-resistant, resealable and protected from contamination.

Similar to 2024 restrictions on vaping products, cannabis products could not depict cartoon-like fictional characters or mimic characters primarily aimed at entertaining minors, trademarks or trade dress or products that imitate or mimic products primarily marketed to minors, symbols primarily used to market products to minors or the images and likenesses of celebrities.
Shari Lawlor of Valley told the commission that her 32-year-old daughter, Brooke, has faced severe seizures for the past 31 years but “nothing in modern medicine has helped her,” including brain surgery in 2024.
Shari Lawlor said her daughter has 11 bottles of medications and takes “handfuls” of pills.
“They’re going to kill her. If it’s not one organ, it’s another,” Lawlor said. “I would just like the option to have complete access for the patients, and that’s only by letting all different products on the market.”
Pharmacist concerns
Jim Wilson, a clinical pharmacist speaking on behalf of the Nebraska Pharmacists Association, said he has seen positives and negatives of cannabis. He asked the commission to seek input from pharmacists because of possible side effects with other drug interactions.

Wilson advocated for adding medical cannabis to the state’s prescription drug monitoring program used for other medications, which LB 677 would have done, too.
“We are not interested in the politics or any particular party or any of that,” Wilson told the commission. “We’re interested in the patient and what might happen to them.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who helped advocate for LB 677 in the most recent legislative session, said the commission has no legal authority to restrict the forms of cannabis available to patients.
“To disallow by regulation what is clearly allowed by statute is a slap in the face to the patients and families who need this medicine and the voters of Nebraska who approved it by an overwhelming majority,” he said in a text.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who introduced LB 677, had no immediate reaction.
‘A long ways to go’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the campaign that ushered the laws through the 2024 election, said the ballot measures clearly legalized medical cannabis in all forms, including flower. She said it’s also unclear where completed applications should be sent.
Speaking with reporters after the meeting, Eggers said there are good components to the regulations and that she viewed Thursday’s meeting as productive, while it had some drawbacks. She said that includes the commission voicing an intention to listen to the public and seek feedback.
“Today was a positive day, and I believe that we are moving in a forward direction,” Eggers said. “We’re not there. There’s a long ways to go. But a good foundation today.”
  Commissioner Bruce Bailey of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. June 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Bailey, who chairs the Liquor Control Commission, told Eggers that he and other commissioners had seen the regulations about 12 hours before Thursday’s meeting and hope to tie down and clear up the regulations more about the regulations over the next month.
“We’re asking for public feedback such that these things could be made whole,” Bailey said. “The best we have right now is what’s in here.”
The eventual formal regulations the commission advances this summer must include at least 30 days notice of what’s being considered before a public hearing.
The commission set its next meeting for 1 p.m. Aug. 4, with a location to be determined. If there are no meetings before then, the likely public hearing on the more lasting regulations would be in September.



The Open Meetings Act
Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Lorelle Mueting of Gretna and Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln as the at-large members of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. They join the three governor-appointed members of the Liquor Control Commission: Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, retired District Court Judge J. Michael Coffey of Omaha and Kim Lowe of Kearney.
This was the first meeting for Mueting and Coffey, whom Pillen appointed last week. Pillen did not reappoint Commissioner Harry Hoch, Jr., to Coffey’s seat, even though he applied for reappointment Feb. 2. Three other people applied for the seat.
Hoch withdrew his reappointment application May 20 at the Governor’s Office’s request for more “cannabis experience,” he told the Nebraska Examiner.
State law requires commissions to publish rules or regulations on a commission website, but the Medical Cannabis Commission does not yet have one.
It costs $70,000 to create a website through a specific state vendor, but commissioners can’t collect fees or levy any taxes on medical cannabis and thus have no funds available, unless they “borrow” funds from the Liquor Control Commission. 
The medical cannabis commissioners also don’t have separate state emails or a set state address or phone number.
Asked by commissioners how to remedy that situation, or if they would violate state law without a website, Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Swanson said: “I understand that that’s the position that you’re in. I unfortunately can’t — I don’t have any information for you on how to fix that problem.”
The commission entered closed session multiple times Thursday, often to discuss regulations and/or pending and potential litigation against the commission. 
Commissioners did not state whether a closed session was “clearly necessary” for “the protection of the public interest” or “prevention of needless injury to an individual, if such individual has not requested a public meting” before any of the three times, as required under the Open Meetings Act.
Asked by the Nebraska Examiner whether it was for either of those overarching reasons, Bo Botelho, chief legal officer of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, who is now working with the Medical Cannabis Commission, said, “No.”

Senate President Ty Masterson said the Republican-dominated Legislative Coordinating Council, which conducts state business when the Legislature isn’t in session, would consider an extension of the one-year STAR bond deadline enacted in July 2024. Masterson didn’t indicate how lengthy the extension could be.
Masterson said Mark Donovan, president of the Chiefs, asked Kansas officials to alter the deadline “in light of substantial progress the Chiefs have made in discussions” with the Kansas Department of Commerce on an NFL development on the Kansas side of the border with Missouri.
Those discussions have included building of a stadium, headquarters, practice facility and related business developments, Donovan said.
“The letter from Mark Donovan indicates that the drive to bring this historic project to Kansas is moving down the field,” Masterson said. “Now that we are in the red zone, this extension will provide stakeholders sufficient time to ensure the ball crosses the goal line.”
Missouri or Kansas? Business leaders don’t care as long as Chiefs and Royals stay near KC

Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill last year authorizing issuance of bonds that would cover up to 70% of stadium construction, but the law set the deadline for making a deal at June 30, 2025.
Last month, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed legislation that would finance up to 50% of the cost to renovate or build new stadiums for the Royals and Chiefs. Missouri’s commitment of tax revenue would be capped at $1.5 billion.
The NFL and MLB franchises play at facilities in Kansas City, Missouri, that were built in the early 1970s. Owners of the teams have encouraged formation of public funding packages that would support replacement of those stadiums. Debate about the future of both franchises has rekindled the economic border war between Missouri and Kansas.
The Legislative Coordinating Council would take up the measure altering the deadline at 2 p.m. July 7 in Topeka.
“The complexity and scale of the project, and the importance of crafting a structure that works for all stakeholders, make it clear that more time is needed to bring the effort to full fruition,” Donovan said in a letter to Masterson.
He said the Chiefs had engaged in multiple rounds of dialogue about stadium proposals with the state Department of Commerce. The Chiefs hadn’t received a response to the franchise’s latest proposal in six weeks, he said.
“Extending the secretary’s authority will allow that process to continue productively and will preserve Kansas’ ability to secure the most significant economic development initiative in its history,” Donovan’s letter said.

(Photo by Getty Images) An Iowa lawmaker who pushed for the passage of a bill to create a state program allowing the medicinal use of psilocybin said Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to veto a bill pertaining to the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms was a “great decision.” 
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, said rather than focus on rescheduling a synthetic version of the drug, the state should instead prioritize creating a state program legalizing the psychiatric use of naturally occurring psilocybin. 
House File 383 would have allowed for the prescription and distribution of synthetic psilocybin immediately following federal approval of the drug, and mirrored a similar bill, which was signed into law, in Colorado.

The bill dealt with crystalline polymorph psilocybin, a compound commonly known as COMP360, which is a treatment developed by the biotechnology company Compass Pathways to help patients with treatment of resistant depression, post traumatic stress disorder and anorexia nervosa.

Shipley said he “condemns Compass Pathways” for its approach at creating, and patenting, a synthetic version of the “natural psilocybin that God has given us that everyone knows and loves.” 
Compass Pathways declined to comment on the veto of the bill, which it lobbied in support of, and on Shipley’s comment. 
Shipley’s emailed statement also apologized for his vote in favor of the bill, which passed unanimously in both the House and Senate. 
“The proper legal framework is to reschedule psilocybin to schedule IV or III, and allow the relevant state regulatory boards to make it available as medicine,” Shipley said. 
Reynolds, in her explanation of the veto, similarly said the state should have time to review any federal action on the synthetic version of the drug before it legalizes it at the state level. 
Shipley was a vocal supporter of House File 978, which would have legalized the use of psilocybin for psychiatric treatment through a state program. The proposed program would have operated similarly to the state’s medical cannabis program. 
The bill passed the House with an overwhelming majority in late April, but was not taken up by the Senate. 
“It’s my hope and prayer that the Governor’s office and the Iowa Senate will agree to take up … HF978 as an immediate priority next January,” Shipley said.

But most of the proposals failed to make it over the finish line during the 2025 legislative session, even though seven political operatives, campaign workers and elected officials are currently facing charges for allegedly manipulating Bridgeport’s absentee voting system.
One measure would have banned anyone who is convicted of an election-related crime from passing out candidate petitions or absentee ballot applications to voters for 12 years.
Maria Pereira, one of the defendants who is accused of mishandling absentee ballots during the 2023 election, is already passing out absentee applications for Bridgeport’s municipal primary in September.
Records reviewed by The Connecticut Mirror show Pereira, a member of the city council, obtained 300 absentee ballot applications in late May to distribute to voters ahead of that upcoming election.
Callie Gale Heilmann, one of the founders of Bridgeport Generation Now, said Pereira’s ongoing involvement in the absentee process in Bridgeport is evidence of why the legislature needs to act.
That prohibition against passing out petitions or applications, which was requested by Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas, was a direct response to the ongoing criminal cases stemming from Bridgeport’s 2019 and 2023 Democratic mayoral primaries.
But even with Thomas’s backing, neither the House or Senate took up the legislation before the session closed on June 4. The measure was initially in a Senate bill and was later repackaged into a different House bill that involved several other election reforms.
The Secretary of the State’s office called the measure a “commonsense improvement” to the state’s election laws and vowed to introduce similar bills in future legislative sessions.
“It’s not uncommon for good bills to die on the calendar — it happens every session. In years without a presidential election, election-related legislation can struggle to gain attention amid other priorities,” Roger Senserrich, a spokesperson for the Secretary of the State, said. 
But advocates in Bridgeport, who have repeatedly called for reforms to the state’s absentee ballot laws, were less accepting of the legislature’s failure to take up the measure this session. 
Heilmann and Gemeem Davis, the founders of Bridgeport Generation Now, said they felt like there was finally momentum this session to address the wave of alleged absentee ballot crimes that have taken place in the city in recent years.
But they said that optimism faded as the final days of the legislative session ticked by and most of the election reforms stalled.
“We were very disappointed this session, because despite having people arrested and trials about to begin, our state legislature chose not to move any of the bills forward,” Davis said. “That’s incredibly disappointing because Bridgeport residents and voters across the state deserve to have this issue settled and deserve a democracy that works for all of us.” 
“If we want changed behavior, we have to do things to make sure that that behavior is changed,” Davis added. “It needs to be codified in the law.” 
Lawmakers did approve funding through the state budget to authorize an election monitor in Bridgeport through the end of 2026. But Davis and Heilmann said that is unlikely to prevent the people who have been criminally charged from continuing to influence the city’s elections. 
Heilmann said she would prefer that the state ban every political operative from distributing absentee applications, but she said the 12-year ban for people who are convicted of an election crime would be a start.
“I guess we just expected that the governor, the Secretary of the State and the leaders of the legislature to all prioritize protecting the voters of Bridgeport, given that it’s the largest city in the state of Connecticut and that this scandal has made international news,” Heilmann said.
Several lawmakers, including Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, told CT Mirror that there was bipartisan support for implementing the 12-year ban on anyone who pleads guilty or is convicted of an election crime.
But that was not enough to get the bill to a vote as lawmakers raced in the last week to pass a mountain of other legislation.
Blumenthal said there was a bipartisan agreement in the House to pass the election bill “expeditiously,” but he said the House leadership wanted a similar commitment out of the Senate before they would spend the time to pass it.
Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Duff said he and his colleagues were waiting on the House to pass the final version of the bill, since it originated in that body. 
“As Senate Majority Leader, I am in charge of bills that are before the Senate,” Duff said in a written statement. “I cannot pass a bill that never passed the House and was never before the Senate.”
Sampson, who is the ranking member on GAE, said he intended to offer up more than 15 amendments to the bill, including proposals to implement ID requirements and signature verification for absentee voting. 
But he said that would not have prohibited the House and Senate leadership from passing the legislation, since he didn’t intend to filibuster a bill that he supported. With no other election-related bills coming up for a vote during the session, Sampson said it was his only opportunity to offer up various election policies favored by Republicans. 
As a member of the Republican minority, Sampson said he does not have the power to decide what bills get called up for a vote, and he said it was on the Democrats, who have a supermajority in both chambers, to explain why the election reform wasn’t prioritized. 
“That bill, had it been brought to the floor, I suspect, would have passed unanimously,” Sampson said. “It was their choice whether or not they were willing to potentially pay the price of having to debate some other election-related issues in order to get it across the finish line. But I was not going to filibuster for hours at a time, certainly on bills that I supported.”
“The fact is that when bills do not pass, that is on them,” Sampson said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1107_SR_BridgeportBallots_033-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

About 4,000 physicians signed a letter from the Committee to Protect Health Care, an advocacy group, urging the U.S. Congress to stop cuts to Medicaid included in the “big, beautiful bill,” saying slashing the initially proposed hundreds of billions of dollars would mean taking health care away from millions of Americans who need it the most. 
“Whether by simply slashing funding, or by imposing block grants, per capita caps, work requirements, or other arduous rules that make it harder for eligible patients to maintain coverage, your efforts will have the same result: fewer Americans with access to the care they need all so that billionaires and big corporations receive a tax cut,” the doctors wrote.

As the U.S. Senate reviews it, the bill will change, especially now after the Senate parliamentarian’s Thursday ruling establishing that the proposed Medicaid changes don’t comply with the rules to advance a reconciliation package. 
That means that the Finance Committee leadership must rework or completely eliminate nine changes to health care programs it included in the bill. Republicans won’t be allowed to reduce federal matches to state funding for Medicaid coverage for immigrants lacking proper documentation, among other proposals. 
US Senate GOP mega-bill suffers major blow with ruling on Medicaid cuts

It’s still uncertain how the final plans will look like after the Senate-mandated adjustments. However, on a Wednesday virtual call, physicians from North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine and Utah were bracing for the original Medicaid cuts, which they said would be devastating and affect at least 8.6 million Americans and raise health care costs for millions more.
Dr. Addison Alley, an OB-GYN in Salt Lake City, said that Medicaid is often the only way some of his patients have access to prenatal, postpartum, preventative and lifelong care.
“Thanks to Medicaid I’ve been able to catch life-threatening complications early during people’s pregnancies. My patients have been able to get mental health support while suffering from postpartum depression because of Medicaid,” Alley said. “And women (with) chronic conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes can safely carry their pregnancies to term and deliver healthy babies.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Alley can’t count the number of times Medicaid has made a difference in his practice, he said. One of his patients discovered issues with her baby early in her pregnancy and was able to receive specialized care. Another, also on Medicaid, found out during a routine visit that she had started developing high blood pressure in the third trimester.
“We were able to safely monitor both her and her baby, and deliver her before she developed complications such as a stroke or kidney injury, and were able to prevent negative impacts to her child, including loss of a pregnancy,” Alley said.
Under the initial proposal, about 80,000 Utahns were at risk of losing health care coverage with the state losing an estimated $381 million.
Analysis: Upwards of 80K Utahns could lose health insurance under ‘big, beautiful’ bill’

That scenario, Alley said, doesn’t just mean fewer doctor visits, but more medical crises because when people don’t have health care, they often skip or delay care.
“Women will skip prenatal appointments and miss warning signs. They’ll give birth without ever having seen an obstetrician. Postpartum depression will go undiagnosed, untreated. Cancer screening will not be performed,” Alley said. “And also, the children of these women will suffer as well.” 
“We’re talking about real people, coworkers, neighbors, loved ones, who will face the consequences of legislation that treats health care as optional,” he said.
Some of the most vulnerable to the cuts are in rural areas. In Utah, Alley said, 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees live in rural parts of the state where access is limited and some hospitals, which are already at risk of closing, could completely shut down. 
“That’s why I’m asking Senators Mike Lee and John Curtis on behalf of my patients and their families to protect their health care and reject this dangerous attack on Medicaid,” he said. “I’m hoping our senators will do the right thing, protect Medicaid, protect women, protect babies and protect the communities that rely on this care every day.”
The Senate Parliamentarian is still reviewing whether other health care provisions meet the reconciliation rules. That includes a proposal that would ban using Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services. 
However, other Planned Parenthood-related prohibitions were also unveiled Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a case out of South Carolina that Medicaid recipients won’t have a right to sue to visit the doctor of their choice. That means states may remove clinics from their lists of approved Medicaid providers, including abortion clinics.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 20:39:43+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven pilot seeks to test CT baby bonds program — and close the racial wealth gap,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/wealth-accelerator-ct-baby-bonds-new-haven/,"Through a new pilot program, advocates hope to take another nation-leading step in CT's effort to create wealth in marginalized communities.","In 2023, Connecticut became a national leader when it launched its “baby bonds” program, an experiment that seeks to help vulnerable communities and close the state’s racial wealth gap.
Two years later, advocates in New Haven hope to take another nation-leading step in the state’s effort to create wealth in marginalized communities, by launching a pilot program that will test what happens when the first baby bond recipients turn 18.
Supporters gathered at the Connecticut Center for Arts and Technology on Wednesday for the launch of the Wealth Accelerator, a program that aims to test new approaches to wealth building and economic justice. The ultimate goal of the initiative, supporters say, is to promote economic equity in Connecticut.  
“We want to see intergenerational wealth transfers come from this work,” said Yaw Owusu-Boahen, the Accelerator’s inaugural director. 
The accelerator employs strategies similar to the tech industry, focusing on a model that Owusu-Boahen described as “ideation, incubation and scale,” and will formally start its first program, called “Cash Catalyst,” in August. 
The Cash Catalyst program will serve as the nation’s first “accelerated baby bonds” program, giving financial education and over $500,000 in direct cash to participants between the ages of 18 and 30. Those are the same ages that Connecticut baby bonds participants will be when they are allowed to access their money. 
The effort will stick closely to the conditions laid out in the state’s baby bonds program in the hopes of providing insights into future distributions. By tracking the outcomes and headwinds participants face, the program should offer valuable data as other states — and the federal government — consider similar investment programs. 
The Cash Catalyst program could also have immediate economic impacts in New Haven. Advocates anticipate the money, given directly to participants, will help more people in the region start down the path toward economic stability.
“We’re going to prove that building wealth in Black and brown communities, in low income communities, in historically excluded communities, is not only possible, it’s necessary,” said Karen DuBois-Walton, the president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Greater New Haven, and a member of the Wealth Accelerator’s steering committee. 
A $564,000 test
The Cash Catalyst program will provide a close simulation of the state’s baby bonds initiative, which was first launched on July 1, 2023. Babies born to households enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, HUSKY, on or after that date receive $3,200 in an investment account.
Over time, that money will grow, and when recipients are between ages 18 and 30, they’ll be able to withdraw from their accounts. The money may then be put toward a variety of approved expenses, including starting a business, making a down payment on a home, paying for college, or making other financial investments.  
To model what this distribution — which will begin when the first baby bonds recipients turn 18 in 2041 — will look like, the cash catalyst program will also focus on giving money to people between the ages of 18 and 30. Eighty-two participants have been selected for the program, each will receive $2,000 to pay off debts, start a savings account or make other investments. 
In addition, 20 of the participants will be randomly selected to receive a separate $20,000 “cash injection” that will be subject to the same spending requirements as the baby bonds. 
In total, the pilot program is expected to distribute $564,000 to participants. The money has been provided with the support of M&T Bank, Edward Jones and the Connecticut Project. Other local and national partners provided additional research and planning support. 
By structuring the program in this way, Owusu-Boahen explained in an interview, the program aims to show how the future baby bonds participants might spend the invested money.
The program will also include a financial education component. Prior to receiving any money, all participants will go through a series of eight financial literacy classes that will teach skills like budgeting, investing, and long-term financial planning. They will also have sustained access to MoneyByrd, a financial planning app that will help them maintain the skills taught during the program. 
“We want folks to come through the program to walk away feeling more confident about their finances,” Owusu-Boahen said. 
Each participant has been selected after completing a workforce development or educational program or other training provided by the Connecticut Center for Arts and Technology (ConnCAT). The program will release the first round of funds, the $2,000 payments, later this year. Those selected for the $20,000 payment will receive the money in two installments, the first half will be distributed in January 2026, and the second in January 2027. 
‘We are doing this work for those who have yet to be born’
At the launch event, speakers noted that the pilot program could help reverse historic inequities in New Haven and the state more broadly. 
“When communities are in the driver’s seat, when they’re truly heard, meaningful and lasting change becomes possible,” said Arden Santana, the chair of the Wealth Accelerator’s 10-member resident council, a group of community advisors who will support the program and provide insights from the area. 
The pilot program comes as baby bonds initiatives receive national attention, and as the Trump administration is pushing its own version of the concept. Known as “Trump Accounts” that proposal would give newborns a $1,000 savings account from the federal government that parents could add money to over time. There are no income restrictions on entering the program, and children born between 2025 and the end of 2028 would be eligible. 
But that proposal, which comes after years of more targeted baby bonds initiatives failing at the federal level, has faced criticism for likely helping wealthier families more than poorer ones, making it unlikely to have an effect on the wealth gap. 
In Connecticut, supporters of baby bonds stressed the importance of focusing on disadvantaged groups. 
“I know the sting of poverty, I know the psychic pain of poverty, and I know what it does to one’s confidence,” said Erik Clemons, the founding CEO of ConnCAT and the Connecticut Community Outreach and Revitalization Program. “We are doing this work for those who have yet to be born.” 
Owusu-Boahen said the Cash Catalyst program will have at least one more cohort in the future, this one pulling from neighborhoods beyond New Haven in the hopes of understanding different conditions in the state. He hopes the pilot will provide insights that will help across the country, encouraging other states and communities to develop their own baby bonds initiatives.
In the coming months, the Wealth Accelerator will look toward finding new programs it can launch, all aimed at pulling communities out of poverty. 
“As an institution, we’re saying you matter,” Owusu-Boahen said. “You’ve been historically excluded. You’ve been historically not given opportunities. This is us giving you that opportunity and validating that you can do it — you can build wealth, you can change your economic circumstances.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OwusuBoahenWealthAccelerator-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

DeSantis' office in 2019. (Photo by Mitch Petty/Florida Phoenix).Among the new laws that will go into effect in Florida on July 1 is one of the most controversial of the just completed legislative session — HB 1205, which will make it much more challenging for citizen-led constitutional amendments to get on the ballot.
That’s why there’s an effort taking place this weekend for a petition signature “surge” for the various campaigns working to get initiatives on the 2026 ballot.
Although the effort is statewide, it’s focusing on seven of the biggest counties in the state — Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Lee, Orange, Hillsborough and Duval — because they touch the 14 congressional districts being prioritized by a new campaign for a proposed amendment to overturn the new law.
There will also be an intense focus on collecting signatures this weekend in St. Petersburg, where hundreds of thousands of people are expected to participate on both Saturday and Sunday at the St. Pete Pride Festival.
Sponsors of citizen-led initiatives need to get approval from the Florida Supreme Court on the clarity of any amendment summary, gather 880,062 valid signatures from at least half of the state’s 28 congressional districts to appear on the ballot, and win at least 60% voter approval to pass. Those efforts are expected to become much more challenging once the new law takes effect next Tuesday.
Sending a message 
“We’re obviously urging them to sign the petitions, help us get to the threshold that we need for the total number of petitions across the state, but it also sends a message that in every corner of this state folks are waking up to the fact that [Gov. Ron] DeSantis is trying to crush our constitutional amendment petition rights — and we the voters, across party lines, Democratic, Republican and independent, are not going to allow him to crush those rights without a fight,” said Chris Wills, with the Florida Constitutional Amendment Network.
That particular group is working to get three separate constitutional amendments on the 2026 ballot: one that would overturn the new legislation on citizen-led constitutional amendments; another that would provide constitutional protections for any individuals or businesses that purchase an insurance policy in the state; and a third that would allow all voters to sign petitions electronically.
Among the active campaigns to qualify for the 2026 statewide ballot are proposals to:

Establish a right to clean water.
A return effort by the group Smart & Safe Florida to legalize recreational cannabis for adults 21 and older.
Expand Medicaid by the group Florida Decides Healthcare.

The latter two groups are involved in a federal lawsuit aimed at overturning the petition-gathering restrictions. They have claimed in court documents that the new law is “legislative gaslighting” not designed to block fraud in the initiative process as claimed by DeSantis and members of the Legislature, but to “effectively destroy the people’s right to invoke the citizen initiative.”
The Republican Party of Florida has since joined the lawsuit, defending the state law.
The Miami-based Wills has worked with both Republicans and Democrats for nearly three decades. He was former district secretary for Miami-Dade County Republican state Rep. Carlos Lopez-Cantera before joining with him as a staffer when he was appointed by Rick Scott to serve as lieutenant governor.
But he quit the GOP in 2016 after Donald Trump won the party’s presidential nomination and now works with Democrats. He says voters of all political affiliations should be outraged by the decision of DeSantis and the Legislature to restrict the power of the citizenry to effect change at the state level.
“As we talk to folks in a nonpartisan way, we have lots of folks that are realizing that no governor or legislator, whether they’re a Democrat, Republican, or independent, should be empowered to rip away the constitutional rights of the citizens’ initiative process,” he said. “It’s our process. It’s protected by our Constitution. It’s enshrined in our Constitution, and no politician should be able to rip it away no matter what party they are. And so we’re getting lots of support across the entire state.”
Restrictions to go into place
Starting on July 1, the state will require people collecting signatures and petitions to register with the Secretary of State. People convicted of felonies who haven’t had their voting rights restored, non-U.S. citizens, and non-Florida residents could no longer collect signatures or petitions. The law will require signed petitions to be returned to the supervisor of elections office within 10 days after the voter signs them, a much quicker turnaround than the existing 30 days allowed. Fines will accrue by $100 for each day those petitions are returned after 10 days.
Other new restrictions target people who collect, deliver, or otherwise physically possess more than 25 signed petition forms in addition to his or her own signed petition form or a signed petition form belonging to an immediate family member, and who is not registered as a petition circulator. They’d be liable to a third-degree felony.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 20:28:07+00:00,CT Mirror,Audit finds more kids missing from CT foster care,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/ct-kids-foster-care-dcf-report/,"Children went missing from DCF care about 3,700 times from fiscal years 2021 to 2023, and the number of incidents increased by 42%.","As the number of foster children who ran away and went missing increased, the state Department of Children and Families didn’t do enough to make sure it didn’t happen again or make sure the kids were safe, according to a new audit.
The Connecticut Auditors of Public Accounts on Wednesday released a report about children who went missing from foster care from fiscal years 2021 to 2023. 
Children went missing from DCF care about 3,700 times from fiscal years 2021 to 2023. Over that time period, the number of incidents increased by 42%, the audit found.
The audit also found that DCF hadn’t followed the law in some cases and had failed to implement internal controls to make sure children stayed safe.
“The findings in this audit, in my opinion, are serious, and I think they deserve serious attention, and no child in the care of our state should ever fall through the cracks,” said Children’s Committee co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.
In the audit documents, DCF said that it had implemented several measures to treat the needs of the kids who go missing and to reduce the number who run away from care. Many of the children have trauma and complicated needs, and one of the responses may be to run away.
The report says that running away can expose children to other adverse consequences like human trafficking, involvement with the criminal justice system, substance use and falling behind in school.
The kids who go missing from care tend to do so multiple times. Less than 5% of the total number of foster children go missing, and one child went missing 100 times. Most of the kids who went missing were teenagers, and they were more often girls.
On average, they were missing for eight days, although the longest period was more than two years. Two of the children were still missing when auditors received data from DCF. One was still missing as recently as April. A DCF spokesman said all the children in the report are now accounted for and safe.
Auditors found that DCF didn’t properly analyze the instances of children going missing and had squandered an opportunity to ensure it didn’t happen again.
“Given that over 50% of the youth who are missing from care are older youth being served in congregate care settings, many with high acuity and complex needs, the Department has implemented several enhancements to its continuum of care for this population,” the agency’s response said.
DCF has since added new guidance and protocols to keep kids safe and is doing further research on the topic.
“It’s also important to understand that some youth are coming into care in their late teen years without any prior/current DCF involvement following an arrest when placement by the court in a juvenile residential center (detention) or return home is not an option,” the agency’s response said. “However, unlike detention, DCF does not (and should not) operate or contract for locked placement settings for children.”
Paris agreed that DCF is making progress.
“I truly think that this isn’t necessarily a story of inaction, that this is a story of a system under strain and trying to evolve, and trying to evolve in the 21st century, and making some meaningful strides in doing so,” Paris said.
The report also examined the cases of six teenage girls and said DCF hadn’t met their needs. Social workers and service providers said they needed more care to stay safe and that the appropriate level of care wasn’t available.
The six girls went missing a total of 341 times over three years.
Most of the children who ran away were also in congregate care settings, according to the report.
In 2023, allegations of abuse and neglect emerged from a congregate care home in Harwinton that served teenage girls. After the reports, DCF announced reforms to the Short Term Assessment and Respite Homes to ensure kids were getting more trauma-informed treatment.
Service providers said what happened at the Harwinton house was, in part, the result of a strained mental health care system for children. Increased need left the state without enough placements for kids with complicated therapeutic needs.
The audit also found that in 94% of the cases auditors examined closely, DCF didn’t document whether they screened children for sex trafficking after they’d been returned to care. This violates federal laws around foster care programs for states.
In the audit documents, DCF disagreed with the finding, saying they had developed protocols for screening.
Auditors said that DCF should establish clear protocols for reviewing cases of missing children to ensure they get the treatment they need after the incident and prevent these types of incidents from occurring. The report included more than a dozen recommendations.
Paris said there needs to be more placement options for kids who have been through trauma, especially in smaller settings like therapeutic foster care.
“We talk a big game in our state about kids being our priority and kids being the future,” Paris said. “If we want to combat poverty, if we want to combat challenges and generational traumas, the only way that we can do that for this key demographic of marginalized folks, is by actually giving more resources to agencies like DCF.”
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, said she needs to check in with DCF to learn more about their current practices, pointing out that the data is about two years old.
“I know from my work with them that they are addressing what were failures, and they’re working to be more proactive,” Maher said.
Children’s Committee ranking member Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, issued a statement Wednesday calling for DCF officials’ “immediate attention” to the issue.
“The audit points the way toward corrective measures which can prevent future tragedies involving vulnerable Connecticut children,” the statement said.
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said in a written statement that although some of the findings were already known, they are troubling.
“Children in these situations are among the most vulnerable in our state and deserve nothing less than a system that intervenes swiftly and effectively,” Dauphinais said. “The commissioner must take these findings seriously and act on the recommendations without delay. We cannot allow this to become another case where auditors return years later with the same findings.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0216_SR_DCFCommissioner_058-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Politicians and several nonprofits that advocate for those affected by poverty Thursday urged Alabama’s congressional delegation to vote against the budget reconciliation bill under consideration in the U.S. Senate.
Speaking at a press conference at the Alabama Statehouse, representatives from Alabama Arise and the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign said proposed reductions to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would make it more difficult for state residents to have access to food and health care.
“This budget is not just a spreadsheet of numbers, it is a moral document,” said Rev. Valtoria Jackson, Montgomery lead organizer for the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign. “And in its current form it will deepen poverty, strip vital support from our most vulnerable neighbors and cost lives right here in Alabama.”

The House of Representatives passed the measure by the narrowest of margins in May. The Senate has taken it under consideration. President Donald Trump has said he wants it passed before the July 4 holiday.
The proposed legislation requires that individual states bear more of the cost for funding both SNAP and Medicaid. The legislation increases the administrative costs of SNAP borne by the states from 50% to 75%. It also shifts a greater percentage of the cost for providing the benefit itself, based on a state’s error rate.
Alabama’s error rate of 7% is one of the lowest in the nation, according to Michael Ledger, president and CEO of Feeding the Gulf Coast, but would still not be exempt from the penalty because the cutoff is a 6% error rate.
“Based on Alabama’s most recent error rate, we would have to cover around $86 million in food assistance each year,” said Carol Gundlach, a policy analyst with Alabama Arise, in a fact sheet presented to the media after the meeting. “The total of the two cost shifts is $121 million per year which would, presumably, come from the Alabama General Fund.”
Speakers said the legislation would reduce the state’s economy by $1.14 billion and potentially cost almost 200,000 people their medical coverage. Speakers also said it could cost 800,000 Alabama residents access to food subsidies.
Opponents of the bill gained a slight victory on Thursday after the Senate parliamentarian stated that some of the measures that targeted Medicaid violated rules for moving forward with the reconciliation process. But even before that, however, GOP senators were having trouble coming to an agreement on the comprehensive budget bill.
The legislation would also expand an 80-hour per month work requirement to more classes of people, placing an additional burden to submit paperwork to prove they met that eligibility criteria.
“By increasing these work requirements, there is more administration, which increases the odds of error rates, which then, insidiously, makes the penalty that we pay go up while eliminating the benefits for people who are working,” Ledger said.
As for Medicaid,the bill does not renew financial subsidies made available by the Biden administration set to expire at the end of the year for those who purchase Affordable Care Act plans through the health care market exchange.
That would increase the price of health insurance and increase the coverage gap for people who generate incomes that make them ineligible for Medicaid and other social service programs.
“There is the provider tax freeze that we are unsure if that is going to remain that will impact Alabama for up to $400 million per year,” said Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise.
The legislation prohibits the state from levying new provider taxes. Currently, the state imposes provider taxes on hospitals and nursing facilities that generate revenues that Alabama uses to fund a part of the state’s share of Medicaid, while the rest is supplemented by the federal government.
Advocates were already concerned with the state’s health care infrastructure amid rural hospital closings. The bill, which reduces people’s access to health insurance, could exacerbate the problem as more physicians and medical providers hemorrhage patients.
“The late Congressman Elijah Cummings had a wonderful saying, ‘Our children are the living message we send to a future that we will not see,’” said Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery at the news conference. “If we are continuing at this pace, even our babies will not get a chance to see that. And they will not certainly be able to partake in our society in a way that their parents and grandparents were able to inherit and do better.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250626_110028-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-26 17:08:30.816238

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
How 2 words could decide whether SC can remove Planned Parenthood from list of Medicaid providers

The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.

Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.

If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”
What does this mean for Indiana?
Planned Parenthood’s chapter in Indiana painted the ruling as “paving the way for other hostile states to attack” the organization, which provides health care to thousands of Hoosiers, according to a news release. 
“Abortion is already illegal in Indiana, making today’s ruling a vehicle that paves the way for hostile elected leaders to discriminate against Planned Parenthood and our patients based on care not even provided in this state,” said coalition CEO Rebecca Gibron. 
Hoosier lawmakers approved an abortion ban with narrow exceptions and eliminated state licensure of abortion clinics in 2022. A small number of procedures still occur in Indiana, but they must be performed by hospitals or hospital-owned outpatient centers.

Planned Parenthood indicated the ruling doesn’t directly impact its participation in Medicaid outside South Carolina unless other states like Indiana take action — which the news release said was “fully expect(ed).” 
Anti-abortion advocates with Indiana Right to Life celebrated the move, pointing to a 2011 Indiana law that sought to do the same as South Carolina but was blocked by courts. 
“Today’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling has been a long time coming. Indiana’s right to stop using Medicaid dollars to fund Planned Parenthood, and its business of abortion, is finally validated,” CEO Mike Fichter said. 
“Today is a new day,” he added. “With this SCOTUS ruling handing Indiana this victory, we are asking Attorney General Todd Rokita to immediately move to have the 2012 injunction vacated and for the State of Indiana to terminate all Medicaid contracts with Planned Parenthood.”

(Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)This story originally appeared on Stateline.
Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
In Alabama, the under-18 population remained flat from 2020 to 2024, at about 1.13 million people, according to the bureau. The over-65 population grew from about 861,000 in 2020 to nearly 956,000 in 2024 (11%).
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

(Photo illustration by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Corrections has lost access to more than $25,000 in federal funding meant to aid in the investigation and prevention of sexual assaults in prisons and jails.
The state Bureau of Finance and Management publishes a rundown, updated weekly, of dollars lost to the state through Trump administration cuts. The latest list includes a loss of $25,332 in “strategic support” money for compliance with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act.
The act requires prisons and jails to document sexual assaults behind bars, protect victims who report incidents and ensure adequate safeguards are in place to prevent assaults.
The lost money would have been a second-year award in a two-year grant. The state already received $28,419.
The finance bureau’s newest spreadsheet lists $23.7 million in total federal funding lost across various state agencies and projects since the start of the Trump administration.
DOC: State facilities in compliance
The DOC says it doesn’t actually need the lost federal dollars to comply with the federal law on sexual assaults in prisons. As of this week, the agency hadn’t spent all the money from the first grant award.  
Corrections spokesman Michael Winder told South Dakota Searchlight that the agency spent about $16,000 from the first year’s funding for “educational literature and training.” 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


That material included wall posters instructing prisoners on how to report sexual assaults, which listed addresses for anonymous reporting and the number to dial from inmate tablets to report an assault. The department also printed “no means no” posters, six-step staff procedure cards outlining what to do when an inmate reports a sexual assault, and pamphlets on the rape elimination act for inmates and their friends and family members.
The grant was awarded to help the department comply with the law, and Winder said it now does. He said South Dakota’s facilities are “continuously audited” for compliance with the federal statute. The remaining $12,000 from 2023, he said, will be used “to provide continued training and advancement for staff who respond, investigate, and provide continued care for victims of sexual violence within the correctional facilities.”
The state penitentiary’s most recent federal audit was finalized in January. The report found no deficiencies. Audits of each state correctional facility since 2019, as listed on the department’s website, showed no deficiencies.
In 2023, the most recent year for which data are available, there were 22 substantiated sexual assault reports in South Dakota prisons.
That was 22 out of 148 investigations tied to the Prison Rape Elimination Act. The department declined to offer details on the substantiated incidents, citing exemptions in South Dakota open records law for law enforcement records or records that could endanger others, as well as a provision in the act that bars the release of information on individual incidents.
That most recent annual report notes that the department “began tracking and reporting investigations in a consistent and efficient manner” in 2023.
Broader impact of federal funding cuts
The loss of the remaining $25,332 for South Dakota was part of the fallout from a decision by the Trump administration to cancel a host of grants related to the Prison Rape Elimination Act  Resource Center. 
The cuts effectively shut down the resource center for a short period of time. Until the change, the nonprofit organization had dozens of employees, laboring under a collaborative agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Overdose deaths, gang violence draw charges in some — not all — recent prison incidents

Many of them worked to review the audits required of every correctional facility in the U.S. every three years, and served as a resource to connect prisons and jails nationwide with partners who could help them do things like train officers on how to handle sexual assault reports.
A California-based nonprofit called Just Detention International is among the organizations that relied on and worked with the resource center. Its mission is tied specifically to sexual assaults and harassment in correctional settings.
In South Dakota, the group worked with the Rosebud Sioux Tribe to build a compliant sexual assault prevention and reporting framework for a juvenile detention facility. It’s also listed as a resource for victims in the most recent penitentiary audit for South Dakota. 
Linda McFarlane, Just Detention’s executive director, told South Dakota Searchlight that some staff at the resource center have returned since April, when the grants for states and the resource center were rescinded. 
All the audits conducted across the U.S. since 2022 remain archived on the resource center website, but McFarlane worries the pared-down staff won’t be able to review them. She’s also troubled that the funding cuts removed the staff that trained investigators and connected local coordinators with resources.
“Part of the problem was that this message was sent, that PREA is no longer taken seriously,” McFarlane said. “I think people misunderstood the defunding of the PREA Resource Center to mean the law was no longer in effect. And that is absolutely not true.”
McFarlane was glad to hear that South Dakota intends to continue adhering to the law, but she worries that jailers who may have never taken the law seriously will feel empowered to ignore it. 
“We heard from survivors and from currently incarcerated people that this felt like a huge slap in the face, that the government was signaling that they no longer take their safety seriously,” McFarlane said. “And from within the corrections departments, the people who take it seriously were panicked.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.
Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.
If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”

Greg Gianforte announced in June 2025. (Provided by the Governor's Office)Lawmaker and military veteran Marta Bertoglio is the new director of the Montana Department of Commerce, Gov. Greg Gianforte recently announced.
“Marta has been a strong partner in the Legislature and is a driven leader, dedicated to making Montana the best place to do business,” Gianforte said in a news release. “With Marta at the helm of the Department of Commerce, I am confident in her ability to recruit businesses that create good-paying jobs, helping more Montanans achieve the American dream.”
Bertoglio, a Republican of Jefferson County, was elected to the Montana House of Representatives in 2020. She resigned the post last week.
In the most recent legislative session, Bertoglio was a majority whip who served on the Education, Local Government, and State Administration committees, according to Legislative Services Division.
A real estate broker and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Bertoglio has owned and operated her small business for nearly a decade, the Governor’s Office said in the news release posted on its website last week.
“Having grown up in a small Montana town, I know how important business is to helping build community,” said Bertoglio in a statement. “By fostering resilient communities and making sure Montana is the best place to do business, we can create a bright future for our state.”
A native of Deer Lodge, Bertoglio graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1991 and went on to serve in the Air Force with her husband before returning to Montana in 2007, the news release said.
In 2016, she started a boutique real estate firm based in Helena with satellite locations across the state, according to the Governor’s Office. In addition to her legislative service, Bertoglio previously served as a trustee on the Montana City School Board.
The news release said she and her husband, Joe, live in Clancy, and have two children.
The Montana Secretary of State’s Office said Bertoglio submitted her resignation to her legislative seat on June 16, effective immediately.
The Jefferson County Republican Central Committee will provide the Jefferson County Commissioners with a list of three prospective appointees to fill the vacancy, and Commissioners will confirm an appointment within 15 days of receiving the list, said a letter from the Secretary of State to Commissioners.
In an email to the Daily Montanan, Jefferson County Commission Chairman Dan Hagerty said he anticipates receiving recommendations for the appointment by possibly next week.
In February, Gianforte, a Republican, announced that former lawmaker Paul Green, then-director of the Department of Commerce, stepped down from his role to spend more time with family after roughly one year on the job.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A union organizing campaign has turned into a contentious conflict at a Madison-based health care nonprofit.
The organizing drive at Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin has gotten mired in a mountain of litigation before the National Labor Relations Board.
There have been disputes over who should be included in a union representation vote as well as dozens of unfair labor practice charges that the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has filed against Group Health management.
Most recently, the NLRB’s regional director has issued an order blocking the election after the union argued that the charges against the co-op would taint the outcome. Group Health is denying the charges, and co-op executives say they want a vote to take place as soon as possible.
The Group Health co-op was founded nearly 50 years ago as a health maintenance organization. Members, who include its employees, say the nonprofit’s focus on primary care and wellness has been central to its appeal. Those who support the union contend that the co-op’s response to the union drive is betraying its progressive roots.
“Everyone involved are gut-wrenched by the animosity that has developed,” said Susan McMurray, a former public employee union lobbyist and Group Health member for nearly 20 years. McMurray spoke at  a union rally outside Group Health’s clinic on Madison’s far East Side on June 20.
“There’s a multitude of reasons many of us chose a cooperative model over a for-profit shareholder model for our health care and insurance over the past almost 50 years,” said retired state employee Ruth Brill, a Group Health member, at a May 13 rally for the union.
“Some of our fellow GHC members have chosen to form a union. A union is like a cooperative in almost every way,” Brill said. “I’m calling on GHC to uphold the cooperative principles that it was founded on.”
In an interview, Marty Anderson, Group Health’s chief strategy and business development officer, rejected the accusation that the co-op has engaged in union-busting.
“GHC is not opposed to a union here at the cooperative,” Anderson said. “I think our position all along has been that we want our employees to have a voice — all of our employees, to have a voice in that choice.”
But Group Health co-op members who support the union see the management’s response — challenging the union’s proposal for who would vote as well as distributing messages to workers criticizing the union — more critically.
Paul Terranova, a community organizer, said he got involved in trying to persuade the co-op’s board to take a different approach earlier this year after a conversation with his Group Health doctor.
Terranova put together a group of members and asked for a board meeting in March.
“They gave us 20 minutes on the agenda to speak,” he told the Wisconsin Examiner. “It was just us making a presentation to them and them saying ‘thank you.’”
Terranova said his group asked the board and the management to “stop the anti-union messaging [and] anti-union activity” and to “get a second opinion” from other nonprofits that work cooperatively with union-represented employees.
“They refused to engage and they denied that there was any anti-union activity or messaging going on,” he said.
Terranova is also part of a member campaign that has endorsed, with the union, four candidates for the Group Health board in elections that concluded this week. The election results are expected to be released when the board holds its annual meeting online starting at 5:30 p.m. Thursday.
Staffing struggles
The pro-union employees and SEIU filed a petition in December 2024 for a union representing Group Health clinic doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and nursing staff in three departments: primary care, urgent care and dermatology. They also included physical therapists, occupational therapists and health educators.
According to union supporters, nearly 70% of the workers in those jobs and departments had signed cards asking for union representation.

Union supporters say that in those departments, issues including employee turnover and increased workloads prompted the campaign.
“We’re calling for equitable wages, safe provider-to-nurse ratios, meaningful ways to ease the crushing workloads we face and real strategies to improve retention,” said Dr. Ira Segal at the June 20 rally.
“There’s been a lot more turnover in our staffing, and that has increased over the years, which negatively impacts our ability to provide excellent care,” said Dr. Nisha Rajagopalan, a family physician. “The increasing turnover in our staff is unsustainable.”
Staffing crunches in health care have been widespread in the last five years, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“There just aren’t enough care providers and folks that assist those care providers within the [health care] system in total,” said Anderson, the Group Health executive. “We’ve had to flex with the changing health care environment.”
Julie Vander Werff, a physician assistant and union supporter, said she understands the health care workforce challenge. Despite that, she said, she’s experienced a shift in the co-op’s culture that is contributing to the problem.
“They used to be a very respectful employer, and they’ve really gotten off track in terms of how respectful they have been,” Vander Werff said in an interview. “And they’re being really punitive, and we’re losing staff as a result with high, high turnover rates.”
Who’s in, who’s out
The bargaining unit called for in the union’s original petition did not include other Group Health departments: optometry, behavioral health, radiology and pharmacy. It also did not include physical therapist techs, lab techs and interpreters, social workers, receptionists and maintenance staff.

Addressing the June 20 rally, Vander Werff explained that “other departments who are not under primary care leadership are happy with their jobs” and not interested in unionizing. “But primary care is not.”
From the start, Group Health challenged the bargaining unit described in the petition, according to a letter that employees leading the union drive sent to the Group Health board of directors on Feb. 10.
“Federal labor law says that to form a union, workers need petition only for ‘an’ appropriate bargaining unit — not ‘the’ most appropriate bargaining unit (however that would be determined), and certainly not the unit their employers would most prefer,” the employees wrote. “Rather than accepting a unit of GHC workers’ rightful choice, however, administration and counsel have chosen to contest our bargaining unit.”
Still at an impasse after two days of hearings before an NLRB hearing officer, the union amended its election petition to focus on a single Group Health facility, the Capitol Clinic on Madison’s near West Side. The employees wrote in the Feb. 10 letter that the change was made at the NLRB official’s suggestion.
Group Health challenged that, too. After an additional hearing, the Minneapolis-based NLRB regional director rejected the union’s petition for a single-clinic vote. The decision directed an election covering all clinical departments at Group Health — the bargaining unit that the co-op management sought.
Group Health’s position is that the bargaining unit the employees sought “didn’t include classes or employees that do go between our clinics,” Anderson said. “And because we are an integrated care delivery system, we need to make sure that all the appropriate employees are in the bargaining class.”  
While some Group Health members see the response to the union drive as a turn from the co-op’s roots, Anderson defended it. 
“We were formed by a vote of our members, our board is elected by our members, and I think this goes right along with our ethos as a cooperative to allow our employees the opportunity to vote,” he said.
Pro-democracy, or diluting support?
Employees involved in the union campaign and their allies among the co-op’s members argue that the management claim is disingenuous, however.
“While the administration claims they’re fighting us in order to give everyone a voice, this is a union-busting tactic to prevent workers from winning in a fast and fair election of our choosing,” the Group Health workers wrote. “Anti-union organizations do this to flood the unit with people that they hope will vote against our union.”
According to an NLRB report on union representation elections in 2023, 89% of employers didn’t challenge the workers’ proposed bargaining unit. 
Group Health member Paul Terranova rejected the idea that expanding the vote to include people in jobs and departments who weren’t interested in the union was “just trying to be democratic.”
 “If folks in Madison decided we wanted to put something on a referendum, and the state Legislature said ‘No, everyone in the state has to vote on it,’ everyone would know right away what they were doing,” Terranova said. “People would call BS. It’s the same thing here, right?”
“The right of workers to unionize and to decide what our union looks like . . .  doesn’t belong to administration,” Sarah Spolum, a physician assistant, said at the May union rally. “It doesn’t belong to lawyers. It belongs to us, the workers.”
Anderson said Group Health stands by its position. “We have no idea how our employees are going to vote,” he said. “That’s why we want to get to a vote — because we want that certainty and we want to know what our employees are feeling.”
Unfair labor practice charges
Throughout the campaign, the union has filed charges with the NLRB accusing Group Health management of numerous unfair labor practices. The allegations include changes in pay practices due to union organizing, surveillance of employees for union activity, prohibiting employees from displaying union-related materials, firing union supporters and a variety of other actions.
Group Health has denied all the charges.
After the co-op management’s bargaining unit petition was granted, however, the union petitioned the NLRB to block an election. The agency’s regional director granted the petition, ordering the election to be suspended until all the unfair labor practice charges are resolved.
The union, wrote regional director Jennifer Hadsall, “provided sufficient offers of proof which describe evidence that, if proven, would interfere with employee free choice in the election.”
Group Health, through its lawyer, has demanded a hearing on the allegations in the blocking charge, contending that it’s a smokescreen for diminished support.

At the union’s June 20 rally, Susan McMurray read from a letter she sent to Group Health’s CEO.
“Nothing good will come of this decision,” she said of the co-op’s stance during the union campaign. “It will in my view ruin GHC’s reputation in our community, cause irreparable harm to staff, as well as jeopardize patient care.
“And it didn’t and it doesn’t have to be like this,” she added. “In the past few weeks, I have communicated to management repeatedly that we could find a way through the strife and give everyone a graceful way out, a path going forward and something positive to announce at the annual meeting.”



Bad timing? Campaign comes as federal environment turns against unions
The Group Health union campaign is taking place under conditions that are expected to be more hostile to unions in  President Donald Trump’s second term.
In NLRB filings, the co-op’s legal team has staked out an agenda to roll back past NLRB decisions that were seen as more favorable to union organizing.
Federal labor law precedents tend to shift with whichever party holds the White House, as National Labor Relations Board appointments are made by the president.
A 2011 NLRB ruling during the first term of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, held that it was mostly up to workers organizing a union to define their bargaining unit, as long as it was appropriate and reasonable.
That presumption was overturned by the NLRB when the White House was held by a Republican during Trump’s first term, then reinstated in 2022 in a subsequent case under Democratic President Joe Biden.
In a footnote, Group Health’s legal brief for its preferred bargaining unit states that the 2011 and 2022 decisions favoring how workers define a unit “were wrongly decided and, as necessary, [Group Health] will seek to overturn those decisions.”

Janet Mills shares remarks at a Harris Campaign presidential debate watch party in Portland on Sept. 10. (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills urged Maine’s congressional delegation to reject the budget reconciliation bill, citing “profoundly harmful consequences” for Mainers.
In a letter dated June 25, Mills focused specifically on the health care impacts of the bill, which aims to slash funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides benefits to 175,000 low-income Mainers. She also warned that plans to roll back clean energy tax credits would hobble the state’s progress towards adopting more sustainable energy sources.
The governor warned that, if the bill comes to pass, thousands of people might be left without health insurance, and the strain on rural hospitals will increase, echoing nonprofit organizations and health care providers that have been raising the alarm over the past few weeks.
“States like Maine do not have the financial resources to absorb cuts of this magnitude,” Mills wrote to Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden. “Slashing essential services in this manner will only do the opposite of lowering taxes and fostering economic growth.”
Impact on health care 
Mills warned that the bill would cut $5.9 billion from Maine’s Medicaid program, MaineCare, over the next decade, $4.5 billion of which would be lost federal funds.
Currently, almost 392,000 Mainers are enrolled in MaineCare, with 40% of rural Mainers in Aroostook, Washington, and Somerset counties relying on the program. The governor said these cuts would likely strip health coverage from tens of thousands and increase the burden on hospitals. 
According to a May report from The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, five of Maine’s rural hospitals are already at immediate risk of closure.
And some reproductive health providers in those counties, such as Maine Family Planning, only operate one day a week because of the increasing cost of healthcare. The bill also proposes cutting funding to family planning organizations and making them ineligible for federal reimbursements. 
Other proposed changes to health coverage in the reconciliation bill, such as the elimination of automatic re-enrollment and cost-sharing subsidies, would make marketplace insurance less accessible and drive up premiums, Mills said.
Cuts to SNAP
The bill proposes requiring states to cover up to 15% of the cost of SNAP, which the federal government has historically funded in full. Currently, Maine’s SNAP program costs $356 million, which means the state could be responsible for coming up with as much as $60 million a year by 2028, when administrative costs are also factored in, which is “a cost the state simply cannot absorb,” she said.
That means the 175,000 Mainers currently relying on SNAP risk going hungry, Mills wrote.
Rollback of clean energy tax credits
Mills said the proposed repeal of clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits would undercut the state’s progress in transitioning to cleaner and cheaper energy sources. 
“At a time when New England needs energy efficiency investments and new generation resources to meet our growing energy demand, this bill could increase costs,” Mills said. Some estimates suggest Maine households and businesses could see electricity rates rise by as much as 20% without federal support.
Maine relies on federal programs to weatherize aging homes, install heat pumps, and expand rooftop solar. All these efforts could be derailed under the bill, she warned.

“There’s different things that are being added to the airport but there’s no different footprint at all. So, it has nothing to do in terms of Everglades impact or restoration.

Florida has gotten a go-ahead on the project from the Department of Homeland Security and is shooting to have the center operational in early July. The governor used his emergency powers to take over the site, which belongs to Miami-Dade County.
The criticism has ranged from those such as Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, who called it “dangerous” and “inhumane,” to those worried about environmental damage to the “River of Grass.” The airstrip was first built in the late ’60s as part of a vast jetport project that was eventually halted due to concerns about damage to the Everglades.
The Sierra Club and Friends of the Everglades are among the organizations that have come out in opposition to the project, which will have as many as 1,000 beds where undocumented immigrants will be held as the government moves to deport them.
Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said her office has “significant concerns about the scope and scale of the state’s efforts, particularly regarding the environmental safeguards in place given the potentially devastating impact to the Everglades.”
Hundreds of people turned out Sunday afternoon for a protest at the site off U.S. 41, waving signs that said things like “NO ICE IN THE EVERGLADES.”
The state has started to build the temporary detention center. DeSantis described the project as a southern Florida outpost and said his administration is working to establish a northern outpost at Camp Blanding Joint Training Center in Clay County near Starke. The Florida National Guard trains there.
“The reality is they [the federal government] don’t have enough capacity, even close to enough capacity. This is going to be a force multiplier,” the governor said.

(Andy Bosselman for Newsline)Colorado regulators on Thursday launched an enforcement action against oil giant Chevron for an April well “blowout” that caused evacuations and closures in a community in eastern Weld County.
Officials with the Energy and Carbon Management Commission said Thursday that some residents remain displaced from their homes in tiny Galeton, an unincorporated town of 250 people located about 10 miles northeast of Greeley, nearly three months after the incident at Chevron’s Bishop well pad.
The well failure caused a high-pressure flow of oil, gas and water to spew from the site for five days before emergency crews were able to bring it under control. With millions of gallons of fluid released, it’s believed to be one of the largest oil and gas spills in state history, and the resulting plume spread dangerous levels of toxic chemicals as far as two miles away, according to data from Colorado State University researchers.

“I can say with certainty that this is significant and unprecedented during my tenure, not just in terms of volumes released … but in terms of complexity, in terms of scale of impact to environmental services, as well as residents,” said Jeff Robbins, who has served as chair of the five-member ECMC board of commissioners since 2020.
A so-called notice of alleged violation issued by ECMC staff to Chevron subsidiary Noble Energy lists six different breaches of the agency’s rules, initiating what is likely to be a lengthy regulatory enforcement action. The notice accuses Chevron of violating water quality standards, breaking employee safety rules, “fail(ing) to engineer and operate all equipment within the manufacturer’s recommended specifications,” and more.
An initial analysis completed by Chevron earlier this month identified the root cause of the incident as “improper assembly” of on-site equipment by a contractor. A total of 16 oil and gas wells were planned to be drilled on the Bishop site as part of a development plan approved by the ECMC in September 2022.
As part of the enforcement process, ECMC staff will calculate penalties against Chevron that will then be adjudicated by commissioners. Greg Duranleau, the ECMC’s deputy director of operations, said the penalties were “one piece of the financial impacts this incident may have on Chevron.”
“There may be civil settlements for damage, there’s a possibility for other agencies to enforce their regulations, and of course, there’s the cost of the response and cleanup,” Duranleau told commissioners during a special public hearing on Thursday.
Four of 14 families that were evacuated from the Galeton area after the blowout remain displaced from their homes, according to Chevron.
“We continue to actively work with the remaining residents on the next steps, including getting access to their properties to conduct assessments and cleaning,” the company’s website says.
An extensive cleanup and remediation effort is underway, a process that Chevron estimates could take up to five years. Thousands of environmental samples have been taken across a 7-square-mile “assessment area” centered on the well site, staff told commissioners.
“I am optimistic that Chevron will work with us through the enforcement process to bring a timely resolution,” ECMC Director Julie Murphy said in a statement. “And I am grateful to the many folks at Chevron who are working diligently to remediate the significant impacts of this incident.”

Emily Donlin is suing United States Drug Testing Laboratories, a private, for-profit Illinois company, in U.S, District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Donlin alleges she that in 2023, she and her husband Michael Donlin were “happily expecting” their second child and that on the evening of March 29, 2023, she delivered a son at a hospital identified in other court records as Des Moines’ Broadlawns Medical Center.

According to the lawsuit, a hospital nurse then collected part of the umbilical cord and sent it to USDTL for testing. The documentation that accompanied the cord included “errors and omissions,” the lawsuit claims, and did not provide any reason or justification for the testing.
USDTL allegedly “returned a false positive result for cocaine,” the lawsuit claims, and no additional testing was performed to confirm the results. USDTL then reported the results to the hospital, but “never contacted Emily to inform her of the positive result.”
The lawsuit claims Donlin “did not learn of the false positive until a social worker with the Department of Health and Human Services came knocking on her door” and later issued a founded report of child abuse based solely on the false positive test.
As a result, the lawsuit alleges, Donlin was incorrectly placed on the state’s Central Abuse Registry. The Donlins were then “dragged into expensive and stressful Child in Need of Assistance proceedings based on the single positive test,” the lawsuit claims.
“Following the false positive, Emily tested negative on every single drug test she completed, including at least eight urine and hair tests,” the lawsuit claims. “One of the tests, a 12-month hair test, demonstrated that there were no illegal substances within Emily’s system over a year-long period.”
When the umbilical cord was later retested by another laboratory, the results confirmed the first test had resulted in a false positive, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged negligence, defamation and false light invasion of privacy.
In its response to the allegations, USDTL admits testing the umbilical cord, but denies its results were a “false positive” for cocaine. The company admits that it did not inform Donlin of the test results, but says the results were relayed to Broadlawns Medical Center, “its customer who requested the testing.”

Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings. The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
‘It was the life raft’: Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida’s capital city

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “common-sense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year. South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law earlier this year when it passed the state budget. The bathroom policy became law last year when it was inserted into part of the state budget, which must be renewed each year.
The Arizona legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin lambasted Republicans over cuts to social services in the Republican mega-bill under consideration by the U.S. Senate and for efforts to tip the scales of elections in North Carolina in an interview with NC Newsline Thursday.
In a conversation at a Raleigh cafe Thursday afternoon, Martin criticized Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) for supporting efforts to cut health care coverage for his constituents and put rural hospitals at risk of closure, and said his seat is a prime target for Democrats in the upcoming Senate races.
“It’s quite despicable what the Republicans are doing right now in Congress,” Martin said. “Why are they throwing people off health care? All to give a tax break to the wealthiest people in our communities, to the billionaires, to the large corporations.”
Per an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the House version of the bill, passed in May, would cut Medicaid funding by nearly $900 billion and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $295 billion over the next decade. Martin quoted figures showing that North Carolina stood to lose $39 billion under the bill, with around 600,000 at risk for losing their health coverage.
Thom Tillis up for reelection
Martin said while Tillis has voiced some restraint over cuts in President Donald Trump’s signature bill, which is due for a vote in the Senate in the coming days, he fully expects Tillis and other Republicans to “fall in line and throw hundreds of North Carolinians off of their health insurance.”
In a June survey by Data for Progress, a left-leaning polling firm, a group of 916 North Carolinians voiced support for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, by a margin of 74% to 17% and for Medicaid by 80% to 15%. A narrow majority, 52% of respondents, said they oppose the Republican-led mega-bill. And 54% said Tillis and Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) should vote against it.
Though Tillis has reportedly spoken out against the Medicaid cuts in private with Senate leadership, according to The Hill — referencing the same figures as Martin — he has been a public proponent of Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” calling it “the most ambitious welfare reform in a generation” in a June 11 commentary.
  Martin said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) is out of step with his constituents and “continues to make himself vulnerable” in the upcoming 2026 Senate election. (Photo: Senate.gov video stream)
“He’s definitely not in line with his constituents, and you know, if you look throughout the country and even here in North Carolina, people support keeping Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security — they don’t want to see those social safety nets destroyed,” Martin said. “And they certainly don’t like the fact that they’re being eliminated all to give tax breaks to those who already have the most in our society.”
Martin said he’s spoken to former Governor Roy Cooper, considered a top prospective challenger to Tillis in the 2026 Senate race, multiple times since becoming chair, and called North Carolina “one of our best pickup opportunities in the Senate” in 2026.
“Senator Tillis continues to support policies that are really out of the mainstream of where most North Carolinians are at,” Martin said. “He continues to make himself vulnerable in a very much swing, purple state.”
Elections in North Carolina
Martin took aim at North Carolina Republicans for their efforts to overturn the 2024 state Supreme Court race, in which Justice Allison Riggs defeated challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin by just 734 votes.
“They tried to disenfranchise 60,000 voters who cast their vote for Justice Riggs,” Martin said. “These are attempts by people to hold on to power that know they’re on the wrong side of the issues and they’re on the wrong side of demographic trends in this state.”
He also condemned efforts by the State Board of Elections, which recently came under the oversight of Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek, to potentially disqualify as many as 200,000 voters in upcoming elections along the same lines as Griffin’s lawsuit. The election board voted Tuesday to request missing information — either a driver’s license number or partial Social Security number — from voters who do not have it on file, which Griffin unsuccessfully argued disqualified their votes.

“What do they do? They make it harder for people to participate. They make it harder for people to actually have their votes counted and for them actually to be full participants in their democracy,” Martin said.
Despite this, Martin voiced optimism for upcoming races in the state. Though Democrats fell short in the presidential race in North Carolina, they won most of the statewide races on the ballot, including the governor, lieutenant governor, and Supreme Court elections — a fact that Martin touted as a sign of strength for the party going into a highly contested Senate election.
“There’s certainly a good trend line that’s developing here electorally for Democrats, but we don’t take anything for granted,” Martin said. “We know that North Carolina is a swing state and it’s going to require us to make a deep investment of time, energy, and money in this state if we’re going to beat Thom Tillis next year.”
He attributed the party’s success in those races to the changing demographics of the state, whose electorate has become younger and more diverse with each passing year. And he also pointed to Republicans in the state growing out of step with North Carolinians and embracing increasingly extreme right-wing positions.
In addition, Martin praised Governor Josh Stein for rising “above partisanship” and focusing on North Carolinians’ economic issues, running as someone who is “centered on an economic agenda that’s going to help everyone, not just a few people.”
“Whether they lived in rural North Carolina, whether they lived in big cities or the suburbs, everyone had a chance to actually improve their lives, and he presented an agenda that actually appealed not just to Democratic voters but to independent voters, and even some moderate Republicans who supported him,” Martin said.
The party’s future
In seeking a direction for the party, Martin said it’s critical to focus on an economic agenda that “speaks to working class people in this country again” — something he saw from both Stein and, in New York City’s recent mayoral primary, State Rep. Zohran Mamdani, who prevailed in an unexpected rout of former Governor Andrew Cuomo.
“He focused almost exclusively on affordability, right, and on economic issues,” Martin said. “His message was really focused on how to make it easier for people to afford to live in New York City, and he didn’t stray too far from that.”
He also credited Mamdani with listening to a wide range of voters, including seeking out Trump supporters and asking what issues were important to them in the recent presidential election and proceeding to earn their trust with an economic agenda that spoke to them.
“What I think many politicians in the Democratic Party need to learn is not just how you organize in-person, but how you organize online, using the power of social media to really engage people in the conversation and create excitement and energy around your campaign,” Martin said.
He said the party will “work our butts off to help get him elected as the next Mayor of New York City” and dismissed concerns over Mamdani’s identification as a socialist, which Republicans have used as an attack line for the Democratic Party at-large — including Trump, who posted Wednesday that Mamdani is “a 100% Communist Lunatic” and condemned Democrats for supporting him.
“The fact that Donald Trump doesn’t understand the difference between a communist and a socialist should tell you everything you need to know,” Martin said. “As long as I’m the DNC Chair, all are welcome, all are invited in this big tent party of ours. I believe you win through addition, not subtraction.”
Though he and former DNC Vice Chair David Hogg came into conflict over the latter’s pledge to back primary challenges to aging Democratic party leaders — a feud that ultimately saw Hogg ousted from his position in party leadership — Martin clarified in the interview that he views primaries as important for holding officials accountable, but believes party leaders should not “put their thumb on the scale.”
“What that does is it actually pushes people out of the conversation. And I know that from firsthand experience in 2016,” Martin said. “There are a lot of young people who supported Bernie Sanders, as an example, and those young people left the party for good. They never came back because they felt like the party bosses were trying to rig the system and, you know, play favorites.”
  Martin praised North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton as “one of the best we have in the whole country,” citing her work in rural communities as crucial for winning the state in the future. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
Martin also offered praised for North Carolina party chair Anderson Clayton, among the youngest party leaders at 27. Martin lauded “the energy that she brings to the job” and her focus on rural areas and small towns in North Carolina as helping to deliver key victories in the 2024 races. Clayton is currently in the midst of a “rural listening tour” across the state, which Martin pointed to as important work.
“She’s one of the best we have in the whole country,” Martin said. “The energy that she brings to the job is what we all should be doing, and I’m really a huge fan of hers.”
Martin said he was not yet looking ahead to 2028 in North Carolina, citing his focus on the Senate race, but said it’s critical for Democrats to “build a foundation here to be successful in the future.”
“North Carolina is going to decide, not just in ’28, but in ’32 and beyond, who the next President is, who controls Congress, who controls a number of different levels of power, including here in North Carolina,” Martin said. “We’re going to be investing heavily in terms of time, energy, and money in ’26, ’28, and beyond.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6262260-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 16:08:29.985150

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Increases to tuition and fees requested by 15 public colleges and universities were all approved Thursday by a board governing Oklahoma higher education. 
Tuition and mandatory fees for resident undergraduate students will increase at an average of 1.9% statewide, or just over $121 annually, after the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education approved requests impacting over half of the institutions they govern. University and college presidents presented their requests to the state regents Wednesday. 
While 10 colleges and universities did not request increases, many of the presidents that did cited inflation or rising insurance costs as the reason for needing more revenue. 
Regent Dustin Hilliary said while Oklahoma is not a “big, rich state” that can appropriate billions of dollars to colleges and universities like other states, the state regents worked at the state Capitol to secure funding. 
“We did have a good effort in the halls of Capitol to hopefully get some legislative funding so that we didn’t have to have these tuition increases where our students are bearing the cost,” he said. “… And I think that we’ll probably be chasing those same dollars next year.”
The state Legislature appropriated $1.1 billion to the state regents for next fiscal year, which is about $80 million more than the current budget year. 
Despite the increases, all Oklahoma public colleges and universities remain below the threshold set by the Legislature to keep higher education in the state affordable and below the average cost of peer institutions. Attending Oklahoma colleges and universities is averaged to be 74% of the cost of peer institutions, according to a news release. 
The regents approved requests from: 

University of Oklahoma for a 3% increase, or $9.80 per credit hour, 
University of Central Oklahoma for a 2.6%, or $7.53 per credit hour, 
East Central University for a 3.8% increase, or $10 per credit hour, 
Northeastern State University for a 3% increase, or $7.70 per credit hour, 
Northwestern Oklahoma State University for a 3.5% increase, or $8.75 per credit hour, 
Southeastern Oklahoma State University for a 3.6% increase, or $9 per credit hour, 
Southwestern Oklahoma State University for a 2.7% increase, or $7.13 per credit hour, 
Langston University for a 3% increase, or $6.93 per credit hour, 
Connors State College for a 0.6% increase, or $1 per credit hour, 
Murray State College for a 2.3% increase, or $4.20 per credit hour, 
Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College for a 2.9% increase, or $5 per credit hour,
Oklahoma City Community College for an 8% increase, or $10.77 per credit hour, 
Rose State College for a 2.3% increase, or $3.78 per credit hour, 
Seminole State College for a 3.1% increase, or $5 per credit hour, and
Western Oklahoma State College for a 3.2% increase, or $5 per credit hour. 

Increases at public regional universities averaged 2% annually and 1.8% for public community colleges. OU was the only research university that had an increase as Oklahoma State University did not request any changes to tuition and fees. 
State law also requires the regents to increase financial aid in tandem with increases in tuition, which will be a 5.3% increase, according to a news release. 
Regent Dennis Casey, board chair, said he appreciated the work that had gone into the requests and that it had been years since some of the colleges and universities requested increases. 
“I don’t worry about a whole lot of other decisions that I have to make here,” he said. “But this one is a big one, and I know it is for these members too. We don’t take it lightly.”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

“He was loved by everyone in our caucus, and he will be deeply missed by all of us,” Whitver said. “He was part of our Senate Republican family, and we mourn with his family just as we would mourn any member of our own.”
The 66-year-old Republican represented Senate District 1, covering a section of Woodbury County including Sioux City and Lawton. He was first elected to the Iowa Senate in 2022, unseating incumbent Sen. Jackie Smith, D-Sioux City. Before his time in the Legislature, De Witt served on the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. He also had worked as courthouse security for the Woodbury County Sheriff’s Office and at MidAmerican Energy for 22 years.
Other Iowa leaders also shared their condolences for De Witt’s family and praised his service. Gov. Kim Reynolds said she and her husband Kevin Reynolds, who is receiving treatment for lung cancer, were saddened to learn about De Witt’s passing, saying he was a “dear colleague and friend” who dedicated his life to serving his northwest Iowa community.
“In just three years, Rocky made a profound impact in the state legislature, all while heroically battling cancer,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Rocky was a dedicated husband and a loving father and grandfather. His family and friends remain in our prayers.”
Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner said in a statement Wednesday she and Senate Democrats were also sending support to De Witt’s family.
“My thoughts, and those of my Senate Democratic colleagues, are with the De Witt family this evening as they grieve the loss of their loved one,” Weiner said. “Sen. De Witt and I may not have agreed on every legislative issue, but I always respected his dedication to his work for the people of Iowa, even while battling his illness.”
De Witt’s nephew, Kolby De Witt, said in a statement posted on social media that his uncle took his public service in the Iowa Senate and on the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors seriously.
“The two positions Rocky held were honors that he did not take for granted,” Kolby DeWitt wrote. “Rocky understood that he was a caretaker of the two seats that he was elected to, and that they ultimately belong to Iowans. I consider myself blessed to have been part of Rocky’s family, and my opportunity to walk with him through the difficulties and triumphs of public service.”
A special election will be held to fill De Witt’s position in the Iowa Senate for the remainder of his term, until January 2027. The governor has until Monday to call for the special election.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rocky-De-Witt-black-background.jpg,,,2025-06-26 16:08:29.985150

Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association tried to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot to stop Ohio Senate Bill 1, but said they ultimately ran out of time.

“Over the course of the last few days, we were collecting over 4,000 signatures a day, and that momentum was only increasing,” said Youngstown State’s Ohio Education Association President Mark Vopat. “It was only because we ran out of time that we weren’t able to get the required signatures. … I believe that if we’d had just a little bit more time, we could have gotten those numbers.”
They needed to collect about 248,092 signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. 
Instead, they collected nearly 195,000 signatures and met the signature requirements in at least 33 counties, said Amanda Fehlbaum, a Youngstown State faculty member who helped champion efforts to get a referendum.  
The plan was to submit the collected signatures to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose on Thursday for him to verify the signatures. This was the deadline to submit signatures since the law goes into effect Friday. 
The new law creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
“One thing is clear in all of this, the people do not want politicians making decisions about higher education,” Fehlbaum said. “The people do not like this legislation.” 
S.B. 1 quickly passed through the legislature earlier this year and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill into law on March 28. 
Fehlbaum said she thought another group “with infrastructure and funding” would come forward to challenge S.B. 1 after DeWine signed it into law, but that never happened so they decided to go the referendum route.
Vopat and Fehlbaum along with fellow Youngstown State faculty member Cryshanna Jackson Leftwich started the referendum process in mid-April and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and the Ohio Secretary of State’s office gave them approval to start collecting signatures May 5.
“I do think we could have pulled this off had we not wasted two weeks waiting on another group or groups to come forward,” Fehlbaum said. 
Vopat agrees they would have been able to get enough signatures if they had started the referendum process immediately after DeWine signed the bill into law. 
“That might have also given us the extra time we needed,” he said. 
The three Youngstown State faculty members said they are figuring out next steps and considering efforts to potentially try to get on the ballot in 2026. 
“This is not the end for us,” Jackson Leftwich said. “I want people to know that we’re going to use this momentum.”
More than 1,700 people volunteered to collect signatures across the state. They ended up raising more than $43,000 in small dollar donations with $1,000 being their largest donation, Fehlbaum said.
“I cannot underscore how much we did not have money,” she said. “We did not have paid consultants. We did not have paid petitioners. None of us are getting paid. …  There’s no dark money here.”
But they said it ultimately came down to a lack of time, not a shortage of money.
“I would love to take these boxes of petitions and put them on Jerry Cirino’s front door as a visible symbol of how detested this legislation is by the people,” Fehlbaum said. “We’re instead going to spend some of our remaining campaign funds on a shredding service so that information voters shared with us will not be mishandled.”
Cirino is the Republican Ohio state senator who introduced S.B. 1. 
Some of Ohio’s public universities have started making decisions because of the new law. Ohio University announced it will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center, and the Multicultural Center.
The University of Toledo is suspending nine undergraduate programs. Kent State University is closing its LGBTQ+ Center, Women’s Center, and Student Multicultural Center.
Referendums are rare and the last one that passed in Ohio was when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law in 2011.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana’s colleges and universities are bringing home hundreds of millions for construction projects and other key priorities, including over $30 million to begin construction for the long-anticipated new LSU library. 
The state budget for fiscal year 2025-26, which starts next week, includes approximately $610 million in immediate construction for higher education and around $75 million for research, campus security and other special projects. 
Funding for the state’s four higher education systems remained largely the same as what they received for the current school year, but each got at least a little one-time money in the three main budget bills Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law this week. 
Building boon 
The state construction budget, detailed in House Bill 2, provides allocations for each state university system, including a significant investment for a new LSU library at its main campus. The bill includes more immediate money for campuses than the previous year, and it lays out promised funds for upcoming years. 
The amounts universities receive fluctuates from year to year because their construction projects need more or less money, depending on what phase of construction their projects have reached. 
Projects in the LSU System are slated to receive about $196 million next year, up from $186 million this year. In addition to about $33 million for the first phase of construction of its library, which should begin next summer, around $28 million has been allocated for a new science building, and another $28 million was set aside for renovations at the Medical Education Building Laboratory at LSU Health Sciences New Orleans. 
The Southern University System will receive about $144 million, up from about $67 million this year. The largest portion, $47 million, will be used for a new science, technology, engineering and math complex at its main campus in Baton Rouge. 
The University of Louisiana System is slated to receive around $175 million, up from $136 million this year. That includes $17 million to renovate a major academic building at Louisiana Tech and $15 million for renovations to the Health Science Complex at the University of Louisiana Lafayette. 
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System will receive around $31 million, down from about $34 million this year. Its biggest project is $14 million for a new building and campus development at Baton Rouge Community College

Extra cash 
Each system is slated to receive lagniappe for special projects, research, athletics and campus improvements. 
The LSU System will receive $7.5 million to help replace lost federal research funding. 
In the University of Louisiana System, Grambling State University has been allocated $6.7 million for an athletic facility, McNeese will get $250,000 for its baseball and softball programs and another $225,000 for its athletic department. Nicholls was budgeted $500,000 for its athletic programs, and the University of Louisiana Monroe will receive $2 million for its pharmacy school.
The Southern University System will receive $1 million for night classes at Southern University New Orleans and $295,000 for a mobile health unit at Southern University Shreveport.

The state’s minimum wage will rise to $13 in July. (Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The minimum wage will increase in 15 states and cities in July, though lawmakers in other states have worked to slow down wage hikes.
Wage floor increases beginning July 1 in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., will benefit more than 880,000 workers by collectively raising their earnings by more than $397 million, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
In Alaska, the $11.91 minimum wage will increase to $13 per hour. Oregon’s $14.70 standard figure will rise to $15.05 (the state has separate rates for urban and nonurban counties). And the $17.50 minimum in the District of Columbia will move to $17.95.
Another dozen cities will see minimum wage increases this summer, including Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Currently, 30 states and D.C. have a higher minimum wage than the federal minimum of $7.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
In many states, the minimum wage is automatically adjusted upward as inflation rises. But voters in several states last year elected to significantly increase their minimum wages.
Voters deliver mixed verdicts on increasing minimum wage, but support paid sick leave

The institute noted that lawmakers have pushed to “water down” some of those voter initiatives.
In Missouri, for example, voters approved a November measure to mandate paid sick time for many workers and boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026, with future hikes tied to inflation. But lawmakers in May eliminated the sick leave requirement and nixed the inflation adjustment, meaning the minimum wage will not automatically increase as voters approved.
“Our side of the aisle has great concern for the burden that this would place on businesses,” Missouri Senate Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican, said in May about the ballot measure, “and if we’re going to promote economic growth and jobs, we need to really be cognizant of that.”
Similarly, Nebraska lawmakers this year aimed to cap future wage increases approved by voters in a 2022 ballot measure. That legislation failed to advance.
Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a national network of business owners and executives, said in a Thursday news release that increased minimum wages are good for employees and businesses alike.
Steven Dyme, CEO of Flowers for Dreams, said higher base wages encourage low-wage workers to spend more locally. The flower store has locations in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee.
“Building our business with living wages has ensured the best floral talent, a product quality that’s truly cared for, and a trusting customer base,” he said in the news release.

CHICAGO — In a hot gymnasium on Chicago’s South Side, Gov. JB Pritzker announced Thursday morning he’s running for a potentially historic third term as governor.

In his announcement speech, Pritzker said he is running to “protect” the story he’s been telling about Illinois — one that has been built largely in opposition to the politics of President Donald Trump.

Pritzker said his third term would focus on grappling with artificial intelligence, addressing the rising cost of living, continued spending on infrastructure and growing the state’s economy.

The field house at Grand Crossing Park where Pritzker launched his first campaign hosted a crowd of Pritzker’s invited supporters, including Democratic party officials, campaign operatives and long-time Pritzker supporters.

Pritzker’s message has often focused on what Democrats need to do to win and push back on Trump, including addressing economic issues for the middle class and being outspoken against Trump’s policies.

“While it is certainly tempting to lay all of this at the feet of the megalomaniac narcissist in the White House and his malignant clown car in Congress, the hard truth is, we all share some of the blame,” Pritzker said.

The governor said “we must reckon with the fact that everything is too damned expensive,” but taking a shot at Republicans, said enacting budget cuts to key government programs like Medicaid that make life more affordable for people shouldn’t be the solution.

The governor also said a third term would continue his past efforts to protect abortion rights, diversity programming in the private sector and teachers’ ability to teach “uncensored history.”

Pritzker’s progressive stances on hot-button national issues are part of what has grown his national profile since President Donald Trump took office in January.

The governor has been one of the president’s most vocal Democratic critics and his schedule has been loaded with national media interviews and campaign speeches around the country.

From reelection to presidential election?

A successful reelection could set the stage for a bigger one: Pritzker’s speculated 2028 presidential campaign.

Pritzker on Thursday downplayed the possibility when speaking to reporters but didn’t explicitly rule it out.

“Everything that I do, truly everything that I do, in my job and every day when I wake up is about improving the lot of the people who live in the state of Illinois, lifting up the working families of Illinois,” Pritzker said. “Whatever I do going forward is going to be about that.”

He had a small taste of presidential campaigning last year when he was considered as a running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris, then served as a surrogate.

“You don’t get on that list unless they think you actually could be president of the United States and do the job if you had to,” Pritzker told reporters last year.

As some Democrats have tried finding a centrist message, Pritzker has stayed in the left lane. He condemned politicians, without mentioning specific names, who abandon their core beliefs for political gain.

“Of all the unbecoming qualities that Americans hate in their politicians – they hate cowardice the most,” Pritzker said. “I’d rather lose standing up for what I believe in than win by selling out those who believed in me.”

As Pritzker rattled off a list of accomplishments in his more than six years as governor, his message remained the same as it has since he launched his first campaign in 2017 to unseat an unpopular Republican incumbent: fight.

“Let me be clear: There is no Mission Accomplished banner to stand under today,” Pritzker said alluding to a premature victory declaration former President George W. Bush made in a 2003 speech regarding military action in Iraq. “Yes, we have addressed so many of our old problems – but new ones always arise. History is an endless relay race. Our job is not to look for the finish line but to protect the baton as we run our assigned leg. But we have work to do. I have work to do.”

Pritzker argued his success has come through embracing his role as a cheerleader for the state, recalling the negative perceptions of Illinois, such as the prevalence of corruption and unbalanced budgets, that had consumed state politics.

“When I was first elected, I told you I was prepared to be a happy warrior on behalf of our state, even if it meant going it alone,” Pritzker said. “I suited up to face the carnival barkers and misery spelunkers and doom grifters. I handed out optimism like a shot of Malört – as a swift jolt to the heart.”

First three-term Democrat?

The 60-year-old Democrat enters the race as the favorite, having received more than 54% of the vote in the 2018 and 2022 elections.

An heir to a fortune built on the Hyatt Hotel chain, Pritzker’s net worth sits at $3.7 billion as of Thursday, according to Forbes. His vast personal wealth makes him one of the richest politicians in American history and gives him a significant leg up on competitors. Pritzker dumped $350 million into his first two campaigns and has never taken outside contributions.

Separately, Pritzker has used an undisclosed amount of his personal fortune to fund a political action committee, Think Big America, to support abortion rights in other states.

Pritzker is also entering unchartered territory for Illinois governors. If he completes his current term, he would be the first Democrat to serve two full terms in modern state history. If he wins reelection, he would be the only governor to serve more than two terms since Republican Gov. Jim Thompson served four terms from 1977 until 1991.

Pritzker will need a new running mate first, however, as Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton is running for U.S. Senate. Pritzker did not announce a running mate Thursday.

Pritzker’s governing record

The governor’s top priority for his second term was to eliminate child care deserts and make preschool more accessible. Since he was sworn in in January 2023, the state has implemented Pritzker’s Smart Start initiative to expand preschool offerings around the state and has begun to phase in a new Department of Early Childhood.

When asked about those goals after his speech Thursday, Pritzker said there were an “awful lot of things” that his administration still needed to accomplish.

“We still need to get to universal preschool. We're on our way. It'll happen probably in 2027,” Pritzker said.

But Pritzker pointed to several of his progressive policy wins Thursday, in his speech and when speaking to reporters.

He has signed legislation raising the minimum wage to $15, legalizing recreational cannabis, banning assault weapons and numerous new protections of abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned three years ago. Pritzker also passed landmark legislation to phase out fossil fuels in the electricity sector.

Pritzker repeatedly brought up cleaning up Illinois’ fiscal house. The state has recorded budget surpluses in recent years and has received nine credit upgrades since he took office.

But challenges are also growing. The budget has gotten tighter, and lawmakers have resorted to more than $1 billion in targeted tax increases over the last two years to balance the budget. The fiscal year 26 budget Pritzker signed this month increased discretionary spending by less than 1%.

There’s also been headaches over legislative priorities. Labor unions are frustrated Pritzker didn’t embrace their proposal for pension reform this spring. And many parts of the governor’s legislative agenda hit roadblocks with concerned lawmakers. There’s also ongoing discussions about achieving Pritzker’s bold clean energy goals as prices rise and energy supply is strained.

The governor has taken pride in growing state agencies decimated by the two-year budget impasse that began a decade ago. But problems at those agencies have caused trouble for Pritzker.

An audit revealed the Department of Public Health failed to intervene to stop deaths from COVID-19 at the LaSalle Veterans’ Home in 2020, though Pritzker blamed and fired leaders at the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Billions of pandemic relief dollars at the Department of Employment Security went to fraudsters, while the Department of Children and Family Services faced years of scrutiny over deaths and the its failure to properly house children in its care while Pritzker maintained support for the department’s director.

GOP criticizes ‘stepping stone’ approach

As problems have mounted at the Statehouse, Senate Republicans have encouraged Pritzker to “think Illinois.” As he announced his campaign Thursday, Illinois Republicans continue to believe his focus is elsewhere.

“These last nearly eight years under his governance merits firing not rehiring,” Illinois GOP Chair Kathy Salvi said in a statement. “While businesses and families flee, Pritzker sees Illinois as nothing more than a stepping stone for the White House.”

A field of Republican challengers is still taking shape. So far, DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick, Posen Park District Commissioner Phil Perez and Lake Forest businessman Joe Severino have announced they will run in the Republican primary.

(Getty Images)The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported Thursday two more measles diagnoses in the state, bringing the total case count to five.
One of the cases was detected in Utah County, while the other is from the southwest health district, which serves Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, the department said in a news release. One of the new diagnosed patients is a minor and the other, an adult.
Like the previous three confirmed cases, the patients were unvaccinated. But, these additional patients were linked to previously diagnosed individuals rather than community exposure. Public health officials are conducting investigations to determine whether there are any additional cases in the state as national outbreaks keep on increasing.

Two of the five cases are unvaccinated, pregnant Utahns. According to the department, individuals infected with measles during pregnancy are at high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or giving birth to a child who will experience serious medical problems. Pregnant women are also “much more likely to be hospitalized because of severe measles.”
First measles case confirmed in Utah amid national outbreaks 

“The department recommends that if you are planning to become pregnant, get vaccinated before you get pregnant to protect yourself and your baby,” DHHS officials wrote in the release. “You can’t get the MMR vaccine while you are pregnant. If you get the MMR vaccine, wait at least 4 weeks after you get your shot before you try to get pregnant.”
As of Thursday morning, two of the Utah patients had been hospitalized due to complications from the virus but have since been released.
Measles early symptoms show up seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever higher than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough, runny nose or red eyes. A rash could appear four days after the fever starts. Health officials recommend that people experiencing these symptoms stay away from others and call health care providers before making a visit to avoid spreading the virus.
“The most effective prevention against the measles is vaccination. Public health officials in Utah want to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation,” according to the release. ” The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective against measles when the person gets 2 doses.”

(Photo via Getty Images)The tax and spend legislation going through the U.S. Congress could reverse New Mexico’s raises for health care providers who serve Medicaid patients called “provider rate increases.”
The unsettled fate of the Medicaid provisions amid rulings against their inclusion by the U.S. Senate parliamentarian leaves New Mexico waiting to see what its fate will be as a state with a heavier stake in Medicaid than any other.
In January, New Mexico started paying health care providers who serve Medicaid patients at 150% of the rate paid by Medicare, with the goal of providing more people primary, maternal and behavioral health care.
Legislative Finance Committee Director Charles Sallee told state lawmakers on Thursday that the U.S. Senate’s version of the bill would require states to bring hospital rates down to what Medicare pays.
“That would be another big hit,” Sallee said at the LFC’s meeting in Taos. “The hospitals just barely got this program up and running.”
The expanded payments started going out in the last few months, Sallee said, and have helped stabilize rural hospitals in particular. But it’s “a big unknown” if those payments will be upended, he said.
Sallee said his staff is researching a concern raised by the state Health Care Authority, which runs the state Medicaid program, that these payment caps would apply to other kinds of services like primary care, maternal care and behavioral health care. He said he has asked to meet with U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján’s office next week about the issue.
New Mexico has allocated more than $2.2 billion for provider rate increases over the past couple of years, Sallee said.
“That would go away,” he said. “So that has significant implications for our health care system going forward.”
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) asked why the federal government cares if New Mexico pays higher rates, and whether it has anything to do with matching what states pay out. Sallee said yes, particularly in states like New Mexico that have expanded their Medicaid programs.
“That’s the majority in Congress’ thinking: ‘Why should we pay so much?’” he said.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In a move quickly panned by licensed health care providers, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Thursday that he planned to “Make Oklahoma Healthy Again” by urging state agencies to stop supporting public water fluoridation, removing red food dyes from school and prison meals, and by asking the federal government to approve a request that bans food stamp recipients from purchasing soda and candy.
Stitt’s pledge came minutes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s secretary of Health and Human Services, criticized the state for having the 47th worst health outcomes during a raucous “MOHA” kickoff rally that drew hundreds of people to the state Capitol.
Oklahoma has become the latest conservative state to submit a waiver to the U.S. Department of Agriculture that seeks to ban the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients from using their benefits to buy sodas, candies and other confectionery items, Stitt said. Tax dollars will no longer “continue to fund foods that are making people sick,” he said.
State officials will also work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to find more ways to promote healthly eating and to make food stamp funding go further. 
“Eating healthy foods today is going to reduce health care spending and dietary related illnesses later on in life,” Stitt said.
The Republican governor also said he’s instructed the Oklahoma State Department of Health to stop recommending fluoride in public water.
“Cities and water districts, they can still choose to do what they want, based on their constituents and the science, but it’s no longer going to be a recommendation for the state health department,” Stitt said.
And Stitt said he’s instructed all state agencies that provide meals to Oklahomans to discontinue their use of artificial dyes. He also plans to convene an advisory counsel to recommend other changes that can improve health outcomes across the state.
Stitt’s plans immediately faced criticism from licensed medical providers who showed up en masse at the rally, holding signs reading “Support Evidence-Based Health Care”, “Encourage Immunizations” and “Protect Medicaid.” 
Dr. Steven Crawford, chair of the Oklahoma Alliance for Healthy Families, said it would be “disastrous” for children’s health to remove fluoride from water.
“We do know that appropriate public water fluoridation prevents cavities,” he said. “And how do you help children get better nutrition when they don’t have adequate dentition or teeth to be able to eat the food? So I am so sad that the governor is advocating removing appropriate fluoride from public water.”
Crawford, who practices medicine in Oklahoma City, said fluoridation of public water and immunizations are two of the major health benefits over the past century and have been critical to improving the state’s and nation’s health outcomes.
He said removing candy and sugary drinks from the list of approved food stamp items isn’t inappropriate, but Stitt neglected to mention that many recipients already don’t get enough resources to be able to buy healthy foods. The governor also didn’t discuss increasing food stamp funding to ensure children are getting adequate nutrition, particularly during the summer months when they are not eating at school, he said.
Kennedy, who participated in a staged, ceremonial executive order signing with Stitt, praised the governor’s actions. 
“I am so gratified by these actions that are being taken by Gov. Stitt to make Oklahoma healthy again,” Kennedy said.
Spectators heckled Kennedy throughout his speech that focused on America’s soaring rates of obesity, diabetes and autism, declines in the nation’s fertility rates and a drop in American teenage boys’ testosterone levels. Kennedy, who has been criticized as being a vaccine skeptic, did not mention immunizations during his address.
At one point, a state trooper could be seen escorting two bystanders from the crowd after one began shouting something unintelligible at Kennedy. A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the encounter.
Kennedy said when people ask him if he’s taking soda and sugary drinks away from the Americans, he tells them that they should have the right to drink a bottle of soda.
“We live in a country where we have individual freedom,” he said. 
The federal government just should not be paying for it, he said.
“We’re paying for them at the front end by buying soda for the poorest Americans, and then we’re paying for it (on) the back end with this diabetes, for Medicaid and Medicare,” Kennedy said. “And it doesn’t make any sense. We are poisoning the American people.”
He said electing leaders like Stitt will change the way we do things in the U.S. to give American children a better chance of growing up healthy.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The Delaware Department of Education has released details of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s policy for free and reduced-price meals for the 2025–2026 school year.
The policy ensures that children from households facing financial hardship will have access to nutritious meals through the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and After School Snack Program.
Schools will continue operating these programs under normal procedures and will collect applications for free or reduced-price meals, unless they are participating in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows certain schools to provide free meals to all students.

Parents and guardians will receive Meal Benefit Forms (MBFs) along with an informational letter.
To apply, households must complete and return the form to their child’s school.
The form collects details necessary to determine eligibility and may be verified during the school year. Information shared is confidential and used solely for program eligibility and verification.

Households not receiving SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) or DE-TANF (Delaware Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) must include the names of all household members, their income sources and amounts, and the signature and Social Security information of an adult household member.
Families receiving SNAP or DE-TANF must list their case number and the child’s name, along with the signature of an adult.
Children enrolled in Head Start, or those identified as homeless, migrant, runaway, or in foster care, automatically qualify for free meals.
Applications can be submitted or updated at any time during the school year.
Those dissatisfied with an eligibility decision can request a review or hearing through their school’s administrative office.
A copy of the full policy is available for public review at each participating school and its administrative office.
For more information, families are encouraged to contact their child’s school.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-2.29.22-PM.png,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)North Carolina House Republicans want more than a third of existing staff positions at the state elections office to be converted to jobs for political appointees, eliciting criticism about the politicization of voting administration. The proposed changes were unveiled in a bill approved by the House Elections Law Committee Thursday morning.
Sweeping changes the bill proposes would prohibit state and local election board members from encouraging voting and open a way for foreign nationals to contribute to referendum campaigns. Another provision would require members of the military and citizens voting from other countries to provide photo ID or sign a document saying why they couldn’t send one. 
Last year, the legislature cut the time voters would have to fix mistakes with their absentee or provisional ballots. If voters sign in at the wrong place or fail to provide an ID, they can contact local boards later to cure deficiencies. The new bill would give voters a little more time to send in a signature or photo, moving the deadline from Friday after Election Day to Monday after the election.
State Elections Director Sam Hayes told the House Elections Committee that House Bill 958 would allow him to reorganize the office the way he wants.
“These positions would just allow me the flexibility that I need to conduct that reorganization and make sure that folks that are surrounding me, certainly my direct reports and I, are aligned on the vision for the agency as I set forward,” he said. “But I want to assure everybody today that we are going to do this in a nonpartisan fashion.”
Democrats on the committee objected to having the main office overseeing elections convert 25 jobs to those where employees are hired and fired based on their politics. 
“That is a purge of the agency is what that is,” said Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake). 
Other than the director, the agency historically has had no political appointees because it should be the least partisan, he said. Employees who have worked in the office for years under Democratic and Republican administrations could lose their jobs for political reasons if the bill becomes law, he added.
The state Board of Elections switched from Democratic to Republican control under a new state law. The Republican board majority hired Hayes, who was House Speaker Destin Hall’s general counsel, to replace Karen Brinson Bell as executive director.
A rushed process
Democrats on the Elections Committee objected to voting on the bill because it was made public only hours before the General Assembly left for a weeks-long break. 
Republicans decided to push ahead with the measure, even though time for discussion and debate was cut in half because Chairman Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke) said the committee could use the meeting room for only 30 minutes. He said the committee could not move to one of the many other vacant hearing rooms. 
The short meeting left no time for public comment.  Members of the public booed as the meeting ended. Some had planned to speak. The bill now moves the House Rules Committee, but since lawmakers have recessed the 2025 session for a summer break, no further action is expected in the near term. House Speaker Destin Hall (R- Caldwell) announced prior to adjourning the session Thursday that no voting sessions will be held in the House until the week of July 14, at the earliest.
New elections board staff weigh in
Hayes said after the meeting that he didn’t ask for 25 jobs to be converted. 
“All I have asked for is some flexibility with some exempt positions,” he said. “I’m really looking at the leadership team — folks there that an agency head would rightfully expect to have around them.”
The bill would authorize a new signature verification pilot program for citizens voting by mail. The legislature mandated the first one in 2023. 
Brian LiVecchi, Hayes’ chief of staff, told the committee Thursday that there had been a problem finding a vendor with the initial pilot. 
“Essentially, the program never really did get off the ground,” he said. 
The Board of Elections did have trouble finding a vendor. But it eventually hired one, conducted the signature verification pilot for the 2024 primaries, and reported the results, which revealed significant problems. 
LiVecchi said after the meeting that he heard from some counties that the pilot could have been done better. 
Other changes
The bill includes a way for non-citizens, overseas companies, and U.S. businesses that are majority-owned by non-citizens or overseas companies to make political contributions. 
Federal law prohibits “foreign nationals” from making contributions in federal, state, or local elections. 
The House bill would allow these contributions to referendum committees if the money was generated in the United States and the decisions were made by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. 
The photo ID provisions for military and overseas voters are the outgrowth of GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin’s lawsuits attempting to overturn his opponent’s election victory.
A rule the Board of Elections had passed unanimously exempted these voters from the state voter ID requirements. However, state appellate courts said military and overseas voters need to provide photo ID. 
The bill also includes provisions that would prevent state and local election board members from making public statements promoting voter turnout. 
Ann Webb, policy director at Common Cause North Carolina called the provision “a red flag.”
“Everyone in our democracy should be encouraging participation, and that’s not a partisan issue,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4499-1-1024x366.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

(AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature approved seven studies on topics including property taxes, health care, higher education and housing production. 
Some of these proposals initially started out as bills to make policy changes to the issues that will now instead be studied first.
That was the case for LD 1770, which initially sought to both increase the property tax fairness credit and establish a Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force. 
The Legislature’s Taxation Committee struck the former piece but maintained the latter. Its members on both sides of the aisle agreed that they’d like to wait for the recommendations from this task force before making any major reform, so the committee unanimously rejected most of the other property tax bills it considered this year.
Bill started as rent relief but passed Legislature as study into tenant-landlord relationships

Pending the governor’s approval, other studies that are expected to begin before the Legislature reconvenes in January 2026 include LD 1023, which would continue the work of the Blue Economy Task Force that was established in the previous 131st Legislature to focus on developing Maine’s ocean-based economy.
“When the Blue Economy Task Force reconvenes, industry leaders of all stripes will continue their work to develop Maine’s emerging ocean-based economy, attract opportunity and strengthen the state’s largest and oldest heritage industry — our ocean,” bill sponsor Sen. Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) said in a statement. “From our harbors to the foothills, Maine’s future will greatly benefit from the continued efforts of the task force.”
Other studies will examine deed fraud prevention, strategies to reduce the cost of and accelerate the production of housing, the state’s public policy on higher education, the state’s health care delivery system and alternative pathways to obtain a license to practice dentistry. 
But lawmakers pushed off decisions on 23 other bills that proposed studies until next year.  
Bills that involve studies are placed on what’s referred to as the “special study table” to vie for legislative resources. The study table is managed by the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership. 
This table is separate from the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, though some bills were placed on both tables because they also included provisions that required appropriations from the general fund.
The property tax measure was placed on both tables because it sought one-time funds — $150,000 — to contract with an entity to provide research and analytical support for the task force. The appropriations committee approved the funding and the Legislative Council approved the bill’s the study elements ahead of its final passage in both chambers on Wednesday.
However, another bill that had been on both tables this year did not end up passing. 
LD 1640 sought to implement the recommendations of the Gagetown Harmful Chemical Study Commission, which studied the impacts of exposure to harmful chemicals on veterans who served at the Canadian military support base in Gagetown, New Brunswick as well as to reestablish the commission. 
While the Legislative Council approved the study elements of the bill, the appropriations committee left the bill — which had a $250,000 price tag for data consulting costs — on its table. 
The bill did not die upon adjournment, however, as the Legislature carried over all of the bills left on the appropriations table into next year. (See the full list here.)
The ‘study table,’ another dead end for bills this session

The Legislature also carried over all of the bills on the study table, so 22 other proposals to study a range of issues, such as an equitable energy transition for Maine’s workforce and the feasibility of establishing a dedicated state family court, have the opportunity to be approved next year. 
A bill that seeks to ensure the already required teaching of African American studies is effectively implemented across all Maine schools was left on both tables and is being carried over. 
Another bill that remains on the study table is LD 1649, which Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) attempted to move off of the table on Tuesday but failed to secure enough support. 
This bill, which Stewart sponsored along with bipartisan co-sponsors, seeks to establish a commission to study and recommend solutions for modernizing and improving the effectiveness of the Legislature. 
“It’s in no way directed at any party, person,” Stewart said, explaining that throughout his roughly five years serving on Legislative Council, the body has made some adjustments but not done a thorough review of the legislative branch as a whole. 
Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) said she agreed with the need to do so, adding, “I think there is an appetite of those around this horseshoe that I haven’t heard before.” However she and the majority of the council ultimately rejected Stewart’s motion to move forward with it this year given its price tag, $14,860 in fiscal year 2025-26 and $22,196 in subsequent years.  
“We will get to do this all over again in the second regular session,” Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said on Tuesday after the council made its study decisions, “and there will probably be more added to the list.”

The Supreme Court just undercut that.,Shefali Luthra | The 19th,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/planned-parenthood-patients-medicaid-supreme-court/,"South Carolina can block Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid funds, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision on Thursday.","This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.  Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
South Carolina can block Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid funds, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision on Thursday — a major step toward the longtime conservative goal of “defunding” the nation’s largest family planning provider.
The case, Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Carolina, concerns a 2018 order from the state’s Republican governor that barred any clinic providing abortions from getting payments through Medicaid. Medicaid, which insures low-income Americans, does not cover abortions in most states, including South Carolina. 
Medicaid is the largest source of insurance for pregnant people in the country, and most people who get health care at Planned Parenthood clinics also rely on it. Planned Parenthood provides a range of services, including contraception, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted infections. In South Carolina, almost 60 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are people of color. About 400,000 are women between the ages of 15 and 44. 
Reproductive health clinics, including Planned Parenthood, typically operate on thin financial margins. In South Carolina, the loss of Medicaid funding could force clinics to turn patients away or to charge them for services that once would have been covered. 
Though Medicaid covers millions of Americans, health facilities typically aren’t required to accept it. Without Planned Parenthood as an option, patients insured through the program could struggle to find health care providers who accept their insurance, let alone ones they trust and feel comfortable with.
The court’s ruling undercuts a key provision of federal Medicaid law: Beneficiaries are allowed to use that coverage at any qualified health provider who agrees to accept it. 
The ruling currently only applies to South Carolina, where abortion is already outlawed after six weeks of pregnancy. However, it offers a template to lawmakers in other states. Already, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas are enforcing laws that disqualify Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. 
President Donald Trump, while promising to leave abortion policy up to individual states, has said he supports policies eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood, most of which comes through Medicaid. 
In Washington, D.C., where Republicans control both chambers of Congress, senators are considering a budget bill that would prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid dollars. Another version of that bill has already passed the House. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that policy could increase the deficit by $300 million over 10 years, thanks to patients missing preventive care and requiring more expensive follow-up treatment later on for conditions such as cancer and sexually transmitted infections, as well as through unintended pregnancies.
Already, many reproductive health clinics have been forced to slash their budgets, thanks to an April move by the federal government to withhold millions of dollars of family planning grants across 22 states. Those grants would have been disbursed through the federal Title X program, which supports family planning clinics that serve low-income people. Planned Parenthood is the largest single Title X provider, and nine of the 16 grantees affected were Planned Parenthood clinics.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP_PlannedParenthood_2022-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

The charges accused Jones of stealing $750,000 from a home rehabilitation program he was supposed to be administering while turning away needy rural residents living in crumbling houses. 
But his defense attorney attacked holes in the case, and last month, a local jury found Jones not guilty of the criminal charges. Now, the state has made no indication it will bring a civil case to try to claw back the money from him.
Jones’ nonprofit Tunica County Housing Inc. secured a subcontract with the county through the North Delta Regional Housing Authority in 2014 to run the county’s home rehabilitation program funded with casino revenue. For his work, vetting applications and managing expenses, Jones earned $12,000 a month.
At the core of the criminal case were “strange money transfers” and a finding that several of the people whose applications for home rehab were approved allegedly never received any repairs to their homes. According to the auditor’s office, investigators found less than 20% of the nearly $2 million Jones’ nonprofit received went to the contractors working to rehab homes.
“Once again, an arm of government trusted a private organization to run a government program, and a large percentage of the program’s spending was flat out stolen,” State Auditor Shad White said in a press release after the arrest.
Attorney General Lynn Fitch echoed White, saying, “These funds – hundreds of thousands of dollars – were meant to help the elderly, handicapped, and poverty stricken. But the funds never got to the vulnerable citizens who needed it most.”
Jones’ lawyer Carlos Tanner explained to Mississippi Today that the program operated with an extreme backlog, and that “some of the people they were claiming didn’t get their houses done actually did” by the time the trial was held this year.
The program was poorly administered, Tanner said, meaning that even if a person’s application was approved and a rehab contract prepared, county officials could direct Jones to put someone else’s repair job ahead of his or hers.
“But just because it was run like a first weekend lemonade stand does not mean Mardis Jones stole money,” Tanner said.
Tanner said the investigators gathered paltry evidence, only looking at details that fit their narrative. While Jones did earn a large salary through his contract, Tanner said prosecutors never presented evidence that Jones converted money that was supposed to be used on home rehabilitation to his personal use. 
Investigators got a warrant to seize Jones’ electronics, Tanner said, but “they never bothered to search it.”
“The two OSA (Office of the State Auditor) officials who were running the investigation, I questioned them about it during trial, and neither of them could tell me where the computer was, where the phone was, or what the contents were,” Tanner said.
Jacob Walters, a spokesperson for the auditor’s office, defended the way the investigators handled the case, saying, “The state auditor’s office is never going to turn a case we investigated over to a prosecutor unless we’re fully confident in the work that we did.”
At the time the auditor’s office announced the Jones arrest, it also said it delivered a demand letter ordering Jones to repay over $1 million, the money it alleged he stole plus interest and investigative expenses.
It’s up to the attorney general or local district attorney to decide how to prosecute auditor investigations, or in Jones’ case, what happens to the civil demand now that a jury found him not guilty in the criminal case.
When a person receives a demand alongside his or her arrest, regardless of what happens with criminal charges, the claw back can be enforced through civil litigation — much like the case against several defendants in a stunning Mississippi Department of Human Services fraud case, which began in 2020 and has yet to be resolved. Walters said the demand against Jones is still the office’s next-largest in history, second only to the welfare scandal.
The government might choose to pursue civil litigation, even if criminal prosecution is unsuccessful, because there is a lower burden of proof to win civil cases.
But the attorney general’s office told Mississippi Today last month that it had not received the Jones demand letter from the auditor, meaning it has nothing left to enforce.
Walters said the auditor’s office sent the letter along with the case file four years ago, but that with a turnover in attorneys prosecuting the case, the auditor had to resend the file last year. If the attorney general’s office no longer possesses the demand document, Walters said, “it’s an incredibly easy problem to resolve.”
“Just reach out to us with a single phone call or email and we can get it to you,” Walters said.
After the interview, the auditor’s office sent the demand letter by email, and the attorney general’s office confirmed it was received.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06195429/Linda-Harris1.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

David M. Dye, who owns residential property at 1618 and 1624 Park St. in Keokuk, and Steve L. Andrews, who owns property at 1710 and 1714 Park St., are suing Roquette America, a corn syrup and corn starch producer located less than 1,000 feet away from the Park Street residences on South 5th Street in Keokuk.
In their lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the two men allege that due to recent developments at the Roquette plant, they’ve been damaged by a “significant” increase in odors emanating from the site. They allege that prior to the recent changes, the odor from the plant was “negligible and typical of an Iowa town.”

Court records indicate the plant was built about 122 years ago. However, the wastewater treatment facility on the site wasn’t constructed until 1977. In 1991, Roquette purchased the plant, and in 2013, Roquette allegedly began expanding its wastewater treatment system. According to the lawsuit, Roquette created an “overflow tank” in 2023 that resulted in a near-constant “foul and offensive odor” once it became operational.
The lawsuit alleges the plant’s wastewater treatment is subject to separation-distance requirements that legally restrict its operations if there are habitable structures within 1,000 feet of the plant, unless a waiver has been signed by the nearby landowners. The lawsuit states Dye and Andrews don’t recall signing any such waiver.
“The odor far exceeds any typical normal operating procedural smells,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the smell is so severe that Dye and Andrews have had to leave their homes and stay in hotels, avoid using air conditioning or heating in order to prevent outside air from entering their homes, and avoid outdoor activities at home.
The odor, they allege, “contains harmful gases” that endanger their physical and mental health.
As recently as March 2025, the plaintiffs claim, the Keokuk Fire Department was able to detect levels of ammonia within Dye’s home and concluded the smells were coming from the Roquette plant.
Federal records show that in October 2024, Roquette agreed to pay $207,488 in civil penalties for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act related to the Keokuk plant. The company also agreed to donate emergency response vehicles to the Keokuk Fire Department as part of the settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
According to the EPA, the company stores more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, on site and failed to comply with regulations intended to protect the surrounding community from accidental releases.
In addition, the lawsuit claims, Roquette previously entered into a consent decree with the EPA over alleged violations at the plant.
The lawsuit, which was first filed in state court before being transferred to federal court, alleges negligence in the construction and use of the plant; the creation of a nuisance that has deposited silt upon homes and vehicles and destroyed vegetation; and trespassing through air contaminants that have “physically invaded” the plaintiffs’ property.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as an injunction permanently barring Roquette from diverting odor onto the plaintiffs’ property or interfering with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their property.
An attorney for the Roquette America declined to comment on the lawsuit Thursday, noting that the company has until July 24 to file its formal response to the allegations.

Pat Williams once said, “If you want to know who someone really is, give them power and see what they do with it.”
What our father did with his life was defend the underdog, protect our wild lands, defend the working poor, arts and culture, Native people, and children with disabilities. He served 18 years in Congress, more consecutive terms in the U.S. House than anyone in Montana history. During his lifetime, he remained devoted to serving the people of Montana and making it a better place for future generations.
 
      About this obituary 

This obituary was crafted by the family of Pat Williams. It has been lightly edited by the Daily Montanan staff. 


Williams was a proudly from Butte, Montana. He taught in the public schools and served as a state legislator.
Throughout his career, he was known to Montanans simply as “Pat.” For many years, Montanan’s were on a first-name basis with their elected officials, Jeanette, Lee, Mike, Max and Pat. After retiring from Congress, he returned home to serve as a faculty member at the University of Montana.
He was born in Butte in 1937, during the Great Depression. His colorful Irish family included his mother Libby Williams, his cousin Evel Knievel, and Sister Toni Harris, Prioress of the Dominican nuns. His working parents owned the American Candy Shop in Butte. Because of their round-the-clock schedule, he was raised primarily by his cherished Irish grandmother Lizzy Keough. In 1965, he married Carol Griffith Williams. Theirs was a 60-year relationship that stood beyond description. Carol has been a life-long advocate for peace and justice, mother to their three children. She was also Pat’s “Senior Advisor,” campaign insider, policy director, poll manager, strategy leader—and the first woman to serve as both Montana Senate Majority and Minority Leader.
Williams was first elected to the Montana House of Representatives from Silver Bow County in 1966. After serving two terms in the Montana Legislature, he worked as an executive assistant to Montana Congressman John Melcher. Montanans elected Williams to the House of Representatives for nine terms, serving from 1979 to 1997. His year-and-a-half-long “door-to-door” campaign set the standard for grassroots campaigns. Williams, himself, knocked on 51,000 doors across western Montana, alongside a dedicated staff who he respected and loved. Many of these staff stayed with Pat for years, becoming a part of the family.
During his time in Congress, he was a tireless champion for working people. He led trailblazing legislation that assisted middle-class families and ensured educational opportunities for every child. Williams sat on congressional committees for the Budget, Natural Resources, Education, Labor, and Agriculture. He was the Chairman of the committees on Post-Secondary Education and Labor Management, and he created the College Middle Income Assistance Act. He sponsored the Family and Medical Leave Act, which protects workers from losing their jobs while taking maternity leave or caring for a sick family member. It was the first piece of legislation signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Williams was also responsible for the legislation that created the American Conservation Corps, providing thousands of America’s young people with an opportunity to serve their country and pursue higher education. Every state now has a conservation corps. In 1985,
Williams was appointed Majority Whip under House leadership by Speaker Thomas “Tip” O’Neill.
Among his many legislative accomplishments were the Children with Disabilities Act of 1987, which he named after his god-daughter Keough Duffy. His legislation protected the Lee Metcalf Wilderness Area, located north of Yellowstone National Park, as well as the Rattlesnake Wilderness Area, north of Missoula. He led the successful effort to save the Bob Marshall Wilderness from oil and gas exploration and banned geothermal energy drilling near Yellowstone. In a 1987 floor speech supporting wilderness protection, he famously warned, “We’re not proposing wilderness for wilderness’ sake—we’re holding back the concrete tide that already threatens our birthright.”
Williams was a famously vocal champion for federal arts funding and has been credited with saving the National Endowment for the Arts. His staunch advocacy of the NEA garnered him national attention during the Culture Wars of the 1980s and 1990s. It was a remarkable undertaking during a very trying time for the NEA, which he called “America’s Little Badge of Courage.”
Williams said the opportunity to defend freedom of expression was one of the things for which he was most proud. When asked about President Donald Trump defunding the agency once again. Williams responded, “Art can flourish without politics. The reverse is not true. Arts reflect the diversity and pluralism of our society, which is free, and freedom is our bulwark against tyranny. You can burn a generation’s imagination by teaching them that art is something to fear.”
Pat worked tirelessly with tribal leaders to build Montana’s seven tribal colleges. Working together, they also established the high school on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation and the Two River Eagle School on the Flathead Reservation.
Upon his retirement from Congress in 1997, Williams immediately returned to Montana, where he resumed his role as a teacher and professor at the University of Montana. He taught courses in environmental studies, history and political science. He was a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Rocky Mountain West and a Trustee for the National Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, the National Association of Job Corps, and The President’s Advisory Commission for Tribal Colleges. He was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Student Loan Marketing Association. He led the development of Western Progress. Pat was responsible for the legislative creation of the Rural Disabilities National Research Lab and the Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, both at the University of Montana. In 2012, Governor Brian Schweitzer appointed Williams to the Board of Regents of the Montana University System.
In 2023, Williams was honored by the Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes with an Indian name, “cikʷsšn” or Shining Stone. The name was chosen “as a reflection of his public service and how he shines as a leader, storyteller and the charismatic way he inspires, shares wisdom and makes people laugh. Shining Stone is a reflection of the strong foundation he provides his family, Butte and all of Montana. He is the statesman many go to for wise advice from a true elder.”
He believed government could be a force for good, and that culture, wilderness and education were not luxuries—but rights. He never gave up on the American experiment, nor on the rugged promise of his home state.
In his later years, Pat said he still heard the call of the mountains walking with his dogs. He said, “Out here, we measure a man by how well he listens when there’s no one else talking.”
Williams is survived by his wife Carol, son Griff Williams, daughters Erin Williams and Whitney Williams, his daughter-in-law Christine Treadway, son-in-law Joe Easton, and his deeply loved grandchildren: Keelan Williams, Aidan Williams and Fiona Easton.
May his life inspire us to work for the public good, take care of each other and remember we have much more in common than that which divides us.
In honor of his distinguished career, Pat’s body will be lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda in Helena, Montana. The Williams family will host a celebration of his remarkable life in Missoula. Both events will take place in July. Details to follow.
Memorials can be made to the Pat Williams Scholarship for Artists at the University of Montana or The Williams Family Fund at the Montana Community Foundation.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pat_butte-1024x781.jpg,,,2025-06-26 15:08:36.262309

Firefighters from about 10 towns surrounding Canaan spent more than eight hours subduing the fire on Monday.

The Ethan Allen lumber plant in Canaan was back operating in a limited capacity Tuesday after a major fire broke out the previous day, the company and Vermont officials said. The fire caused damage to the factory — which employs almost 100 people in the village of Beecher Falls — and required firefighting teams from two countries to tame the blaze. 
The fire erupted around 10:30 a.m. Monday after a compressor failed at the furniture maker’s Essex County plant, sparking an eight-hour blaze that emergency crews from Vermont, New Hampshire and Quebec finally subdued in the early evening.  
Vermont teams from Beecher Falls and Brighton were assisted by emergency responders from several other towns, including Dalton, New Hampshire; Colebrook, New Hampshire; Saint-Isidore-de-Clifton, Quebec; and Coaticook, Quebec, among others.
“We want to thank the brave fire crews that helped to put out this blaze and ensure the safety of all our associates as well as the safety of those who live around the plant,” Farooq Kathwari, president and CEO of Ethan Allen, said in a statement. 
“We are pleased to report that no one was injured,” Kathwari’s statement continued, “and although the damage caused will require some repair, we have restored power to a good portion of the plant and don’t anticipate significant delays in production.”
Lindsay Kurrle, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development, said in a written statement that the blaze required the factory to halt operations Monday but the damaged plant was up and running “in a limited capacity” the following day.
Named for the eponymous Vermont Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen Interiors was founded in 1932 and opened its Beecher Falls plant in 1936. The factory handles sawmill and machining operations and has about 95 employees, making it one of the largest employers in Essex County.

The company also has a furniture manufacturing plant in Orleans, which employs about 250 people, as well as facilities in North Carolina, Mexico and Honduras.
Kurrle said the company had already scheduled a “routine, one-week shutdown” for the Beecher Falls plant this month and now plans to use the time to repair damage caused by the fire and expects to be fully operational after the brief closure. 
“Ethan Allen officials tell us the fire could have been much worse,” Kurrle said. “They say they are grateful to firefighters for knocking it down and to community members who supported first responders by showing up with food and water as they battled the blaze that took more than eight hours to extinguish.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA).NEW ORLEANS – The Louisiana Anti-Hunger Coalition and New Orleans Health Department Director Dr. Jennifer Avegno expressed opposition to proposed changes to state food and health programs in the Congress’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” at a virtual news conference Wednesday.
The bill proposes increasing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP) work requirement age from 54 to 64 for able-bodied people without dependents and to lower the age of qualified dependents from 18 to 10. The bill also includes changes that would reduce enrollment in Medicaid and limit the number of providers who can participate in the federal health insurance program.
The U.S. Senate parliamentarian recently found that a proposal in the bill to implement cost-sharing for SNAP, shifting financial responsibility for the program to states for the first time, would have violated Senate rules. The Louisiana coalition, made up of food advocacy organizations, supports that ruling but has continued concerns  with the bill’s proposed cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.
Pat Van Burkleo, executive director of Feeding Louisiana, a nonprofit system of food banks across the state, said SNAP should be seen as an “economic development issue,” not as free handouts.
“Real fiscal responsibility means protecting programs that prevent deeper poverty, poor health outcomes and greater social instability,” he said. “SNAP is a bridge to help people in vulnerable situations.”

Dauda Sesay, founder and executive director of the Louisiana Organization for Refugees and Immigrants, said his family depended on food assistance after fleeing civil war in Sierra Leone as a teenager, eventually ending up in Baton Rouge.
“Today, through that support, I am giving back,” he said.
Sesay called the bill’s proposed changes a “weapon” against financially struggling families and children.
“We cannot call ourselves a free and modern society if we abandon the most vulnerable among us,” he said.
Dr. Avegno, health director of the city of New Orleans, said the city has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country. According to the mayor’s office, 21% of city residents receive SNAP benefits, and over 16% experience food insecurity.
Nearly 18% of Louisianians rely on SNAP to pay for groceries, including 360,000 children, according to the state’s Department of Children and Family Services.
“I think we’ve all felt the pain of rising food costs over the past few years, but those individuals who really rely on assistance to keep their families whole are going to be cut most of all,” Dr. Avegno said. “We can’t ‘make America healthy again’ by robbing millions of our citizens of ways to eat healthy food and avoid chronic disease that’s caused by poor diet.”
She added that the bill would inevitably place funding responsibilities on states.
“[The cuts] would increase the state’s contributions to the program, which our state, as well as every other state, can’t really handle in terms of the burden on our own budget,” she said.
Conrad Cable is the owner of Current Farms, a community farm in Marion. He spoke about the importance of programs like SNAP for small-to-medium sized farms that do not qualify for larger government subsidies.
“If any of these lawmakers advocating for these changes would come out here and work for a day on my farm, it would break them,” he said. “They are so out of touch from how hard Louisianians work and how hard it is to survive in this state whenever these programs are cut.”
On Tuesday (June 24), President Donald Trump posted on TruthSocial that members of Congress could not go on vacation for July 4 until the bill is on his desk.
Burkleo said he encourages voters to pressure Louisiana Senators John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy to oppose the bill, which is currently in the Senate and has not yet been passed by the House of Representatives. Both senators have expressed support for the bill.
Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, spoke about the proposal’s potential to disproportionately affect the Black community.
“This bill aims to strip us of the very services meant to close those disparities,” he said. “If you vote for this bill, you vote against the lives of every Louisianian, period.”
McClanahan noted that his organization is prepared to oppose the bill “at all costs.”
“The NAACP was born out of struggle, and we’re going to challenge this bill in the Capitol, in the streets, at the ballot box and in the courtroom,” he said. “This is not a request. This is a warning.”

Jenny Boelter, wife of Vance Boelter, released her first public statement Thursday condemning the assassination of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. Vance Boelter is accused by prosecutors of killing the Hortmans and shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, on June 14. 
“On behalf of my children and myself, I want to express our deepest sympathies to the Hortman and Hoffman families. Our condolences are with all who are grieving during this unimaginably difficult time, and we are praying daily for them,” Jenny Boelter wrote. 
Authorities found lists written by Vance Boelter with the names and addresses of Democratic public officials, suggesting the attack was politically motivated. Boelter is alleged to have impersonated a police officer, visiting the homes of Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope and Rep. Kristin Bahner in Maple Grove in addition to the Hortmans and Hoffmans. Rest and Bahner were not harmed.
Vance Boelter texted his wife and other family members in the early hours of June 14, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.” 
Jenny Boelter wrote that she and her family were “absolutely shocked, heartbroken and completely blindsided” by the attack and that it was “a betrayal of everything we hold true as tenets of our Christian faith.” 
The statement says that Jenny Boelter received a call from law enforcement on June 14 and met with agents at a gas station. She said she answered questions, provided requested items and cooperated with searches. 
“From the moment we were first contacted by law enforcement, we have fully cooperated with investigators and responded to their every request…We thank law enforcement for apprehending Vance and protecting others from further harm,” the statement said. 
Vance Boelter was arrested the day after the assassination and has been charged with murder by both Hennepin County and federal prosecutors.  
Jenny Boelter has retained legal representation from Halberg Criminal Defense, according to the statement.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis) North Carolina lawmakers are sending half a billion dollars to the western mountains for hurricane relief, reaching a long-sought compromise between the House and Senate just hours before they left Raleigh for weeks.
Both chambers unanimously approved House Bill 1012 on Thursday. Gov. Josh Stein is expected to swiftly sign it into law.
The final agreement puts $700 million total into the state’s Helene relief fund. And it appropriates $500 million of that money, leaving the other $200 million for future relief.
“It addresses immediate needs,” said Rep. Karl Gillespie (R- Cherokee). “It does not address all needs. There will be more to work on later.”
Private road and bridge repairs, which are ongoing, will receive $75 million as part of the bill. Another $70 million will serve to match federal funding for ongoing projects.
State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office will get $51.5 million to send out interest-free loans to local governments. And a separate $70 million grant program will help fund infrastructure in municipalities.
Farmers will also continue to see aid. A $25 million program will help reimburse damaged or lost farm infrastructure.
A host of natural resource and environmental programs will receive money: $15 million for wildfire prevention, $15 million for streamflows, $10 million for dam repairs and more.
School districts will also be eligible for $8 million in grants included in the bill to repair infrastructure or buildings damaged by the storm.
Absent from the final agreement is a grant program for small businesses. The longtime request from business owners and western lawmakers was part of the House’s proposal, but struck by the Senate.
“We have not done small business grants for the east,” Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters. “We just didn’t feel like it was something that we needed to do at this point.”
Democrats from Asheville and the surrounding county said the lack of grants would hurt the “economic engine” of the area.
“When we talk about ‘there’s more to come’ … for most of the small businesses impacted by the storm, it will come too late,” said Rep. Brian Turner (D-Buncombe). “And the ripple effects will be felt all across the region.”
Other large bundles of money will be directed toward relief under the bill. Almost $300 million for the Department of Transportation will be used for Helene repairs. And the package green-lights the use of $685 million in federal dollars for water and sewer infrastructure.
The House passed their version of the bill in May, sending a $464 million package to the Senate. It went untouched there for a month, until senators made major changes to the bill and pushed it through.
Senators’ prior plan was more expansive than their counterparts’. But it lacked key line-items like the business grant program, and redirected hundreds of millions in transportation money for relief efforts. Both changes prompted concerns from the House.
The Republican-led General Assembly has over the past year been reticent to send out money at the clip that Stein, a Democrat, has asked for.
But GOP lawmakers have touted their approach, which has now resulted in four substantive aid bills, as the proper line between fiscal responsibility and meeting needs in the west.



Still, that approach has encountered roadblocks and frustrated Democrats.
Slow-arriving federal money has made state efforts more urgent, as western North Carolina struggles to rebuild. And Democrats have frequently called for more robust investment to save the tourism-dependent mountain economy and ramp up recovery efforts.
Some remained exasperated Thursday with the final state of the aid bill.
“We need relief money in western North Carolina, so I’m going to vote for this bill,” said Rep. Lindsey Prather (D-Buncombe). “I’m really not happy with the way it ended up.”
The new aid deal means lawmakers have now spent $1.9 billion in state money on Helene recovery. Just over $1 billion of that has come through the two aid packages passed this session.
Ahead of the Senate’s vote Thursday, a local lawmaker urged those traveling in the coming summer months to consider western North Carolina.
“Please come. Spend your money,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield (D-Buncombe). “Because we need it.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-26 14:12:20.183907

Loeffler was CEO of Bakkt, a Georgia-based company that builds crypto technology for business use and a former owner of the WNBA team Atlanta Dream. She served as a Republican U.S. senator from Georgia from 2020 to 2021. During her time in the Senate, she touted a “100% Trump voting record.”
She was chosen as President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the SBA earlier this year. This marks Loeffler’s first trip to Iowa as SBA administrator.
“I’m thrilled to be part of this year’s Entrepreneur Expo led by Senator Ernst, and to work with her as Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee,” Loeffler said in the release. “President Trump knows that small businesses are our nation’s economic and innovation engine. This Administration is returning the focus to Main Streets in Iowa and across America to ensure they have the resources they need to succeed.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kelly-Loeffler-_-Jill-Nolin-GA-Recorder-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 14:12:20.183907

In a unanimous vote, the council approved a budget, reducing city staff but closing the previous $9.8 million budget gap.

BURLINGTON — The City Council unanimously approved a $107.1 million budget Wednesday for the 2025-26 fiscal year, closing a nearly $10 million gap through workforce reductions, new investments and a municipal tax increase. 
The new budget also addresses a $1.8 million shortfall discovered last week by increasing municipal taxes by $115 on a $500,000 home. However, Progressive Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said the hike will be offset by a reduction in education taxes.
“This budget reflects an unwavering commitment to affordability for residents here in the city of Burlington,” Mulvaney-Stanak said Wednesday. “It contains very critical investments in key priority areas for my administration, largely community safety and housing.”
The Howard Center Street Outreach program, which provides support for people in need of mental health, addiction, housing and social services, received increased funding. The council also allocated $50,000 to support senior programming.  
To balance the budget, Mulvaney-Stanak and her administration reduced the city workforce, which the mayor said grew unsustainably in the past nine years — adding 98 new full-time positions, including 37 funded with one-time money and no long-term plan to maintain them. The mayor also gave up her own cost-of-living salary increase in the next fiscal year, and her department heads won’t receive it for the first six months.
Mulvaney-Stanak mentioned inflation, cost-of-living adjustments, health care increases and possible tariffs among the challenges the council had to address to close the budget gap. 
“We were able to deliver you a budget that is decreased or reduced by more than 1%. When you compare the total to fiscal year [20]25, that is pretty rare out there in government,” Mulvaney-Stanak said.
City councilors expressed appreciation for the efforts to close the budget gap and the new investments, but also expressed unease about layoffs.
Councilor Carter Neubieser, a Progressive, advanced a motion to cut $100,000 allocated to the University of Vermont Health Network, presenting data on profits and assets to show that the hospital network would have enough money to cover this expense.
Councilor Evan Litwin also presented a motion to move $7,500 from the Howard Center Street Outreach program to the Turning Point Center of Chittenden County, dedicated to addiction recovery programs. 
Both motions were rejected by the rest of the councilors, who claimed these proposals required a more in-depth discussion and that it was too late to make new changes to the budget.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, early last month, told states it wanted records of all applicants and recipients for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since 2020. The records include names, dates of birth, addresses and Social Security numbers.
This triggered a lawsuit by nonprofit groups and others, and the department has since walked back its request. But some states did begin taking steps to hand over data.
The demand came in light of a March executive order from President Donald Trump telling federal agency heads to “ensure the Federal Government has unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding.” 
A letter to states said the rationale for getting the SNAP data was to “ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients.” 
The unprecedented move appears to be part of a broader effort to access state-held data that could be used to target immigrants without legal status. The Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency had moved to combine data across the federal government under the auspices of rooting out fraud.
On a similar front, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security asked for state-level Medicaid data from the federal agency that oversees the program. Washington was one of a few states whose Medicaid data was shared, to the outrage of immigrant rights groups who have called on the governor to address their concerns. 
The federal government funds SNAP, which helps low-income residents pay for food, but states run it with the help of third-party payment processors. Recipients receive their monthly benefit on an Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT, card. 
In Washington, that third-party processor is Fidelity Information Services. At least 20 other states also use Fidelity, which reportedly told its state clients it planned to cooperate with the Trump administration. The company gave states a deadline to provide consent to disclose the data.
The state Department of Social and Health Services, which runs Washington’s program, told Fidelity not to give the feds “any confidential information.”
“DSHS is complying with proper data requests sent directly to DSHS, subject to federal data and security protocols,” agency spokesperson Norah West said in an email Tuesday. “We are concerned about the potential for bypassing protections and processes that are already in place.”
“We have requested that USDA continue to send any requests for DSHS SNAP data directly to DSHS,” West continued. “We will evaluate each request and provide information as required by law.”
In March, the most recent month for which data is available, over 908,000 Washingtonians received a total of $168 million in SNAP benefits. That’s more than 10% of the state’s residents. Nationwide, the program serves upward of 42 million people.
When advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over its attempts to access the data, they argued the federal government was exceeding its authority and violating privacy protections.
The Department of Agriculture has told the processors not to transfer over the data until they hear “requisite procedural safeguards have been met.”
Some other states, like Kansas and New Mexico, have similarly refused to comply, while others, including Alaska and Tennessee, have said they’re prepared to share the information.
Meanwhile, food stamps are threatened under the budget bill the U.S. Senate is currently considering. Estimates indicate tens of thousands of Washingtonians would lose some or all of their SNAP benefits under revised work requirements and other changes in that legislation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/snap-ebt-food-stamps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 14:12:20.183907

Dan McKee on June 26, 2025, for the ceremonial signing of a ban on the purchase and sale of assault-style weapons. The law goes into effect on July 1, 2026. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Starting July 1, 2026, Rhode Islanders will be barred from buying or selling certain military-style semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns — though those who already own them can still keep them.
Gov. Dan McKee signed the ban at the State House Thursday morning, flanked inside by gun safety advocates in red and orange T-shirts who have long pushed state lawmakers to ban such weapons.
“This is progress today and it will make Rhode Island safer for our families and for our neighbors,” McKee said. 
The legislation that went to McKee’s desk was the Senate’s version unveiled in the final days of the 2025 legislative session, which was a  scaled-back version of the legislation that passed the House.
“It wasn’t an easy process, it wasn’t a guaranteed success,” Senate President Valarie Lawson told the crowd of lawmakers and advocates
Violators of the ban face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and will have to forfeit their assault-style weapons.
Excluded from the new law are shotguns with detachable magazines, pistol grips and folding stocks along with most semi-automatic pistols.
The Senate’s rewrite also did away with a voluntary weapon certification program, which itself was amended from a mandate that grandfathered weapons be registered with law enforcement — a provision that drew the ire of pro-Second Amendment advocates.
McKee went as far as including the ban in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget — though legislative leaders like House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi were not keen on that maneuver.
“This bill belonged, it’s a very important issue, as standalone legislation,” Shekarchi told the crowd. “And the votes proved it.”

The Senate approved the bill 25-11, while the lower chamber approved it by 43-28 vote Friday night.
The compromise was met with some dissatisfaction from the Rhode Island Coalition against Gun Violence, whose leader took aim at lawmakers’ decision to no longer outlaw the possession of prohibited weapons. 
Executive Director Melissa Carden told reporters after the signing ceremony that it’s possible the perceived loophole could allow someone to purchase a weapon in another state where such sales are legal. She acknowledged that federal law prohibits firearm sales to residents of states where a particular weapon is banned, but said it’s ultimately up to the federal government to enforce.
“And at a time where the federal government is rolling back all kinds of gun safety programs, that’s a concern,” Carden said.
Still, she said the progress made by the state in eliminating the sale of weapons commonly used in mass shootings is worth celebrating.
“We never want another family or workplace torn apart by a preventable loss,” she told the crowd.
Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat who sponsored the House version of the ban, said he’s satisfied with what the General Assembly ultimately brought to McKee’s desk.
“Could it have been more? Sure,” Knight said in an interview. “But show me a bill that passes through this building where that’s not true.”

(Stock photo via Getty Images)Eight years after Christopher Hudrick was fired from the Des Moines Police Department and lost his certification, he is again able to work as a police officer.
His certification was suspended for a minimum period of three years from Sept. 1, 2020. Hudrick fought his termination, suing the Des Moines Civil Service Commission that denied his appeal for reinstatement but was ultimately unsuccessful. 
Hudrick was terminated after violating a last chance agreement in January 2017, after nearly 10 years with the Des Moines Police Department.
During his time, he accumulated a record of 11 reprimands and a total of 37 days suspended. These violations range from hitting an airplane with his squad car to failing to pull over for Iowa State Patrol, according to court records filed by the commission. 
“I’ve gone through a lot this whole process, I’ve grown, I’ve matured.” Hudrick said during his reinstatement discussion with the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy Council. “Since the past, I’ve been able to perform what I know to be what I love at a high level.”
His career
Growing up, Hudrick loved superheroes. He cites the stories of Spiderman and Captain America as a reason for he developed a passion for justice. 
“Heroes, they go out and save the day. They don’t do it because they have the power — they do it because they want to. Because they can go out and they can help people. Part of that always stuck in my head, I can go out and I can help people and I’m good at that because I can find a way to relate to somebody,” he said in an interview with Iowa Capital Dispatch.
He said he decided to become a police officer after 9/11. At the time, Hudrick had the day off from his job at a gas station, but was unexpectedly called in due to a huge influx of customers. 
“Cars were lined up for miles trying to get gas and they needed help at one of the other gas stations in town just down the road,” he said. “People were getting in fights over who gets gas next, so, I mean, it was chaotic. Everyone was freaking out and rightfully so.  But, the thing that dawned on me after that had all happened was that I didn’t freak out, I stayed calm amidst everything that was going on and was able to get things flowing smoothly.”
Following a conversation with a deputy from the Story County Sheriff’s Office, he applied to be a corrections officer at the local detention center. He applied “over and over and over again,” did well on his tests and did well in his interviews but he was never hired due to a lack of college education.
“I was like, ‘How much longer am I going to do this? I know what I want to do, how much longer am I going to put it off?’ So, I made the decision to go back to school so I could get my degree in criminal justice,” he said.
While taking courses, Hudrick was a member of the Criminal Justice Club, which allowed him to get “hands-on experience” with the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. He “really enjoyed” the training and his passion for law enforcement “kept growing.” By the time he graduated, he no longer wanted to be in corrections, he wanted to be a police officer.
Hudrick was hired by the city of Des Moines in 2007. In his nearly 10 years with the force he had several moments he looks back fondly on.
One day he got a call for an 8-year-old boy who was attacking workers and tearing up his room at a Youth Emergency Shelter. 
“When I got there, he actually wanted me to shoot him and kill him. He’s like 8 years old. He would make a sailor blush with his language. I mean, it was bad. So, I had to break down that barriers between me and him. You know, I’m a police officer and he hates police officers and he wants me to shoot him,” Hudrick said.
He spotted a Batman and Superman sticker on the kid’s wall. As a lifelong comics fan, Hudrick offered to pick up some graphic novels from the library if the boy would calm down and clean up his room. The boy didn’t believe him, but he went anyway. 
That same day, “The Incredible Hulk” star Lou Ferrigno, a “childhood hero” of Hudrick’s, was visiting the department. Rather than attending the appearance, he “put that aside,” to deal with the youth but calls it “one of the best, most rewarding things” he’s ever done. 
“He did change but then he would act up and get in trouble just so they would call me, because he wanted to see me,” he said. 
Following the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, in 2012, every time he dropped his daughter off at school, he would remain on campus until the last kid arrived to ease the worries of the family and faculty. For this, he received a letter of appreciation from the principal. He also received a letter of appreciation for “kindly and delicately” treating victims of a home invasion.
Hudrick said he prevented multiple suicides during his career, one of which he received a chief’s commendation for. 
“Coming from having a bit of a troubled childhood and home life, it helps me to relate to them. ‘I’m not in your circumstances but I’ve been in that circumstance.’ I can relate through my own experiences,” he said. 
Hudrick says these experiences and more “fueled that passion” he had for law enforcement.
His termination
“In my case, I’ve got a lot of experience. I’ve got a lot of experience with helping, I’ve got a lot of experience with making my mistakes but the most important thing is to own the mistakes and learn from them,” he said. 
In 2008, he received two written reprimands. In 2009, he was suspended for three days, a two-day suspension in July and a one-day suspension in October. In October 2010, he received a 12-day suspension for mishandling property. In July 2011, he received a written reprimand followed by a four-day suspension for a separate instance of misconduct. In September 2013, he received a one-day suspension. All disciplinary actions were accepted without appeal from Hudrick.
Among the violations are reprimands for hitting an airplane at an airport with his squad car, mishandling property, refusing to pull over for the Iowa State Patrol and driving in “emergency mode” without lights and sirens. His police chief called his disciplinary record “abysmal” in a letter to Hudrick, filed in court records on behalf of the service commission.
Hudrick notes in his reinstatement discussion with the law enforcement academy council that he “never had complaints with use of force, never any integrity issues or falsifying evidence.”
“It was based on me wanting to impress people,” he said. “Unfortunately, it was me just getting in my own way. Just hitting the gas and going like I had a rocket strapped to my back.” 
In 2015, Hudrick caused an accident, did not stop at the scene, as required by Iowa law, and failed to check on the condition of the driver he hit, according to court records filed on behalf of the service commission. The records also indicate that at the time, Police Chief Dana Wingert “was inclined to terminate Hudrick’s employment” but instead imposed a ‘last chance warning’ and a 15-day suspension.
Hudrick’s last chance warning indicated, “Any future incidents of misconduct of any kind including but not limited to the exercise of poor judgment, poor driving, inappropriate care of evidence, poor service, unprofessionalism, failure to perform assigned tasks, or otherwise failing to fulfill your assigned duties WILL result in your termination from employment.”
Following the incident, Hudrick notes at his reinstatement discussion, he sat down with “a really good mentor and officer Pat Hickey,” and determined that he “needed to slow himself down.”
“He told me to drive like the chief was in the car, so I did. And it worked, it really did work. I was able to respond to several different calls where instead of just hitting the gas, I pictured where it was at, the different ways it could go for suspects leaving the scene and then just went that way. I didn’t push the envelope, I didn’t get crazy or anything like that and time after time after time, it put me right in the exact right spot,” he told the council.
On Sept. 22, 2016, Hudrick responded to a call for police service where a couple had handcuffed themselves together and were unable to find the key, according to court records. He claimed that he and the couple laughed about the incident. After assisting the couple, he returned to his police car and took a picture of the Des Moines Police Department Mobile Data Terminal which displayed details of the call for service. He posted this image to Facebook with comments such as “arm to leg…you can’t make this stuff up folks?” and “you should have seen them hopping across the floor…lol.”
The post was determined by the Department of Professional Standards to be in violation of several department policies, related to professionalism and the dissemination of information. 
“It was really a brighter moment in what was going on at the time. Nobody in law enforcement was good in 2016,” he said at the reinstatement discussion. “That post wasn’t meant to make fun of them, it was meant to show a funny moment.”
In his reinstatement discussion, Hudrick notes that at the time he was affected by the passing of his squad members. Earlier that year, officers Carlos Puente-Morales and Susan Farrell were killed in a head-on collision with a drunk driver while transporting a prisoner from Council Bluffs back to Des Moines. He argued that 2016 was a “bad year” for law enforcement “no matter what you did.”
“What we do doesn’t stop at that moment. We still have to go out and do our job,” he said. “The grieving process isn’t something you get to fully actuate and get through.”
According to Hudrick, at the time of his termination, the department had yet to adopt a social media policy. The complaint against his post came internally and he was terminated for making a “news release” with his Facebook post.
On Jan. 6, 2017, Hudrick’s employment was terminated by Wingert.
Hudrick filed several appeals to argue his termination, first to the Des Moines Civil Service Commission, then to the courts. In both cases the termination was reaffirmed.
His eight-year hiatus
Before his certification was suspended, he had applied for jobs with the Iowa State Patrol,  as well as positions in Ankeny, Pleasant Hill, Urbandale and Carlisle. He notes that in applying to other jobs his past “always came back to haunt” him. 
“If it wasn’t for my wife, I don’t know if I would be sitting here. She’s supported me, she’s kept me grounded, she’s been nothing short of amazing in every sense of the world. That’s an understatement,” he said. “We’re still together after all this, after almost losing everything.”
Hudrick says he lost his ability to provide for his family. Going into law enforcement was also a means of securing a good job and losing that hit his family in a significant way. They were forced to cash in a large part of their retirement savings and relied on support from their family to stay “on dry land,” he said.
Following his termination, Hudrick worked for a year at Uber without any driving issues. After realizing he “needed something more sustainable,” he worked as a delivery route driver for FedEx for four years. When he began working there, he had an extended route that took him into southern Iowa — a 10-hour route Monday through Friday. He compiled no issues with his driving during this time. 
“Driving 10 hours a day gives you a lot of time to think and reflect,” he said in his reinstatement discussion. “So, it’s a lot of learning how to self check, getting my head where it needs to be and to be present in the moment, accepting the stupid things I did and learning from them.”
At FedEx, he transitioned to a route to Urbandale where he received a safe driving award. 
In 2022, he started working in production at Kemin industries but moved to “different departments within the company and learned new areas and new skills.”
But ultimately, Hudrick said, law enforcement is his passion. One of his main reasons for getting recertified after his eight-year hiatus, is to help newer officers who are struggling “to not go down that same path, where you just keep tripping over your own feet.”
His recertification
The reinstatement discussion for Hudrick was held by the ILEA on April 3, 2025. Hudrick was accompanied by his lawyer, Mark Hedberg, who represented him during his termination appeals in 2017. 
“To hear the stories on that side of the bench and the struggle that you guys have to come up with the right decision, pulling out the facts, sorting that out. It’s very humbling and very refreshing,” Hedberg said at the start of the reinstatement discussion. “The integrity of public safety is number one, your job is to keep the public on the right side and I think you’ve done a great job of that here in Iowa. Having said that, I support him wholeheartedly.”
Following his discussion, the board members had no comments other than board chair Ric Martinez commenting he had “been out of law enforcement for a while…but as we all know, police work is still police work.” 
Councilmember Dan Jansen motioned to grant the reinstatement for Christopher Hudrick stating the “reason for the suspension no longer exists and it is in the state’s best interest to fully return state certification.” 
All council members approved the reinstatement. 
Kristi Traynor, legal counsel to the ILEA, said board members would not comment on the reinstatement. In the reinstatement order, the council concluded that Hudrick “demonstrated his growth and maturity through stability in other employment,” and “further accepted responsibility for his behavior.” They added “there no longer continues to be public safety given the evidence of rehabilitation.”
A spokesperson for the Des Moines Police Department did not respond to a request for comment about Hudrick’s reinstatement.
He has not applied for a job since his reinstatement. He said “that passion hasn’t died,” but he wants to wait to confirm that “mentally” it’s something he can still do.
“It feels like home,” he said to the academy board members. “It’s what I am good with, I’m good with people. My mindset is that we’re not out there to mess with people, we’re there to help people,”

According to the health department, the facility currently houses approximately 400 people and employs 100 staff members. NMDOH will be supply the facility with personal protection equipment, test kits and measles vaccines. The new cases bring the total number statewide to 86, spread across eight counties. The other counties in which measles cases have been reported include: Lea, San Juan, Curry, Eddy, Doña Ana, Chaves and Sandoval.
Measles symptoms begin with a cough, runny nose and eye redness, before progressing to fever and rash that starts at the head before moving down the body. Health officials advise that people who have measles can infect others from four days before the rash appears and remain contagious four days after the rash is gone.
The health department encourages people with symptoms who have been exposed to measles to call NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for guidance in English and Spanish. If planning to see a doctor or visit an emergency room, call first so health care providers can plan for a visit by someone who may have measles.

She is the wife of James Meredith, the man who faced a violent white mob when he became the first Black student to enroll in the University of Mississippi in 1962.
More than 100 relatives, friends and admirers gathered Wednesday night at Hal & Mal’s restaurant in Jackson to celebrate Meredith’s 92nd birthday. Many posed for photos with him, and Judy Alsobrooks Meredith spoke on behalf of the family.
She said the new anti-DEI law will make educators reluctant to teach about her husband or other important figures including Medgar Evers, the Mississippi NAACP leader who was assassinated in Jackson in 1963, and his wife, Myrlie Evers, who is still living and who became a civil rights leader in her own right.
“Y’all better start teaching your kids and your grandkids who they are,” said Alsobrooks Meredith, as the Evers’ daughter, Reena Evers-Everette, stood nearby.
A federal judge heard arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit that seeks to block the anti-DEI measure, which became law when Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed it in mid-April.
The law prevents public schools from creating diversity, equity and inclusion offices; hiring people based on their race, sex, color or national origin; or engaging in “divisive” concepts, including teaching that a person “by virtue of his or her race, sex, color, national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive.”
Legislative Democrats argued that the restrictions will force teachers to minimize ugly parts of history, including slavery and segregation. Republicans who pushed for the law said DEI concepts divide people into victims and oppressors.
With restrictions in schools and universities, Alsobrooks Meredith said it’s more important than ever for people to share their own family histories.
“Young people, start recording when you hear old folks talking … when you hear your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother talking about some stuff, start hitting the record button. Just do that. You’ve got to preserve,” she said. “To say that Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers and James Meredith … they never existed. Well, that’s a lie born in hell.”

Ron DeSantis threw out the V word on Thursday and warned state legislators he is getting ready to use his line-item veto power.
During a lengthy press conference on higher education held on the campus of Florida Atlantic University, the Republican governor took shots at the Legislature for not passing a budget on time. He also noted that the final $115.1 billion budget includes enough local projects for individual lawmakers to leave him “kind of numb.”
He will have to sign the budget and use any line-item vetoes before July 1.
“Well, there obviously will be veto[es],” said DeSantis, who last year vetoed $949.6 million in projects from the budget that runs through next Monday. In 2023, the governor vetoed $510.9 million from the state’s spending plan and in 2022 he vetoed a whopping $3.1 billion.  
DeSantis’ remarks on the subject were brief but biting.
“I think those of you who follow state politics, legislative stuff, we’d thought we’d get a budget in early May. Fiscal year ends June 30. They didn’t quite do that and they ended up producing one probably about 45 days after the deadline — which, you know is their prerogative to do. The reality, though, is there’s a lot to go through. So we’ve been going through it. I mean like I’m kind of numb with all the different line items that are in it.”
The GOP-led Legislature failed to pass the budget during the regular 60-day session. Leaders agreed to an extended session and on June 16 approved a $115.1 billion budget and a $1.3 billion tax cut package. The 2025-26 budget is $3.5 billion smaller than this year’s and half a billion less than DeSantis proposed spending.
The House and Senate also agreed as part of the budget to direct for the next two years $1.5 into the Budget Stabilization Fund to weather a potential recession. The emergency fund could help Florida get through the looming federal funding cuts. 
The Senate unanimously voted for the budget, whereas two Democrats in the House voted against it.

Free.,"Trump administration intends to deport Abrego Garcia to third country, DOJ lawyer says",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-intends-deport-abrego-garcia-third-country-doj-lawyer-says,,"This report has been updated.GREENBELT, Maryland — The Trump administration plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a third country once he is released from federal custody, a Department of Justice attorney disclosed during a Thursday emergency court hearing.Attorneys for the unlawfully deported Abrego Garcia had made an emergency request Thursday to bring him back to Maryland while his criminal case continues.The move by the lawyers followed earlier public statements from Trump administration officials that they would deport Abrego Garcia to El Salvador upon his release from a Tennessee federal court as soon as Friday. But Thursday, plans appeared to have shifted to deportation somewhere else.DOJ attorney Jonathan Guynn, under questioning by District of Maryland Judge Paula Xinis, said the Trump administration planned to deport Abrego Garcia, and “to a third country is my understanding.”“He will be taken into (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) custody and removal proceedings will be initiated,” Guynn said of Abrego Garcia’s release. “There are no imminent plans to remove him to a third country.""Xinis declined the request to return him to Maryland, arguing that Abrego Garcia has not been released and that she’s not clear if she has the jurisdiction to fulfill such a request.She added that Guynn said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security does not have “imminent plans” to deport Abrego Garcia to a third country, while holding out that possibility.The Supreme Court this week, ruled that it will allow, for now, the Trump administration to continue carrying out deportations to third countries, after a Massachusetts judge barred removals without proper notice. In such cases, immigrants are deported to countries that are not their native countries and may be far from them.Jonathan Cooper, a partner of Quinn Emmanuel, the firm representing Abrego Garcia in his immigration case, tried to ask Xinis if she would require the Trump administration to notify Cooper and his team before deporting him to a third country.“We have concerns that the government may try to move Mr. Abrego Garcia quickly over the weekend,” Cooper said.Xinis said she would not because Guynn said that the Trump administration had no “imminent plans” to remove Abrego Garcia.Cooper laid out the same concerns in the written emergency request to Xinis Thursday.“The Government’s public statements leave little doubt about its plan: remove Abrego Garcia to El Salvador once more,” according to the complaint written by attorneys from Quinn Emmanuel.“If this Court does not act swiftly, then the Government is likely to whisk Abrego Garcia away to some place far from Maryland,” it says.Federal prosecutors in Tennessee court have said that should Abrego Garcia be released, he would be immediately arrested by ICE agents and could face deportation back to El Salvador, despite having protections from such removal since 2019.Tennessee caseAbrego Garcia was returned from El Salvador earlier this month to the United States to face federal criminal charges lodged in Tennessee that accuse him “of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”The indictment occurred while Abrego Garcia was housed in a Salvadoran prison.The human smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee when police pulled Abrego Garcia over for speeding. Eight other men were in the car, but neither Abrego Garcia nor the passengers were arrested.DHS opened an investigation into the three-year-old stop and Attorney General Pam Bondi held a press conference on the day Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face federal charges.She argued that the traffic stop was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme where Abrego Garcia was paid by members of the MS-13 gang to transport migrants who entered the country without legal authorization to destinations across the country.His attorneys have denied the charges and Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty in federal court in Nashville.Stephen Miller, the chief architect of many of the president’s immigration policies and a senior White House adviser, has written on social media that Abrego Garcia would be deported back to El Salvador if released. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have pointed to that statement as to why they want him brought back to Maryland.The Trump administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a leader of the MS-13 gang, and President Donald Trump has made those same allegations. During an interview, the president held up a photo of Abrego Garcia’s knuckles that were digitally altered to type MS-13 on his fingers.House Democrats pressed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in May about the doctored photo and she sidestepped questions about whether the photo was real, until she eventually said she was unaware it existed.She added that even if Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. that he would be immediately deported.Maryland argumentsIn Maryland, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said in their complaint they want to ensure he is not deported again.“This motion does not ask this Court to adjudicate Abrego Garcia’s custodial status in the Tennessee criminal proceedings; that is for the Tennessee district court to resolve,” they wrote.“Nor does this motion seek to alter any of the conditions of release set by the Tennessee district court or otherwise interfere with the Tennessee criminal proceedings. This motion simply seeks to ensure that when Abrego Garcia is released from criminal custody, he returns to, and remains in, this District (other than to travel to Tennessee as needed), until further order from this Court.”Abrego Garcia lives with his family in Maryland. “Maryland is where he was on March 12 at the moment his unlawful removal saga began, when ICE agents with ‘no warrant for his arrest and no lawful basis’ arrested him and locked him up at an ‘ICE facility in Baltimore, Maryland,’” the complaint said.“Returning Abrego Garcia to Maryland implements the Supreme Court’s directive and safeguards this Court’s jurisdiction in this matter,” it added.Clashes between administration and judgesAbrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation drew national attention to the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportations campaign that some judges have found skirted due process rights for immigrants. The White House has clashed with the judicial branch with some frequency over immigration decisions.The Trump administration this week has, in an unusual move, sued the entire judicial bench of the District Court of Maryland, including Xinis, over a standing order to require a two-day pause for deportations due to a high volume of habeas corpus claims from immigrants challenging their detention in the state. A habeas corpus claim allows immigrants to challenge their detention.Abrego Garcia has had deportation protections from his home country since 2019, but in March he was arrested in Maryland by federal immigration officials while driving his son home and informed his status had changed. Days later, he was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, a move the Trump administration admitted was a mistake.In April, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration had to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States, but stopped short of requiring it.For the next two months, administration officials would testify in a Maryland court that Abrego Garcia’s return was out of their hands and up to the government of El Salvador.Xinis has accused the Trump administration of stonewalling information and is allowing for discovery in the civil case to continue to determine if the Trump administration violated her court order to return Abrego Garcia.",,,,2025-06-26 16:08:29.985150

(Photo: NCGA)Governor Josh Stein’s key cabinet members have been on the job since January but required confirmation from the state Senate under a 2016 law to check the governor’s appointment powers. And after months of multiple committee hearings, the state Senate on Thursday gave its blessing to Stein’s final three cabinet secretaries for the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Adult Correction, and the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
Reid Wilson, who has spent the last four years leading the NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, now has the full title of Secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality.
The confirmation hearing for Wilson encountered a brief hiccup Wednesday from an angry constituent. Nelson Paul of Beaufort said the Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) recently contacted his wife and other recreational fishing license holders to encourage them to support a ban on inland shrimp trawling.
“This is a blatant political act to put the thumb on the scale to ensure shrimp trawling ban come into effect. I want to know what Mr. Wilson is doing about this? We need to know who’s responsible and what is being done to discipline that employee,” said Paul.

But the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) is a separate state agency, distinct from NCWRC.
“Are you commenting on the nominee or are you pontificating on your stand on a particular issue?” interjected Sen. Bill Rabon.
“I have difficulty hiring blatantly environmentally proponent…people who have no business experience, just somebody who is an environmental advocate who just has no understanding of the business in the state,” Paul responded.
Rabon thanked Paul for his remarks but noted everybody on the Select Committee on Nominations was comfortable moving forward with Wilson.
For his part, Wilson has pledged to help Western North Carolina communities recover and rebuild from Hurricane Helene.
“Whether it is water infrastructure or waste cleanup or dam inspections or debris cleanup, we’re involved in many, many ways and we’re going to be at it until the job is done,” Wilson testified.
Wilson said his second top priority is trying to reduce PFAS pollution, also known as “forever chemicals” in the state’s waterways.
About a third of the people in North Carolina drink water with PFAS levels above what will be the EPA’s health standard, according to Wilson.

Leslie Dismukes told lawmakers it has been an honor to serve the past six months as the interim Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction (DAC).
Previously working as the Criminal Bureau Chief at the North Carolina Department of Justice, Dismukes wore many hats, including supervising the legal work of NCDAC.

During her confirmation hearing in May, Dismukes said that the state was faced with a 40% vacancy rate for correctional officers.
This week, she indicated the department was making some headway.
“We’ve streamlined our HR processes, added additional resources to HR in recruitment, and expanded our basic training offerings to decrease the time from offer to post. This has resulted in 250 people in basic training right now and a 1% decrease in our vacancy rates since January,” said Dismukes.
In addition to recruitment, the DAC Secretary reminded legislators that the fire suppression systems at nearly two dozen prisons remain outdated or completely inoperable.
“I’ve raised the alarm, no pun intended, regarding the 23 prisons we currently have on fire watch and the more than $90 million that it will take to avoid grave disaster,” Dismukes warned.
Dismukes said she’s also empowered a new chief medical officer to move forward with critical process improvements to streamline services that achieve cost savings while maintaining the standard of care.
This fiscal year, the department is projected to spend $425 million on health care.
Dismukes’ reality check comes as the North Carolina House and Senate have been unable to agree to a comprehensive budget plan with the fiscal year that starts July 1.

Also winning Senate confirmation Thursday was Jocelyn Mallette as Secretary of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
Mallette served on active duty for ten years in the United States Air Force, as an admissions advisor at the Academy, an intelligence officer, and finally as a prosecutor in the Judge Advocate General’s (JAG) Corps.

Mallette pledged in her new role to make the transition from military life into the civilian workforce as smoother one.
“DMVA should be leading the way to retain North Carolina’s transitioning service members and families, and also to attract those who get out of the military and other states,” said Mallette. “All of us on the federal, state, and local level need to work together to support them during the year that is referred to as “the deadly gap.”
The period during which a servicemember transitions out of active duty to civilian life can present many major life challenges. It’s also a period in which the veteran suicide rate is 2.5 times higher than the rate for active-duty military.
Mallette said North Carolina DMVA is actively partnering with entities like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Labor, the North Carolina Department of Commerce, and nonprofits like Blue Star Families and Veterans Bridge Home to establish initiatives that more quickly connect transitioning service members to benefits, jobs, and housing upon the end of their service.

(Getty Images)The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reported Thursday two more measles diagnoses in the state, bringing the total case count to five.
One of the cases was detected in Utah County, while the other is from the southwest health district, which serves Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, the department said in a news release. One of the new diagnosed patients is a minor and the other, an adult.
Like the previous three confirmed cases, the patients were unvaccinated. But, these additional patients were linked to previously diagnosed individuals rather than community exposure. Public health officials are conducting investigations to determine whether there are any additional cases in the state as national outbreaks keep on increasing.

Two of the five cases are unvaccinated, pregnant Utahns. According to the department, individuals infected with measles during pregnancy are at high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or giving birth to a child who will experience serious medical problems. Pregnant women are also “much more likely to be hospitalized because of severe measles.”
Utah health officials report two more measles cases

“The department recommends that if you are planning to become pregnant, get vaccinated before you get pregnant to protect yourself and your baby,” DHHS officials wrote in the release. “You can’t get the MMR vaccine while you are pregnant. If you get the MMR vaccine, wait at least 4 weeks after you get your shot before you try to get pregnant.”
As of Thursday morning, two of the Utah patients had been hospitalized due to complications from the virus but have since been released. 
Measles early symptoms show up seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever higher than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough, runny nose or red eyes. A rash could appear four days after the fever starts. Health officials recommend that people experiencing these symptoms stay away from others and call health care providers before making a visit to avoid spreading the virus. 
“The most effective prevention against the measles is vaccination. Public health officials in Utah want to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation,” according to the release. ” The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective against measles when the person gets 2 doses.”

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025NASHVILLE — A Maryland man facing criminal charges in Tennessee, after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, will remain in jail until at least Friday as a federal judge weighs whether prosecutors have the power to keep him from being “precipitously deported.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, appeared Wednesday in a downtown Nashville courtroom for a hearing to set the conditions of his release while a criminal case against him moves forward.
Abrego was indicted by a Tennessee grand jury June 6 on two criminal human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment occurred while Abrego was housed in a Salvadoran prison, where U.S. immigration officials dispatched him after a routine traffic stop.
A Department of Justice attorney later conceded Abrego’s deportation had been a mistake. His case has come to symbolize the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
Wearing an orange jumpsuit and seated next to his attorneys, Abrego occasionally glanced in the direction of the gallery where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, sat in the first row. It was the couple’s wedding anniversary, she told reporters earlier in the day.

But as Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes went over the terms of Abregos’s pretrial release, defense attorneys raised the specter that he could instead face deportation.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are expected to take Abrego into custody immediately once he is released by the federal court.
Sean Hecker, an attorney for Abrego, sought a decision by the judge that Abrego’s release would be conditional on prosecutors working to ensure that he would not be deported while the case remains ongoing.
Hecker also sought assurances that Abrego would not be housed in Texas, Louisiana or other parts of the country that could impede access to his attorneys.
In support of his request, Hecker noted prosecutors and the Department of Homeland Security had a history of coordination and cooperation in Abrego’s case.
DHS and federal prosecutors coordinated to bring charges against Abrego, including facilitating his return from El Salvador to face an indictment in Tennessee; they also established agreements with potential witnesses against Abrego to halt their own deportation cases, Hecker said.
But acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire indicated he could make no promises about either Abrego’s placement in an ICE facility accessible to his attorneys or to prevent his deportation. He told the court that he would “do his best.”
“I will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, but obviously I can’t tell them what to do,” he said. McGuire noted that ICE — a department within the federal homeland security agency — is not a party to the case.
McGuire had unsuccessfully sought to keep Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who typically oversee detainees awaiting trial on federal crimes.
In an order issued over the weekend, Holmes denied the prosecutors’ petition, ruling that Abrego had a right to release while awaiting trial.
“These are the sort of practical implications of that (the judge’s decision),” McGuire said Wednesday.
Holmes has given attorneys until noon Friday to submit legal arguments that address the question of “what can the government do to ensure Mr. Abrego will not be precipitously deported.”
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing an appeal of Holmes’ weekend decision to release Abrego.
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., separately on Wednesday, set a July 16 hearing day to review prosecutors’ request to revoke Abrego’s release from the custody of U.S. Marshals.
The criminal charges Abrego faces stem from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop alleged the trip was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme in which Abrego was a paid driver who transported migrants who illegally crossed the southern border to destinations across the country.

(Photo by Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will reexamine current recommendations around childhood vaccination schedules and Hepatitis B immunizations, members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices announced during a meeting in Atlanta Wednesday.
The committee, which meets three times a year, does not typically garner much public interest. However, this meeting is the first since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics, launching the little-known committee into the national spotlight.
Medical experts, including the American Medical Association, expressed dismay at Kennedy’s appointment of the new committee members, which the organization said occurred “without transparency and proper vetting to ensure they have the expertise necessary to make vaccine recommendations to protect the health of Americans.”
“We urge the administration to reconsider the removal of the 17 ACIP members who have deep expertise in vaccines so physicians can continue to have confidence in ACIP’s recommendations,” AMA President Bobby M. Mukkamala said in a statement.
Six former ACIP leaders also authored an op-ed after the former committee members’ dismissal, warning that “if relevant scientific expertise on vaccines is not maintained, access to vaccines may fundamentally change.”
The move was also made in direct contradiction with a promise from Kennedy to Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy ahead of the secretary’s confirmation in February. Cassidy says Kennedy pledged to “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.”
Cassidy, a doctor who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary, called for the meeting to be delayed until members with more expertise in vaccines could be appointed to the panel, but was unsuccessful. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski also expressed concern about the backgrounds of the new panelists.
The committee is now led by Martin Kulldorff, a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who was fired in 2024 after declining the COVID-19 vaccine, and has spoken out against blanket vaccine mandates during the pandemic.
“Secretary Kennedy has given this committee a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine when making vaccine recommendations, and that is what we will do,” Kulldorff said in his opening remarks. He also disputed characterizations of his skepticism of vaccine mandates as “anti-vax.”
“Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee, issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro- or anti-vaccine box,” he said. “Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry, and it further feeds the flame of vaccine hesitancy. To thoroughly scrutinize and assure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.”
Other appointees to the committee include Robert Malone, a doctor and biochemist who said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise” and Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses who also serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization that advocates for vaccine exemptions.
One member of the committee, Michael Ross, had already withdrawn from the committee by the time the body convened for the two-day summit in Atlanta. Kennedy, who was attending a “Make America Healthy Again” event in Oklahoma, was not present at the meeting.
  ‘Completely unprecedented’ 

As the committee met inside, dozens of people braved the sweltering heat to hold what they called a “parade of preventable diseases” to highlight the dangers of limiting the public’s access to vaccines. They also called for the committee to be restored to its previous makeup.
A whole colorful cast of pathogens were represented just outside the center’s entrance, from influenza to HPV to meningococcus. Dr. Deblina Datta carried a leg brace to represent polio.
“This is what we don’t want to see again. When we introduce vaccine skepticism, we are going to see people wearing this,” Datta said holding up the brace.
Datta spent more than two decades at CDC working on immunizations, with six years with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. She called the abrupt overhaul of the committee alarming.
“While a healthy skepticism of vaccine policy is good, this level of skepticism and the sources of the skeptics being put onto ACIP is calamitous,” Datta said. “And it’s absolutely eroding the public’s faith in the ACIP to dictate policy.”
Katrina Kretsinger, who retired from the CDC two years ago after working mostly on vaccine-preventable diseases, said she has major concerns about the changes made to the committee.
“This is completely unprecedented,” she said. “And I really don’t think it’s going to have any credibility.”
But she said she is also trying to have “a little bit of wait and see” attitude about the new members.
“I would say that there’s a number of them who seem like they are reasonably well qualified, and then there are others of the seven who come with a very clear anti-vaccine agenda and are well known for viewpoints that are really hard to defend based on the scientific merits,” Kretsinger said. “It’s very disappointing.”
  ACIP’s new agenda 

The new ACIP appointees are scheduled to spend two days reviewing safety and efficacy data on COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella (MMRV), Influenza, Anthrax and Chikungunya vaccines before voting on new immunization recommendations.
However, Kulldorff said the committee also plans to commission new working groups dedicated to evaluating the impact of childhood vaccines and investigating the timeline for the recommended administration of Hepatitis B vaccines in newborns. The committee will also be reexamining vaccines that have not been reviewed within the last seven years.
“In addition to studying and evaluating individual vaccines, it’s important to evaluate the cumulative effect of the recommended vaccine schedule,” Kulldorff said.
Thursday’s agenda also includes a presentation from Lyn Redwood, the former head of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy.
Redwood, who is not a CDC employee, is expected to argue that a preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, known as thimerosal, causes autism. According to the CDC, research has shown no connection between thimerosal and autism or any other source of harm, and the chemical was taken out of childhood vaccines in the U.S. in 2001.

Medicaid patients do not have the right to sue to visit the doctor of their choice, allowing states like South Carolina to remove clinics that also provide abortions from their lists of providers, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to Thursday’s opinion began with a 2018 executive order, in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of medical providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.
Six justices agreed with the decision. One wrote a separate concurring opinion. Three dissented.

Planned Parenthood, which operates two clinics in the state, sued, claiming a patient has the right to visit the clinics for other services, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Medicaid already excludes most abortions, covering them only in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life under a federal provision South Carolina follows.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
A federal appeals court ruled against McMaster’s order three times, deciding the state can’t deny Medicaid patients from going to the provider of their choice because the provider also offers abortions.
Each time, the state’s attorneys appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the issue until December.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)In the shadow of Three Mile Island’s iconic cooling towers, state Rep. Tom Mehaffie recalled Wednesday how his father, 50 years earlier, built a career and a life around the nuclear power plant.
“When Constellation left and this plant shut down, a lot was missed,” Mehaffie said, noting the fortunes of businesses and the community followed that of the plant in Dauphin County.
Now, state government and energy and tech industry leaders are betting on its rebirth as an example of Pennsylvania’s readiness to power future industries, including electricity-intensive artificial intelligence data centers.
In a $16 billion deal between owner Constellation Energy and Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers, Three Mile Island is set to return to service as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Let’s not just open this plant, let’s open business,” Mehaffie told a tent full of Constellation Energy workers gathered to celebrate progress in the plant’s restoration, including an expedited review that cuts about a year off the project’s timeline.

About 10 miles south of Harrisburg near Middletown, Three Mile Island was the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that transfixed the world. But after that partial meltdown in one of the plant’s two reactors, the remaining Unit 1 continued safely producing electricity for another 40 years.

In 2019, Constellation determined the facility was no longer economically viable and put plans in motion to permanently decommission the reactor. With peak energy demand, driven largely by data centers, predicted to grow up to 17% by 2035, the plant’s capacity is now in high demand.
“We made a mistake in shutting down this plant, but we’re not here to dwell on that mistake,” Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said, noting that hiring staff for the recommissioning process is ahead of schedule because many former workers returned.
The plant’s reopening will support at least 650 permanent jobs and hundreds more for building-trade workers during the recommissioning process.
Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomed the returning workers Wednesday, as he highlighted the role of nuclear power in his energy plan.
“We’re going to make sure you never have to leave again,” Shapiro said. “This is going to be one of those places where the jobs get passed down from generation to generation, where fathers talk to their daughters about the work that they did, and their daughters pick up that mantle of energy leadership right here at Crane.”
Shapiro has outlined a plan over the last two years to ensure the commonwealth remains a leader in the competitive energy market, by leveraging the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Shapiro noted his administration intervened to ensure the Crane center would be able to quickly reconnect to the regional power grid that serves Pennsylvania and all or parts of 12 other states.
PJM Interconnect, which operates the grid and ensures adequate energy supplies, has a backlog of projects waiting to be approved for connection. The company created its Reliable Resource Initiative last year to expedite the interconnection of 51 shovel-ready generating resources that include battery storage, nuclear and natural gas facilities, a PJM spokesperson said.
Shapiro, who describes himself as an “all of the above energy governor,” noted the state has four operating nuclear power plants that provide nearly one-third of its energy.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Shapiro said. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said the Crane center is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring nuclear energy online with the speed needed to match the growth of artificial intelligence.
“It’s a unique opportunity where we can bring together a supportive community, state and a skilled workforce that is absolutely the best kept secret ingredient,” Hollis said.
Microsoft’s agreement to purchase all of the Crane center’s 835-megawatt output demonstrates the importance of abundant energy for tech industry growth, Shapiro said.
“That is a heck of a signal of the optimism people feel about Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting that Amazon also recently announced a $20 billion investment in a data complex near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County.
PJM interconnection president and CEO Manu Asthana said as the state swelters through its first heatwave of the summer, the growth in demand for energy is apparent. PJM this week recorded an all-time peak in electricity production, nine gigawatts larger than last summer’s peak. Asthana said the difference is equal to 11 times the Crane center’s planned output.
“What we’re talking about here is not hypothetical. Our country needs this power. All of our citizens need this power just to keep their lights on, to stay warm, to stay cool,” he said, adding that ensuring power for all that plus AI is a matter of national security.
“I can’t imagine by 2030 what artificial intelligence will enable us to do and strategically, for our country, for our state, for our region, it is critical that we win that race, and the power that you produce here is critical to winning that race.”

When I came to college, I never expected that my roommate would believe that I infected her with Covid-19, simply because I was Chinese. My negative test didn’t matter. My ethnicity was all she needed to hurl an accusation my way.
When I sought comfort from a Dean, an administrator who claimed to support her students, I never expected that my hurt would be brushed aside. “You could be just as miserable anywhere,” she said. Her final piece of advice? Focus on how to cope.


But, when I joined Asian Students in Action, I found something different: unyielding comfort and validation. My Asian friends didn’t dismiss my pain or tell me to cope. They named the harm. They understood the pain. They knew that the accusation was rooted in the harmful, misguided belief that Asians were carriers of Covid-19—a narrative that surged during the pandemic.
Asian Students in Action provided what the broader institution failed to: community, safety, and the affirmation that what happened to me was not okay. Without that affinity club, I would have felt unseen and unheard. I would have thought that the racism I faced was both unimportant and invisible to the predominantly white college I attended. Without an Asian club, I would have left college after my first year.
Today, critics of DEI initiatives often lump Asian and white Americans together. They do so for three reasons: to dismiss the structural inequities we face, to undermine our solidarity with Black, Latino, and indigenous communities, and to strengthen the very inequalities DEI efforts aim to solve.
On February 14, the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, issued a “Dear Colleague” letter. While this letter claimed to protect students from alleged racial discrimination by educational institutions, its true intent was clear: to dismantle race-based programs altogether.
But, what caught my attention most was this line: “American educational institutions have discriminated against students on the basis of race, including white and Asian students.”
This phrase is troubling. It collapses white and Asian students into one, unified demographic, while Black, Latino, and indigenous students are conspicuously left out. It suggests that white and Asian students endure comparable racial discrimination.
Here’s what I know for certain: my white peers have never been blamed for spreading Covid-19 simply because a president chose to scapegoat their entire ethnicity for the pandemic. I was. Asians were.
When DEI despisers conflate my racial experiences with those of white students, they weaponize the Model Minority Myth to promote a false sense of Asian-White solidarity. The Model Minority Myth frames Asian Americans as the ideal minority—quiet, polite, and compliant—suggesting that if we conform to this stereotype, we’ll be rewarded with proximity to whiteness. A proximity that promises an illusion of immunity from the racial discrimination and systemic inequalities other communities of color face.
Opponents of DEI hope that Asian Americans will endorse their opinion, simply to attain acceptance into the system of white supremacy that dominates the U.S. But, it is naive to think that we would seek acceptance from a system that has long excluded us and fueled an influx of Anti-Asian hate.
As an Asian American, I know what it feels like to be excluded, stereotyped, and overlooked. But I also know the transformative power of belonging, because I’ve experienced it through the community of care that DEI programs make possible. Without DEI, and without the affinity groups it sustains, we will lose some of the only places on campus where students of color feel seen, heard, and safe.
So, when people assume I despise DEI, my answer is clear.
Absolutely not. I am here because of it.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/asian-hate-protest.jpg,,,2025-06-26 12:23:34.281028

June 26, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceFor state Rep. Jason Morgan, an openly gay Democrat from Ann Arbor, the vibrant celebration of love and inclusion that defines Pride Month felt duller this year in the Michigan House of Representatives.
The House has yet to take a vote on or pass a resolution acknowledging Pride Month in June, as it has in the past two years when Democrats controlled all levers of state government. There are no Pride flags flying from the flagpoles on Capitol grounds, nor are any flying from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office in the Romney Building that sits across the street.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Morgan said that the month felt muted in some regard – both at the national scale but also here at home, and in the halls of power where he works each day.
“Now that Republicans are in charge at the federal level and here in the Michigan House, it really feels like there’s a concerted effort to roll back LGBTQ+ rights and protections,” Morgan said. “It feels like there is pressure being applied to businesses and organizations and universities to roll back commonsense efforts to support diversity and LGBTQ+ people.”
Adding to that sense of retrenchment is the fact that the House hasn’t acknowledged Pride Month yet, even as Morgan tried mightily over the last few months to make it happen and in a timely fashion.
Morgan told the Advance that a Pride Month resolution with exclusively Democratic co-sponsors was submitted on Wednesday. The last day of session before Pride Month ends is Thursday, and Morgan hoped that it would come up for a vote then.
A vote on Thursday would also be symbolic, as it marks the 10th anniversary of Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark case that allowed same-sex marriage nationwide.
But House leadership on Thursday said it would not come up for a vote, moving House Democrats to gather on the Capitol steps to read the resolution aloud. Morgan said there that the Supreme Court’s ruling on same-sex marriage was the culmination of decades’ worth of work from community members and allies, resulting in a civil rights victory.
“And yet, 10 years later to the day, Republicans are trying to strip away this progress that so many of us have fought for,” Morgan said. “History teaches us that rights can be won, but they can be taken away just as easily. With constant threats like these against the LGBTQ+ community, Pride is more necessary than ever.”
The process to get a Pride resolution to the floor, however, started in March, with Morgan’s office sending the same resolution that was passed last year to the office of state Rep. John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming), the House’s minority floor leader, which then sent the resolution for edits and approval to the office of House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) in late May.
Morgan said despite some back and forth from the two offices, he and his colleagues – who were pushing to have Pride Month acknowledged by the House earlier in the month than later – never got a clear answer on whether the resolution language was approved, if edits were needed or if it would ever reach the floor.
Morgan on Wednesday said that he at least hoped to get it up on the board for a vote Thursday before the clock winds down.
“All we are asking from the Speaker’s office is to pass the same resolution that passed under Republican and Democratic legislatures before to let our LGBTQ+ Michiganders know that we acknowledge them, welcome them and continue to celebrate living as who they are in our state,” Morgan said.
During a regularly scheduled news briefing on Wednesday with Capitol news reporters, the Advance asked Hall if the House was going to allow a vote on a Pride Month recognition resolution before the month ends.
Hall emphatically said no. When asked if there was a reason, Hall started to move on from the question, but kept coming back to it, adding that he didn’t believe a resolution had actually been introduced.
When he was told by an Advance reporter that Morgan’s office had been working with his office to get it finalized, Hall returned to his initial answer: no, even if it was introduced, it would not be taken up for a vote.
Morgan, following Hall’s news conference, said that at least now he had an answer from the speaker’s office.
Additional issues muting the colors of Pride
State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia), who is openly bisexual, said in an interview that she was not surprised House Republicans stalled the resolution, and that it was to be expected.
“Rep. Morgan has been trying to work in good faith with them, and it’s not really been reciprocated,” she said. “What I can say is that, very clearly, folks who were loud and proud [as allies] back in 2019 don’t seem to have that same level of enthusiasm and support, and that’s disappointing.”
She agreed with Morgan’s assessment that this year in particular feels like the step forward gains of the last six years have taken two steps back.
The House under GOP control this year has passed anti-transgender legislation, including House Bill 4066 and House Bill 4469, aimed at prohibiting transgender girls from joining girls’ interscholastic sports.

While the bills have zero chance of making it past the Democratic-controlled Michigan Senate or being signed by Whitmer, Morgan said Democrats would have never put that legislation forward, or even come up for a vote, if they still had control of the House.
There was also House Resolution 28, sponsored in February by arch-conservative state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford), condemning the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to allow same-sex marriage. That remains in the House Government Operations Committee, which is typically where bills and resolutions go to die.
Coupled with Republicans controlling each lever of the federal government, and many of them openly anti-LGBTQ+, the high tide of progress feels a bit like it’s beginning to roll back.
Some members of the community have also noticed that no Pride flags are hanging from state buildings this year. Whitmer hung a Pride flag from her office in the Romney Building in 2019 the year after she was elected to the high office, but has not done so since.

A Whitmer spokesperson said that she has flown the flag outside the governor’s residence in Lansing since 2020, and that it was flying outside her home this week when the Advance inquired about the Romney Building.
The Capitol grounds and what flags fly inside or outside the building is in the purview of the Michigan Capitol Commission and not the governor or legislative leadership.
Messages sent by the Advance requesting an interview with the Capitol Commission or its staff about whether it planned to honor Pride by flying the LGBTQ+ flag were not returned.
The House has a flagpole on the roof of its wing of the chamber, but a Pride flag is unlikely to fly from that pole this week before Pride Month ends.
State Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), an LGBTQ+ ally, said in an interview that “Rainbow Capitalism” was a driving force of why so many corporations and businesses appeared as allies in recent years, with products adorned in Pride colors, but dialed back once the political climate changed.
“Because we have a fascist in the White House and Republicans that are pushing culture wars and not equal rights, corporations have found it easier to back away from their LGBTQ+ stances,” Wegela said. “I think we can’t speak for the community, but as an ally, I think it’s important that corporations adopt standards of human rights at all times, not just when it’s convenient for the profit margins.”
State Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), the first openly gay member of the state Senate, said the fight to have Pride recognized this year in the House harkened back to his fight with former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) over the Senate’s recognition.

Moss told the Advance that Shirkey allowed it to go up for a vote and it passed one year, but then the next year, leadership said they wouldn’t be doing that again.
If House Republicans go the same route, Moss said it would be a sad state of affairs.
“Really, it takes me back to serving in a pre-marriage equality era, and I’m just dismayed about it,” Moss said. “I think we are all fortunate that we still have a very strong, pro-equality majority in the Senate, so any [anti-LGBTQ+ action] they put up in the House is a non-starter in the state Senate. Which is great, but not for the seven of us in our caucus.”
He warned that could be part of the difference for Democrats fighting to take back the House and retain the Senate come election time, as Moss believed that the Shirkey Senate’s anti-LGBTQ+ stance was one factor that helped propel Democrats to the current Senate majority.
As to the change in the atmosphere this June, Moss said the feeling was palpable for LGBTQ+ Michiganders.
“I think the community really gets it, and I think we are prepared to fight like our lives depend on it,” Moss said. “In many cases, they do, as we’ve seen with the recent anti-transgender ruling from the Supreme Court. It’s a new era. It’s a very big reminder that the progress that was made is very fragile.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Four Republican lawmakers want oversight of a Kansas Native American university to shift from the federal government to a board of regents under proposed legislation.
It’s a move that follows cuts to the Haskell Indian Nations University’s programming from Trump administration policies, years of congressional inquiries into staff misconduct and months of weighing input from tribes and the university, lawmakers said.
The university, located in Lawrence, is under the purview of the Bureau of Indian Education within the U.S. Department of the Interior. U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas, along with Kansas U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann and Derek Schmidt and Oklahoma U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, say a change is needed. Some tribal and Indian education leaders agree, arguing a shift to a board of regents would empower tribal communities.
“The bureau has failed to protect students, respond to my congressional inquiries or meet the basic infrastructure needs of the university,” Moran said in a news release. “It is clear that the best path forward is for the university to be led by an independent Board of Regents nominated by the Tribal community and no longer obstructed by the BIE.”
Moran and Mann introduced companion bills Monday in the House and Senate. The Senate bill was referred to a finance committee, and the House resolution was sent to three separate committees for review. However, the process began six months ago, when Moran and Mann announced their intentions to draft legislation to charter the university and transfer governance to the Haskell Board of Regents, while maintaining federal funding for the school.
The board currently has 15 members. Thirteen are appointed through tribal or intertribal resolutions, making certain to represent the broader Alaska Native and American Indian communities. The remaining two members are designated by the university’s student body government and alumni association.
Dalton Henry, president of the board of regents, said the university has succeeded in advancing Native students and strengthening tribal nations for decades.
“Yet, persistent challenges under federal oversight have limited its potential,” Henry said.
Shifting oversight to a Native-led board of trustees cements the notion that tribal nations are the most qualified candidates to shape the university’s future, he said.
“This is how we secure Haskell’s legacy,” Henry said, “not just for today’s students, but for the next seven generations.”
The four-year university enrolled about 900 students from nearly 150 federally recognized tribes in 2024. In 2023, a federal report that wasn’t made public until more than a year later revealed the university failed to implement adequate sexual assault policies, that it wrongfully terminated some staff and employees, and that university leadership intimidated students.
Under the proposed legislation, the university’s headquarters will remain in Lawrence with the option to establish branches elsewhere. The president of the university would serve as CEO of the university and would be appointed by the board of regents. If passed, the legislation would establish a trust fund for the university and require stringent, annual reporting to Congress.
Moriah O’Brien, vice president of the Congressional and Federal Relations of American Indian Higher Education Consortium, said the legislation reaffirms the federal government’s treaty responsibility for higher education and the importance of culturally relevant education to the survival of tribal nations. O’Brien said the legislation also “rightfully empowers” the board of regents with decision-making authority while it currently serves on an advisory basis.
The bill, called the Haskell Indian Nations University Improvement Act, also earned the support of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians tribal chief, the National Congress of American Indians, the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Education Association and the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Chief Cyrus Ben said the change will offer the university “the stability, autonomy and leadership it needs to thrive.”
“Haskell holds a special place in the hearts of many of our Tribal students — past, present, and future — who attend with deep pride and commitment,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Bureau of Indian Education said in an emailed statement that the bureau does not comment on proposed legislation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Hiawathahall-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 12:23:34.281028

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court issued two orders Wednesday, declining to hear cases challenging the constitutionality of the state’s congressional maps. 
Democrats had hoped that the liberal wing of the court retaining majority control of the body in this spring’s election would give them an opportunity to change the congressional lines. Republicans currently hold six of the state’s eight congressional seats, and Democrats hoped they could flip the 1st and 3rd CDs under friendlier maps. 
Before Republicans drew new congressional lines in 2010, Democrats controlled five of the state’s seats. The current maps were drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and approved by the state Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservatives. That Court had required that any proposed maps adhere to a “least change” standard that changed as little as possible from the 2010 maps. 
While Evers’ maps made the two competitive districts slightly closer contests, they’re still controlled by Republican U.S. Reps. Bryan Steil and Derrick Van Orden. 
The two lawsuits were brought by the Elias Law Group representing Democratic candidates and voters and the Campaign Legal Center on behalf of a group of voters. The cases argued the maps violated the state’s constitutional requirement that all voters be treated equally. 
The challenges against the maps drew national attention as Democrats hope to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections. 
This is the second time in as many years that the Supreme Court, under a liberal majority, has declined to hear challenges to the congressional maps. 
In both cases, the Court issued unanimous decisions without any explanation as to why they weren’t accepting the cases. 
Aside from declining to hear the cases, Justice Janet Protasiewicz issued an order denying requests that she recuse herself from the case. Republicans have called for her recusal from redistricting cases because of comments she made during her 2023 campaign about Wisconsin’s need for fairer maps. Previously, after Protasiewicz joined the Court, as part of a new liberal majority, it declared the state’s legislative maps, which locked in disproportionate Republican majorities in the Legislature, unconstitutional. 
“I am confident that I can, in fact and appearance, act in an impartial manner in this case,” she wrote. “And the Due Process Clause does not require my recusal because neither my campaign statements nor contributions to my campaign create a ‘serious risk of actual bias.’”

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 15:31:24+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven to build $316M transit-oriented development project at Union Station,Mona Mahadevan | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/new-haven-union-station-development/,"Two towers containing 470 apartments and 28,000 square feet of retail and commercial space are now slated to be built next to Union Station.","Two 16-story towers containing 470 apartments and 28,000 square feet of retail and commercial space are now slated to be built next to New Haven’s Union Station, per the governor’s announcement Wednesday of a major new transit-oriented development.
Gov. Ned Lamont and state Department of Transportation Deputy Commissioner Laoise King broke that news in an email press release. 
The governor, Mayor Justin Elicker, and top city and state officials gathered at that same time in the parking lot just north of Union Station to hold a press conference about the project. 
According to the governor’s press release, the $316.1 million project will be led by Gilbane Development Company and MURAL Real Estate Partners. 
The press release states that, of the 470 new apartments, 118 will be ​“affordable units.” 
At Wednesday’s presser, Elicker said that 20 percent of the new apartments will be reserved for households making no more than 50 percent of the area median income (AMI), which currently is around $45,500 for a two-person household. Elicker said an additional 5 percent of the new apartments will be reserved for those earning up to 80 percent AMI, which currently translates to $72,800 for a family of two.
In addition to the 28,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, there will also be 26,000 square feet of residential amenities and 294 parking spaces to serve tenants and transit customers.
Construction will unfold in two phases. The first, scheduled to begin in late 2026 and finish in early 2028, will include 280 units and 393,000 square feet of development. The second phase is slated to begin in August 2029 and wrap up by November 2031, delivering the remaining 190 units and 286,000 square feet.
Opening Wednesday’s press conference, Elicker described Union Station as ​“the welcoming mat to the city” and framed the project as part of a broader initiative to increase the city’s housing supply. This will help ​“make sure we build, build, build,” he said, noting that 7,000 apartments are currently in the pipeline citywide.
King viewed the idea of building more as ​“really exciting,” though emphasized that what constitutes appropriate housing depends on a community’s size and character. Nonetheless, she said, ​“There is so much land that can be put to higher and better uses.”
Gilbane CEO Edward Broderick highlighted the development’s mixed-use, mixed-income vision. His company is committed to providing ​“quality housing that serves a wide range of incomes,” he said. ​“One day, the short walk from here and the Green will be filled with spaces where families are happy to go; where they can get a cup of coffee or lunch.”
MURAL CEO Robin Ziegler echoed that vision for a vibrant neighborhood, saying the development aims to attract ​“young professionals, families, singles, and empty nesters” alike. She said the commercial portion would likely include both food and retail, selected in coordination with the city using ​“a community-driven and community-centered approach” to ensure they ​“provide something for everyone.”
New Haven-based firms Pickard Chilton and Newman Architects are among the architects chosen for the project.
For Pickard Chilton Principal Adrienne Nelson, one of the more exciting parts of the project is ​“the opportunity for creating an amazing destination along that walk downtown.” In addition to addressing the housing crisis, she said, ​“it adds to the community in terms of creating a sense of place and arrival.”
On the question of parking — where 294 spaces will be available at the end of construction — King said she ​“think[s] it’s going to be sufficient” for residential and commercial uses. Commuters, she added, will be encouraged to use a multi-modal transit center planned for the station’s West Lot, which is currently in the design phase.
Newman Architects Principal Melinda Agron agreed. Based on data collected by her firm, many parking garages in New Haven are underutilized, demonstrating the city’s reduced demand for parking, as well as providing another parking option for the building’s future residents. ​“It takes a cultural shift to get used to the idea that we don’t need as much parking,” she said.
City spokesperson Lenny Speiller told the Independent that this newly announced development project will not impact the existing Union Station Parking Garage, which has 876 parking spaces. He also noted that the state Department of Transportation is planning to build an additional parking garage on the West Lot. That new garage will have 400 to 600 new parking spaces.
Wednesday’s announcement comes nearly four years after the city, state, and parking authority struck an agreement in 2021 to build up the lot just north of Union Station into a new mixed-use development. By late 2024, four developers had responded to a request for qualification for the project: Gilbane, Spinnaker, Richman Group, and Twining Properties.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/slack-imgs-1024x538.jpg,,,2025-06-26 12:23:34.281028

The South Carolina case that led to Thursday’s opinion began with a 2018 executive order, in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of medical providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.
Six justices agreed with the decision. One wrote a separate concurring opinion. Three dissented.
Planned Parenthood, which operates two clinics in the state, sued, claiming a patient has the right to visit the clinics for other services, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Medicaid already excludes most abortions, covering them only in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life under a federal provision South Carolina follows.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
A federal appeals court ruled against McMaster’s order three times, deciding the state can’t deny Medicaid patients from going to the provider of their choice because the provider also offers abortions.
Each time, the state’s attorneys appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the issue until December.

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A Maryland man facing criminal charges in Tennessee, after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, will remain in jail until at least Friday as a federal judge weighs whether prosecutors have the power to keep him from being “precipitously deported.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, appeared Wednesday in a downtown Nashville courtroom for a hearing to set the conditions of his release while a criminal case against him moves forward.
Abrego Garcia was indicted by a Tennessee grand jury June 6 on two criminal human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment occurred while Abrego Garcia was housed in a Salvadoran prison, where U.S. immigration officials dispatched him after a routine traffic stop.
A Department of Justice attorney later conceded Abrego Garcia’s deportation had been a mistake. His case has come to symbolize the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
Wearing an orange jumpsuit and seated next to his attorneys, Abrego Garcia occasionally glanced in the direction of the gallery where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, sat in the first row. It was the couple’s wedding anniversary, she told reporters earlier in the day.
But as Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes went over the terms of Abrego Garcia’s pretrial release, defense attorneys raised the specter that he could instead face deportation.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are expected to take Abrego Garcia into custody immediately once he is released by the federal court.
Sean Hecker, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, sought a decision by the judge that Abrego Garcia’s release would be conditional on prosecutors working to ensure that he would not be deported while the case remains ongoing.
Hecker also sought assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be housed in Texas, Louisiana or other parts of the country that could impede access to his attorneys.
In support of his request, Hecker noted prosecutors and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had a history of coordination and cooperation in Abrego Garcia’s case.
DHS and federal prosecutors coordinated to bring charges against Abrego Garcia, including facilitating his return from El Salvador to face an indictment in Tennessee; they also established agreements with potential witnesses against Abrego Garcia to halt their own deportation cases, Hecker said.
But acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire indicated he could make no promises about either Abrego Garcia’s placement in an ICE facility accessible to his attorneys or to prevent his deportation. He told the court that he would “do his best.”

“I will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, but obviously I can’t tell them what to do,” he said. McGuire noted that ICE — a department within the federal homeland security agency — is not a party to the case.
McGuire had unsuccessfully sought to keep Abrego Garcia in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who typically oversee detainees awaiting trial on federal crimes.
In an order issued over the weekend, Holmes denied the prosecutors’ petition, ruling that Abrego Garcia had a right to release while awaiting trial.
“These are the sort of practical implications of that (the judge’s decision),” McGuire said Wednesday.
Holmes has given attorneys until noon Friday to submit legal arguments that address the question of “what can the government do to ensure Mr. Abrego will not be precipitously deported.”
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing an appeal of Holmes’ weekend decision to release Abrego Garcia.
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., separately on Wednesday, set a July 16 hearing day to review prosecutors’ request to revoke Abrego Garcia’s release from the custody of U.S. Marshals.
The criminal charges Abrego Garcia faces stem from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop alleged the trip was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme in which Abrego Garcia was a paid driver who transported migrants who illegally crossed the southern border to destinations across the country.

Generally, new mayors and governing boards possess the power to void and renegotiate contractual decisions made by their predecessors. But this rule does not apply to contracts that are time-specified by statute, such as the six-year solid waste collection contract penned by the city last year.
Since the Jackson city council agreed to a $64-million contract with the New Orleans-based, minority-owned Richard’s Disposal in 2024, the city’s garbage contract likely won’t be reopened until at least 2030, after Horhn’s first term ends. 
But the new mayor is expected to take a host of other contracts under review when he takes office on July 1. 
Robert Gibbs, the chair of Horhn’s transition team, said they have obtained lists of hundreds of city contracts and grants to review with an eye toward efficiency and effectiveness but that it’s too early to say which ones could be renegotiated. 
“For instance, when there has been a man shortage problem, (the city of Jackson has) been able to enter into contracts with companies that brought the man power and the know-how,” Gibbs said this week on Mississippi Today’s political podcast The Other Side. “As we’ve looked at those, some of those are working very well, and we may very well continue those. But in other instances, there’s been a loss of employees for whatever reasons, and those departments have to be built back up.” 
Gibbs added the transition team has heard complaints from local contractors who feel the city has been unreceptive to doing business with them. 
An attorney, developer and local contractor himself, Gibbs was involved in the yearslong dispute between outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the city council over selecting a new garbage vendor, which spanned from 2021 to 2024. Gibbs’ company served as the minority subcontractor for Waste Management, the company that formerly held the contract and was vying for a renewal. 
“You always hear about the dollar circulating in the community seven, eight times, and that’s important for your community to be profitable. But if those dollars go and leave your community, then you lose that seven or eight times effect,” Gibbs said. “And that’s what I’m afraid we’ve done with a couple of contracts in the city of Jackson.”
The pledge to review contracts has been welcomed by some city council members, including Ashby Foote, a representative for Ward 1 who has vocally opposed numerous city agreements in recent years, including the garbage contract. 
“So much of this stuff has been outsourced because we haven’t had the personnel to do stuff that should’ve been done internally,” Foote said. 
In particular, Foote noted that last year he voted with a majority of the city council to pay $700,000 to a local engineering firm for what he described as a one-year “contract to review contracts” in the public works department.
While Horhn will likely have the opportunity to renegotiate that contract early in his first term, he won’t be able to touch the garbage collection agreement without some effort. 
In general, new mayors and governing boards in Mississippi have the power to rescind or modify city agreements, because that is what they’ve been elected to do, said Pieter Teeuwissen, a Hinds County Court Judge. 
But that rule does not apply to certain time-limited obligations that governments can enter, such as the issuing of municipal bonds, the leasing of sixteenth section lands or the collection of solid waste. 
“The general rule is you want to give each successor governing authority as much opportunity as possible to have a say in the business of the city or county,” Teeuwissen said. “But the legislature in its infinite wisdom has decided that certain types of contracts ought to carry a specific time. Someone who is buying $40 or $50 million in government debt doesn’t want to have to worry every four years that they’re gonna get canceled.” 
The rules around time-limited contracts were the subject of a lawsuit that Teeuwissen brought against Hinds County for terminating his contract as board attorney before its one-year period expired. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with him.
In the case of solid waste collection, state statute permits municipalities to sign six-year contracts, with options to extend the contract through four additional one-year periods. 
This could be because garbage collection is considered an essential city service, Teeuwissen theorized, but he noted that almost any contract can be renegotiated if one party is intent on it, even as these laws are poorly understood by many attorneys in Mississippi.
“A good lawyer and a good set of facts can get you out of almost anything,” he said. 
Marcus Wallace, a well-known city subcontractor, ran for mayor in the Democratic primary in part because he was unhappy with Lumumba’s approach to contracting. He said he’s hopeful the incoming administration will prioritize local contractors who can keep the city’s money in Jackson.  
“Let the big companies pave your State Streets and your Northside Drives and Woodrow Wilsons, but when you go into these neighborhoods and these smaller streets – like a Valley Street – allow the smaller companies to do those jobs,” he said.

She outlined her accomplishments and goals in an interview.,"Indiana Comptroller Elise Nieshalla, a Republican, poses after an interview in downtown Indianapolis on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After serving out the rest of another’s term in office, Indiana Comptroller Elise Nieshalla is seeking her own.
“I knew from the beginning that that would be what I would do: fulfill the term and then be ready to run,” she told the Capital Chronicle on Wednesday.
Nieshalla, a Republican, has served as the state’s 58th chief financial officer since late 2023. Former Gov. Eric Holcomb appointed her after predecessor Tera Klutz resigned.
“It is an absolute privilege to serve as state comptroller in a great state like Indiana, that has its fiscal house in order,” Nieshalla said. “And it would be a privilege to continue serving, to do our part in our office: to provide the accounting and the reporting, the distribution of the tax revenues to the local units, the payroll, the payment of the state’s bills.”
Achievements made — and envisioned
Nieshalla said she’s proudest of her efforts to divest from China and entities that follow environmental, social and governance investment principles.
State officials celebrate as public pension system completes Chinese divestment 

The Indiana Public Retirement System finished shedding its $1.2 billion worth of investments in Chinese entities last August — four years ahead of the schedule state lawmakers set and one year after starting the effort.
Nieshalla, as comptroller, is on the system’s board. But she also chairs the board for a pension supplement called the Deferred Compensation Plan, or Hoosier START. That plan wasn’t required to divest — but did.
“We leaned into it as a board and took the spirit of that law and made certain that the funds invested through the Deferred Compensation Plan were also not invested in anything touching Chinese entities,” she said. “And we also accomplished that here, just in this last year. Very proud of that, for the sake of Hoosiers and the beneficiaries that we serve.”
The boards for INPRS and the Deferred Compensation Plan have taken similar actions following another state ban on ESG in pension investments.
Nieshalla has additionally urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate delisting China-based companies on U.S. stock exchanges.
Another achievement she highlighted is coming this fall.
The comptroller’s office is responsible for the Indiana Transparency Portal, and is working on adding visibility into how the state spends federal funds.

Nieshalla also noted that the office has earned a certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting from the Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada for 31 years straight — and vowed to continue that for another four years if reelected.
She’s got goals for a prospective next term.
Such as: incorporating artificial intelligence into accounts payable, U.S. Department of Government Efficiency-style.
“We can do that here at the state, look through our massive amounts of information and help our people see even more clearly where there are anomalies that need to be investigated,” Nieshalla said.
Another aim is fund number consolidation.
“Currently, the State Board of Accounts has one number for each fund that local units use. The Department of Local Government Finance has another number, and then local units have yet another,” Nieshalla said.
“It is confusing, it is laborious, it is difficult for the sake of transparency, for Hoosiers to understand,” she added, later. “… It is low-hanging fruit for us as a state to consolidate these numbers in partnership with the local units, to streamline that great working relationship that we have in the distribution of funds and to serve them in their budgeting process.”
Extracurricular and past pursuits
When asked if there was anything else she wanted Hoosiers to know about her, Nieshalla offered up her work with the State Financial Officers Foundation. She pitched and now leads a National Debt Crisis Task Force for the conservative organization.
“I’m very concerned about the rapidly dissolving financial position of our country,” Nieshalla said. “We are under the weight of $36 trillion of debt, and the interest payment alone on that debt is the fastest-growing line item in the federal budget.”
Her task force issued a letter late to then-President-elect Donald Trump and the 535 voting members of Congress last year, urging them to take action.

“It made a great impact. And we’re not done,” Nieshalla said. “We’re working on a follow-up letter in partnership with state legislators, and leaning into providing our support to President Trump and Congress to restore the country’s fiscal solvency — for the country and for the states.”
Prior to her appointment as comptroller, Nieshalla was serving as president of the Boone County Council, president of the Indiana County Councils Association and chair of the Association of Indiana Counties’ 2023 Legislative Committee. She has also worked 22 years in real estate.
Nieshalla made an unsuccessful bid for Indiana treasurer at the 2022 GOP convention but lost out to current officeholder Daniel Elliott.
She earned a bachelor’s degree from Oral Roberts University and a master’s degree from Indiana University. She and her husband, Chris, live in Zionsville, where they’ve raised their four children.

(Photo: Lithium Americas Presentation, June)Cattle rancher Edward Bartell waited patiently to take pictures of Lithium Nevada pumping water from a well the mining company had recently lost the right to use.
“I needed to make sure I caught them pumping and had photographs of them pumping, so I could prove that they were illegally using water,” said Bartell, who holds senior water rights in Thacker Pass.
His photos confirmed what the Nevada Division of Water Resources already suspected during an earlier field investigation. Lithium Nevada was, without a permit and despite a court order to halt, still pumping water from a contested well.
The state sent the mining company a cease and desist order Friday. 
The Nevada Division of Water Resources, which manages public waters in the state, said Lithium Nevada continued using the well despite being notified in April that their water permits were no longer valid.
Lithium Nevada’s water permits were reversed after Nevada’s Sixth Judicial District Court found the state agency erred when they approved two water permits for mining operations in Thacker Pass without properly analyzing whether the action would conflict with Bartell’s senior water rights.
Lithium Nevada was given 14 days to comply with the cease and desist. Bartell said he’s standing watch to ensure they do.
“It’s very frustrating for a family business to try and keep operating our business when the huge mining company comes in and continues to trample our rights and adversely affect the springs and the ecosystem out there,” he said.
He added, “They’re the neighbor from hell.”
Lithium Americas CEO and President Jonathan Evans in a statement to Current said the company would “continue to follow all laws and guidance from our federal and state partners, and are optimistic we will come to a positive resolution with the state.”
Water watchdog group Great Basin Resource Watch said the reversal of previously granted water permits by the Nevada Division of Water Resource was an example of “sloppy permitting” for a project that was approved unusually quickly.
President Donald Trump approved the Thacker Pass lithium mine project in Nevada five days before his first term ended. It was one of several projects fast-tracked by his administration to advance energy and mining development on public land.
“I’ve never seen a cease and desist order from the state on water rights,” said John Hadder, director of Great Basin Resource Watch. “It doesn’t make sense to try to ignore the law.”
“That’s the rush we’re seeing with a lot of this lithium mining. Just push it through. But there’s consequences if you don’t do it right,” he continued.
Lithium Nevada said it’s looking at several options to cover its immediate water needs as construction continues, but that the company is confident further analysis will restore their previous water permits.
“We are excited to be moving forward with construction on the Thacker Pass lithium project to deliver a U.S.-produced lithium supply chain that reduces American dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals,” Evans said in a statement.
Lawsuits and delays have plagued the construction of the planned lithium mine in Nevada for years. Lithium Americas had initially planned to begin lithium production at Thacker Pass by 2026, but several permitting issues and litigation by Nevada tribes and conservation groups helped delay the project. Lithium production at Thacker Pass is now expected to run at full capacity in 2028.
Bartell has been fighting the approval of several water permits awarded to Lithium Nevada for the construction and operation of a massive lithium mine near the Nevada-Oregon border, arguing the mine would deplete the available water for his ranch.
Since 2008, Bartell has used his senior water rights to rear cow calves at his ranch before selling them to buyers across the nation. He fears the water he depends on will soon be drained to extract millions of tons of lithium from clay at Thacker Pass.
“We’ve definitely seen a diminishment of one of the springs. It’s definitely flowing a lot less water than it was,” said Bartell.
Before their permit was revoked, Lithium Nevada was using water from the contested well for construction work. Once the lithium mine is in operation, however, that water would be used to create a slurry out of lithium-infused clay the targeted lithium can be separated from through a complex evaporation process.
While lithium mining is water intensive, Lithium Nevada has repeatedly said their environmental assessment proves Bartell’s ranch will not be negatively affected by their operation.
Bartell was sceptical, arguing “the evidence is very clear that they will dry up our springs, but obviously they will spend enormous sums of money to try and argue otherwise.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-5-8-24-at-4.10-PM-1024x600.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

(CHFS photo)Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball has asked the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) to share information about “a significant number” of denials under Medicaid’s Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW).
Ball sent a letter to the cabinet asking for more information on Tuesday, saying “these denials have raised serious concerns” about waiver eligibility “as well as the broader implications for vulnerable individuals who depend on these critical services.” 
A CHFS spokesperson said the cabinet learned earlier this year of an increase in denials and said a subcontractor wasn’t “correctly examining the Medicaid criteria used to determine if someone requires long-term care services.” 
The cabinet then “required the subcontractor to take action and correct their error,” it says. 
A spokeswoman for Ball said the Ombudsman’s Office, which investigates and resolves complaints about agencies in CHFS, including protective services for children and elderly Kentuckians, received 47 waiver denial appeals since January. 
Joy Pidgorodetska Markland, the communications director for the auditor, said information from the cabinet will help the office to “have a better idea of how to reach families and get a deeper sense of exactly how widespread this problem is.” 
“We were made aware that despite some children having more severe health conditions than when they originally were approved for the waiver, they were nonetheless denied,” Markland said. “It appears that all families received a boilerplate letter with the same language and general reason for denial without any specifics about the child. But beyond that written correspondence, we do not yet know what exactly families have been told about this entire situation.” 
A cabinet spokeswoman said that as of Wednesday, after addressing the subcontractor error, it had “corrected” 112 cases involving children and 67 involving adults. 
“Team Kentucky believes that health care is a basic human right and works to ensure everyone has access to quality care,” Beth Fisher, the deputy executive director in the cabinet’s Office of Public Affairs, said in an email. “We have been transparent with both the public and families about an issue with a subcontractor that has since been resolved.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/agencies-2.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 11:13:04.751473

(Photo by Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)Medicaid patients do not have the right to sue to visit the doctor of their choice, allowing states like South Carolina to remove clinics that also provide abortions from their lists of providers, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to Thursday’s opinion began with a 2018 executive order, in which Gov. Henry McMaster directed the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from the list of medical providers that patients can choose to visit for non-abortion health care services.
Six justices agreed with the decision. One wrote a separate concurring opinion. Three dissented.
Planned Parenthood, which operates two clinics in the state, sued, claiming a patient has the right to visit the clinics for other services, such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Medicaid already excludes most abortions, covering them only in cases of rape, incest or to save a patient’s life under a federal provision South Carolina follows.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health and Human Services.
A federal appeals court ruled against McMaster’s order three times, deciding the state can’t deny Medicaid patients from going to the provider of their choice because the provider also offers abortions.
Each time, the state’s attorneys appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to take up the issue until December.

The Senate won’t convict a president who has committed high crimes. The Supreme Court will give an insurrectionist president a free pass and grant him king-like immunity. The criminal justice system fails to impose any accountability against a politically powerful felon.
Coloradans can count the governor’s office as yet another institution that won’t save them from the Trump administration’s cruelty and lawlessness. As became clear this week in testimony before a Denver District Court judge, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, at least on some crucial matters, is on team MAGA.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in April sent an administrative subpoena to the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment seeking personal information that could improperly expose dozens of residents to immigration enforcement. Colorado has laws that prohibit state personnel from sharing personal identifying information with federal immigration officers except in response to a court-issued subpoena or to assist with a federal criminal investigation.
Polis had ordered that the information be released to ICE, claiming that disclosure was justified under the state law’s criminal-investigation exception. 
A top CDLE manager, Scott Moss, brought a whistleblower lawsuit against Polis to stop what he said would be illegal disclosures. A judge on Wednesday sided with Moss.
A witness on Polis’ side seemed to substantiate Moss’ case during testimony. CDLE director Joe Barela acknowledged under questioning in court that he knew of no evidence that the information sought in the subpoena had anything to do with a criminal investigation. And when Polis lawyer Thomas Rogers III continued to insist that the subpoena was related to a criminal investigation, even Judge A. Bruce Jones had had enough. 
“Am I going to believe you or my own lying eyes?” he said.
The judge’s eyes could see the subpoena itself. It was titled “Immigration Enforcement Subpoena.” It was an administrative document and did not come from a court. It sought extensive personal information, including work and medical records, of 35 people identified as sponsors of unaccompanied child immigrants. 
The only mention in the subpoena of a crime was so open-ended as to be meaningless. It said that Homeland Security Investigations, an agency within ICE, was “conducting investigative activities” to locate unaccompanied immigrant children to ensure they’re not the victims of “crimes,” such as human trafficking.
That’s not a criminal investigation. Not in the legal sense. Not according to common sense. That’s a fishing expedition.
But Polis is on board with it.
No pursuit of the Trump administration so exemplifies its lawlessness and cruelty so much as its immigration enforcement program, which has terrorized communities, stripped residents of due process rights, disappeared people to a brutal foreign prison, targeted individuals who have done nothing more than express a disfavored opinion, and resulted in the arrest of elected officials.
Leaders of Trump’s mass deportation effort originally claimed that it would target violent criminals, but its implementation shows that anyone without residency authorization is at risk, no matter how long they’ve lived in America, no matter how clean their record, no matter how much they’ve contributed to their communities. This week a whistleblower revealed that it was federal Justice Department policy to ignore court orders and withhold information in immigration enforcement cases.
In other words, immigration officials have repeatedly acted in bad faith, yet Polis has chosen to give them the benefit of the doubt. This has come at great cost to Coloradans — not just the countless families in the state who might fear that masked government goons at any time could kidnap one of their own off the street, but also the tens of thousands of residents who grieve the erosion of constitutional order and have registered their fear and anger by marching in multiple protests against ICE’s unaccountable behavior.
As Trump’s return to the presidency approached, many Coloradans took some comfort in assuming that leaders like Polis, a Democrat leading a blue state, might provide some protection against the fascist abuses they suspected, correctly, would issue from Washington. But early on there were ominous indications that Polis was aligned with MAGA, not least the president’s immigration enforcement program. Now it’s clear Polis has made the governor’s office an extension of that program.
Institutions won’t save us. When individual Coloradans take to the streets to demonstrate in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian outrages, they would be justified in including the Colorado governor’s office as an object of protest.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned a controversial earlier decision that had sent alarm through the ski industry in Idaho and nationwide, holding instead that a lower court was right to dismiss a lawsuit from the widow of a skier who died after crashing into a snowmaking tower gun at Sun Valley.
However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed.
“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.”
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.
 Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident

Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions.
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
 Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say

The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails.
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas.
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling:

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others.
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.
In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas.
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

Should Pritzker win and serve a full term, he would become the only three-term Democratic governor in Illinois’ history.

“I’m running for re-election to protect our progress and continue solving the problems we face,” he said in an announcement video. “I love this state, and it’s the honor of my life to serve as your governor – to help lead through the most challenging of times and celebrate the most joyful ones together. I’m ready for the fight ahead.”

Pritzker has not yet announced a running mate to replace Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, who is running for U.S. Senate in 2026.

The state GOP issued a statement saying Pritzker should be “fired not re-hired.”

“He’s prioritized illegal immigrants over Illinois families, hiked taxes, and rammed through the largest, most bloated budget in state history,” ILGOP Chairman Kathy Salvi said in a statement.

The governor’s political future has been the topic of significant speculation, especially since he was shortlisted for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate search last summer in her campaign for the White House. That and his vocal and frequent condemnations of President Donald Trump have fueled speculation of a presidential run in 2028.

The announcement that he will run for governor does not prohibit a future presidential run, because governor and president are not up in the same election cycle.

Several Republicans have announced plans to run for governor. DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick said he would run earlier this year. Mechanic and Posen Park District Commissioner Phil Perez and businessman Joe Severino have also publicly said they are running, while Cook County GOP Chair Aaron Del Mar is also mulling a run.

Oregon-headquartered Hampton Lumber announced it will build the new $225 million mill near the town of Fairfax. The 375,000-square-foot mill is expected to make framing lumber used in home construction, with production scheduled to begin in 2027.
“This investment will benefit not only our state’s timber farmers but will also offer quality jobs in a largely rural and agricultural part of the state,” state Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers said in a statement.
And State Forester Scott Phillips called the mill a “welcome boost to the industry and to communities that rely on forestry for economic opportunity.”
The mill is expected to buy southern yellow pine common in South Carolina, a potential shot in the arm to a state timber industry that has been struggling amid closures of major paper mills.
“We’re happy to join the healthy wood products industry already present in the region, and we look forward to building partnerships in the area and supporting the communities in and around Allendale County,” Hampton Lumber CEO Randy Schillinger said in a statement.
It’s also a boost for Allendale County, among the state’s poorest counties with historically high jobless rates. The county’s 4.8% unemployment rate last month ranked 10th highest, according to the state Department of Employment and Workforce.
SouthernCarolina Alliance President Danny Black, the head of the region’s economic development agency, said Allendale County Council is considering a deal that would lower Hampton Lumber’s property taxes to a 4% rate for 40 years in exchange for the company’s investment.
By state law, manufacturers without such an arrangement pay a 6% rate. (Industrial property owners previously paid a 10.5% rate, but state laws passed in 2017 and 2022 effectively lowered it to 6%.)
The state also approved the company for income tax credits worth $25,000 per new job annually.
“Hampton Lumber’s new operation in Allendale County will be a notable addition to our state’s forestry industry, while also providing opportunities for our people and contributing to the local economy,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate is working on the “big, beautiful bill” — a massive tax package that gives money directly to the wealthiest Americans while gutting programs that help everyday South Dakotans. If passed, this bill would cause devastating harm through deep cuts to Medicaid, higher health care costs for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, and automatic cuts to Medicare.
This bill will increase the federal deficit, resulting in the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act (PAYGO) to kick in. That law requires automatic, across-the-board cuts to programs like Medicare unless Congress intervenes. So not only does this bill extend $1.1 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, it pulls the rug out from under those who rely on Medicare just to get by.
The human cost of this legislation is staggering.
As someone who works directly with people experiencing homelessness, I witness every day what a lack of health care looks like. It’s the untreated infections that escalate into emergencies. It’s the missed mental health support that results in a crisis. It’s the addiction that goes unaddressed because there are no accessible recovery services. It’s the quiet suffering of people who are told — explicitly or implicitly — that their lives are expendable in the name of tax cuts for the rich.
Thune, other GOP leaders in US Senate struggle to lessen pain of Medicaid cuts for rural hospitals

And as a pediatrician, I’ve seen firsthand how children suffer when the health care safety net is dismantled. I’ve seen children arrive at shelters sick, scared, and in need of urgent care that their families simply couldn’t afford. Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in South Dakota and provides essential services like immunizations, developmental screenings, and early interventions that can change the course of a child’s life. Without it, preventable illnesses go untreated, mental health conditions worsen, and families are left with nowhere to turn. Children don’t get a second chance at healthy development. We must protect their access to care now.
Children, people with disabilities, older adults, and rural communities will bear the brunt of this proposal. Medicaid is not just a safety net; it is a lifeline. In South Dakota, Medicaid expansion has helped thousands access preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health services — often for the first time in their lives. This bill would unravel that progress.
It’s not just individuals who will suffer. This legislation threatens the very institutions that keep our communities alive — hospitals, senior-living centers, and nursing homes. Many of these facilities operate on razor-thin margins and rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement to stay open. If this bill passes, South Dakota will see closures, especially in rural areas where there is no backup option. When the local hospital closes, people die. When a senior center shuts its doors, families are left scrambling to care for aging loved ones without support.
And for what? To fund permanent tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy. That’s not fiscal responsibility. That’s cruelty disguised as budgeting.
There is still time to act. Congress can let the Trump-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire. Congress can still extend the tax cuts for the hardworking middle and low-income earners. These two things are not mutually exclusive.
Instead of the federal government forcing states like South Dakota to shoulder more health care costs, citizens should have access to the critical programs that keep them healthy — especially our children, whose futures depend on it.

(Photo by Allen Stegeman/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Alaska, like other states around the nation, is compiling a 10-year plan to guide conservation of sometimes vulnerable wildlife populations. Alaska’s State Wildlife Action Plan, which is in draft form, identifies “species of greatest conservation need” because of declining populations, changing habitat, development, invasive species threats, knowledge gaps or other concerns.
But now the federal funding that supports Alaska’s State Wildlife Action Plan and those of other states is itself vulnerable.
The Trump administration proposes to zero out funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s entire State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program, established in 2000. The program distributes money to states to use on conservation projects that are designed in accordance with wildlife action plans. For Alaska, the most recent grant funding was about $2.76 million.
In its Fish and Wildlife Service budget summary, the Trump administration pitched elimination of the grant funding as part of a shift to the private sector.
“Although FWS is responsible for conserving trust resources across broad landscapes, its work to conserve natural resources is impossible without partnerships with States, Tribes, and private landowners. In recognition of this, the 2026 Budget will eliminate grants to States and Tribes that come with strings attached on the types of species they should conserve. These eliminations will be complemented by FWS investments in partnerships with private landowners,” the summary said.
The summary does not identify the “strings” that the administration contends limit states’ actions.
While Alaska and other states must have 10-year wildlife action plans to qualify for the federal grants, the states choose how those grants will be distributed, said an official with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s Division of Wildlife Conservation.
State Wildlife Grants “are implemented at the discretion of the states,” said Lindsey Nietmann in an email. She is the coordinator of the division’s threatened, endangered and diversity program.
A key goal of the plan in Alaska and those in other states is to address possible wildlife problems before they get serious enough to warrant the drastic step of Endangered Species Act listing, said state biologist Julie Hagelin.
“An important general principle is that it’s more cost effective to maintain or manage or mitigate threats to ensure sustainable populations of wildlife, sort of in a proactive way, rather than the need to go to great lengths and expense and sort of have prescriptive regulatory burdens that the federal government imposes through the ESA,” said Hagelin, a conservation and management coordinator with the Division of Wildlife Conservation.
The concept fits Alaska’s constitutional mandate for sustained yield and is “consistent with this idea of being proactive and caring for the long-term sustainability of our natural and wildlife,” Hagelin said.

	A variety of work to mitigate threats has been funded by the federal grants. Recent projects include research into Alaska bats and the dangers they may be facing from white-nosed syndrome, a fungal disease that has killed large numbers of Lower 48 bats; monitoring of the Aleutian tern, a migratory bird that breeds only in coastal Alaska and neighboring parts of Siberia and is believed to be declining in population; and studies of forest practices that are best for regeneration and protection of habitat used by bird and mammal species.
The State Wildlife Grant Program appears to be popular nationally.
“This program provides critical funding to every U.S. state and territory to plan and implement proactive conservation actions to prevent the nation’s fish and wildlife from becoming endangered,” the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says on its website. “The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program is considered the core program for keeping species healthy and off the federal threatened and endangered species list, a goal shared by a broad constituency of conservationists, business, farmers, ranchers, and land developers.”
“The State Wildlife Grants program has allowed the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and its partners to accomplish so much more for Iowa’s Natural Resources than was possible before its inception,” the Iowa Department of Natural Resources website says. “State Wildlife Grants is the nation’s most important program in keeping species from becoming endangered.”
“State Wildlife Grants save taxpayers millions of dollars,” the Georgia Department of Natural Resources website says. “Taking action to conserve wildlife before it becomes endangered is environmentally sound and fiscally responsible. Once a species drops to the point of potential extinction, recovery efforts become risky and expensive. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
Even the first Trump administration lauded the program. In 2020, the final year of the first Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service released a publication that touted it as providing “20 years of conservation success.”
However, the first Trump administration attempted that year to slash funding for the program by more than $20 million, though not eliminate it. Congress wound up appropriating about the same amount in that budget as had been appropriated in other recent years.
The wildlife grants continue to enjoy bipartisan support in Congress, if a recent letter signed by 42 U.S. senators is any indication.

The federal grant program distributed about $55 million in total to states to be used at their discretion for work this year. Alaska, California and Texas received equal amounts and were the top recipients. That has been the case every year since 2002, with annual amounts that ranged from about $2.3 million to over $3.8 million.
Related Fish and Wildlife Service grants are awarded to tribal governments across the nation. That tribal grant program distributed about $6 million for projects this year. In Alaska, tribal governments have used grants from that program for projects that include fish surveys in Southeast Alaska to clam restoration work in Prince William Sound to habitat surveys in Seward Peninsula areas that might be affected by mine development.
Another related program provides grants on a competitive basis totaling about $7 million a year. One recent Alaska project that won a competitive grant concerned research into the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whale population.
If the grants survive, a wide range of Alaska species could benefit.

	Alaska’s new wildlife action plan, in draft form, identifies 362 vertebrates as being of “greatest conservation need,” a number that includes 188 bird species, 101 fish species, 43 terrestrial mammals, 25 marine mammals and five amphibians. That is far fewer than the approximately 20 Alaska populations with Endangered Species Act protection.
One species identified as being of greatest conservation need is the Alaska hare, sometimes called the tundra hare. It is known for its large size – up to 15 pounds, much larger than the more abundant snowshoe hare – but a lot of other details about the population remain unknown.
There are historical accounts from biologists and local hunters who described seeing groups of hundreds of Alaska hares, Hagelin said. “And now it’s pretty rare to find groups of more than three to four individuals,” she said. Aside from those indicators of decline, wildlife managers are faced with a scarcity of information about Alaska hares in general, including their population status and habitat use, she said. “It’s all kind of poorly understood.”
Recent research that was funded in part by the federal grant program enabled biologists to engage in some “epic snowmachine surveys” in which they gathered hare pellets and tagged some animals to piece together genetic and population information, Hagelin said. Information from that work helped lead to some hunting restrictions imposed by the state Board of Game and Federal Subsistence Board, she said.
Another species identified as being among those of “greatest conservation need” is the gray-headed chickadee, previously known as the Siberian tit. Their range extends across the circumpolar north, from Siberia to northern Asia to North America, but the Alaska population appears to have declined.
For the most part, the list of species in the draft 2025 State Wildlife Action Plan is the same as that in the 2015 plan. There are 37 more identified in the new plan, largely because of habitat changes that have affected aquatic species.
An important new element is a more precise methodology for selecting species of greatest conservation need, Hagelin said. That uses a ranking system developed by the Alaska Center for Conservation Science at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
In addition to guiding federally funded projects, the State Wildlife Action Plan helps Alaska coordinate management actions with other states, Hagelin said. That is important to protecting migratory birds that spend the summer breeding seasons in the Arctic or subarctic, where habitats are more likely to be intact, but spend other parts of the year in southern habitats that may be more compromised, she said.
Generally, the plan does not apply to game species that are widely hunted, such as caribou, because there are numerous other programs and revenue sources that provide money used for management and conservation, she said.
Likewise, it does not concentrate much on fish that are the subject of big commercial or sport harvests, as those fisheries have their own management and funding systems. And it does not include plants, though other states’ plans do extend to plant species. Texas is among the states that includes plants in its wildlife action plan, and it has a total of about 1,200 identified species of greatest conservation need, Hagelin said.
The State and Tribal Wildlife Grant Program is among several Fish and Wildlife Service-managed programs that the Trump administration has targeted for funding elimination.
The administration’s budget proposes no money for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, the Multinational Species Conservation Fund and the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. Each of those funds got between $5 million and $49 million in funding for the current fiscal year.

DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein urged his advisors to stay open-minded while also hinting at the possibility of disentangling state policy from the Trump administration.
The post State experts mulling federal vaccine policy shifts, Mass. response appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS TURMOIL engulfed a federal vaccine advisory panel earlier this month, Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein urged his own set of advisors to stay open-minded while also hinting at the possibility of disentangling state policy from the Trump administration.
That philosophy could be tested later Wednesday and Thursday, as the CDC’s revamped Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meets and reviews a vaccine ingredient that US Health and Human Health Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. has previously — and, experts say, erroneously — linked to conditions like autism. Kennedy fired all 17 ACIP members on June 9 and made eight new appointments days later.
The Massachusetts Vaccine Purchasing Advisory Council (MVPAC) orients its work closely around guidance from the ACIP. At its recent meeting, Goldstein acknowledged the upheaval at the federal panel has been “in some ways, very alarming.”
“I guess I want to say to this group that’s here that I think it is our responsibility to keep an open mind about what is happening, to analyze the data as they’re presented to ACIP, to think like an ACIP member in the next two weeks, and to use this body to have our own deliberation and our own discussion,” Goldstein said on June 12. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to jump to conclusions that what ACIP decides at the end of June is necessarily wrong or necessarily right. I think it’s our responsibility to look at the data that are presented, to listen to the deliberation, and to come to our own conclusions — and they may be the same.”
Kennedy said he chose to do a “clean sweep” and reconstitute the panel “to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science.” The secretary later wrote on social media that his new appointees include “highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America’s most accomplished physicians.”
Goldstein pointed out one of those new members is Dr. H. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, who also happens to be on the MVPAC.
“I think Dr. Meissner has shown a commitment to the science, a commitment to evidence, a commitment to vaccine policies that protect the commonwealth, protect people across this country,” Goldstein said. “And so I’m hopeful that there are more like him on the advisory committee as it is repopulated.”
One of the dismissed ACIP members was Dr. Lin Chen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in a letter to Kennedy on Tuesday, said the panel’s new members “include vaccine skeptics, medical professionals with conflicts of interest, and individuals without any apparent experience conducting studies of vaccines, counseling patients about vaccines, or administering vaccines.”
“As presently constituted, the committee lacks the qualifications and credibility to offer the nation credible advice on vaccines,” Warren wrote.
The ACIP’s role is to make recommendations about vaccine safety, efficacy and clinical need to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to HHS.
Meanwhile, the MVPAC’s mission is to help DPH distribute ACIP-recommended childhood vaccines “to ensure the health and safety of the Commonwealth’s citizens.” Some members are designated by DPH, the Center for Health Information and Analysis, the Massachusetts Academy of Pediatrics, the Massachusetts Medical Society and health insurers.
The MVPAC makes its purchasing recommendations using principles such as safety and efficacy, cost and supply issues, provider and patient issues, and market share, according to the body’s guiding principles. Aiming to “maximize vaccine coverage and minimize provider confusion, vaccine waste and administration errors,” the MVPAC says it also “will avoid to the degree possible making significant changes to their periodic purchasing recommendations except as indicated by their careful assessment of the factors outlined in these principles.”
Before coming to DPH, Goldstein worked as a senior policy advisor at the CDC during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Goldstein said state public health officials have been working to gauge how Massachusetts fits into the “complicated federal landscape,” including within the legal and regulatory arena.
“So what laws, what regulation do we have here in Massachusetts that either tie us to CDC recommendations and ACIP, or may need to be amended to make sure that we can use evidence and science to drive our decisions and our recommendations,” the commissioner said.
“The work falls into a second bucket, which is how do we maintain access and purchase ability for these vaccines,” Goldstein continued. “And we are making sure that, no matter what happens at the federal level, we will continue to be able to purchase vaccines here in Massachusetts, distribute them across the commonwealth, and make sure there’s access in pediatrics practices, community health centers, hospitals all across the state.”
Gov. Maura Healey, asked Monday how Massachusetts may need to extricate itself from federal vaccine policy, said Goldstein and DPH are evaluating the matter.
“We’re going to continue to provide vaccinations here in Massachusetts,” Healey told reporters.
Kennedy last month announced the CDC is no longer recommending COVID vaccines for healthy pregnant women and children. Goldstein has emphasized COVID shots remain available, and they can prevent serious illness and death for at-risk individuals.
The ACIP is meeting at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, with opening remarks slated for 10 a.m. Wednesday. 
“The work prior to an ACIP meeting is extensive, and the amount of data that are evaluated by working groups and presented to the full committee is enormous,” Goldstein had said earlier in June. “I am interested to see, at the end of this month, brand new members of ACIP that are able to make informed decisions about vaccine policy.”
A previous agenda for this week’s ACIP meeting listed votes on vaccine recommendations for COVID, RSV and flu shots, among other immunizations. The finalized itinerary scraps some votes, and includes a presentation about thimerosal in vaccines and recommendations about the ingredient in flu shots.
Kennedy wrote a book in 2014 about the dangers of thimerosal, which the CDC and health experts have debunked, according to Politico. In her letter, Warren called the ACIP’s planned vote on thimerosal-containing vaccines a “dog whistle for vaccine skeptics.”
As questions swirl around pending federal recommendations and how the public will react to Kennedy’s updated panel, Goldstein emphasized the role of MVPAC in promoting trust in vaccine policy.
“I cannot say this enough, that the damage that is done when people in the federal government talk about vaccines with mis- and disinformation, when they share fringe theories about vaccines, the damage that is done to trust in public health and vaccine programs is enormous,” Goldstein said, without invoking specific individuals or examples. “I have been trying to use my position to speak about the benefits of vaccines as much as I possibly can. I think that we need to continue to do so — all of us.”
Healey called Kennedy a “threat to public health” during the Health Equity Trends Summit earlier this month. She described engaging with the federal government as playing “opposite day” with children.
“If they want to defund science and research, we will fund science and research,” Healey had said, drawing audience applause and cheers. “If they want to dismantle the CDC and vaccine infrastructure, we’re going to find a way to build, and make, and distribute our own, and we’re going to make sure people have access to it equitably.”

Grace Sweeten, a ninth-grader at Sussex Academy in Georgetown, and Vivian Wan, a tenth-grader at Tower Hill School in Wilmington, were among 75 first-place winners selected from thousands of student submissions across the country.
Sweeten was honored for her original artwork, “Mother of Refuge,” while Wan earned recognition for her essay, “The American Mosaic.”
“America’s Field Trip is a transformative opportunity for students across the country to engage with our nation’s history in meaningful, lasting ways,” said Rosie Rios, chair of America250. “Our tentpole programs are intentionally designed to be hands-on, educational, and engaging. America’s Field Trip truly brings the story of America to life and allows a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for these students to experience American history and national treasures up-close.”
Both students’ works will be featured in an upcoming exhibit at the Delaware Public Archives, organizers announced this week.
America’s Field Trip invites students from grades 3 through 12 to reflect creatively on the question, “What does America mean to you?”
This year’s competition drew submissions from all 50 states, five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.
First-place winners will take part in field trips to historic and cultural landmarks across the U.S. this summer, while second-place winners receive a $500 prize.
“It’s an honor for Delaware to have two students recognized as first place winners in the America’s Field Trip contest,” said Margaret Hughes, director of Delaware 250. “We’re so proud of what Grace and Vivian have accomplished, and grateful to them for sharing their vision of America.”
The contest is part of a broader educational initiative by America250, the national commission leading preparations for the country’s Semiquincentennial in 2026. Organizers aim to foster civic reflection and participation through hands-on, inclusive programming.

,DC,2025-06-26 13:36:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump urges voters to press for US Senate GOP mega-bill after setback on Medicaid cuts,"Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-urges-voters-press-us-senate-gop-mega-bill-after-setback-medicaid-cuts,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Thursday told his supporters to call members of Congress and lobby them to support the “big, beautiful bill,” a crucial push with just days to go before a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.Trump’s plea follows several tumultuous days on Capitol Hill as GOP leaders struggled to find consensus on multiple policy disagreements, especially after the parliamentarian ruled core elements of the package don’t meet the complex rules for moving a budget reconciliation bill.Trump during an event in the White House’s East Room that was attended by several GOP lawmakers also cautioned Republicans against voting down the tax and spending cut package.“We don’t want to have grandstanders,” Trump said. “Not good people. They know who I'm talking about. I call them out. But we don’t need grandstanders. We have to get our country back and bring it back strong.”Some Republican senators remain optimistic they can work through the weekend and that the House votes will come together next week, despite growing opposition from members in that chamber.Sen. Eric Schmitt said he doesn’t think the parliamentarian’s rulings will delay the votes “outside the weekend window, which has been the goal all the time.”“We're probably voting into the weekend, though. That's probably my guess — Saturday and I suppose even Sunday — but, that's the goal, I don't think that materially changes too much,” the Missouri Republican said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., however, appeared a bit less definite, telling reporters in the afternoon that he didn’t know when the chamber would take the procedural vote that kicks off floor consideration.“I’ll get back to you on that,” he said.Medicaid provisions tossedEarlier Thursday, Senate Republicans suffered a significant setback when the parliamentarian ruled several changes to Medicaid in the bill don’t comply with the rules, which means billions of dollars in savings are no longer available for the GOP to offset the cost of tax cuts.Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo. R-Idaho, must rework or completely eliminate nine changes the committee proposed to the health care programs, though more of the panel’s proposals are still under review.Republicans can no longer reduce the amount of federal matching funds for state governments that use their own tax dollars to provide Medicaid coverage for immigrants in the country without proper documentation.The GOP bill cannot bar gender-affirming care for Medicaid patients.And Republicans need to change or scrap a proposal to reduce states’ Medicaid provider tax credits, an issue that is relatively in the weeds of health care policy but has sharply divided the GOP and drawn fierce opposition from states.The changes or eliminations will have a major impact on how much in savings the GOP tax and spending cut bill will generate during the next decade and will likely make the overall package’s deficit impact higher than before.

Robert Byrd, includes several guardrails for reconciliation bills.Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote in a statement that the parliamentarian’s ruling will lead to “more than $250 billion in health care cuts removed from the Republicans’ big bad bill.“Democrats fought and won, striking health care cuts from this bill that would hurt Americans’ walking on an economic tightrope. This bill is rotten to its core, and I’ll keep fighting the cuts in this morally bankrupt bill until the end.”The parliamentarian is still deciding whether several health provisions meet reconciliation rules, including language that would block all Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, effectively blocking Medicaid patients from visiting the organization for routine health services.Federal law already bars funding for abortions with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient.The parliamentarian will also decide later whether Republicans’ bill can block the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing a Biden-era rule that would require nursing homes to have a nurse working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Higher ed provisions axedThe parliamentarian also struck down several attempts from congressional Republicans to overhaul the higher education system.GOP lawmakers cannot streamline student loan repayment options for current borrowers to just a standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment plan, making such restrictions apply to only new borrowers.Republicans have to nix a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are for-profit and not accredited.The parliamentarian scrapped a proposal that would have barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.The federal program eliminates remaining debt for borrowers when meeting certain requirements, including working for a qualified employer within the government or nonprofit sector.The parliamentarian rejected GOP lawmakers’ proposal to end federal student aid eligibility for certain immigrants who are not U.S. citizens.‘Too many Medicaid cuts’Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said the parliamentarian’s ruling on the Medicaid provider tax rate will give lawmakers “a chance to get it right.”“This is a chance for the Senate to fix a problem that they created and not defund rural hospitals,” Hawley said, later adding he supports the House language that would freeze the rate at 6% instead of decreasing it to 3.5% over several years. Hawley said hours before Trump’s event that he expects the president to get more involved in negotiations now that he’s back from a NATO conference in Europe and said Trump was in a “terrific mood” during a recent phone call.“I think he wants this done. But he wants it done well. And he does not want this to be a Medicaid cuts bill,” Hawley said. “He made that very clear to me. He said this is a tax cut bill, it's not a Medicaid cuts bill. I think he's tired of hearing about all these Medicaid cuts, you know. As am I. It's because there are too many Medicaid cuts.”Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy early Thursday night called on leaders to put the House’s language regarding Medicaid back into the bill, wiping out changes made by the Finance Committee.“My position is that cuts, and especially drastic cuts, to Medicaid have to be avoided. The Senate bill cuts Medicaid too much,” the influential chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee wrote in a social media post. “I agree with President Trump, the House version is better.”SNAP cutsThe Agriculture Committee also is reworking parts of its bill, some being closely watched by states, to meet the rules that govern reconciliation.Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., said he expects to hear from the parliamentarian before the end of Thursday about whether a revised state cost share provision for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that's based on error rate payments will be in the final bill.""It was thrown out the first time, so we actually gave her revised text. If she rules the revised text is fine, then we'll release it,"" Boozman said.The committee released a statement later in the day announcing the parliamentarian had cleared the revised state cost share for SNAP that’s based on a state’s error payment rate.States that have SNAP error payment rates higher than 6% will have to contribute some of the cost of the program. The updated proposal will give states the option of choosing between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026 to determine their match, which will begin during fiscal 2028. After that, a state’s match will be determined by its error payment rate for the last three fiscal years. State and local tax, ‘revenge tax’Senate Republicans also remained stuck on finding a deduction level for state and local tax, or SALT, that passes muster with House Republicans who represent high-tax blue states.The House version would allow taxpayers making under $500,000 to deduct up to $40,000 in SALT from their federal tax bill. Both the $40,000 cap and the $500,000 income threshold will increase annually at 1% until hitting a ceiling of $44,000 and $552,000. The deduction cap phases down for higher earners.Senate Republicans and the White House sought to lower the income threshold but were shot down Thursday by House Republicans, according to multiple reports.Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, the lead negotiator on SALT for Senate Republicans, said he remained optimistic.""We're gonna be in a good spot. We're gonna find a landing spot,"" Mullin said.A Senate Finance Committee spokesperson declined to comment on current negotiations, including any proposed income level changes.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also weighed in on another tax provision: the so-called “revenge tax” on investments from countries whose trade policies the president views as unfair to U.S. businesses.Bessent asked lawmakers to remove the up to 20% tax from the mega-bill following an agreement made with G7 partners, he wrote on social media.“This understanding with our G7 partners provides greater certainty and stability for the global economy and will enhance growth and investment in the United States and beyond,” Bessent said.The retaliation tax would have raised roughly $116 billion over 10 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Timing on votesRepublican lawmakers don’t have much time left to rework all of the ineligible provisions, clear them with the parliamentarian, read through final bill text, slog through a marathon amendment voting session in the Senate and then move the bill through the House before their self-imposed deadline.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing before Trump’s event that the president is ""adamant"" Congress must pass the ""big, beautiful bill” within the next week, despite the latest ruling.  ""We expect that bill to be on the president's desk for signature by July Fourth. I know there was a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian this morning,” Leavitt said. “Look, this is part of the process, this is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate. But the president is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day.""",,,,2025-06-26 19:05:24.226906

At a hearing on Beacon Hill, Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability bill was met with praise from lawmakers, but Sen. Barrett and Rep. Turco raised questions about Mass Save and the overall affordability of the green energy transition.
The post Healey’s energy affordability bill gets support, tough questions on Beacon Hill appeared first on CommonWealth B[...]","GOV. MAURA HEALEY’S sweeping energy affordability bill received a largely positive reception from lawmakers at a nearly six-hour hearing on Wednesday, but even lawmakers who lauded the proposal had some concerns. 
Healey unveiled the bill in May in response to a winter that saw sharp increases in natural gas bills across the state. The legislation aims to reduce certain charges on energy bills, keep unnecessary costs from being passed to ratepayers, and expand the state’s authority to explore new nuclear power technologies. 
After a cold winter that had residents across the state struggling to make ends meet, Healey’s aim is to lower rate payer bills while still moving forward on the state’s mandated climate goals. She faces a challenging balancing act as the Trump administration pulls federal funding from climate efforts and takes aim at offshore wind – a potentially abundant source of clean energy for Massachusetts.
Sen. Michael Barrett of Lexington, the chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy who was the driving force behind the climate law which passed in November 2024, said that he was “impressed with the sheer intelligence and ingenuity of the fine print” of the bill.
But he also questioned whether Healey’s plan to allow the Department of Public Utilities to authorize utility companies to issue bonds to fund Mass Save would cost ratepayers more in the long run. “We would move from pay-as-you-go to an alternative that requires the payment of interest on long-term bonds,” said Barrett.  “One would think that would be an additional financing cost, and that over the entire cost of the useful life of the project, more dollars might wind up being spent either by our taxpayers or by our ratepayers.”
Mass Save, which is currently funded entirely through surcharges on utility customers, accounted for the biggest portion of the increase in natural gas rates this past winter. The program’s cost is updated only every three years, and an unusually cold winter amplified the effect of the rate increase.
Rebecca Tepper, the state secretary of energy and environmental affairs, said the DPU would be reviewing any plan to issue bonds for Mass Save, and that the agency would only move forward on allowing this means of financing if it is in the interest of customers. The utility companies would not make a profit on the bonds, she added.
Barrett also expressed concern that, in the absence of offshore wind, the state would be more reliant on solar but that the proposed legislation would lower the rate – known as the “net metering compensation rate” – non-residential solar panel owners are compensated when they send energy back into the grid. According to the Healey administration, Massachusetts has the highest net metering rate in the country, and lowering the rate will save customers an estimated $380 million over 10 years. High net metering rates can mean that the costs of maintaining the electric grid are disproportionately borne by non-solar customers and utility companies might have to raise rates for all customers to offset the revenue lost from paying solar producers at a higher rate.
“We want to indicate we need more solar because offshore wind is going to be very slow off the mark, given what President Trump is doing,” said Barrett. “But in the next breath, we assure people that we’re going to reduce the value of net metering. How are you going to get more solar during a period – when it may be our primary source of clean energy over the next four years – and somehow make it less lucrative to the developers?”
Healey’s undersecretary of energy, Michael Judge, testified that the lowered net metering rate would only impact certain large net metering facilities. Currently, those facilities receive close to “double what any other state in the country provides to solar,” he said. 
“I don’t think it should have any … negative impact on solar development or the pace of solar development in Massachusetts, but it should allow us to build it at a lower cost,” he added.
The legislation gives the state more flexibility in how energy is procured from the state. Barrett asked Healey to clarify if the state would include sources like solar, nuclear, and hydropower under the new procurement framework. Elizabeth Mahoney, commissioner of the Department of Energy Resources, said that all different sources will be part of the procurement plan to meet the state’s climate goals.
Rep. Jeffrey Turco, who represents Winthrop and parts of Revere, expressed doubts that energy affordability and the transition to green energy could go hand in hand.
“What is the priority of the administration: Green energy or rate pay relief?” asked Turco. “Because it seems to me that the reality of the last year or two with our rates is that you can’t have both.”
In response, Healey said she was taking an “all of the above approach” to get as much energy as possible onto the grid from different sources. She said that she is looking at “all options” and that she wants to address some of the “immediate hurt” of the energy affordability crisis.
“[With] some of the programs that have served the Commonwealth well – where can we scale back right now?” said Healey. “Because people have got to be able to put food on the table, especially with the other the other cuts that that we’re likely to see from the federal administration.”
Healey’s legislation would also phase out a program that provides incentives to businesses for installing “alternative energy systems” that contribute to the state’s clean energy goals by increasing energy efficiency, reform the competitive supply market to protect customers from predatory practices by third-party electric suppliers, and allow the Department of Public Utilities to cap the amount of month-to-month bill increases.
Carrie Katan from the nonprofit Green Energy Consumer Alliance said that her group supports the consumer protections in Healey’s bill around third-party electric suppliers – which have come under fire for predatory marketing and major price hikes. Many environmental and energy affordability advocates, including Katan, as well as more than a dozen municipal leaders across the state support an outright ban on third-party suppliers.
“If we cannot get a ban, we would love if there is legislation that protects people from the worst abuses of the system,” Katan said in an interview. “That would still be a massive win for the people of the commonwealth.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Mike Duggan may be mayor of the Motor City, but he was one of the most popular attractions on the vehicle-free Mackinac Island during the Detroit Regional Chamber’s annual policy conference last month.
As mayor of Detroit, Duggan is one of two people – along with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – guaranteed a keynote speaking slot during the Mackinac Policy Conference.
He used this year’s address to roll out his plan to invest $4.5 billion in schools while promoting his independent campaign for governor, contrasting himself with Republican and Democratic attack ads alike.
The next day, he highlighted Detroit’s comeback during a panel with Rocket Mortgage founder and philanthropist Dan Gilbert.
April Ryan, Washington bureau chief and White House correspondent for Black Press USA, underscored Duggan’s arguments about partisan politics during a separate panel on the final day of the conference, saying Duggan’s polling – indicating that he pulls nearly equal amounts of support from Republicans and Democrats – shows “the system is broken.”
“Certain groups felt … like they weren’t heard. And the problem is we have to find a way to get everyone under the umbrella,” Ryan said. “That’s why independents are on the rise, and people are listening, because people don’t feel heard. People want to feel seen.”
The Michigan Advance caught up with Duggan about his campaign taking on both the Democratic and Republican candidates for governor as an independent.
The Democratic field to succeed term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer currently includes Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki.
Republicans who have entered the race include former Attorney General Mike Cox, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.), former House Speaker Tom Leonard, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former congressional candidate Anthony Hudson and construction manager William Null.

The following are excerpts from the Advance’s interview with Duggan:
 
You mentioned during your keynote address that a bad system will always beat a good person. If we’re in a bad system now, what does that mean for your campaign?
“Well, I think people in Michigan are really internalizing now that with this divided state and the continual 50-50 Republican and Democrat split in the Legislature that we are going to keep swinging back and forth. And people are feeling the impact of that. They feel the impact in the schools. They feel the impact in the economic policies. I’m offering a different alternative, and I’m finding a lot of people receptive.”
 
You mentioned how policy goals will swing back and forth with Republican and Democratic governors and legislators. You’re running as an independent. How effective can you be at changing that as governor if you don’t have similarly independent legislators to work with?
“When you have a 56-54 margin, and you’re in the 56, your most extreme three or four people control your agenda. And that pulls the two parties to the extremes – what makes people so angry in these evenly divided systems – because you’re obsessed with having a majority and your majority passing a bill that your party gets credit for.
“I’m going to try a different approach: The approach I took at the city of Detroit and City Council, where I sat down with Council, people had their own opinions, and I said, we’re going to agree on principles that apply to all of us.
“I laid out a set of principles for the schools that said let’s put $4.5 billion in the schools without raising taxes, let’s have a clear reading curriculum, let’s build the CTE program, and let’s hold principals and superintendents accountable for performance.
“I think most people in the two parties can agree to that. Now, there’s people on one extreme that say you shouldn’t have to have accountability in schools, and people on the other extreme that says you ought to have vouchers. But I think most people in this state would say put money in the school system, teach the kids to read, give us CTE options that are real and hold them accountable.
“That’s what I believe. And I think I can forge a coalition in the middle of Republicans and Democrats who say this is the Michigan solution, it’s not a Democratic or a Republican solution.”
 
You’ve talked about the purpose of the campaign being to take on a broken system. Why run for governor rather than, say, a ballot proposal to literally change the system?
“Well, we had a ballot proposal, right? We eliminated gerrymandering, and now you have an evenly divided Legislature – which is the state, it actually reflects the state. It had an unintended consequence that you have almost complete gridlock in the Legislature.
“I think what has been done at the legislative level, or the ballot proposal level, has been done. I think you have to have a change in politics.
“If you watch what happened in Detroit when I ran in 2013, the definition of politics in Detroit was us versus them. It was Black versus white, city versus suburbs, city versus Lansing. And people thought that a white guy in an 83% Black city would never have a chance to be elected.
“But the people of Detroit have overwhelmingly supported me, because there were things more important to them in terms of common values and common strategies.
“I think with what’s happened in the city of Detroit, by people pulling together, not only have I done well, our City Council is at a 60% approval rating. You don’t see that in other cities. Our legislative branch found that a consistent plan that delivered results was good for them as well as good for the mayor.”
 
You’ve argued that people are tired of Democrats versus Republicans. Why is Democrats versus Republicans versus Mike Duggan preferable?
“We’re going to get a chance to see, but just look at the toxic ads that you have. The Gallup polls show we’re down to 27% of Americans who consider themselves Democrats, all time low, 27% Republicans, all time low, 43% independents, all time high.
“But the campaign managers know that you’re starting out with only a 27% base. The way they get from 27% to 51% isn’t to explain their affordable housing plan, it’s demonize the other person.
“I showed the ad calling people pedophile protectors and insane and the ads that people are running. They run the ads because all you have to do is demonize the other party to 51%.
“If I’m in the race, you can’t just demonize the Republicans or Democrats. You’re going to have to actually say what you’re for, and it is going to be a very different dynamic.
“I think there are a handful of congressional people who have already figured this out and are figuring out ‘okay, this guy’s going to get 30-40% of the vote as an independent, I’m going to need his independent voters to vote for me in a U.S. Senate race or in a Congressional race.’
“You’re going to start to see, I believe, other candidates modify their positions to talk about what they’re for in order to get elected. At least that’s what I’m hoping to do, because I’m running to change the system.”
 
Does running as an independent force you to spend more time convincing people that you are a viable candidate rather than being able to talk about those issues?
“For sure it does. But I lived this once already.
“If you had been in the living rooms with me when I ran for mayor, and people would show up and say, I like you, but there’s no way a white guy can win an 83% Black city, and then after a couple months, they saw me the second and third time, and some of their friends are saying, I’m looking at this guy, and they said, maybe he can. And by the time we were done, I carried 92% of the precincts.
“But what you’re saying is absolutely right. It wasn’t the first time, it wasn’t the second time, but I’m seeing the same thing here. People are showing up in large numbers, mainly out of curiosity to hear the independent guy.
“I was in Lexington last Tuesday, town of 1,000 people; 100 people showed up and spent an hour and a half with me. At some point, I said to them, how many of you would have showed up if I were running as a Democrat? Half the hands in the room went up, and then everybody started laughing.
“There is something about this independent candidacy that is getting people to come out and listen. But you’re right, I’ve got to convince them, once they hear, that an independent can win, and that’s what the campaign’s about.”
 
You’ve rejected a lot of the conventional wisdom about independent campaigns and have argued that the vast majority of people are ready for that independent change. If that’s not the challenge you face, what do you view as the biggest challenges to your campaign?
“The size of the state.
“In Detroit, I did 250 house parties. I was in every neighborhood, sitting in living rooms. Now I’m going to a farm in Saginaw County, I’m in a house in Ottawa, I’m up at a bar in New Baltimore. I’m enjoying it, but it’s a bigger state. I’m going to have to spend a lot of time going to every corner of it. The challenge is just the physical geography of the state.
“The folks in New Baltimore, a whole crowd of people, and after an hour, somebody raises their hand and asks, ‘why isn’t everybody in this state going to vote for you?’ And if I have time to talk to them, I would win the vast majority of the state. But I need the time to talk.”
 
You mentioned Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has found exactly the right approach to dealing with President Donald Trump. You appeared at a number of Democratic campaign events in 2024, where we heard very dramatic rhetoric about the threat that he poses. Is there a mismatch between the rhetoric we heard on the campaign trail last year and this strategy now?
“That rhetoric didn’t come from me. And you can see the rhetoric didn’t work. Calling Trump a fascist was not a good campaign strategy. People wanted to know ‘what are you going to do?’
“I was mayor the first Trump term, I didn’t have any issues. We worked fine with the administration. I stayed out of the crossfire. I wasn’t one of the people who engaged in Twitter wars with the president to boost my Democratic status. It’s just not who I am.
“Ben Carson was the HUD Secretary under Trump. I had him to the house for dinner. He came from Detroit originally. I got funding for lead programs to take lead out of houses in Detroit in the first Trump administration.
“I’m the kind of person that says I don’t work for the Republicans or Democrats, I work for my residents in Detroit. Ultimately, I work for the people of Michigan. And I think Gretchen Whitmer has shown enormous courage in the last month. She knew she was going to take grief from the Democrats. But to save 5,000 jobs at Selfridge that she couldn’t get done under a Democratic president, it was remarkable what she accomplished.”
 
If you’re elected governor, would you have a PowerPoint for your State of the State?
“I’m not going to stand and read a teleprompter, I know that. I don’t know how to use a teleprompter. So yeah, I think you can assume it will be a PowerPoint. You’re the first person to ask me that. That’s funny.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0052-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:39:58.632206

“A year ago, I was ready to give up. Staff wouldn’t give up on me,” said one graduate, Rodney Davis. “I now have a life that has meaning,” including a supportive employer, a commercial driver’s license, and a future.
Drug court graduation is one of the most inspiring things I’ve witnessed in a courtroom. It also leaves me wanting more: more graduates, more success stories, more treatment programs across the state. Iowa could do much more to expand this alternative to prison.

Drug courts are reserved for defendants whose addictions lead to crime. They are at high risk of repeatedly stealing or committing other offenses to feed their habits.
Polk County created the state’s first adult criminal drug court in 1996, just seven years after the nation’s first drug court was established in Miami.
I attended my first drug court graduation in 1999. One of the graduates was a bear of a man who showed me a photo of his emaciated face when he was regularly using meth. He gushed about how the court had changed his life. It was the first time I’d ever seen a defendant hug a judge.
Such happy outcomes have been documented in multiple studies in Iowa and nationally. While results vary depending on many factors, graduates have lower rates of recidivism and substance use, and the treatment is far more cost-effective than incarceration, studies show.
An Iowa Department of Corrections study showed that every $1 spent on drug court returns a $9.61 benefit over a 10-year time frame.
Despite the results, funding has been inconsistent and depends on a mix of local support, state appropriations, and federal grants. “In general, Drug Courts have been left to their own means to fund and provide training to Drug Court Judges and staff, identify treatment providers, and otherwise enhance their programs,” according to a 2018 study of Iowa specialty courts by the National Center for State Courts.
Now that the Iowa Legislature has finally come up with a structure to spend opioid settlement money, expanding drug courts and other treatment programs should be on list of uses.
In Polk County, drug court graduations are held two or three times a year. Nine people is considered a large class; the graduation on June 13 occurred in the courtroom of the Drake Legal Clinic to accommodate the crowd.
Currently, 24 people are in the county’s drug court program, charged with crimes including theft, fraud, forgery, and burglary. Many more defendants qualify, if the program had more staff.
Drug court isn’t cheap, as it requires a judge, prosecutor, defense attorney, probation officer, coordinator, and support staff. But it’s generally a third of the cost, per participant, of prison.
The morning before the noon graduation on June 13, District Judge Jeffrey Ferrell presided over the regular routine of drug court. Defendants reported on their progress and gave updates on their work, community service, and treatment plans.
The reports went deeper than that, however, as the participants shared about larger issues they were confronting: past traumas, personality conflicts, relationship issues, and other root causes of their addictions.
The staff challenged the participants with some of the mantras of drug court:

“Own your mistakes.”
“All the truth, all the time.”
“Your worst day sober is better than your best day high.”

Later, participants listened to the graduates reinforce those lessons. The grads shared how they “learned to love myself” and “untangle the mess inside me.” They thanked their family, court officials, sponsors, therapists, and each other.
Graduate Jeremiah Bender summed up the goal: “Recovery isn’t just about staying clean, it’s about building a life worth living.”

To identify student work written by artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, many California colleges and universities rely on Turnitin, a plagiarism detection service. But the company’s tools aren’t always accurate, and when it falsely flags work done by humans as AI-generated, students are caught in the crossfire.
As CalMatters’ Tara García Mathewson explains, in 2025 California State University paid $163,000 to use Turnitin’s tool to identify AI-generated writing. Several University of California campuses spend more than $100,000 per year on the detector, while nearly three-quarters of California community colleges now use it. 
One of Turnitin’s biggest selling points is its robust repository of student writing, which it uses to train its detection tools. As of June 2025, the company reported having a database of 1.9 billion student papers. Turnitin licenses its technology to colleges under the requirement that the company gets to keep students’ writings in perpetuity.
Besides the privacy concerns that come with handing over students’ papers to a third party, tools marketed to identify AI-generated content also make mistakes. The Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, found that one in five students either were wrongly accused of using generative AI to cheat or knew someone who had been.
That’s what happened to Nilka Desiree Abbas in 2023. While taking a political science course at San Bernardino Valley College, Abbas received a zero on an assignment with a message from her professor saying she had used ChatGPT.

Abbas: “It took me so long to go back to school. To be falsely accused felt devastating.”

Though she ultimately passed the course, the incident rattled her: For her remaining classes, Abbas took photos as she worked on assignments for proof of her original work.

More on Turnitin: In reviewing purchasing records from 60 California institutions, Tara also found that Turnitin charged varying amounts for the same plagiarism-detection tools. In 2021, for example, UC Berkeley paid $2.11 per student for its Turnitin license, while UC Irvine’s Division of Continuing Education paid $6.50.

Budget negotiations continue

With less than a week before the fiscal year begins on July 1, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-controlled Legislature are inching closer to a budget agreement that seeks to plug the state’s $12 billion budget hole, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Both parties reached a tentative deal Tuesday, though negotiations are ongoing as lawmakers iron out the final details of the $321 billion spending plan. Newsom, for example, is calling for a provision that would speed up housing development near public transit, but the proposal is facing pushback in the state Senate.
The draft deal rejects some of Newsom’s proposed cuts, including reinstating a Medi-Cal asset limit that would have disqualified thousands of existing enrollees who are elderly or disabled. But it does retain some of Newsom’s other plans, such as freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for adults who do not have legal status. Legislators also successfully added one-time funding for the anti-crime measure Proposition 36.

Lawmakers, unions fight over construction wages

Speaking of the budget, a provision buried in the budget agreement could signal that lawmakers are nearing a deal that would set a new minimum wage rate for housing construction workers, report CalMatters’ Ben Christopher. 
If passed, the new rates would mark a turning point in a longstanding debate about “prevailing wages,” which has loomed over the legislative politics of California housing. These state-determined wages vary by occupation and location, and are generally comparable to union wages.
The proposal would carve out exceptions to California’s environmental laws to make it easier to construct certain housing projects, while putting forward a significantly lower, more developer-friendly alternative to the prevailing wage rate. Supporters of the deal say the new standards represent a wage increase since it applies to construction projects not currently covered by prevailing wages. 
But the influential State Building and Construction Trades Council slammed the proposal, calling it “harmful and unprecedented.” It argues that the arrangement would “devastate construction workers” by undercutting pay standards.

Ohio Republicans passed a $60 billion operating budget that includes tax cuts for the wealthy, funding for a new Cleveland Browns stadium, and restrictions on education. The GOP says it is a fiscally conservative and responsible budget. The Democrats say it is a budget for billionaires — not the working-class Ohioans.
In the dead of night, the Republicans on the Conference Committee approved a final budget. But while Ohioans were sleeping at 1 a.m. Wednesday morning — we were there. We only got the information less than an hour before the full Senate and House floor votes on Wednesday afternoon — the same as the Democrats. Even Republicans didn’t get the full language, many told us.




“Take care of all the major programs I think Ohioans expect us to do,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart (R-Ashville) said.




However, this was the first budget bill to not get a single Democratic vote since 2001.
“I cannot tell the people of Ohio that this is a budget that’s working for them,” The top Democrat on the Finance Committee, Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Westlake), said.
The final budget proposal ranges from changes to taxes, education, social services, health care and much more.
In the Senate, there was a 23-10 vote. Only state Sen. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) joined the Democrats to vote no.
In the House, it was 59-38. State Reps. Tim Barhorst (R-Fort Loramie), Levi Dean (R-Xenia), Ron Ferguson (R-Wintersville), Scott Oelslager (R-North Canton) and Michelle Teska (R-Clear Creek Township) joined the Democrats.
Income tax
They passed a 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
“We are making Ohio more competitive, more open for business,” Stewart said.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. This was made up by cutting social services and some tax exemptions. Sweeney said cuts came to public education.
Education
Public schools will face hundreds of millions of cuts from their expected budget, but the funding formula will stay intact for the most part.
“We’re underfunding our schools by at least a billion dollars,” Sweeney said.
Lawmakers would also be giving additional school funding to high-performing public school districts.
There is a cap on districts’ rainy day funds at 40% carryover from the previous revenue fund. This would mean that the schools would have to refund anything above that back to the taxpayer to provide property tax relief.
“We’re looking at more local control,” Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) said.
“How is it local control if we’re capping carryover at 40%?” I asked him.
“It’s the budget commission that is representing the people,” he responded, also adding that there are exceptions so that the districts can carry over more than 40%, as long as they are put in a capital fund instead of operating. However, schools are unable to move money back to the operating fund once they are in the capital.
The House wanted to cap the districts at 30% and the Senate 50%, which is why they settled in the middle.
If voters pass a school levy, the bill allows county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away, if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
The bill also eliminates levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it prohibits them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
It also prohibits a school district from submitting any current expense levy to voters if it has a general fund carry-over balance of more than 100% of general fund expenditures in the preceding fiscal year. It excludes renewal levies, though.
They kept the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, guaranteeing admission to a public university for each high school graduate in the top 10% of their graduating class. The students would also get $5,000 each year in financial aid.
However, the bill requires the student to sign a “statement of commitment” to stay in Ohio for three years after graduating.
They also give more than $30 million to five “intellectual diversity” centers at different public colleges across the state. These centers were created to combat what some consider liberal bias at universities.
The budget will provide about $2.5 billion over the biennium for the state’s voucher system — providing taxpayer dollars for students to attend nonpublic schools. This includes a new education savings account program, or ESAs, which is a way for families to get state money to purchase “educational goods and services,” including tuition at nonchartered, nonpublic schools.
This comes a day after a Franklin County court ruled Ohio’s EdChoice voucher program to be unconstitutional.
Property taxes
The restrictions on levies and carryover caps in the education budget are meant to give relief to property taxpayers. District cash carryovers have increased year-over-year from $3.6 billion to $10.5 billion since tracking began in 2012, the GOP reported.
The bill also allows the boards of county commissioners to provide up to a 2.5% owner-occupancy tax credit and a permissive homestead exemption for those who qualify.
Cleveland Browns
The Browns will be getting $600 million for their new Brook Park stadium. The budget calls for the state to take legal ownership of $1.7 billion in unclaimed funds, setting a clock on how long people have to file claims and get reunited with their missing money.
That’s a major change for Ohio, which currently holds unclaimed funds in perpetuity. The budget proposal would give people a decade to claim their money before it becomes the state’s property. Lawmakers want to grab $1.7 billion out of Ohio’s $4.8 billion pool of unclaimed funds right away – and then continue taking money on a rolling basis, after a decade of holding it.
A last-minute amendment to the compromise budget bill, released late Tuesday, would change a state law designed to make it harder for pro sports teams to leave publicly subsidized facilities, clearing a significant obstacle from the Browns’ road to Brook Park.
The new language says the so-called Modell law, designed to prevent major sports teams from pulling up stakes, would only come into play if a team chose to leave the state.
The proposed changes to the law are likely to end a court battle that’s just getting started and take leverage away from the City of Cleveland, which is fighting to keep the Browns on the lakefront or negotiate a better exit deal if the team leaves.
Pensions
First reported by us on Tuesday, state lawmakers chose to remove the majority of educators’ voices from the state’s retired teachers’ pension fund board.
Amid legislators’ concerns of an alleged corruption scheme threatening the fund, they have decided to reduce the number of elected positions and add more political appointments.
A provision in the bill would change the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers—five contributing and two retired—to three elected after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for actives and only one retiree seat. Each elected member will be able to finish their term, but once their term is out, four of the seven seats will not be refilled.
Those four removed educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members. Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
“The state legislature established these pension systems and has an ongoing responsibility to ensure the long-term health of the fund for retired and active teachers,” Provision Proposer State Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond) exclusively told me Tuesday. “The ongoing turmoil has clarified the need for the General Assembly to rebalance the Board composition.”
Health and child care
Numerous changes to Medicaid could put hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at risk of losing health insurance. The legislators also restricted access to Medicaid for babies.
The lawmakers funded a Child Care Choice program, which would provide millions for eligible families to cover child care services. There is also money going toward eyesight programs and families with children with disabilities.
The budget also cut DeWine’s proposed pediatric cancer research funding by half.
Miscellanous
Other provisions in the massive budget bill have nothing to do with spending, including:

Prohibiting SNAP for “sugar-sweetened beverages”
Requiring public libraries to place books related to sexual orientation or gender in an area away from the public
Adding more reporting requirements for abortion
Enshrining into state law that there are only two sexes
Stops funding for both youth homeless shelters and mental health services that support transgender or nonbinary identities
An ability to lock lost or stolen EBT cards

“At the end of the day, we have to remember that budgets are about choices,” Sweeney said. “We were elected to make choices for the people of Ohio, and we believe that this budget is making the wrong choices.”
Next steps
Since both the House and the Senate passed the bill, it will be sent to the governor’s desk. DeWine will decide which provisions to line-item veto.
Line-item vetoing is the ability for the governor to pick and choose which policies within a larger piece of legislation get to stay or must go.
In the past operating budget, he issued about 40.
We will continue breaking down what is in the 6,000-page bill in the coming days.

That was the main message Wednesday for an online presentation featuring top executives from four organizations that have membership straddling the border. The presentation came just days before the teams face a deadline from Kansas on its proposal to build new stadiums for both teams.
“We get this question a lot,” said Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. “Does the regional business and civic community have a preference for which side of the state line or which specific location the teams land? No. As long as the teams land within the KC region, we’re going to support their decision, full stop.”
The presentation focused on how Kansas City competes with other metro areas. At no point during the debates in Kansas or Missouri over public financing for stadiums has either team said it was considering moving out of the region.
Such a move would require the concurrence of other team owners. No city or state other than Missouri and Kansas have made public overtures to the teams.
The sentiment that the state line was the smallest consideration for Kansas City businesses was echoed by the other participants, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, which hosted the presentation, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City and the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation.
“The more that we can stand united as one KC, and understand that our competition are those other regions that want the assets we have or are competing to attract what we want to get as well, I think we’re going to be stronger and we’re going to win,” said Joe Reardon, CEO of the Kansas City chamber.
Missouri lawmakers this month approved a plan to finance up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, committing almost $1.5 billion in future tax revenue. The current facilities, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, were opened in the early 1970s and almost all other stadiums built near that time are no longer in use, Reardon noted in the presentation.
Kansas, under a plan approved last year by the Kansas Legislature, is offering to pay up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums if the teams cross the state border.
During the debates in both states, the focus was on winning the “border war”.
For Missouri, the loss of either team would mean another major league team leaving the state. St. Louis lost the NFL’s Rams in 2015, the football Cardinals in 1987 and the NBA’s Hawks in 1968. Kansas City lost Major League Baseball’s Athletics in 1967 and the Kings NBA franchise in 1985.
Kansas City is the smallest market that has both an NFL team and a Major League Baseball team.
For Kansas, it would be the first time a team from the NFL or Major League Baseball called the state its home.
“Our competition is not in Missouri or Kansas, it’s outside the region,” Cowden said. “We need to keep them at bay at arm’s length. This is not, in our opinion, about a border war. It truly is about a border solution.”
The success of Kansas City sports teams, especially the Chiefs, has raised the national and international profile of the region, said Kathy Nelson of the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation and Visit KC.
“They are opening doors to businesses like we never heard,” she said.
The Chiefs have played in five of the six most recent Super Bowls. The 2025 game had a national audience of 127 million and international audience estimated at 62 million. The romance between Taylor Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has also boosted the city’s profile, she said.
The Royals made the playoffs last year for the first time since winning the World Series in 2015. They have a more regional audience, she said, with 80% of game attendees living within 75 miles of downtown Kansas City.
“Nothing else puts us on a global stage like our sports teams,” Nelson said. “There’s nothing else like this.”

,California,2025-06-26 12:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,California colleges spend millions to catch plagiarism and AI. Is the faulty tech worth it?,Tara García Mathewson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/ai-detector/,Colleges and universities renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year even though its flawed detectors are expensive and require students to let the company keep their papers forever.,"In summary
Colleges and universities renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year even though its flawed detectors are expensive and require students to let the company keep their papers forever.


It has been more than two years since the release of ChatGPT created widespread dismay over generative AI’s threat to academic integrity. Why would students write anything themselves, instructors wondered, if a chatbot could do it for them? Indeed, many students have taken the bait, if not to write entire essays, then certainly to draft an outline, refine their ideas or clean up their writing before submitting it.
And as faculty members grapple with what this means for grading, tech companies have proved yet again that there’s money to be made from panic. Turnitin, a longtime leader in the plagiarism-detection market, released a new tool within six months of ChatGPT’s debut to identify AI-generated writing in students’ assignments. In 2025 alone, records show the California State University system collectively paid an extra $163,000 for it, pushing total spending this year to over $1.1 million. Most of these campuses have licensed Turnitin’s plagiarism detector since 2014.
That detector first became popular among professors when the internet made it easy for students to copy and paste information from websites into their assignments. In the AI detector, faculty members sought both a way to discourage students from using ChatGPT on their homework and a way to identify the AI-generated writing when they saw it.  
But the technology offers only a shadow of accurate detection: It highlights any matching text, whether properly cited or not; it flags everything that mirrors AI’s writing style, whether a student used AI inappropriately or not. And Turnitin licenses this technology to colleges while demanding “perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable and sublicensable” rights to student writing. The company has used these rights to build a massive database of student papers, which it uses to market the superiority of its existing products as well as build new ones, including the AI detector. Turnitin has become so valuable that in 2019 Advance Publications paid $1.75 billion to acquire it, more than the total amount raised by all ed-tech startups the prior year, EdSurge noted at the time.
To understand the full range of consequences stemming from Turnitin’s place in higher education, CalMatters and The Markup interviewed dozens of students, faculty members and administrators across the state and obtained Turnitin purchase orders documenting the amount paid over time by approximately 60 colleges there. This investigation revealed institutions willing to renew Turnitin subscriptions year after year despite the cost, faulty technology and concerns about privacy and intellectual property raised by the company’s ever-expanding database of papers.
Turnitin tries to make the gray area of academic dishonesty into something black-and-white, and many faculty members drive demand, searching for the promise of algorithmic accuracy. But honest students are caught in the crossfire of an arms race between technology that mimics human speech and technology that claims to identify it.
The rise of Turnitin
In 2004 Wendy Brill-Wynkoop, a photography professor at College of the Canyons, chaired her campus’s technology committee. She became one of the first Turnitin users at the large community college north of Los Angeles, testing out the software before campuswide adoption. Purchasing records obtained by CalMatters and The Markup show Brill-Wynkoop’s license cost just $120 in 2004. The following year, College of the Canyons paid 75 cents per student and less than $6,500 total to make the tool available to all faculty members for as many papers as they wanted to scan. This year, the college paid almost $47,000.
As teaching and learning increasingly shifted online throughout the early 2000s and 2010s, Turnitin became more embedded in classes. College of the Canyons, like many institutions, paid extra to integrate the plagiarism checker into its online learning management system, where faculty members had begun to post assignments and reading materials and students were expected to submit their papers. Turnitin’s default settings, once integrated, are to scan every assignment, not just those that professors suspect are plagiarized. Besides accelerating the growth of the company’s student-paper database, this puts the tool in front of faculty members who otherwise wouldn’t have used it.

In fact, Brill-Wynkoop had largely stopped using Turnitin to check student work after a few years. “If I had a student who I suspected wasn’t using their own words, I’d pop the phrase into Google and then could just show them,” she said. “I wouldn’t have gone back to [Turnitin].” But since her college built it into the system she was already using to read student papers, she found herself checking the automated reports again.
When the pandemic shut down in-person instruction on campuses nationwide in 2020, fresh anxiety over academic integrity created another windfall for Turnitin. The GovSpend database of government-purchasing records shows a nationwide spike in Turnitin contracts during the 2020-21 school year. And in California, at least, many colleges processed more cheating accusations that year, too, according to academic dishonesty case counts obtained by The Markup and CalMatters via public-records requests. Those case counts dropped — sometimes precipitously — with the return to in-person learning but climbed again when the release of ChatGPT gave Turnitin its next crisis to monetize.
This year’s $47,000 contract with Turnitin for plagiarism and AI detection pushed the total spent by College of the Canyons to over half a million dollars.
Turnitin executives did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Worldwide, the company licenses its software to more than 16,000 institutions that cumulatively enroll over 71 million students. Almost three-quarters of California community colleges now use it, as does the entire California State University system, except Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Cal Poly canceled its contract last year saying not enough faculty used Turnitin to justify the cost, but not before it spent $171,000 on the detectors from 2020 to 2024. Cal State campuses have spent a combined $6 million on Turnitin since 2019 alone, according to records obtained by CalMatters and The Markup. Several University of California campuses spend more than $100,000 per year on the detector, which Turnitin licenses for a per-student fee.
As part of this investigation, CalMatters and The Markup tracked down more than $15 million in purchases of Turnitin plagiarism-prevention software across 57 institutions. Of course, since California is home to 149 public colleges and universities, this amount represents just a fraction of the total spending statewide. And while College of the Canyons released 21 years of receipts, most campuses shared only three to seven.

Robbie Torney is the senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, a national nonprofit headquartered in San Francisco that does research and advocacy work around how young people use technology. He said $15 million is a lot of money to spend on a tool with such limited value. He pointed to troubling reports of Turnitin erroneously flagging student writing as AI-generated and equally troubling accounts of students using simple workarounds to undermine the AI detectors.
“It’s probably better to invest in training for professors and teachers,” Torney said, “and also creating some frameworks for universities to message to students how they can and can’t use AI, rather than trying to use a surveillance methodology to detect AI in student writing.”
Yet many faculty members still want the tool, and colleges have continued paying for it year after year. Records show the Los Rios Community College District, in the Sacramento area, has paid almost $750,000 since 2018 to license Turnitin’s antiplagiarism software. In the Los Angeles Community College District, this year’s license alone cost $265,000. And UC Berkeley is just a few years into a 10-year, nearly $1.2-million contract of its own.
Amassing student papers
Turnitin helps convince college leaders to buy its tools by arguing it knows student writing better than any other company in the world. It has been making this case for decades by pointing to the size of its database, regularly updating its website with the latest student-paper count — 1.9 billion as of June 2025.
Brill-Wynkoop heard the same pitch back in the early 2000s: Instructors could catch a student turning in a peer’s paper from a previous semester with Turnitin. But the company doesn’t need to keep papers for decades to accomplish this.
The Community College League of California signed an agreement in 2016 with a company called VeriCite, locking in pricing for any of the state’s 116 community colleges that wanted its plagiarism-prevention software. VeriCite also claimed to help colleges catch students turning in their peers’ papers. But the tool only made student papers searchable to faculty members on campuses covered by the contract, and it gave them a chance to opt out of letting VeriCite pool their students’ work. The company claimed no rights to student intellectual property or copyright over their work.
After Turnitin bought the company in 2018, a new set of terms and conditions took effect: Now student papers go into Turnitin’s global database and the company maintains a perpetual, royalty-free license over all of them.
When Turnitin acquired another plagiarism-detection company, Unicheck, in 2020, the El Camino College student newspaper reported that the institution switched vendors rather than put up with Turnitin’s contract terms. Still, the vast majority of colleges and universities across California continue to hand over student writing to Turnitin in the name of plagiarism prevention.

Jesse Stommel, an associate professor at the University of Denver, started speaking out about the company’s database of student papers in 2011, when he discovered his dissertation was in it. As a writing instructor, he takes issue with schools unquestioningly handing over original student work to a for-profit company.
In his syllabus, where the university requires him to include a statement about Turnitin, Stommel tells students, “It is my commitment to you that I will not submit any of your work to Turnitin. Plagiarism-detection software like Turnitin monetizes student intellectual property and contributes to a culture of suspicion in education. I trust you. I trust that your work is your own.” He then encourages students to ask him if they have questions about how to properly cite sources and directs them to an essay he co-wrote if they want to learn more about Turnitin or how to protect their intellectual property.
Students have protested Turnitin use too. An undergrad at McGill University, in Canada, failed multiple assignments in 2003 after refusing to submit them to Turnitin. He appealed to the university administration, ultimately winning the right to have his papers graded without the technology.
In 2007, high schoolers in Virginia and Arizona sued iParadigms, Turnitin’s parent company at the time, arguing that its database violated their copyright over their own writing. The courts disagreed. The students also lost on appeal, but some colleges still warn their faculty against using free online plagiarism checkers because of privacy concerns inherent in handing student work over to third-party companies.
Turnitin says it doesn’t “monetize” student writing, per se, but it has raised its prices since releasing an AI detector, which the company developed using that writing.
Brill-Wynkoop said she and her colleagues never thought that the student-paper database could one day become a source of profit for Turnitin. “That makes me feel bad as a faculty member, that I encouraged my students to use something, and now, I don’t know,” she said. “None of us thought about big data and how it would be used in the future.”
‘Caught in the middle’
For today’s undergraduates, routine surveillance and violations of privacy are an unavoidable part of college life. Emily Ibarra, who just finished her second year at Cal State Northridge, said she has never even used ChatGPT. Yet, like all students on her campus and many millions more across the country, she has to deal with the consequences of widespread suspicion about her generation’s integrity.
“That culture is getting normalized here, of professors being able to take the furthest lengths possible to make sure [students aren’t cheating],” she said. “It kind of makes you feel defeated before you even start.” 
When Ibarra started college, she panicked at the sight of her first Turnitin “similarity report.” Some faculty members let students see the reports as soon as they turn in their assignments, while others show students the reports only if they want to discuss a problem.

“At first I didn’t know what it was,” Ibarra said. “It shows green, yellow, red, so at first I thought it was grading the quality of my writing.” On a short assignment, she said, it’s almost impossible to avoid a “yellow” report because Turnitin’s text-matching scanners will flag quoted material and suggest it could be plagiarized. So far, none of Ibarra’s professors have accused her of academic dishonesty, but the risk, she said — even if she doesn’t intentionally plagiarize or use ChatGPT — is “really stressful.”
Ibarra has a tool called Grammarly installed on her computer that she has been using since high school to catch spelling and grammar mistakes; only now, she said, some professors at Cal State Northridge tell students not to even use spell-check tools because they’re bolstered by AI. Microsoft Word, Google Docs and Grammarly now all rely on the same algorithms that create ChatGPT’s human-sounding responses to suggest improvements to users’ writing. Ibarra says she uses Grammarly only to correct misspellings and missed commas, but, like other students interviewed for this story, she isn’t always sure when appropriate use of ubiquitous technology veers into academic dishonesty.
Joshua Hurst, who just finished his junior year at Cal State Northridge, said Turnitin flagged his writing in the spring of 2024. He hadn’t used ChatGPT to craft the assignment, but he had used Grammarly to clean up his writing before turning it in. His professor didn’t dock his grade, but Hurst knows other professors might have. Now he runs his writing through two different checkers before submitting anything.
Hurst is excited about AI-driven innovation and is glad to be part of a generation that gets to experience it, but the lack of consensus over acceptable AI use and the threats posed by faulty detectors make him shake his head.
“Students,” he said, “are the ones who are caught in the middle.”
The Center for Democracy & Technology, a D.C.-based nonprofit focused on research and advocacy around digital rights, surveyed high schoolers about their experiences with a range of educational technologies last summer. At the request of The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, researchers asked students whether they or anyone they know had been wrongly accused of using generative AI to cheat. One in five said yes.
When Common Sense Media surveyed a nationally representative group of teenagers about their AI use last year, it found that Black teens were twice as likely as white and Latino teens to say their teachers had flagged their work as AI-generated when it wasn’t. In their report about the survey, researchers attributed this difference, in part, to teachers’ bias. Black students have long been disciplined at far higher rates than their peers. 
Other researchers have pointed to the vulnerability of non-native English speakers subjected to these detectors because their writing is likely to use simpler syntax and a more limited vocabulary, which happens to be typical of AI-generated writing.
Nilka Desiree Abbas suspects that’s why she was accused in the summer of 2023. A native Spanish speaker, she was taking a political science course at San Bernardino Valley College and got a zero on an assignment along with a curt message from her professor saying she had used ChatGPT. But Abbas, who is from Puerto Rico, said she hadn’t.
“It took me so long to go back to school,” she said with a toddler at her side. “To be falsely accused felt devastating.” She ultimately passed the class with a B and graduated with a degree in administration of justice the following spring, but she was shaken. She took photos of her progress on assignments in her remaining courses to create an evidence trail of original work.
Turnitin has since fine-tuned its detector to avoid accusing non-native English speakers more often than native English speakers, but it acknowledges its detector still gets it wrong sometimes. And stories like Abbas’s have saturated Reddit communities and TikTok feeds, creating anxiety even among students who don’t think they cross any academic integrity lines while completing their assignments.
CalMatters and The Markup spoke with more than a dozen current undergrads, and virtually all of them described strategies to reduce the likelihood of being wrongly accused. A freshman said she adds typos to her writing to distinguish it from AI’s. Many students said they check their papers with Turnitin before submitting them, when professors allow it, and with additional online detectors for good measure. This step has become a form of due diligence for students, most of whom describe at least some level of concern that they could be accused without having done anything wrong.
Jasmine Ruys, who oversees student conduct cases at College of the Canyons, said she often sees students who think they were wrongly accused but unwittingly used AI.
“There are students who go to other colleges where that college purchases Grammarly, the pro version, installs it on their computers to help them and when they turn it in to our instructors, it gets caught by the AI detector,” Ruys said. “It’s hard because students think they’re doing the right thing and they’re getting caught up in it because [AI] is just embedded in everything.”
The illusion of a solution
Turnitin’s original text-matching software wasn’t especially sophisticated at detecting actual plagiarism, but at least it could point to the original source behind its accusations, and a faculty member had something to assess; they could ignore the text Turnitin highlighted because students were quoting reading material or citing an appropriate source. The AI detector determines what portion of an assignment was probably generated by AI but leaves it to faculty members to puzzle through whether that AI-like text represents a violation of academic integrity.
Adam Kaiserman has taught English at College of the Canyons for more than a decade. Unlike some of his colleagues who forgo Turnitin’s technology, he looks closely at the software’s similarity reports. And while he said he plans to keep using the tool, he didn’t describe it as very helpful. Student habits have shifted. Both Kaiserman and Ruys said they almost never see traditional plagiarism in Turnitin’s text matches anymore; students who are inclined to cut corners will just use AI chatbots instead. And the software misses much of the AI-generated writing it scans, in part because Turnitin has become more conservative about what it flags to avoid accusing honest students. The software also doesn’t scan for content accuracy, leaving a key tell of AI writing undetected.

“The biggest tipoff [of AI use] are fake quotes or hallucinations, which Turnitin isn’t good at catching,” Kaiserman said. When a paper mentions a person who doesn’t exist or a quote that never appeared in the reading, what many refer to as “hallucinations,” Turnitin has no idea. It just measures how much the writing mirrors the style of AI-written text.
While many students are as honest as ever, plenty have started to use AI. They describe using ChatGPT on assignments they don’t care about, reserving their full effort for papers they see as a higher priority. Sometimes they outsource deeper thinking and planning to AI when they are stumped by a blank page and want help with how to write an introduction or structure a paper. In the Common Sense Media survey, 63% of teens said they had used a chatbot or text generator for school assignments.
Now, many colleges make chatbots available to students for free, driving even wider use. A survey of undergraduates in the United Kingdom this past December found 88% had used AI on assignments, mostly to explain concepts, summarize content and suggest research ideas, but 18% of those surveyed said they had submitted work that included some AI-generated text.
At College of the Canyons, Ruys has found that when students do use a chatbot to complete a paper, it’s usually because they had too much on their plate with school, they were preoccupied with work or family commitments or they didn’t understand the assignment. Instead of going to their professors, they went to AI. During academic-dishonesty hearings, she guides students to campus resources that can help them better manage their workloads. But she considers a lot of AI use to be in an ethical gray area, including when students write a first draft themselves and then polish it with an AI tool.
“Isn’t that very similar to our tutors?” Ruys mused.
Administrators from the California State University Office of the Chancellor, Cal State Northridge and the Los Angeles Community College District, all of whom occasionally teach, said they don’t use Turnitin in their own courses, even if they defend their institutions’ software licenses more broadly. Stanford University doesn’t license the technology at all, advising its faculty that the tools can erode feelings of trust and belonging among students and raise questions about their privacy and intellectual-property rights. 
Stommel, the University of Denver professor, said faculty members often believe cheating is on the rise and that detectors are one of the only ways to keep students honest. But he shares evidence that cheating rates have long remained largely flat, even post-ChatGPT. He also pans the use of Turnitin as a scare tactic. “We see this with the criminal-justice system,” he said. “Deterrence doesn’t actually work.” What does work, he argues, is building trusting relationships with students. “Turnitin immediately fractures that relationship with students.”
Sean Michael Morris, a frequent co-author of Stommel’s and a longtime educator, also tries to convince faculty members they don’t need Turnitin despite the company’s marketing, which champions its value to academic integrity.
“Ed tech does a good job of convincing you that it is huge, permanent, there, 100% necessary for education,” he said. “That’s its big lie.”

A shortage of court reporters is leaving many Califonians with no way to appeal their cases in the justice system. Will a new union-backed bill solve the problem or make it worse?


Ashley Paschen believed she had a strong case as she sought a restraining order against her ex-husband.
She alleges she had proof he hurt her, and she had “nanny camera” footage that she alleges showed him beating her stepson. But a San Diego County court commissioner refused to admit the video footage as evidence and ruled that her abuse claims weren’t credible. 
She wanted to appeal the decision, but no attorney would represent her because no one transcribed her court hearings. Court reporters simply weren’t available for all of her court dates. Without a written record “it makes it virtually impossible to win an appeal,” one attorney told her.
It’s a common occurrence in California. Since 2023, more than 1.7 million family law, restraining order, probate and other civil proceedings have had no written transcriptions, according to the Judicial Branch of California. 
That’s because there’s a statewide shortage of certified court reporters. When no reporters are available, state law, with a few exceptions, bans recording in courtrooms, even though many courts have recording devices. Having a recording would give parties in a legal dispute the option of later having a hearing transcribed by a certified professional. 
“It’s absolutely outraging (if) it’s that easy to, you know, flip a switch and be able to record,”  Paschen said. 
Nonprofit legal aid groups filed a petition late last year urging the California Supreme Court to overturn a ban on recording cases such as Paschen’s.
The petitioners argue that Californians’ constitutional rights to appeal are being violated, and the ban on recording in courtrooms creates a “two-tiered” system of justice. Wealthy litigants, the petitioners say, have the option of hiring private court reporters to sit in on their hearings and type up a written record. But people who can’t afford the more than $3,000 a day to hire a contract reporter are at the mercy of an understaffed court system.
Most states and the federal courts use recording technology more than California does, some exclusively in lieu of court reporters. Only Texas and New York restrict the technology to the extent California does, according to the Judicial Council of California.
Now, with the state Supreme Court’s ruling pending, the unions representing court reporters have urged the court to uphold the recording  ban. At the same time, the union is pushing for legislation that will temporarily allow recording in cases like Paschen’s. If it passes, it could conflict with the court’s decision.
And critics say the union’s bill might make the problem worse.
Influential SEIU pushes for bill
San Mateo Democratic Assemblymember Diane Papan’s Assembly Bill 882 would lift the ban on recording in civil cases for three years to give the courts time to hire more reporters and ease the shortage.
“This bill is about access to justice,” Papan told her colleagues on the Assembly floor early this month. “It will ensure that a record of civil proceedings is available when a litigant cannot afford to hire a court reporter.” 
Papan didn’t return interview requests; neither did a lobbying representative for the most influential labor organization behind the bill, Service Employees International Union. SEIU has donated at least $62,300 to Papan since 2021, according to the CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.
Critics say unions put so many restrictions into Papan’s measure that it doesn’t go nearly far enough to solve the problem – and could even make it harder to turn on a recorder inside a courtroom. 
The proposal would require parties in a case who cannot afford to retain a private court reporter to request in writing a recording at least a day before a hearing, an option that those without an attorney are unlikely to know about. 
Court reporters also could turn down an assignment in another courtroom, even if it’s in the same building. For instance, a court reporter stationed in a family courtroom would not be required to cover a felony criminal trial, even if the lack of a court reporter would cause the case to be dismissed.

Earlier versions of the bill, which easily passed the Assembly this month, had more restrictions, including prohibiting courts from buying or leasing recording equipment.
Unions that represent court reporters that got the ban on court recording passed in the first place have fought previous legislative efforts to expand use of the technology. In 2023, the unions succeeded in killing the bill which would have allowed recording in all civil proceedings. 
Had it passed, the legal aid groups wouldn’t have needed to ask the California Supreme Court to decide the matter. In a brief opposing the pending Supreme Court case, SEIU and other court reporter unions argued the Supreme Court wasn’t the appropriate venue and that the Legislature and trial courts are working to solve the problem.
The court reporter dispute is the latest example of the political power labor unions wield in the Legislature. 
As CalMatters has reported, organized labor, which represents around one-sixth of the state’s workforce, regularly gets its way on bills at higher rates than other prolific lobbying groups, due in part to the massive political spending by unions. 
SEIU is one of the most politically influential unions. Since 2015, SEIU and its affiliates have donated at least $20.6 million to members of the Legislature, according to the Digital Democracy database.
“The union representing court reporters has been a particularly effective union in protecting their interests,” said Clark Kelso, a professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law.
Despite good pay, positions go unfilled
Court reporters argue that because they guarantee that their transcriptions are 100% accurate, they’re the only method of ensuring no one loses a case because something said during a hearing is written down wrong.
Court reporters can ask a witness to speak up, slow down or repeat their words if they’re hard to understand. Without human beings doing that, transcriptions can end up incomplete or inaccurate, the bill’s proponents say. 
“The state of California demands justice be fair and accurate,” Stacy Gaskill, a court reporter from San Mateo County, told the Assembly Judiciary Committee in April. “That can only be met if court records are verbatim and complete.” She said court reporters are held to such high standards they can be charged with a crime for certifying inaccurate transcripts.  
While most agree that human court reporters are the gold standard, those pushing for expanded recording in courtrooms argue that there aren’t enough new court reporters to offset the number of retiring workers – a problem causing ripple effects throughout the judicial system. Around 4,600 court reporters are licensed in California, most of them not court employees. That’s down from 7,500 in 2010. Around half of them were eligible for retirement in 2023, according to the last available statistic from the judicial branch.

The most serious cases, such as felony criminal proceedings, get priority for a court reporter, leaving other hearings without a written record on busy days. Almost all of California’s major civil cases go without one; more than half of all family law and probate cases have no reporter present, according to the judicial branch.
“The inability to create a verbatim record limits people’s ability to appeal significant and life-changing decisions regarding child custody, paternity, conservatorship assets, and more,” the judicial branch says on its website.
Legal organizations that filed the petition with the Supreme Court say it’s often not known whether reporters are available until the day of the hearing. This forces attorneys and their clients to decide to delay their cases or risk that they won’t need a written record during an appeal.
“Even when a continuance is a viable choice, it may be repeated, dragging out proceedings for many months or even years,” the aid group, BayLegal, wrote in the petition.
The shortage comes despite the Legislature’s approval of $30 million to lure new hires for the well-paying job. 
The median pay with benefits for a court reporter in California is more than $200,000, according to the judicial branch. Plus, by law, transcripts of hearings must be purchased from court reporters who get to keep the money. During the last fiscal year, California courts spent $23.7 million paying court reporters for transcripts, according to the judicial branch. 
But even with the job’s financial perks, courts are struggling to hire. Los Angeles Superior Court is offering a $50,000 signing bonus and $25,000 finder’s fee for court employees who refer a court reporter. Despite the incentives, L.A. County has 106 vacant court reporter positions, according to an online dashboard the superior court created to highlight the problem.
Hiring has stepped up statewide, but courts still need an estimated 428 new full-time court reporters to catch up, according to a statewide dashboard.  
Could AI replace court reporters?
It’s hardly surprising that courts are struggling to find enough reporters, said Lorin Kline, director of advocacy for the Legal Aid Association of California, one of the groups pushing for expanding the use of recordings in courtrooms.

Kline said court reporters are likely to make more money working as private contractors, and younger applicants may recognize that artificial intelligence transcription technology could replace their jobs in a few years. 
“Not only is it a profession with potentially a questionable future because of technology,” Kline said, “working in the court itself isn’t necessarily the first job that a court reporter wants to get because they can make more money working elsewhere.”
Neither the petition before the Supreme Court nor the bill to temporarily allow more recordings refer to AI transcription software. For now and the immediate future, to appeal a case, a transcript from a recorded hearing must be prepared by a pro. 
Some experts say AI is not the answer to the court reporter shortage — and will never be.
“Humans just do language imperfectly all the time and in unpredictable ways… and they make mistakes,” said Nicole Holliday, an associate professor of linguistics at UC Berkeley.  “But here’s where they have the edge over any automated system: They can pause and ask for clarifications. They can improve their training.”
She said AI transcription systems have been trained to transcribe speech based on how English is spoken by a subset of the population that’s typically white and wealthy. The software is not even close to accurate for the diverse accents spoken in America today, Holliday said.
Others see promise as the technology improves and if it’s deployed responsibly, including Camille Crittenden, executive director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute.
She called the technology “potentially transformative for the judicial system,” giving poor people the same access to justice while achieving “all kinds of cost savings.”
“I know that the union doesn’t want to hear that,” she said. “But for the courts overall, that would seem like a positive outcome.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10092023_CARE-Court_AH_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

Experts say companies often base their pricing on what they think colleges are willing to pay. 



If a California community college wants its faculty to be able to detect plagiarism and AI writing in student papers, it can buy software from a company called Turnitin at a discounted price. By banding together through the Community College League of California, each campus gets the purchasing power of the collective. Yet even though the league has more than four times as many colleges as the California State University system, its members pay more per student for Turnitin’s software.
And the Cal State system pays more than the University of California at Berkeley.
And UC Berkeley pays more than the City University of New York.
As part of an investigation into the consequences of this software’s use in higher education, CalMatters and The Markup collected purchasing records from approximately 60 California institutions as well as the CUNY system through public records requests. This investigation chronicles the dominance of Turnitin, which continues to collect millions of dollars every year from California colleges and universities despite its unsophisticated technology and its demand for a perpetual license to the student work it scans.
In reviewing records across California, CalMatters and The Markup also discovered wide variation in the amount Turnitin charged for its plagiarism-prevention tools, even when colleges were licensing the same product. While Turnitin did not respond to interview requests seeking information about its pricing strategy, experts said companies charge different amounts to different institutions based on how much they expect the institutions are willing to pay.
In 2020, Michel Davidoff retired as chief infrastructure officer in the California State University chancellor’s office, where he helped centralize technology purchases to secure huge discounts. When presented with the results of the CalMatters-Markup investigation into Turnitin pricing, Davidoff was not surprised. He said the size and reputation of an institution routinely sway the price of a given product.
“When Berkeley wants to negotiate pricing,” Davidoff said, “everyone wants the Berkeley logo on the website, knowing they bought it.”
Small colleges with little name recognition, then, get the worst deals. “They don’t have much money, they don’t have [many] students, and they’re paying the most,” he said.
The most extreme example of this variation came in records showing how much campuses paid during the 2021-22 school year. Turnitin had been flooded with customers the prior year when the Covid pandemic shut down campuses and instructors worried they couldn’t trust students at home. That year, UC Berkeley paid $2.11 per student for its Turnitin license. Cal State Long Beach and Antelope Valley College each paid $3.03 per student for the same product, records show. And the UC Irvine Division of Continuing Education paid more than double that, $6.50 per student.
Yet on the other side of the country, CUNY’s purchasing records show that the 200,000-student system got the best deal of all, paying just $1.79 per pupil for the same technology.

Davidoff, for his part, was pained to hear CUNY got a better deal than the Cal State system.
“CUNY? I’m crushed,” he said with a laugh.
Colleges tend to put out a “request for proposals” when they want to make institutional purchases. Companies then submit bids outlining the products they have, their capabilities, and the price. The Cal State system does not let companies charge significantly less than it costs to provide a product, but it otherwise encourages companies to give it the best deal they can.
The system last signed a contract with Turnitin in March of 2024, locking in the company’s basic plagiarism detector for $2.59 per student last year and $2.71 per student this year. For colleges to add the AI upgrade, Turnitin first offered institutions a total cost of $3.05 and $3.19 per student, respectively. Only six campuses took them up on the upgrade offer. But negotiations continued.
Leslie Kennedy, assistant vice chancellor of academic technology services for the Cal State Office of the Chancellor, reached out to her contact at Turnitin, saying there was demand for the detectors across the Cal State system, but that campuses couldn’t handle the cost.
“Turnitin came back to me and said, ‘We can give you better pricing if you buy for the whole system,’” Kennedy said. The company may have lost potential profits in discounting the AI detector for individual campuses, but it guaranteed itself more business. When Turnitin offered an additional 13% discount on top of the deal Cal State already had, Kennedy agreed to pay about $100,200 from her budget in the chancellor’s office to make it happen. And now 16 more campuses have access to the AI detector at a discounted price of $3.12 per student instead of $3.19.
Meanwhile, South Orange County Community College District is paying $3.57 per student for the same product this year.
While the per-student price for Turnitin sounds small, the cost adds up. The Cal State system has collectively spent over $6 million on this plagiarism-prevention technology in the last seven years. And UC Berkeley is in the middle of a 10-year, $1.2-million contract of its own.

,California,2025-06-26 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Congress is fighting over this tax deduction. Here’s how it affects Californians,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/06/salt-deduction-taxes-california/,"The House wants to raise the SALT deduction cap, which would help wealthy Californians pay less in federal taxes. The Senate wants to keep it where it is.","In summary
The House wants to raise the SALT deduction cap, which would help wealthy Californians pay less in federal taxes. The Senate wants to keep it where it is.


A provision in the Republicans’ tax and spending bill will help determine a limit on what high-income Californians can deduct on their taxes, but Congress disagrees on how much. 
After the passage of the 2017 tax bill during President Donald Trump’s first term, California taxpayers who itemize deductions saw their ability to deduct their full state and local income taxes and property taxes go away — to help the federal government pay for corporate tax cuts. The new cap that was established, $10,000, expires at the end of this year.   
Now the tax bill in the U.S. House of Representatives proposes raising the deduction’s cap to $40,000, though the U.S. Senate bill would keep the cap where it is. 
The debate over raising the so-called SALT (state and local taxes) deduction cap has been contentious. A higher cap would benefit high-income people who many experts say don’t need another tax break. But another part of the proposal would get rid of a workaround that individuals and small business owners have been using to reduce their personal income tax. 
Nikhita Airi, a research associate in the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, wrote in an analysis that raising the cap “would be expensive and deliver little benefit to most taxpayers.” Nationally, about 10% of taxpayers who itemize use the state and local tax deduction, she told CalMatters.
That number is higher In California, where about 2.8 million taxpayers, or 15% of those who filed taxes in the state, claimed the deduction in 2022, according to the most recent data available from the IRS. The highest percentage of those who used the deductions were in some of the wealthiest parts of the state, such as Marin, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, according to Airi’s analysis.  
While some experts agree with the sentiment that raising the cap would benefit mostly wealthy taxpayers, it would actually help “the working rich” in high-cost California, said Dennis Ventry, a professor at UC Davis School of Law who focuses on tax policy.
Ventry was referring to people whose annual income is between $250,000 and right under $500,000, who are likely to itemize their deductions. 
For example, raising the cap could mean California residents could deduct the full cost of their property taxes, he said. The median price of a home in the state is $900,000. Although it varies by county, the property tax for such a home would be about $9,000 annually. Raising the deduction cap would allow many homeowners to deduct their property taxes as well as other state and local taxes.
“That’s a big deal,” Ventry said. “Or it pays for your child care so your spouse can re-enter the workforce.”
The House proposal would allow the increased cap to apply to those with annual incomes of $500,000 or less. Taxpayers who make more would be subject to the $10,000 cap.
More than 20 California Democrats in the House, led by U.S. Reps. Dave Min of Costa Mesa, Zoe Lofgren of San Jose and Mike Thompson of Napa, actually pushed for no cap on the deduction. They wrote in a May letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith that the state’s taxpayers “pay more than their fair share of taxes to our nation and deserve tax relief in these difficult economic times.” 
Rep. Young Kim of Anaheim, a Republican member of Congress, was pushing for a $62,000 deduction limit, advocating for a higher cap along with her colleagues from other high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey. Kim represents parts of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where almost half of homes are worth more than $1 million.
It’s no surprise that the Senate kept the cap at $10,000. “There is no Republican senator from a high-tax state,” said Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at UC Berkeley. “If the Senate had a choice, it would not include this provision.”
Another part of the proposed tax bills would partly get rid of workarounds that certain taxpayers have been using: By paying state taxes through a business entity, owners can effectively bypass the federal deduction cap and count the payments toward their personal state income taxes.
Without the workaround, individuals and small businesses with incomes under $500,000 — such as doctors with private practices or lawyers or financial professionals with their own firms — could be subject to whatever deduction cap Congress eventually agrees on. But, as authors of an analysis by the Tax Law Center at the New York University School of Law wrote, the House bill included exceptions to shutting down the workaround, depending on the types of taxes being paid. 
Darien Shanske, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law who focuses on state and local taxation, said that the discussion about these tax proposals can “make it hard to give a straight answer… it clearly skews toward wealthier people.”
In the case of getting rid of the cap workaround, for example, Shanske said it would be more palatable if, say, “they were doing it to fund universal pre-K.” But he said “this is being done to retain low taxes on [big] corporations. You’re increasing taxes on smaller businesses. That’s problematic.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/040123-Tax-File-Preparation-PU-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420
,California,2025-06-26 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Much of LA’s  community of immigrants is hiding, leaving a hole in the fabric of the city",Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/los-angeles-undocumented-immigrants/,"Los Angeles’ large, productive, and now very afraid community of undocumented immigrants has slipped into the shadows. Here's how it hurts us all.","In immigrant-rich Westlake in Los Angeles, stores were empty Friday morning. The computer repair place was closed. 
Gates were down in front of a check-cashing operation. One of the area health clinics, where residents often line up for medical care, was open but without takers.
A block away, MacArthur Park still stirred with drug addicts and unhoused men. Police arrested two, cuffing them as the men stared into the distance. 
Around Los Angeles, flower sellers who congregate outside Forest Lawn were missing, buses were running half empty, car washes were closed. Parking lots at Home Depots and garden stores were suddenly noticeably vacant.
This is what happens when the federal government, against the wishes of those who live in a community, exercises its distant authority and imposes a solution Los Angeles residents don’t want. Confrontations in a small area of downtown escalated after the arrival of the National Guard and then of active-duty U.S. Marines. 
And Los Angeles’ large, productive, and now very afraid community of undocumented immigrants has slipped into the shadows. 
There are many misconceptions about immigrants in Los Angeles, but none more disorienting than the canard — so popular among Trump administration representatives — that those immigrants who arrived without papers somehow live apart from the rest of the city.
The role of these immigrants in the local economy is widely misunderstood and deliberately misrepresented. Undocumented immigrants do not work outside the larger economy; they are integrated into it, just as they are into every other aspect of life in California. 
When they are removed or are cowered into staying home, the effects touch everyone.
“The impact on the economy is broader,” said Saba Waheed, director of UCLA’s Labor Center. “They (federal authorities) are uprooting and interfering in the daily life of Los Angeles.
“You’re taking away part of our workforce. That is hurting LA more broadly.”
That’s in part because of the close integration of illegal immigrants into the broader economy, and not just in Los Angeles. In California, undocumented workers make up about a quarter of all farm laborers and construction workers.
When Arizona adopted anti-immigrant laws in the early 2000s, many undocumented residents, perhaps as many as 40%, left. The economy suffered. And unemployment for low-skilled white men increased, not decreased.
That makes perfect sense to all but the closed-minded or hard-hearted.

Whether here legally or illegally, these are working men and women. When they get paid, they spend that money on clothes and places to live, toys for their children, food and the stuff of life. That spending goes into the broader economy, supporting businesses that are owned and operated by legal residents. 
Restaurants and stores that depend on business from those in the country illegally suffer right along with those immigrants.
Trump supporters, starting with the president’s shrill emissary, Stephen Miller, like to counter with crocodile tears for illegal immigrants, who they suggest are an exploited class of workers, while simultaneously calling them an ominous criminal threat. 
And though it is certainly true that some undocumented residents are paid lower wages than citizens, many are not victims but have been comfortably working for years. Indeed, nearly 80% of those living illegally in this country have been working here for more than a decade.
Miller and his fellow travelers suggest that this is all a drag on the economy, a burdensome expense. But that, too, is false. 
In addition to the economic activity they generate, undocumented workers pay taxes — using taxpayer identification numbers, many pay federal income taxes. Others share housing, often with documented family members, and help pay property taxes. 

Many of these workers have Social Security money withdrawn from their paychecks but, since they are using fake Social Security numbers, they never get the benefits at the other end — which means they help prop up that system for others. 
And, of course, they pay sales taxes, which are especially vital to local governments. 
California’s undocumented workers contribute $23 billion a year in federal, state and local taxes. Their direct pay alone amounts to 5% of the state’s economy, a new study shows.
Pulling them out of the workforce, either to send them out of the country or chasing them indoors to avoid detection, hurts not just them. It hurts Los Angeles.
In fact, if deportation enthusiasts got their fondest wish, it would hurt the entire country.
One study concluded that if the government succeeds in deporting every person currently in the country illegally, it would result in a 1.4% drop in Gross Domestic Product in the first year, with losses rising thereafter. The economy would shed more than $5 trillion. 
Those are studies. And then there is life in the city. 
Los Angeles, like any city, would welcome the removal of dangerous people. But that’s not who’s being grabbed. Immigrants in the country illegally tend to be more law-abiding once here than native-born Americans.

Under Trump, more than 70% of those seized in these disruptive raids have no criminal record at all, and many more have only minor traffic or other offenses. All told, about 8% of those snatched by ICE in recent months have serious criminal histories. 
That means more than 9 out of 10 gave no evidence of being a threat. Removing them separates families, devastates businesses and damages the larger economy — with no corresponding benefit to the safety of this community. 
You don’t snag criminals by raiding car washes and Home Depot parking lots. Washington may not get that — or may not care. But Los Angeles does. 
If those who are behind the recent immigration raids imagined that they were excising an unwanted, detached community from the rest of Los Angeles, they badly miscalculated. Instead, this region has demonstrated resolve and solidarity in the face of a threat that is not just economic but cultural as well.

Churches with large immigrant congregations are advising their parishioners to stay home rather than expose themselves to ICE. Hotels and businesses are flying Mexican flags in solidarity with their workers. 
Activists and everyday people are refusing to cooperate when masked agents, who themselves refuse to provide identification, demand it of others, often merely because of their skin color. 
The city of Pasadena, hardly a hotbed of radicalism, cancelled summer swim and park programs last weekend for fear that ICE would use them to snag suspects. 
Those actions prove a point: These immigrants, however they arrived or whatever their legal status, are integral to this region’s economy and to its sense of self. 
These are our neighbors, our friends, the friends of our children, our coworkers. Forcibly removing them is bad for them, of course. It’s also bad for the rest of us.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/070119-Immigrant-Rights-Protest-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the changes could cause nearly 9 million Americans to lose health care coverage. That includes approximately 130,000 to 160,000 annually in Missouri, said Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president of health policy and advocacy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, during a news briefing on Wednesday.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” proposes individuals ages 19 to 64 would need to work at least 80 hours per month to be eligible for Medicaid coverage unless they qualify for an exemption. These exemptions include, but aren’t limited to, people with disabilities, people taking care of dependent children and people who are pregnant.
Atate Sen. Patty Lewis, a Kansas City Democrat, described the bill as “devastating.”
Missouri’s Medicaid program, known as MO HealthNet, currently serves approximately 1.25 million people. This includes 660,000 children, 109,000 seniors and 186,000 people with disabilities, according to a joint news release from Lewis and the Missouri Foundation of Health.
Missouri receives $12.7 billion in federal funds from the program, and nearly two-thirds of the state’s Medicaid budget is made up of federal funding. The bill being considered by Congress would also introduce new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and scale back federal funding by an estimated $1.3 trillion over the next decade.
“Patients going through cancer treatment, going through chemo and radiation, who are immunocompromised, could be forced to be out in the community, working when that would be ill advised by their health care providers,” Lewis said.
Missouri has already seen 21 hospital closures since 2014, and another 25 are currently at risk as the proposed legislation moves through Congress. Weisgrau said rural providers could lose up to 21 cents of every Medicaid dollar under the bill.
Weisgrau said these hospitals are the largest or second-largest source of income for rural counties, so the cuts will affect income and lead to job loss if implemented.
“We are likely going to see rural hospitals close,” Weisgrau said. “That means job losses and economic ripple effects.”
MU Health Care and Boone Health are two of the largest hospital systems serving patients across mid-Missouri. Officials say that while the impact is unknown at this time, they are actively watching the legislation.
“This bill is unpopular and will harm and kill people if implemented,” Lewis said. “It’s vital that Missourians contact their representatives now.”

(Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Heading into the momentous 2023 legislative session, then-House Speaker Melissa Hortman was dealing with big, fractious and ideologically diverse personalities in her caucus.
“Dave Lislegard and I had been in a hot war with each other for two years,” said Rep. Aisha Gomez, a Minneapolis Democrat with punk rock tastes and socialist politics.
Lislegard is a self-described “Iron Range old-school Democrat.” 
Hortman’s plan was to have them take the lead on taxes, which would be an important policy lever as Democrats sought to spread Minnesota’s prosperity more widely. 
“I didn’t know how it would work out,” Lislegard said in an email.
Hortman persisted: “You guys are closer than you think,” she told Lislegard.
The result was a massive tax bill that created a steeply graduated child tax credit, among other progressive achievements. 
“Melissa saw what no one else did,” Lislegard said. “She had an ability to see what’s in people’s hearts and how we could take the best parts from our own unique backgrounds to build a partnership.”
Gomez and Lislegard say Hortman’s matchmaking fostered both a tax bill — and a lifelong friendship. But Hortman wasn’t doing it just to make friends.
It was a “totally shrewd move,” Gomez said, cementing the loyalty of the farthest right and left flanks of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor House caucus, which was key to securing the votes Hortman needed to pass Minnesota’s most ambitious legislative agenda in decades.
Hortman’s politically motivated assassination this month has left Lislegard and Gomez – and the entire state – in shock and grief.
“She was an amazing friend,” Lislegard said, “and I already miss her terribly.” 
The Reformer interviewed nearly two dozen legislators of both parties, Capitol staff, political operatives, and the many Hortman alums who have gone on to successful careers in business, law and public service thanks to her mentoring.
The portrait that emerges is of an unusual politician: She merely tolerated the spotlight, happily shared credit and accepted blame, eschewed higher office, and by all accounts was motivated chiefly by an interest in public policy, its details and how it could help as many Minnesotans as possible. 
Hortman, a Catholic Sunday school teacher, was also guided by an insight often lost on elected officials. 
“Selflessness enhances power. Strong leaders understand that,” said Larry Redmond, a DFL lobbyist whose political resume includes working as a political aide to Hubert Humphrey. 
Put another way, “She wasn’t about the bullshit,” Gomez said. “The TV cameras or the next higher public office. Or about being glorified or having everyone like you. She was about doing the best she could do for the most people.” 
On Friday, June 26, she will be the first woman in Minnesota history to lie in state at the Capitol, along with her husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever, Gilbert.

Losses and reused yard signs 
Hortman began her own political career by losing — twice, in 1998 and again in 2002. 
“Adversity is a good teacher,” Redmond said.
From those defeats and her time representing a swing district, Hortman learned the importance of maintaining contact with voters, especially by knocking doors — thousands of them. Years later, as a caucus leader, she also never forgot what it was like to defend a battleground.  
In 2004, she hired future DFL Rep. Zack Stephenson as her campaign manager as an early 20s college student with no political experience in what would become another pattern: nurturing talent.
Hortman’s lawn signs in 2004 said “It’s time to get the job done” and made the pitch that unlike the incumbent, she would get the north metro a fair share of road and bridge money.
She won by a few hundred votes in the same year Republican President George W. Bush won her district.
When she ran for reelection in 2006, she was worried about reusing the slogan “It’s time to get the job done,” because she was now the one doing the job.
“Melissa was frugal and really hated waste, so she didn’t get new lawn signs. She just cut the (old slogan) off all the lawn signs, hundreds of them,” Stephenson said.
A wonky policy profile with roots in environmentalism
Growing up, Hortman’s family owned a junkyard, and she prided herself on understanding blue-collar small business people, but she’d also been educated at Boston University and the University of Minnesota Law School. 
She took up the wonkiest of subjects: Energy law and what was then only just emerging as a major policy issue — climate change. 
She fought against the powerful auto dealers’ lobby — and some in her own caucus — in a seemingly quixotic battle to adopt stricter tailpipe emissions standards, which would come to fruition more than a decade later when Gov. Tim Walz used rulemaking to adopt the standards. 
In 2007, she played a role in passing a mandate for Minnesota utilities to generate 25% to 30% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025, an optimistic target at the time which the state reached early. 
She was also author of a landmark 2013 law that set solar energy standards for Minnesota utilities and kickstarted what was for several years the country’s leading community solar program.
“We called her the godmother of solar in Minnesota,” said Logan O’Grady, executive director of the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association.
When then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty vetoed a transportation bill after the I-35 bridge collapse, Democrats appointed her the chief spokesperson during the floor debate over overriding the Republican governor’s veto. 
“Here is someone in their second term and is being called upon to navigate what was probably the most significant floor debate of that decade,” said former DFL Rep. Frank Hornstein. “We prevailed, and it felt like winning the Super Bowl.” 
Later, she’d become known as a legislative fixer who could pick up an ailing piece of legislation and yank it across the finish line, as with a foreclosure reform bill in the wake of the housing crisis of the Great Recession. (Fresh out of law school years before, she’d worked for Central Minnesota Legal Services, where she won a then-record-setting verdict in a housing discrimination lawsuit.)

While her interest remained policy, Hortman was developing a theory of elections, politics and power. 
Democrats would wind up losing the majority during the 2010 Republican wave that swept all the way to Washington, and Hortman often relayed what a voter told her that year: He didn’t care what she had done in the Legislature. He was sending a message to Democrats.
This humbling moment was so seared in her brain that she would repeat it to legions of legislators and operatives over the years: Voters mostly don’t know who their legislator is, and they care even less. 
The national political atmosphere will determine the outcome of most elections. 
Within those constraints, however, candidates could eke out enough votes on the margins to win the close races that frequently determined control of the House. 
And the best way to do that was by knocking doors and having face-to-face interactions that voters would appreciate and remember. 
Later, as caucus leader, she kept a tally of the members’ door knocking stats and sent out an email with everyone’s scores, including her own. The message was clear: If you want a good committee gavel, you need to do the work. After a doorknocking session, known as “Speaker knocks,” they’d retreat to a local bar for fellowship. 
The doorknocking also informed governing, as the conversations helped Democrats create an agenda that people wanted. 
Her approach to power was similarly grounded in the knowledge that it was fleeting. 
When Democrats controlled both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office in 2013-14, they debated how boldly they should govern, with an eye on the 2014 midterm election. 
On issues like a gas tax increase for transportation, drivers licenses for undocumented people and restoring ex-felons’ right to vote, some Democrats wanted to play it safe.
Lars Negstad, the policy director for the progressive ecumenical group ISAIAH, said Hortman made the kind of blunt argument she was famous for in an environment more often known for Scandinavian reticence. 
“We’re gonna lose anyway. We should just do it,” Negstad recalls her saying, anticipating the go-for-broke 2023 legislative session a decade later, when Democrats passed all three of those policies. 
An underestimated minority leader
Hortman became the House DFL leader in 2017 at a perilous moment for the DFL. Republicans had defied political gravity and picked up House seats in 2016 while taking control of the state Senate. Democrats feared Minnesota would go the way of Scott Walker’s Wisconsin, with its gerrymandered, permanent GOP majorities and attack on collective bargaining rights. 
She immediately made the kinds of sweeping changes that would become her management hallmark.
Brynn Hausz, who worked for Hortman in those years and is now intergovernmental relations director for St. Paul, recalled that a woman DFL legislator warned about “the optics” of Hortman’s all-female staff. 
Hortman replied, “I don’t remember anyone complaining when the leadership team was all men.”
In another instance, Hortman defended Hausz when a member of the caucus tried to have her fired. Hortman gathered the facts, and that was the last Hausz heard of it. 
“She had my back,” Hausz said.
Susie Malmberg-Merthan, who was a media and political advisor, said Hortman worked her staff hard — though she always outworked all of them herself — modernizing and systematizing both the caucus and the campaign. 
She didn’t suffer fools, but even her famously salty, cutting remarks came with a signature twinkle in her eye, and she was equally known for small kindnesses gifted upon the dozens of people in her orbit. 
Hortman won the loyalty of her caucus and many Minnesota Democrats during a moment of spontaneous anger.

Marching on freeways had emerged as a way to protest unconstitutional policing and Black men dying at the hands of police, including Philando Castile in 2016.
Republicans sought to stiffen criminal penalties for  the highway marches. 
As Democratic women of color talked about the nation’s history of racial injustice and the nonviolent resistance of the Civil Rights movement, some Republicans left to play cards in what’s known as the retiring room off the House floor.
I.e., women were talking and the men weren’t listening.
Hortman rose and made a point of privilege.
“I hate to break up the 100% white male card game in the retiring room,” Hortman said. “But I think this is an important debate.”  
Republicans asked Hortman to apologize, but she was unfazed. 
“I’m really tired of watching women of color, in particular, being ignored,” she said. “So, I’m not sorry.”
The moment went viral, known as “Sorry, not sorry.” 
Lt. Gov. Flanagan, who was one of the women Hortman was advocating for on the House floor, said the moment felt like a first.
“I remember in that moment just being like, ‘Oh, she’s got our backs.’ And in a way that in politics I just had never experienced before,” Flanagan said. 
State Sen. Erin Maye Quade, who was in the House at the time, said that Hortman’s authenticity came through because she didn’t ask them about it beforehand. There was no strategy. 
Malmberg-Merthan said she remembers thinking, “Oh shit, there she goes.” 
Abou Amara, a former DFL House aide close to Hortman who is now an attorney, said Hortman had been quietly evolving and learning about racial justice issues as her district became among the state’s most diverse, and as policing emerged as a key issue for her constituents and caucus. 
“She was always growing in her representation of people,” he said. 
She was also raising money, recruiting candidates and knocking on doors, preparing for what she knew — having lived through the opposite scenario in 2010 — would be a good Democratic year.

A master negotiator emerges
Hortman became speaker during divided government, in what would prove to be some of the most tumultuous years in recent Minnesota history.  
She immediately made changes to improve the working conditions of members and staff. 
Unruly House debates have historically stretched into the early morning hours. 
“We all knew that eventually something bad is going to happen at 3 or 4 in the morning,” said former Rep. Pat Garofalo, a south metro Republican who served with Hortman for nearly two decades. She feared a member or staff would die in a car wreck. 
“Her thought was, ‘Rather than waiting for something horrible to happen. Why don’t we just do it now?’” Floor sessions have rarely gone past midnight ever since. 
Hortman always made sure to keep her office stocked with snacks and drinks. 
“I served under a lot of speakers, and she was the only one to make sure we were fully hydrated and ready for long floor sessions,” Hornstein said. 
When COVID-19 hit, the health and safety of the entire House and the staff became her focus. 
Longtime Chief Clerk Pat Murphy’s wife was immunocompromised, but the clerk had to be in House chambers. So, Hortman, who worked to create a system of remote voting, decreed that only people who had to be in the House chamber should be there.
Then-Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a Republican from lake country, said she was an excellent governing partner who became a friend.
“My connection to Melissa Hortman became very important to Minnesota,” said Gazelka, who compared their bond to that of soldiers of wildly different backgrounds coming together for a common purpose. 
After the police murder of George Floyd, the two worked out a compromise on policing reforms, which was a nearly impossible task given the passion of urban Democrats and the increasingly close relationship between Republicans and police. 
Neither the Democratic public safety chair in the House nor the Republican chair in the Senate wanted a bill because they were so dug in on their positions. “But by the time we hashed out what was in it, both wanted their names on it,” Gazelka said.  
It included a ban on chokeholds and the kinds of maneuvers used in the Floyd murder, while creating a duty to intercede when an officer witnesses another using excessive force. 
Negstad recalled that after a particularly grueling negotiation with Gazelka, Hortman tried to be optimistic about her differences with him: “At least he loves Jesus, so we have that in common.” 
During the years of divided government, however, Hortman was planning and preparing in case Democrats won a trifecta again: She ran ambitious bills like a new paid leave program through the gauntlet, knowing they wouldn’t even get a hearing in the GOP-controlled Senate. This way, they were vetted. Interest group allies knew the score. The opposition’s arguments were well known. When one paid leave bill author would leave the House, she’d assign another to pick it up.
A trifecta, and a historic session
After Democrats captured the Legislature in 2022, Hortman brought in Zach Rodvold, who was a key House aide during the previous trifecta, and former Dayton chief of staff Jaime Tincher, to talk to the caucus about how to use their newfound power. 
They had two messages: 
“Do as much good for as many people as possible.” 
“Do the right thing and the message will take care of itself.”
These two sentences remained on a scoreboard Hortman kept of all the bills the caucus wanted to pass. 
The result was a more ambitious legislative session than any in decades.
Democrats codified abortion rights; restored voting rights to people no longer incarcerated; allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain a drivers license; enacted a so-called red flag law to take guns from people deemed dangerous; mandated carbon-free electricity by 2040; fully legalized marijuana; and, made Minnesota a sanctuary state for trans people.
They passed one of the most significant pro-worker agendas in state history, including paid sick leave and a state-run paid family and medical leave program; banned noncompete agreements; and raised workplace safety standards at meatpacking plants and Amazon and other big warehouses.
They raised taxes in the metro for housing and transportation; they showered money on public building projects around the state and increased spending on education and human services.
To a large degree, this will be Hortman’s policy legacy, and for now, the results remain to be seen. 
The paid leave program launches Jan. 1. The marijuana market has struggled to get off the ground. The state, flush with cash just two years ago, confronts a serious fiscal imbalance, with deficits on the horizon. Population growth has remained relatively stagnant.

The toughest vote of her career, just days before her death
The voters returned a mixed verdict in 2024, sending to the House 67 Democrats and 67 Republicans. 
But the 2025 legislative session wound up starting with a temporary Republican majority, 67-66. Hortman, fearing Republicans would use the advantage to unseat a Democrat who had won a contested race, kept her caucus united in a three-week boycott. After prevailing at the state Supreme Court, she negotiated a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, including giving up the speakership to GOP leader Rep. Lisa Demuth. Later, the two would negotiate a two-year state budget. 
Demuth called Hortman a worthy adversary: “I have the utmost respect for her, even though we disagreed. She was incredibly brilliant as a politician, sometimes to my detriment.” 
As part of that budget deal, Hortman was forced to take the toughest vote of her career, ending state-subsidized health insurance for undocumented adults. She was the sole House Democrat to vote for it, upholding her end of the bargain, in exchange for keeping the government open and funding schools, safety net programs, parks and public safety and saving thousands of state workers from a damaging government shutdown.

In due time, city councils and school boards and legislators and governors will want Hortman’s name to grace the facades of community centers and schools and park buildings and roads and maybe even the newly refurbished State Office Building, a robust example of public architecture that she won in a negotiation with Gazelka. 
She would probably scoff at all that, however. 
Hortman loved gardening and wanted more trees planted on the Capitol mall. The area is relatively open with little shade and few places to sit down.
“She talked about bringing her grandchildren to sit under the shade of one of those trees on the front lawn, and that missed opportunity now is really heartbreaking,” Flanagan said. 
“We’re going plant all of the damn trees that Melissa ever wanted,” she said. “We will have trees that her grandchildren will be able to sit under and feel that clean shade and the love of a grandma they never met but is beloved by so many people in Minnesota.”

But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
Michigan is one of at least 37 states and Washington, D.C. that have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.












We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University




But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A man is dead. One man who was arrested is now out of jail. And the man who allegedly shot three bullets — including the one that killed “innocent bystander” Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo, according to police — is cooperating with law enforcement but is not in custody. 
Based on what’s been reported so far in the wake of the chaotic shooting during a “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City earlier this month, Utah gun law experts say the tragic situation is looking increasingly legally nuanced. And they say it’s possible any justice for Ah Loo and his family may be more likely to come from a civil lawsuit than a criminal case — but that remains to be seen.
“There was, from what it sounds like, a misunderstanding, which led to extremely tragic consequences,” said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council and a Utah gun law lobbyist. 
Man arrested in connection with shooting during ‘No Kings’ protest released from jail

According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting during the June 14 protest happened after two men, who described themselves to police as “peacekeepers,” confronted 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15 style rifle during the protest. One of the men, reportedly part of the event organizer’s volunteer security team, told police he thought Gamboa was acting suspiciously, which led him to fire three shots from a handgun, hitting Gamboa in the back but also inadvertently striking Ah Loo, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle, and his attorney said his rifle was not loaded. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
Last week, Gamoba was released from jail after the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office conducted a preliminary review of evidence. While the investigation continues, charges have  not been filed in the case, against either Gamboa or the unnamed armed security volunteer.

While police and protest organizers have not released the identity of the security volunteer, Utah 50501 said he is a military veteran and that members of the safety team were chosen for “military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience.” 
‘Peacekeeper’ involved in shooting at SLC ‘No Kings’ protest is a military veteran, organizers say

The national 50501 organization has disavowed the Utah chapter in the days following the shooting, pointing to a “strict no-weapons policy” for the groups it affiliates with. Salt Lake’s demonstration, which drew 10,000 people, was part of a national wave of protests that day criticizing President Donald Trump’s leadership and policies. 
To Aposhian, Utah’s nonrestrictive gun laws may offer protection for both Gamboa and the armed security volunteer who fired. 
“You know, my gut (feeling) is nobody’s going to be going to prison on this,” Aposhian said, adding that prosecutors likely face a “heavy bar” to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gamboa had malicious intent by openly carrying the AR-15 or was acting recklessly leading up to the shooting. 
Utah’s gun and self-defense laws and the factors at play
Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, meaning its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those 21 years old and over who are legally allowed to possess them. Plus, those ages 18 to 20 can carry a concealed firearm in public if they obtain a provisional concealed carry permit. 
Utah also has one of the “strongest” self defense laws in the country, said Mitch Vilos, a Utah attorney with expertise in weapons law and the author of a book comparing self-defense laws across all 50 states. Utah law allows the use of force, including deadly force, when a person reasonably believes it’s necessary to prevent death, serious bodily injury, or forcible felony. Utah is also a “stand your ground” state, meaning a person does not have a duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, including in public places. 
The details that will likely decide a potential criminal case or a civil lawsuit will likely come down to two things — intent and behavior — leading up to the shooting.

“Unless there’s something that shows Gamboa … had some sort of a manifesto or something,” Vilos said, then it’s likely prosecutors won’t be able to prove any sort of malicious intent on his part. And the “No Kings” demonstration reportedly wasn’t the first protest where Gamboa has openly carried that AR-15 style rifle. His friend and longtime roommate told The Salt Lake Tribune he’s brought it to protests at least a dozen times before, and never aimed it at anyone. 
And as for the armed security volunteer, “if he reasonably thought that a mass murder was in progress” in the moments before shooting and if prosecutors can’t provide “clear and convincing evidence that (his decision to shoot) was not self-defense or self-defense or another,” then a criminal case would likely be dismissed, Vilos said. 
“You know, (it seems) you have two people with good intentions, and to me it just doesn’t seem productive to bring a criminal case against either one of them,” Vilos said. “I think it’s more of a friendly fire incident than it is a case where you’ve got someone that’s acting violently towards someone with no good cause.” 
The self-described “peacekeeper” told police, according to an affidavit of probable cause for Gamboa’s arrest, that Gamboa had “lifted the rifle,” and witnesses said he had begun running toward the crowd while holding it in a “firing position.” 
But in the days since Gamboa’s arrest, videos have circulated online raising questions about whether Gamboa had actually raised the rifle in a firing position or charged the crowd. One video angle, reported by FOX 13, showed Gamboa with his rifle pointed down and not running until after one of the security volunteers started shooting.

Aposhian said it’s possible that prosecutors could argue the armed security volunteer acted negligently or recklessly. 
“If you’re acting in self-defense, and you shoot and your bullet overpenetrates, or richochets, or it misses its mark and it hits an innocent party, you’re not going to be criminally liable unless it can you can be found that you acted with negligence or reckless disregard,” Aposhian said. “It’s an unintentional type of thing, but they’re going to have to show that you acted with reckless disregard.” 
Additionally, Aposhian noted that acting in self-defense “certainly does not necessarily protect you from a civil suit.” 
Evidentiary standards in civil lawsuits have much lower thresholds than in a criminal case, both Aposhian and Vilos said. 
“In a criminal case, it’s beyond a reasonable doubt, and in civil it’s whatever tips the scales, a preponderance of the evidence,” Aposhian said. 
Vilos said depending on potential insurance coverage for the victim or the men involved, “there’s probably a chance for a significant civil settlement.” But insurance coverage could hinge on what happens with criminal charges, if there are any. 
“If anybody really cares about the family (of the victim), the best thing that could happen would be a civil lawsuit that’s successful, and to heck with the criminal action because it’s probably going to be a loser, and it’s going to take a lot of resources,” Vilos said. “And it could actually harm the ability of the family to collect a civil damage award.” 
Should Utah allow open carry of long guns during protests?
Unlike 26 other states, Utah has not adopted a law prohibiting the open carrying of long guns at state capitols or political protests, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.” 
When asked whether lawmakers would be open to considering some type of policy change to restrict the open carrying of long guns during protests given what happened during the Salt Lake City “No Kings” protest, House Speaker Mike Schultz told reporters last week “Utah is a very proud Second Amendment state.” 
Utah lawmakers briefed on ‘No Kings’ shooting in SLC, their security after Minnesota shootings

“Finding that balance is what we want to try to do, and I think we’ve done a good job with it in the past,” he said. 
Schultz, however, left the door open to a discussion. 
“As we enter into the legislative session and we have more details around what happened, I’m sure some of those conversations will happen and we’ll see where it goes from there,” Schultz said. 
Aposhian — who has been lobbying for Second Amendment rights for 30 years — acknowledged that carrying a gun openly, especially a type of gun “that has been demonized, an AR-15, it’s very provocative.” 
“And anything you do will be viewed through the eyes of someone who may or may not appreciate AR-15s,” he said. 
Aposhian added that today’s polarized political climate — and given that some protests across the country have turned violent — can contribute to tensions. 
However, Aposhian added that the open carrying of firearms “is and always has been legal in Utah.” 
He predicted that any efforts to regulate what type of guns can be carried openly during political protests would be met with resistance from Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature. And it’s not something that he or the Utah Shooting Sports Council would be supportive of, either. 
It would be an “emotional response,” he said. “Emotion really doesn’t make for good laws.”
So while open carrying a gun like an AR-15 rifle may be “provocative,” Aposhian said it’s also a form of exercising two constitutional rights — the right to free speech and the right to bear arms — at the same time. 
“Carrying that gun is utilizing both those rights,” he said.

A University of Alabama professor accused Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, of threatening the budget of an honors program if its curriculum wasn't changed to comply with Alabama's DEI ban. (Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector).BIRMINGHAM — A University of Alabama professor and administrator Wednesday accused a member of the Alabama House of Representatives of threatening a fellowship program’s budget if its curriculum was not changed to comply with a state law banning DEI programs and so-called “divisive concepts.”
In an evidentiary hearing in a federal lawsuit over the statute, known as SB 129, Dana Patton, director of the Witt Fellows Program and a political science professor at the University of Alabama, testified that university officials told her a “powerful person in Montgomery” was behind complaints alleging the Dr. Robert E. Witt Program, an interdisciplinary honors program at UA focused on community service, was violating the law.
“Clearly, a very powerful person was behind this complaint for me to be asked to provide such extensive detail about my course,” Patton said in testimony before U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor. “I did not know who she was referring to. When I hear ‘very powerful person,’ I generally think it’s either a big donor to the university, a board of trustee member or state legislator.”

The anonymous complaints, which Patton received on October 15 and read during her testimony, alleged that “divisive concepts (were) embedded in UA Dr. Robert Witt Fellows program.” It stated that five students complained that “the viewpoints in the required reading books are presented as the correct perspective, and other opinions are shut down,” and “the students have stated they feel unsafe and scared to speak in class, unable to express their viewpoints in the classroom or in class assignments.”

Patton testified that at a University of Alabama game on Nov. 16, 2024, she was introduced to Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, one of two legislative committees that oversees the Education Trust Fund budget, in the president’s box at Bryant-Denny Stadium.  
She further testified that at that meeting, she had a 45-minute conversation with Garrett where he asked her if she knew about the complaints, which she told him she did. According to Patton, Garrett said that Rep. Susan DuBose, R-Hoover, “was not going to let this thing go” and that she was very “tenacious.”
Citing the litigation, Garrett in a phone call Wednesday declined to comment on Patton’s allegations. A message seeking comment was left with DuBose.
The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged that SB 129, sponsored by Sen Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, violated the First and Fourteenth amendments by prohibiting public funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and limiting discussions of so-called “divisive concepts.” Plaintiffs also allege the new law is confusing, vague and discriminatory.
Patton also said she understood a comment allegedly made by Garrett at the UA game, telling Patton he is chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, as a threat against her university program.
“He told me he’s the chair of the budget. He’s in charge of the budget. He answers to the taxpayers. He controls the budget, and all of this conversation was in relation to talking about the complaint and talking about my program and my courses. Well, I took it very much as a threat against the budget of my program,” she said.
Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the members of the University of Alabama Board of Trustees, did not address those allegations or ask for clarification when cross-examining Patton, who said she does not know if any complaints were investigated and remains unclear whether they came from within the university community. 
After the hearing, Ezelle declined to comment on the complaints and would not vouch for their authenticity, saying that he didn’t want to possibly identify one of the anonymous complainers.
“I won’t comment on that,” he said, saying that his public comments are on the court record.
Garrett texted Patton following their introduction in November, according to evidence presented to the court, saying that he “will be working with (Vice Chancellor of External Affairs) Charlie Taylor to set up a time for you, the Honors College Dean and me to meet with a couple of other legislators who have raised concerns. As I expressed today, my desire is to address/resolve concerns and avoid potential major issues in the future.”
Patton said she “took that as a threat.” 
“Well, he wants to talk to avoid major issues in the future. He had made it clear that he controls the budget. He had told me that the state legislature was upset with the program. I’ve been asked about the books that I assign. He’s saying we need to avoid major issues. We need (to) compromise about my class and my decisions about it. It felt very much like a threat to me,” Patton said.
Patton said she has already made some changes to her courses as of her testimony Wednesday, and plans to make more for next semester. She has discontinued the use of the Harvard Implicit Association Test (IAT), a test that analyses a person’s subconscious bias.
 Patton said that while she was not asked to make that change, she’s afraid that it could lead to more complaints, putting her in a similar situation again. She said that while she tells students the IAT doesn’t label them as racist or sexist, she cannot control their “feelings of guilt,” which could lead to accusations of violating SB 129, especially concerning the law’s mention of subconscious concepts. 
In her introductory “Understanding Poverty” class, Patton said next semester she will stop showing three documentaries that tend to elicit “visceral reaction” and “feelings of guilt and anger” in students, particularly regarding topics like convict leasing.

The land shaded in pink could be opened for oil and gas exploration. (Department of Natural Resources map)The Alaska Department of Natural Resources is considering whether or not to open state-owned land near the Yukon River to oil and gas exploration.
In a public notice published in May and renewed June 18, the agency said it “intends to evaluate the acceptability of an oil and gas exploration license proposal for the Yukon Flats area.”
The Yukon Flats cover a vast area of Interior Alaska, and the state’s proposal includes only “unencumbered” state-owned lands, primarily near the Dalton Highway, the town of Livengood, the Steese Highway and the Yukon River town of Circle.
The Yukon Flats are a relatively unexplored region when it comes to oil and gas potential.
This summer, the private oil company Hilcorp is drilling for oil on land owned by the Alaska Native corporation Doyon Ltd.
Historically, the prospect of oil development in the area has been controversial; the Yukon Flats are home to the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to large amounts of wildlife.
The refuge is not included in the state proposal, and most of the refuge is a significant distance from the state-owned land being considered for oil and gas exploration.
The state’s exploration licensing program requires a public comment period before the DNR commissioner makes a final determination about whether state lands in the Yukon Flats should be open to exploration.
After that determination, interested explorers would be able to submit license applications that would permit them to conduct seismic surveying and test drilling for oil and gas.

That was the main message Wednesday for an online presentation featuring top executives from four organizations that have membership straddling the border. The presentation came just days before the teams face a deadline from Kansas on its proposal to build new stadiums for both teams.
“We get this question a lot,” said Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council. “Does the regional business and civic community have a preference for which side of the state line or which specific location the teams land? No. As long as the teams land within the KC region, we’re going to support their decision, full stop.”
The presentation focused on how Kansas City competes with other metro areas. At no point during the debates in Kansas or Missouri over public financing for stadiums has either team said it was considering moving out of the region. 
Such a move would require the concurrence of other team owners. No city or state other than Missouri and Kansas have made public overtures to the teams. 
The sentiment that the state line was the smallest consideration for Kansas City businesses was echoed by the other participants, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, which hosted the presentation, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City and the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation.
“The more that we can stand united as one KC, and understand that our competition are those other regions that want the assets we have or are competing to attract what we want to get as well, I think we’re going to be stronger and we’re going to win,” said Joe Reardon, CEO of the Kansas City chamber.
Missouri special session ends with passage of KC stadium funding, disaster aid

Missouri lawmakers this month approved a plan to finance up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, committing almost $1.5 billion in future tax revenue. The current facilities, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium, were opened in the early 1970s and almost all other stadiums built near that time are no longer in use, Reardon noted in the presentation.
Kansas, under a plan approved last year by the Kansas Legislature, is offering to pay up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums if the teams cross the state border.
During the debates in both states, the focus was on winning the “border war”. 
For Missouri, the loss of either team would mean another major league team leaving the state. St. Louis lost the NFL’s Rams in 2015, the football Cardinals in 1987 and the NBA’s Hawks in 1968. Kansas City lost Major League Baseball’s Athletics in 1967 and the Kings NBA franchise in 1985.
Kansas City is the smallest market that has both an NFL team and a Major League Baseball team.
For Kansas, it would be the first time a team from the NFL or Major League Baseball called the state its home.
“Our competition is not in Missouri or Kansas, it’s outside the region,” Cowden said. “We need to keep them at bay at arm’s length. This is not, in our opinion, about a border war. It truly is about a border solution.”
The success of Kansas City sports teams, especially the Chiefs, has raised the national and international profile of the region, said Kathy Nelson of the Greater Kansas City Sports Commission & Foundation and Visit KC.
“They are opening doors to businesses like we never heard,” she said.
The Chiefs have played in five of the six most recent Super Bowls. The 2025 game had a national audience of 127 million and international audience estimated at 62 million. The romance between Taylor Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has also boosted the city’s profile, she said.
The Royals made the playoffs last year for the first time since winning the World Series in 2015. They have a more regional audience, she said, with 80% of game attendees living within 75 miles of downtown Kansas City.
“Nothing else puts us on a global stage like our sports teams,” Nelson said. “There’s nothing else like this.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/KC-stadiums-2048x1150-1-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-06-26 09:02:18.883420

Gavin Newsom this week is a noteworthy — even heroic — response to financial problems caused by factors beyond their control, particularly President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
A summary of the $321 billion agreement issued by the state Senate declares, “Through the work of the Legislature and the governor the past two years, the budget was once again stabilized, with the governor’s January 10 proposed budget being balanced without needing new solutions. Unfortunately, since January, circumstances have changed, and California now faces a significant budget shortfall.”
“First and foremost,” the summary continues, “the policies of the new federal administration — in particular the tariff increase policies — have caused economic forecasts throughout the world to be significantly downgraded.”
It goes on to cite “to a modest degree, the baseline costs of key programs — particularly Medi-Cal — have grown faster than projected … and third, to a smaller degree, the devastating LA fires have had a negative economic impact and resulted in increased state spending.”
That scenario is fictional, conjured up to mask the fact that Newsom and legislators have been overspending revenues for three years, ever since the governor erroneously declared that the state had an almost $100 billion surplus — long before fires hit Los Angeles and Trump was inaugurated.
The supposed surplus ignited a multi-billion-dollar flurry of new spending in 2022, that has persisted. The administration finally admitted, a year ago, that it overstated projected revenues by $165 billion over four years.
The initial 2025-26 budget that Newsom proposed in January had an $11 billion general fund gap between revenues and spending. His revised budget, released in May, had a $19 billion deficit even with a number of spending cuts, mostly in services for the poor and elderly. The budget deal expands the deficit to $21 billion.
Newsom’s revised budget started the blame-it-on-Trump syndrome and legislative leaders quickly embraced it to explain away their chronic failure to either reduce spending or raise taxes to balance income and outgo, a condition known in the Capitol as a “structural deficit.”
Thus all of the versions of the budget, including the semi-final one unveiled this week, would fill the gaps for another year with payment deferrals, loans, accounting gimmicks and raids on reserves meant to cushion the effects of genuine emergencies.
Direct and indirect loans to the general fund budget come from special funds set aside for specific purposes, and after three years of deficit spending the state has accumulated many billions of dollars of internal debt that will have to be repaid sometime.
The accounting gimmickry takes several forms, such as delaying $2.3 billion in support payments to community colleges and local school systems that are due in June 2026 until a month later, thus shifting them from one fiscal year to another.
Officials call such maneuvers “solutions,” but they don’t solve anything. They merely stave off the day of reckoning when officialdom runs out of tricks. That day will probably come after Newsom has left the governorship and is, perhaps, running for president.
In effect, the state has adopted the same hide-the-pea approach to budgeting that the federal government employs, one that has resulted in a multi-trillion-dollar national debt. Trump, by the way, appears to continue that spend-now-pay-later practice with his “big beautiful bill” that, by all accounts, would grow the national debt even more.
Were a private corporation to cook its books like the state government does, its executives could wind up in jail for fraud. For some strange reason, however, California’s voters continue to tolerate the Capitol’s chronic fiscal malpractice.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

(photos courtesy of candidates, graphic by Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Voters in Tuscaloosa County will Choose between the chair of the county’s Democratic Party and a Republican city councilman in a January special election. for an Alabama House seat.
The House District 63 seat opened up after Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned earlier this month to become president of the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Judith Taylor, a Democrat, is a first-time candidate who said she is running for office to give voters a choice.
“I am really tired of not having Democrats on the ballot,” the 63-year-old retiree said in an interview Tuesday morning. 
She said she wants to prioritize reducing poverty and food shortages, improving the quality of public education and monitoring out-of-state property owners.
“We desperately need public education, and it shouldn’t cover the cost of someone going to private school,” the first-time candidate said.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like education savings account that allows applicants to spend up to $7,000 on education-related expenses, including private school tuition. It is funded through the Education Trust Fund, which is the state’s budget for public education.
She said that she is concerned about foreign entities and corporations owning land in Alabama, but not having to pay their share of taxes.
“I think it’s time we looked at all people and the least of us need to have the benefit,” Taylor said. “I do think that corporations should pay their share, and I think the wealthy among us should pay their fair share. I don’t resent paying more in taxes than a lot of poor people do, but I do resent that I’m paying more in taxes than Walmart.”
Norman Crow, a Republican and Tuscaloosa city councilman, said the opportunity to represent Tuscaloosa County in Montgomery is furthering his passion for public service. 
“When Cynthia, Representative Almond, resigned her position to take the president of the Public Service Commission, I felt like it was a huge opportunity for me to take another step towards serving our community on a statewide basis,” the real estate agent said in an interview Tuesday evening.
He said he wants to prioritize maintaining a business-friendly environment in Alabama, furthering economic development and improving education.
“I think that being supportive of workforce development is very important,” the 57-year-old said. “Having our communities in Alabama ready for the potential growth that needs to happen for good paying jobs is important.”
He said that improving education goes beyond educating children, but also includes educating adults for the future.
“Continuing to work to improve education in the state of Alabama is so important to prepare our students, but also adults, for the jobs of tomorrow,” Crow said.
Taylor said that voters should choose her so the Legislature has more Democrats and diverse debates.
“I think they should choose me because I care about the people, the common everyday people, and I think that those who are underserved need someone to speak for them,” she said. “I think that we need more Democrats in office. We need more options for our voters, and we need different sides for the issues to be discussed.”
Crow said his political experience and familiarity of the district makes him the best candidate. 
“I really know the district, and I feel like I’m in a good position to understand constituents and help with what the priorities of District 63 are,” Crow said.

But the cuts could hit harder, later, they were warned.","The West Front of the U.S. Capitol in May. Lawmakers are scrambling to finish a budget reconciliation bill that will make deep spending cuts. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Coming federal budget cuts will likely have severe impacts on Maryland, but they could come later than expected and their impact will not be felt right away, lawmakers were told Wednesday.
But that little bit of breathing room will not change the fact that the state still needs to brace for potentially massive cuts to programs like food assistance and Medicaid, state analysts and officials said.
The comments came during the first meeting of the new Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee, created this session to track how policies from the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress could affect Marylanders and the state.
“There are lots of enormous questions ahead for the state of Maryland,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during the 90-minute virtual committee meeting. “We want to make sure that we are monitoring the impact as we move forward.”
While there may be a longer on-ramp to the anticipated federal cuts, the impact will still be “dire and concerning,” House Majority Whip. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) said during the meeting.
Lawmakers heard from analysts with the Department of Legislative Services and federal relations officials from the governor’s office to get a layout of the current budget talks.
They also got an update from Attorney General Anthony Brown on the many legal actions Maryland has joined to challenge Trump administration policies changes, program cuts and federal worker firings, among other efforts.
Buyout offers, hiring freeze coming for state government amid budget crunch

David Romans with DLS said that the cuts for fiscal 2026 are “not as horrible as we had worried about” duringn the legislative session, but that cuts down the line will be “more significant.”
“We think the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and Medicaid changes will likely increase state costs by somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in fiscal ’26,” Romans said. “Part of the reason for that … is that some of the provisions have delayed effective dates. So a lot of things that are going to cause problems for the states don’t go into effect immediately.
“The outyear impacts are much more significant in our view. And again, it depends on where the (U.S.) House and Senate end up,” Romans said.
Some of biggest concerns are cuts to SNAP, as both the U.S. House and Senate plan to shift more of the cost burden onto states and reduce federal spending for the program. Romans said that the risk for Maryland in out years is up to $450 million annually, according to DLS estimates.
He said the state may save some money from lower Medicaid enrollment, which could offset anticipated increases to administrative costs needed to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on recipients that will be required under the bill.
But lawmakers argued that those savings, if any, would be quickly consumed by the rise in “uncompensated care,” as more uninsured people would likely seek health care from emergency rooms. Estimates from national health advocacy groups say that about 130,000 Marylanders could be kicked off of Medicaid due to work requirements that are part of budget proposals working their way through Congress now.
An additional challenge could be prohibitions on health care that goes toward undocumented immigrants.
Romans said that Maryland’s Healthy Babies Equity Act, which provides Medicaid coverage during pregnancy regardless of immigration status, might be at risk depending on how officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services interpret the bill.
He said that the state currently receives $100 million in federal funding for the healthy babies program that would no longer be available under the current budget reconciliation language.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But in addition to federal funding cuts, Maryland could be on the hook for financial penalties if the state continues to provide health care coverage for pregnant undocumented immigrants, even if the state only uses state dollars.
Matthew Verghese, director and senior adviser for the Governor’s Federal Relations Office, said that there are still details being worked out in the budget reconciliation legislation, and it’s not clear how the House and Senate will work out differences between their versions of the bill.
“I would not total all these numbers up to figure out what the impact of the state will be. Some of it is double-counted, but clearly we’re looking at potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in lost federal funds, and more administrative costs, if these changes go forward,” he said of the various cuts to Medicaid.
Currently, the budget reconciliation bill in the hands of the U.S. Senate has bigger cuts than the House version of the legislation — but would grant states more time to adapt to some of those cuts.
Legislative leaders had considered calling a special session later this summer to rapidly adapt the state budget or other policies, if necessary, in reaction to federal decisions.
Ferguson said that the urgency for a special session this fall has dropped, though they are keeping the option “on the back burner.”
“The necessity for a specially session is probably less than it was when we left in April. But there are still enormous questions out there that could shift things at any point,” Ferguson said to reporters after the briefing.
  Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the possibility of a special session later this year is  less likely, but is “not off the table.” (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“It does look like … we will have time to deal with a lot of these issues in January” when the 2026 General Assembly convenes, he said. “And that the administration will have enough flexibility in the meantime to deal with some of the more pressing pieces and components of the bill.”
Fiscal house ‘built on sand’
But state Republicans repeated their charge that much of the problems Maryland faces under the budget reconciliation act are self-inflicted.
“Our generous Medicaid expansions and extensive support for undocumented immigrants are not federal mandates — they’re policy choices made here in Annapolis,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said in a written statement. “If we can’t afford them, we have the ability and responsibility to revise those policies.
“Instead, Maryland leaders double down, accepting limited federal funds to justify unsustainable programs that burden state taxpayers,” Hershey said. “It’s time to stop asking them to bankroll the liberal wish list.”
That was echoed by Sen. Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll).
“Ironically, the same state government that’s crying about unfunded mandates from Washington is the first to force them onto our counties,” Ready said. “We need responsible budgeting, immigration enforcement, and less reliance on Washington—because right now, our fiscal house is built on sand.”
The briefing comes just one day after Gov. Wes Moore announced a state hiring freeze and worker  buyouts with the goal of saving $121 million to help offset the tight budget in fiscal 2026, which starts Tuesday. That plan would appear to block previous goals of the governor, to fill vacant state jobs and hire federal workers who lose their jobs as part of Trump administration cuts,
Ferguson said the state will try to backfill as much lost federal dollars as possible to keep Medicaid and SNAP afloat, but with the state’s tight margins “it is likely that we will not be able to cover everywhere.”
“Given the scope of the challenges, it is unlikely that in the short term, that we will be able to provide at the same level that we have been able to,” Ferguson said after the meeting. “Given the destruction of the historic federal and state partnership that we have had for many of these safety net programs.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmay72025-4_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

The city’s acts amount to “the most severe violation of a court order witnessed by this Court in its extensive experience adjudicating high-profile litigation,” Williams wrote in an order filed Tuesday, adding the city’s “repeated, willful, and bad-faith defiance” of judicial orders “is unparalleled” and reflects a “shocking disregard” for the court, especially from a municipality.
MaQuade Chesley, Mesquite’s former police chief, is suing the city for wrongful termination and defamation. 
Chesley was fired in January by then-City Manager Edward “Owen” Dickie, who initially cited a vote of no confidence by the Mesquite police union as the reason for the termination. He later said Chesley was fired for recording a conversation, which is not illegal in Nevada. 
The Current was first to report multiple recordings Mesquite residents and Chesley provided of Dickie making racially-charged statements regarding the hiring of the city’s next police chief. 
The council, by a vote of 4 to 1, terminated Dickie in late April, citing the recordings. 
Chesley’s attorney, Philip Trenchak, contends in court filings the city is attempting to cover up its actions by failing to provide documents requested in the litigation, redacting entire pages, and cancelling scheduled depositions.
In an order issued Tuesday, Williams found the city engaged in “Bad Faith ‘Hide the Ball’ Discovery tactics,” and found the city “systematically and intentionally violated” his court orders by “producing deficient, redacted, and duplicative documents, asserting improper objections, and failing to produce critical evidence…”
Chesley, who joined the Mesquite police force in 2007, says rumors allegedly circulated by former City Attorney Bob Sweetin and then-Mesquite employee Shannon Harris, prompted what has become a drawn out legal battle.
“I was told and believe that both Sweetin and Harris joined together to spread defamatory lies about me,” Chesley told the Current on Wednesday.
The alleged rumors suggested Chesley was having sexual relationships with young girls. He filed a harassment complaint with Human Resources. 
“I’ve been a police executive for the past 14 years. I’ve always held myself to a higher standard,” Chesley said earlier this year. “To be accused of these things floored me. It destroyed me and my family.” 
Williams, in his order, wrote that Chesley sought unredacted responses to subpoenas served on the city, “particularly documents related to an investigation of Shannon Harris, who allegedly referred to Plaintiff as ‘Chief Pedophile.’”
Instead, the city “produced heavily redacted documents, with entire pages blacked out, citing attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, despite the Court’s order for unredacted production.”
Williams found the city’s “selective redaction” of the Harris investigation was unjustified, and “further supports a finding of bad faith.”
The city’s “heavy redactions of documents, particularly entire pages of the Harris investigation report,” demonstrate an intent to conceal evidence of misconduct by City employees, the judge wrote, adding the city’s actions have “severely prejudiced Plaintiff’s ability to prepare his case, as these materials are central to his claims of defamation and misconduct by City employees.”
Mesquite’s “egregious and willful violations, including untimely and deficient productions, misrepresentations to the Court, and obstruction of discovery, warrant sanctions,” Williams wrote, adding he’d determine after further briefing “whether the ultimate sanction of default is appropriate…” 
In the meantime, Williams awarded attorneys fees and costs to Chesley for recent motions related to the city’s failure to comply with the court. The city’s delay and obstruction “constitute a chilling effect on the litigation process, potentially deterring Plaintiff from pursuing his claims due to escalating costs and frustration.”
Williams also found the attorney representing the city, Jorge “Coco” Padilla, made misrepresentations to the court, an act he says “compounds the bad faith exhibited throughout the discovery process.”
Padilla said he hasn’t seen the order and declined to comment. 
The city’s acts, Williams wrote, undermine the integrity of the judicial process. He gave the city deadlines next month to comply with his orders.

O’Neil’s son was born 11 weeks premature and entered foster care as a newborn, which qualified him for Medicaid. At two months old, he was hospitalized with RSV, a respiratory virus that can be severe in infants, and diagnosed with subglottic stenosis—a narrowing of his airway. Doctors performed a tracheostomy, and her son required round-the-clock care and specialized medical equipment, all of which was covered by Medicaid.
Years later, surgeons rebuilt his airway. Because his adoption was nearly finalized, O’Neil was able to see for the first time just how much that hospital stay cost: over $100,000 just for a two-week stay.

Medicaid provided a stability O’Neil hadn’t thought possible. Since that two-week stay, her son, now six years old, has had five procedures, with a sixth planned for summer. And yet, she didn’t have to worry or fight with the insurance company.  Because of Medicaid, she was able to focus on her son.
“Because of Medicaid, my child, who could not speak a word until after he turned three, can talk and tell jokes and yell at his little sister,” O’Neil explained, adding that “most people don’t even know he ever had any medical issues.”
Now, she faces the uncertainty of another surgery this summer, and the looming threat that the federal government might cut the very program that has supported her family every step of the way.
For Sarah Abend, Medicaid was the only support that made her work—and life—sustainable. 
She was inspired to share her story by U.S. Sen. Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota), who recently claimed that “the best health care is a job.”
“I stand here as evidence that is not true, Senator Thune,” she said at Wednesday’s vigil. 
“I am the job, and I don’t come with health care,” Abend said.
Abend is an artist, former teacher, and small business owner. She’s also a Medicaid beneficiary– something she was once embarrassed to tell people. It felt shameful, she explained, “because our society taught me that needing assistance meant personal failure.”
However, Abend soon realized that utilizing Medicaid was not an indicator of personal failure. The failure did not lie with her, she said, but with the system– chiefly the idea that healthcare is a luxury, rather than a fundamental right. 
Moreover, Abend explained, our economy depends on creative and service work. And yet, that same system abandons these workers all too frequently.
“The economy depends on teachers, artists, service workers, caregivers, people doing essential work that often doesn’t come with benefits,” Abend said. “If we’re going to have a system that needs low-wage workers to function, then we have a moral obligation to ensure those workers can afford to stay healthy and alive.”

For Nathan Dunbar, Medicaid was a new beginning.
“I had nosedived my life with drugs and criminal activity and being a general menace,” he admitted. Tired of prison and chaos, he sought to start over.
“I didn’t have any way to pay for the services I was going to need to unravel the screwed-upness I’d injected into my life,” Dunbar said. “I relied on Medicaid funds to help me figure out how to get my life going.”
Since 2016, he’s stayed sober, become a father, and works at Community Mental Health, mentoring other addicts in their recovery. Dunbar has become, in his own words, “an exemplary citizen.”
Still, he expressed concern for what the proposed cuts to Medicaid might mean for those struggling with addiction. 
“People need help, and if we have no way to deliver that help, then those people will be left to their own devices trying to figure things out,” Dunbar said. “If you don’t know the direction, you have to ask somebody, and if there’s nobody to ask because they cut all the funding, there’ll be nobody offering that direction. And our city, Lansing, our state, Michigan, the place we love, our neighbors that we care about, will all suffer.” 
Protect MI Care, in conjunction with the Governor’s office, has compiled “14,905 real stories from real Michiganders on how losing access to Medicaid would be detrimental to themselves and their families.” 
Binders full of these stories will be hand-delivered to the seven Michigan representatives who voted for the bill: Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), Jack Bergman (R-Watersmeet), Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), John James (R-Shelby Township), Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Township), John Moolenaar (R-Caledonia), and Tim Walberg (R-Tipton).
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives 215 to 214, and the U.S. Senate is anticipated to vote by the end of the week.
Meanwhile, Protect MI Care will be hosting a Hands Off Medicaid Rally on Saturday in Lansing. Speakers will include U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut), Michigan leaders, and healthcare advocates from across the state.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Several state legislators want to take the New Jersey State Police out of the state attorney general’s supervision and make it its own entity, a move that comes amid escalating tensions between the two.
Under a bipartisan bill introduced last week, the 3,000-member agency would no longer be a division under the Department of Law and Public Safety, which Attorney General Matt Platkin heads, and instead would become a state department, with its superintendent answering directly to the governor.
Sen. Michael Testa (R-Cumberland) said he signed on as one of the bill’s five sponsors because of directives Platkin and his predecessor, Gurbir Grewal, have issued in recent years that limit police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents and divert law-breaking youth from criminal justice involvement.
Those directives have kept officers from doing their jobs, Testa said. The agency’s top brass should instead decide policing policies, he added.
“I want the state police to have the handcuffs taken off of them and put the handcuffs on the criminals, where they belong,” he said.
Beyond disagreements over directives, the attorney general’s role in ensuring police accountability also has increasingly put him at odds with the state’s largest police force.
Platkin’s office oversees police licensing, investigates fatal police encounters and official misconduct, and publicly reports major discipline levied against officers statewide. He’s issued bombshell reports on racism in the agency’s promotions and internal affairs and has been investigating allegations that state troopers reduced traffic enforcement in response to racial profiling claims.

Several of the bill’s sponsors deny that it’s a response to such scrutiny.
“This legislation has nothing to do with that,” said Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris).
It has more to do with bureaucracy, he added.
“I’ve heard from a number of retired troopers over the last couple of years that promotions are slow getting done, that different things that are requested take a long time to get approved,” Bucco said. “That makes an awful lot of sense because the attorney general’s office is enormous. The Department of Law and Public Safety is enormous. The attorney general has a lot on his plate, and to put the state police in there as a division promotes, almost, that turmoil because sometimes they can’t operate as efficiently and as quickly as they should be able to.”
Sen. Robert Singer (R-Monmouth) conceded that Platkin has ruffled a lot of feathers since he became attorney general in February 2022.
“I don’t think the AG has missed poking anybody in the eye, from the governor on down,” Singer said.
But he said he signed on as a bill sponsor because he felt the state police deserve “a seat at the table,” and Col. Patrick Callahan, the agency’s superintendent since 2017, should have equal footing with other members of the governor’s cabinet.
Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), the bill’s leading sponsor, seconded that sentiment but also pointed to Platkin’s lack of policing experience.
“We have a politically appointed attorney general, a politically appointed lawyer, who really doesn’t know anything about policing and has never been a cop, and he is telling a force of men and women who are professionals in policing what they can and can’t do,” Beach said. “I just don’t think it makes sense.”
Mike Symons, a spokesman for Platkin’s office, and Murphy spokeswoman Tyler Jones declined to comment. Spokespeople for the state police didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 Attorney Gregg Zeff, who represents the state NAACP, said the group wants changes to the bill to ensure robust, independent oversight of the police. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
The bill has the cautious support of the NAACP New Jersey State Conference, whose leaders have long called for a clean sweep of the state police’ top brass over discrimination concerns.
Attorney Gregg Zeff, who represents the NAACP, said the group supports the bill conceptually but wants improvements to “give it teeth.” That could come in the form of other legislative efforts to create an inspector general in New Jersey to ensure robust, independent oversight of the police.
“The primary function of our State Police is law enforcement and public safety. The attorney general’s primary function should be legal leadership, oversight, and prosecution. The overlap in these functions makes it difficult in both offices to avoid conflicts and provide appropriate leadership without blending many separate issues together— resulting often, in our opinion, in quid pro quo decisions, actions, and compromises that the public cannot easily reconcile,” Zeff said in a statement.
Lauren Bonds heads the National Police Accountability Project.
State police being under the direct supervision of a governor is “the standard model” in most states around the country, she said. But shifting who’s tasked with police oversight for political reasons also is common, she added.
“This is usually a supportive relationship that you see between state police and the state’s AG, but there can be times where there is tension and division, when the attorney general is maybe a progressive prosecutor or somebody who came in with police reform being one of their top priorities,” Bonds said.
The bill has no Assembly companion and is unlikely to pass this legislative session because lawmakers are expected to recess by Tuesday for the summer and not return until after the November general election. They then have less than two months to act on unfinished business before the next legislative session begins Jan. 13.
January is also when a new governor will be sworn in — Murphy cannot seek a third term in November — who will presumably name their own attorney general to replace Platkin.

Although Vermont has strong protections for abortion on the books, those protections mean nothing if patients have nowhere to access the service.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicole Clegg: After Roe, 3 years of resistance, care and community.","This commentary is by Nicole Clegg, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.


Three years ago, most Americans assumed that the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was the final check mark on the anti-abortion movement’s to-do list. Overnight, federal protections for abortions evaporated, and states suddenly had the power to decide who could access abortion and under what circumstances. 
But overturning Roe was just the beginning. The decision served as a catalyst to pass more restrictions on abortion and repeal safeguards for health centers providing abortion care, and it emboldened anti-abortion extremists to commit more violent acts — like the tragic events that took place in Minnesota. 
Support for abortion rights is the highest it’s been in history and 81% of Americans don’t want politicians involved in decisions about pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups know that pursuing a nationwide ban is politically toxic, but that hasn’t stopped them.
They’re reversing federal protections through executive orders, like the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, criminalizing abortion providers and patients, and hiding abortion bans in bills where they don’t belong. 
Congress is currently considering a budget bill that includes a provision to ban patients insured by Medicaid from getting care at Planned Parenthood. Despite the claims to the contrary, the bill has nothing to do with fiscal responsibility — banning Planned Parenthood would cost taxpayers $300 million — and everything to do with the fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortion care. 
If the measure passes and the Trump Administration withholds other funds we receive, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England would lose $5 million annually, or 42% of our patient revenue. These funds cover cancer screenings, birth control, wellness exams and so much more. We are a critical safety net provider in New England and without us, Vermonters will suffer. 
This attack highlights that although Vermont has strong protections for abortion on the books, those protections mean nothing if patients have nowhere to access the service. Planned Parenthood health centers are an irreplaceable part of Vermont’s health care system, serving nearly 16,000 patients annually who rely on us for birth control, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings and other preventive care. Patients and communities in Vermont will suffer.
In only three years, we have heard countless stories of women getting turned away from emergency rooms, medevacked to a “legal” state, losing their ability to become pregnant in the future and in some cases, even losing their lives. It’s an injustice and could jeopardize the future of an entire generation. At PPNNE, we are determined to do all we can to safeguard our patients’ health and rights. 
We are expanding access to abortion. 94% of our health centers now offer abortion services, with a goal to reach 100% in the coming year. We’ve knocked down financial barriers by growing our abortion fund. PPNNE provides practical support to patients traveling to us for care, including help with lodging, travel, childcare and more. 
We opened our doors wider and welcomed patients from across the country — people who should never have had to leave their home state. 10% of our abortion patients hail from another state including Texas, Florida, and Georgia and other states where abortion is banned. PPNNE has served patients from 36 states since the fall of Roe. 
We’ve also seen firsthand the emotional toll this crisis has taken. Patients often arrive at our health centers exhausted and scared. But they leave with dignity, care and support — because we believe your access to care shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code. 
The overturning of Roe may have been the green light for the anti-abortion movement. But it has also served as a spark for PPNNE and our communities. When access to abortion is under attack, we become the shield.
We stand between harmful policies and the people they’re designed to hurt. We show up — every day — to protect care, to protect patients and to protect the fundamental right to make personal decisions about our bodies and futures. And we won’t give up until that freedom is guaranteed for all.

Passing something that is rushed and does not promote equity, affordability or quality schools is not better than nothing.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver: A dereliction of duty.","This commentary is by Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver of Moretown. She is the 2025 Vermont Teacher of the Year and teaches English and history at Winooski High School.


On Monday, I sat in the Senate chamber and watched a senator sleep through one of the most consequential bills in recent Vermont history. Then, I sat on the Statehouse lawn with my two young children, livestreaming the House hastily doing a voice vote, where many representatives appeared surprised by what they had just done. 
Earlier in the day, I spoke with many representatives who did not recognize the complexities of H.454: they did not understand the implications for small schools like the one I will send my children to, they did not understand the consequences of what this would mean to lose our unique Winooski School District, nor did they recognize that public funds will continue to be fettered to private schools which lack the same accountability as public schools. 
As a teacher, I pride myself on holding students to high-quality standards for their work. I do not ask my students to rush through their assignments. I ask them to take their time, consider multiple perspectives, share with stakeholders, receive feedback, and revise, revise, and revise. Why are our lawmakers not doing the same?

I also teach my students that their voice matters; that in a democracy, they have representatives that represent their interests. This message rings hollow when they see it not fulfilled. My own senator, Sen. Cummings, did not respond to a single email from me and stated publicly she “stopped doing emails when [she] didn’t feel I could bleed anymore.” Sen. Baruth, representing Winooski where I teach, did not engage in dialogue with our school district once.
In the days and weeks leading up to the consequential vote, we heard again and again from lawmakers that passing something is better than nothing and that taxpayers want tax relief.
First, passing something that is rushed and does not promote equity, affordability, or quality schools is not indeed better than nothing. In my classroom, I mark work like this with a “NY”: not yet. Try again.
Second, taxpayers do indeed want tax relief, and the bill that Gov. Scott, Democrats and Republicans are celebrating does not provide it. Shame on our governor for putting us in this position and shame on everyone who followed suit.
In the coming weeks and months, there will be many small committees tasked with big decisions that will impact every student in our state, and thus play a lasting role in our state as a whole. I ask our lawmakers to think critically about the same questions I ask my students to think about: Whose voices are being heard? Whose voices are not at the table? How do these decisions affect the most vulnerable in our community?
Chances are, once again, teachers and students will not be there. A student texted me after the House voted for the bill, asking eagerly what happened. When she learned the fate of H.454 her response was plain and clear: “When has the government ever been on the side of education or the side of students’ like me?”
So lawmakers, please prove her wrong. Please let her know that you are on her side. Decisions that impact her future, that will destroy her district and the unique aspects of Winooski, are now in your hands, sadly.
And to everyone who cares deeply for public education, please stay engaged and keep fighting. My two children, who played on the state lawn before later holding protest signs against ICE, now associate the “golden dome” with making decisions that “hurt our school.” Our young people are always watching; show them that you care about their future.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana has used more than $491,000 in public funds to defend Attorney General Todd Rokita in multiple disciplinary investigations and formal ethics cases, according to new records obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
The state paid four law firms a combined $491,508 between 2022 and 2025 to represent Rokita in at least six separate matters before the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission — investigations that the Republican describes as politically motivated and retaliatory. 
Only two of the investigations resulted in formal disciplinary charges.
The Capital Chronicle previously reported partial figures showing dollars spent on Rokita’s disciplinary defense, but new records provide a more complete accounting.










We’re paying four law firms close to half a million dollars so that Todd Rokita can keep his law license and stay in office. That’s a campaign expense — not something the public should have to fund.


– Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis


The highest payment — more than $240,000 — went to Indianapolis-based Ammeen and Associates, which represents Rokita in the current ethics case still pending before the disciplinary commission.
The state paid an additional $177,650 to Greenwood-based Patrick Olmstead Law; $57,995 to Washington, D.C.-based Schaerr Jaffe; and $15,560 to Indianapolis-based Lewis and Wilkins, according to information released by the attorney general’s office.
Indiana’s Transparency Portal shows the legal firms have previously been contracted by Rokita’s office and other state agencies to assist with separate litigation and legal matters.
But Democrat Rep. Ed DeLaney, a longtime lawyer from Indianapolis, maintained that taxpayers “shouldn’t be footing the bill.”
“We’re paying four law firms close to half a million dollars so that Todd Rokita can keep his law license and stay in office,” he said. “That’s a campaign expense — not something the public should have to fund.”
Indiana has in the past covered legal costs for public attorneys, judges, and prosecutors facing complaints that arise from actions taken in the course of their official duties, as long as those actions aren’t criminal or personal in nature. One section in Indiana Code specifically requires the state to indemnify prosecutors for expenses incurred in lawsuits or disciplinary proceedings related to a “decision, a duty, an obligation, a privilege, or a responsibility of the prosecuting attorney’s office.”
Years of disciplinary investigations
The ongoing complaint stems from Rokita’s nationally televised comments in June 2022 about Indianapolis OB-GYN Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who oversaw a medication abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio that summer.
In an interview with Fox News commentator Jesse Watters, Rokita called Bernard an “activist acting as a doctor” and suggested that she violated patient privacy and state reporting laws. He said his office was investigating her conduct and would be “looking at her licensure.”
The Indiana Medical Licensing Board ultimately found that Bernard had violated patient privacy laws — resulting in a reprimand and a fine — but she was cleared of failing to report the abortion.
Rokita’s office settled an initial complaint about his comments in November 2023. In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to violating two professional conduct rules in exchange for a public reprimand. A third count was dismissed.
Story continues below.
Exhibit B – Affidavit
 
Although he agreed not to contest the charges, the commission found that Rokita recanted almost immediately, suggesting in a public press release — issued just hours after the reprimand — that he had done nothing wrong.
The commission said Rokita acted with “a deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth” and has since opposed his request to dismiss the new charges.
But he maintains the taxpayer expense is the result of a politically charged and unaccountable disciplinary process.
“These investigations require time away from the job Hoosiers elected me to do,” Rokita said in a written statement. “Regardless of their false, politically motivated nature, each grievance, investigation and complaint requires time, attention and office resources to combat.”
“The Commission has caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money to be wasted and there is no end in sight,” he added.
Disciplinary commission rejects Indiana AG Todd Rokita’s call to dismiss latest ethics complaint

James Ammeen, one of Rokita’s defense attorneys, said “the Commission has caused this expensive situation by entertaining politically motivated grievances and by drawing out these investigations as long as legally possible only to not file anything in several cases.”
Three of the six investigations into the attorney general’s conduct originated from a single source, Indianapolis attorney Bill Groth. The labor lawyer was named the Indiana Democratic Party’s “Activist of the Year” in 2018 and has advocated for labor unions, employees and other progressive causes.
The disciplinary commission does not name complainants unless a case becomes public, but Groth and another Indianapolis attorney, Paula Cardoza-Jones, have openly revealed the grievances they filed. Republican State Sen. Liz Brown just last month also said she filed a complaint against Rokita.
“This whole thing still stems from 16 accurate words that I said on a Fox News interview over three years ago,” Rokita said. “Every complaint after has just been a follow-up to try and get me for something because they hate the issues I fight for on behalf of Hoosiers.”
“I accepted responsibility for the timing of my initial comments and indicated at the time that I could always do better,” he added. “Now, the Commission wants to waste time and money claiming I wasn’t ‘sorry’ enough, and wants a new punishment for 16 words said over three years ago.”
Rokita decries system
While defending himself, Rokita has also offered up proposed changes to how the disciplinary commission operates. 
He holds that the members shouldn’t be able to give political donations, and also called for commission meetings involving elected officials to be open to press and public scrutiny.
Rokita and his legal team have accused current and former members of the disciplinary commission of partisan bias. The attorney general specifically took aim at former Chair Bernie Carter, a Democrat who previously served as Lake County prosecutor.

Although he did not vote on Rokita’s current disciplinary complaint, Carter oversaw the commission when multiple earlier investigations into the attorney general’s conduct were opened.
Rokita’s office also pointed to current commission Chair Peter Rusthoven, a Republican lawyer who previously worked within former President Ronald Reagan’s administration.
Amid a GOP split by those who support President Donald Trump — and those who don’t — Rusthoven endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024. Although a longtime GOP donor, he also made contributions to her campaign, and to those for Joe Biden and Liz Cheney — all prominent Democrats or vocal Trump critics.
Rusthoven also believed Trump should be removed from the ballot while Rokita’s office was involved in litigation defending Trump’s candidacy before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
“Some Commissioners undoubtedly disapprove of what the attorney general does and says in office,” said Rokita attorney Paul Mullin, “and (are) willing to impose the minority’s view despite (him) being elected by the largest number of Hoosiers in Indiana history.”
Although most disciplinary commission members donate to political candidates, Rokita said such contributions further undermine the body’s impartiality.
“The Attorney General has been nothing but transparent,” Mullin continued. “Instead, this process is being misused by political enemies and those working against the duly-elected AG’s policies. The strategy is to punish his own truthful speech, causing unneeded public expense and distraction.”
The disciplinary commission operates largely in secret under rules designed to protect reputations during the initial investigation phases. Rokita said that amounts to a lack of transparency, which leaves taxpayers in the dark.
Critics push back
But Rokita’s critics said the attorney general has blurred ethical lines by leveraging his public office for political messaging. 
DeLaney, the state lawmaker, argued that Rokita’s conduct, especially his public comments about Bernard, had little to do with his official duties and instead reflected personal political choices.
 Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis. (From the Indiana House Democrats)
“We didn’t say he had to go on national TV, and we certainly didn’t tell him to say what he said,” DeLaney added. “This isn’t about serving the public. It’s about preserving his own political standing.”
Former Attorney General Curtis Hill funded his own disciplinary defense, but his actions were after hours at a bar and were not work-related.
DeLaney also questioned why four outside law firms were needed.
“He doesn’t need four law firms,” DeLaney said. “He needs one person — to look in the mirror and ask if he’s solving problems or just being one.”
“Rokita brags every time he brings in a nickel for the state,” he continued. “But if we’re going to keep an accounting, we need to count what he’s spending, too. And I’ve never seen another official rack up this kind of bill to protect his own law license.”
Anja Matwijkiw, a professor of professional ethics and human rights at Indiana University Northwest, agreed that there are questions about whether Rokita was acting in his personal or official capacity.
“If he spoke as a private citizen, then his First Amendment rights to free speech are protected — but he should pay for his own legal defense,” Matwijkiw said. “However, if he intended to act in a public capacity, then arguably, the taxpayers’ money can be used. But that requires substantiation: documentation, legal references, citations. Otherwise, we risk entering a conflict of interest.”
She emphasized that the “appearance of a conflict is as important as the reality,” especially when public funds are involved.

“He can’t have it both ways,” she said. “That’s why clarity on his role and intent matters.”
Matwijkiw cautioned, too, against the way the disciplinary process itself is being framed by Rokita and his legal team.
She pointed to the attorney general’s use of the term “lawfare,” a label Rokita has used to describe the commission’s actions, as an example of politicizing the legal process.
“‘Lawfare’ is becoming a trend. It’s when legal arguments are turned into a weapon to undermine the other side rather than promote justice,” Matwijkiw said. “That politicizes the process and risks eroding the rule of law.”
She added that public officials invoking distinctions between law and ethics — such as Rokita’s previous suggestion that attorney ethics rules aren’t statutory law — only deepen the problem.
“If you’re introducing a distinction between ethics and law, then there’s an even greater need to protect the law itself,” she said. “What should come first is preserving the integrity of the law — not protecting political narratives.”
What comes next
The commission has declined public comment on the pending complaint against Rokita, and the case remains before the Indiana Supreme Court.
A decision on the dismissal motion and the disciplinary commission’s new complaint is ultimately up to the high court justices.
If the charges aren’t dismissed — or if the disciplinary commission and Rokita can’t reach a settlement agreement — the justices will appoint a hearing officer to hold a public hearing on the case and hear evidence.
It would be up to the hearing officer to then issue findings and recommendations to the court, which has final say over the outcome of the case.
Sanctions depend on the seriousness of the case. Possible sanctions include a private or public reprimand; suspension from practice for a set period of time; suspension from practice with reinstatement only after the lawyer proves fitness; and permanent disbarment.
The vast majority of grievances filed with the commission are dismissed, however.

(Getty Images)New Mexico could face ballooning costs to address oil and gas wells abandoned by operators – sometimes called “orphan wells” — and the problem is poised to get bigger, a new report said, as more wells reach the end of their lifespans
Current cleanup of 700 wells will cost $208 million and take close to a decade to complete, analysts from the Legislative Finance Committee estimated in a 47-page report released Tuesday. Future plugging of an identified 1,400 wells could cost New Mexico between $700 million dollars to as high as $1.6 billion.
“On top of that, there are more than 3,000 wells on state or private land producing extremely small quantities of oil and gas whose expected cleanup costs far exceed their predicted future revenues, increasing their risk of being orphaned,” the report says.
Unplugged oil and gas wells can pollute groundwater; pose threats to human health from wastewater or gas exposure; and can prevent further extraction from nearby wells. Private owners plug most wells, but since fiscal year 2019 the state has spent more than $50 million to plug about 1,000 orphaned wells.
Analysts recommended four policy proposals for lawmakers to incentivize oil and gas companies to address unplugged wells before they become a state problem.
They include: clarifying the definitions of abandoned and orphaned wells in the law; amending the state limits on bonds for drilling oil and gas wells to reflect cleanup costs; allowing for operators to fund cleanup through trusts; and providing state regulators the power to review or disallow the transfer of wells if the buyer can’t plug or clean them up.
Several other states adopted laws requiring operators to pay a fixed rate into trust funds for certain wells, according to Stephanie Joyce, a program evaluator for the nonpartisan Legislative Finance Committee.
“Think of it as something like a retirement account for a well, where companies put money into a fund over a well’s life, so the money is there when it is needed,” Joyce told lawmakers at a committee meeting in Taos.
Analysts also recommended the Oil Conservation Division adopt new rules to address wells at the end of their lifespan; change its bidding procedures; and adopt controls to ensure that the state is not overpaying contractors for plugging.
The report found the state’s costs for plugging wells have dramatically risen in recent years in part due to plugging deeper, more complex wells, and some inflation, but also due to procurement practices at the Oil Conservation Division.
New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Deputy Secretary Ben Shelton called the report “fair and comprehensive,” noting that the Oil Conservation Division was not originally set up to deal with orphan wells.
“We’re a regulatory agency set up to permit the operation of the oil and gas industry in New Mexico, this is something that has become a bit of an elephant that the division is dealing with,” Shelton said.
In addition, state laws obligating oil and gas companies to pay are insufficient to meet the costs of cleanup, analysts said.
State law limits oil and gas bonds plugging wells to $250,000 for all of a company’s active wells in the state — even as the average cost to plug one well last year was $163,000. More than three dozen oil and gas operators would be required to pay less than $1,000 per well, according to the report.
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) asked Shelton why the the Oil Conservation Division hasn’t pursued more funds from operators to reclaim public money spent on cleanup.
“The juice is not worth the squeeze,” Shelton responded. “I’m not going to send one of my three attorneys doing 100% of enforcement for the state on a two-month goose chase for a $50,000 bond — it’s just not worth the state’s taxpayer dollars.”
Shelton said he was hiring an additional attorney to help pivot to seeking assurance, but noted that it still is insufficient to pay.
Muñoz said the state was shirking its responsibilities to “go after bad actors,” and asked if the division was denying permits to operators with outstanding wells.
Shelton said state law doesn’t give the agency that power.
“The view right now is that we don’t have that sort of bad-actor review on that sort of personal compliance,” he told lawmakers. “If you start a brand-new company that has a clean bill of health and a clean record, then we don’t have the ability to come in and say ‘one of your officers has outstanding liability in another company.’”

Debra Stephens also has concerns, but her faith in the rule of law, the Constitution and the American judicial system keeps her centered and hopeful. 
Like other judges, justices and legal experts I talked to, Stephens holds a more historical perspective of our government systems. As we move deeper into the second Trump administration, you may not be able to embrace her optimism that things will turn out OK, but the data support her perspective. So far, states and advocacy organizations suing the administration over its policies and executive orders are overwhelmingly winning in court. 
America’s court system may be the only thing standing between us and the collapse of our democracy. But can it withstand relentless political pressure, a president flouting norms, and the more mundane challenge of just making sure the gears of the judiciary keep turning and cases move efficiently through the legal system?
According to The New York Times and others tracking court cases against the Trump administration, nearly 200 judicial decisions so far have halted at least temporarily the president’s initiatives. People have already died or been deported or lost their jobs because of Trump’s policies and actions, but it could be worse if the nation’s court system wasn’t as sound.
Stephens worries about courts getting bogged down in toxic public debates about socially divisive issues. But another risk to judicial independence that she flags is considerably less sexy.
“The greatest threat to judicial independence is that courts are overburdened and under-resourced. The ability to just get through those dockets with a limited number of judges is a chronic problem,” she said. 
Just taking care of everyday work is more than the current Washington courts can handle. When a big case comes onto a district court calendar, like the McCleary decision on public school funding or an upcoming adjudication of water rights in Whatcom County, the whole county may need to rewrite its court calendar and move staff and other resources around. 
Stephens said the judicial system, which represents about 0.08% of the state general fund budget, needs more money, but that’s not the whole solution. She thinks the state needs to make a broader social assessment of what we’re asking courts to do. Some things, like addiction, family unification, mental health and income insecurity, might need to move out of the courts into a different system.
Will the system be overwhelmed?
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown agrees that an overburdened judiciary could be a threat to judicial independence because it could lead to instability.
But he’s more concerned about the pressure the Trump administration could put on the system by doing things like attacking judges or calling for their impeachment.
People who would make good judges are already deciding not to pursue that career path, because of the hyper-partisan atmosphere in which they would serve. The assassination in June of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband only underscored the risks and fear public officials must confront these days.
Like Stephens, Brown remains confident in the integrity of the judicial system and doesn’t think it will be overwhelmed even as President Trump is “flooding the zone” with executive actions.
“Our court system will be fine. They’ll make it work,” he said, noting that the judiciary appears to be operating efficiently and independently. 
“And we’re winning. It’s the second quarter of the game, but we’re winning on the scoreboard,” he added. 
It’s the “next quarter” that raises concerns for Brown, his fellow attorneys general across the nation and the citizens who are paying close attention. The attorneys general are working with the courts to keep the pressure on the executive branch to make sure they follow court directives. But no one knows what the future will bring, especially if Congress doesn’t do its job to check the president.
The role of everyday Americans
Retired UW law professor Hugh D. Spitzer said one key to maintaining judicial independence is in the hands of the American people. Everyone should educate themselves about the separation of powers and let their representatives in Congress know how important an independent judiciary is to them. He and others expressed concerns about the need for more civics education and encouraged people to take advantage of any opportunity they have to serve on a jury as a great way to learn how our courts work. 
“On balance, I’m also optimistic that it’s going to work out. But you have to be vigilant,” he said.
Like all the people I interviewed for this story, Spitzer had a nuanced opinion on whether electing or appointing judges was better for judicial independence. But they all agreed that both approaches include some political pressure on those who hold the gavel. Longer periods between elections help with independence, they also agreed. Spitzer added that public financing of judicial races is better than expecting judges to raise money for their campaigns. This seems pretty obvious.
We’ve seen the way judges appointed by Republican presidents, including Trump himself, are stopping some of the current president’s executive orders. This is judicial independence working well: with judges focusing on the law and the Constitution and ignoring political pressures.
Both the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, John Roberts, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, have spoken out recently about the need for judicial independence and have criticized the president’s statements to the contrary. 
“Judicial independence is crucial,” Roberts said at a May gathering of judges and lawyers in Buffalo, New York. He praised the constitutional concept of the three co-equal branches of government. “That innovation doesn’t work if the judiciary is not independent,” he said.
In a talk at the Georgetown Law School in March, Sotomayor agreed with Spitzer that educating the public about the importance of judicial independence. 
“More than ever, we have to get up and explain and repeat and explain again why judicial independence is critical to everyone’s freedom,” Sotomayor said in response to a question about the role of courts in addressing growing challenges to the rule of law. “Once we lose our common norms, we’ve lost the rule of law completely. So it’s going back to figuring out what those are,” she added.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, nominated by President Joe Biden, recently warned at a conference of judges and lawyers about the danger of attacking judges for doing their jobs, as Trump has done, although she did not name the president in her comments. 
Hints from history
Judge Ketu Shah, presiding judge of King County Superior Court, said this moment in U.S. history will pressure test the judicial branch, but he thinks the courts are up for the test. 
He’s been thinking a lot about an 1803 Supreme Court decision, Marbury v. Madison, that made the judicial system what it is today by establishing the right of the courts to rule on the constitutionality of actions by the other two branches of government. 
“The chief justice at the time was very worried about judicial independence but not wanting to offend the current president, Thomas Jefferson,” Shah said. That decision set up the independence of the judiciary, which was essential to keeping the fledgling American system moving in the right direction then and now. “The reason our government has been successful all of these years are the checks and balances between the different branches. We need to hold on to that.”
He drew from history again to talk about another concern. Because even judges are human beings, they will make mistakes (and have made some that many of us could list). The question is: Will they be able to fix them? Shah raises as an example of how mistakes by the judicial system can be fixed, the Dred Scott decision, or Dred Scott v. Sandford, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1857 that slavery was OK. 
That decision, considered by many to be the worst ever from the Supreme Court, was overturned by the 13th and 14th amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery and declared all persons born in the United States to be U.S. citizens, with the same rights. In other words: birthright citizenship, which is currently being debated again in the courts. 
Shah said he thinks the courts are being serious and sober about their role right now, but like the others I interviewed, he’s worried about the tone of political debate affecting the courts and our system of government more generally.
“I wonder what will happen in the future if the amplified voices help people forget the importance of checks and balances,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

(Screengrab via Uthmeier's X account)Last week, Florida’s recently appointed attorney general, James Uthmeier, announced that he had a pretty snazzy idea: Build the state’s biggest immigrant detention center in the middle of the Everglades and call it “Alligator Alcatraz.” (Presumably “Gator Guantánamo” was already taken.)
“You don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there’s not that much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons,” Uthmeier said in a video he posted on X. “Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.”
I predict Uthmeier’s next brainstorm will call for transforming Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ historic home in Coconut Grove into a big public urinal. For toilet paper, he will no doubt provide copies of Florida’s Government in the Sunshine Law.
This week the state began building the prison, rushing the project while ducking questions the same way Gov. Ron DeSantis tried to duck the public last year while rushing construction of golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts in state parks.
The official designation for the detention site is TNT, by the way — the governor should take care that this project doesn’t blow up in his face like his parks plan did.)
As with the failed state parks scheme, pretty much every environmental group in Florida has been screaming bloody murder about it. Watching them reminded me of that scene in “Airplane!” when everyone lines up for a turn to slap one hysterical passenger. It’s clear they’d like to give Uthmeier the same treatment, along with the guy who appointed him.

Hundreds of people turned out Sunday afternoon for a protest at the site off U.S. 41, waving signs that said things like “NO ICE IN THE EVERGLADES.” Even as they protested, though, they could see work was already starting.

The crowd of protesters included Miccosukee tribal elder Betty Osceola, acclaimed nature photographer Clyde Butcher, often called “the Ansel Adams of Florida,” and the daughter of a legendary NFL quarterback who helped lead opposition to DeSantis’ golf course ploy.
This protest “was less about the kind of facility and more about the location of the facility,” said Jessica Namath, daughter of “Broadway Joe” Namath. “I mean, is anything sacred anymore?”
Namath wasn’t just talking about the fact that the Miccosukee Tribe opposes the prison because it’s adjacent to land the tribe regards as sacred. No, the site Uthmeier and DeSantis have picked for their Alligator Alcatraz happens to be one of the most holy places in Florida’s environmental history.
That lonely 10,500-foot-long airstrip is the reason Big Cypress National Preserve exists all around it. It’s the reason writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas became, at age 79, an environmental crusader for the rest of her 108 years of life.
 It’s the place where Miami officials tried to build the world’s largest jetport. They figured that by putting it in the middle of a swamp, no angry neighbors would object.
Boy, were they wrong.
 ‘A new city’
In 1968, the Dade County Port Authority acquired a 39-square mile parcel just six miles north of Everglades National Park and laid out plans for runways six miles long where jets would take off every minute.
For easy access to the site from either side of Florida, they proposed new interstate highway and a high-speed transit system (this is where fans of “The Simpsons” should start chanting, “Monorail!”). There would even be a “recreational waterway” for airboats.
Authority officials saw this massive investment of tax dollars as a way to set off an explosion of private development in what they viewed as a soggy and valueless land.
“A new city is going to rise up in the middle of Florida,” the authority chairman boasted.
Imagine his surprise when an odd coalition formed to oppose this supposedly foolproof plan. Hunters, anglers, high school students, Native Americans, and birdwatchers all said, “Whoa, that’s a terrible idea!”
Thriller writer and Sarasota resident John D. MacDonald even weighed in, writing in “Life” magazine that the jetport would “kill what was left of the Everglades.”
The most politically savvy opponent, Joe Browder, approached Douglas about joining the fight. After all, she’d written THE book on the Everglades. Surely, she wanted to save it.
She demurred, telling Browder nobody would listen to a half-blind old lady like her. They would only pay attention to organizations.
“Well,” Browder asked, “why don’t you start an organization?”
Together, Douglas and Browder founded Friends of the Everglades. (Yes, that venerable organization is in the thick of the current fight too.)
  Marjory Stoneman Douglas via Florida State Archives
“It was that project that drove Marjory into the ranks of active environmentalists,” said Jack Davis, who wrote the definitive biography of this Florida icon.
She knew that the Everglades wasn’t just vital habitat for panthers and gators, Davis said: “She knew that the Everglades recharges the Biscayne Aquifer where South Florida gets its water supply. She made the connection between the ecological health of the Everglades and the quality of human life in South Florida.”
This week, when Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava wrote to state officials posing lots of questions about the Alligator Alcatraz project, she brought that up too: “As a longtime champion of our Everglades and clean drinking water, I am committed to ensuring we continue to provide bipartisan protections for our greatest natural resource.”
Douglas’ greatest ally turned out to be science with a capital S. But, as has often happened during the DeSantis administration, science seems to be getting short shrift this time around.
 The first impact statement
To gauge the ramifications of building a giant jetport in the Everglades, a team from the U.S. Geological Survey put together the nation’s first environmental impact statement.
They were led by a senior scientist named Luna Leopold, the son of “A Sand County Almanac” author Aldo Leopold.
Their analysis found that the jetport would produce 4 million gallons of sewage and 1.5 million gallons of industrial waste every day, plus scatter 10,000 tons of air pollution across the natural landscape. When you added in all the related development, the numbers ballooned.
Nathaniel Reed, then a top aide to Gov. Claude Kirk, used the USGS report to convince his boss to withdraw the state’s support. That led to President Richard Nixon canceling federal support too, which ended the jetport before it got off the ground.
Then, under Nixon’s successor, Gerald Ford, the feds spent $150 million to buy up Big Cypress and turn it into the nation’s first-ever preserve.
Thus, we can thank three Republican politicians — Kirk, Nixon, and Ford — for halting the jetport and preserving a big swamp, Davis pointed out.
But that pro-conservation Republican Party seems to be a thing of the past now.
 Crossing his fingers
The first thing most people knew about this push for a big detention center in our most famous marsh came June 19, when Uthmeier posted about it on X.
That’s hardly the proper forum for alerting the public to a major Florida land-use change, but apparently that’s DeSantis’ preferred method.
Uthmeier’s post emphasized the lonely airstrip, calling it “an old, virtually abandoned facility” that could be used for flying detainees in and out.
Actually, the only thing that’s been abandoned is the pretense that DeSantis cares about fixing the Everglades.
“I’m proud to keep advancing these efforts in Everglades restoration and water quality, which will have lasting benefits to our state for years to come,” he said six months ago. Guess he had his fingers crossed when he spoke those words.
On Wednesday, in his first public comments on the Alligator Alcatraz controversy, DeSantis insisted that adding so many humans and manmade infrastructure to the Everglades will have “zero effect” on the River of Grass, and insisted all the environmental groups and others objecting to the project were just using it as a pretext because they disagree with his anti-immigration stance.
This isn’t just an environmental concern. Last year, the state and federal government earmarked more than $1 billion for restoring the River of Grass, on top of the $5 billion or so spent over the past 20 years. That’s all wasted taxpayer money now, poured down a really big drain.
A study last week found that a healthy Everglades is worth more than $31 billion to the South Florida economy every year. Real estate, tourism, fisheries, and recreation all benefit, the study reported.
Sorry folks, DeSantis is saying, we only support the lock-em-up business now. We can’t do anything to help other Everglades-related industries.
If this DeSantis scheme is disastrous for you, perhaps you can apply to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help — assuming FEMA still exists.
 Tents in hurricane season
Speaking of FEMA, how about that brilliant plan to house more than 1,000 detainees (plus all their guards) in tents and trailers in a remote area with a single road in and out during hurricane season.
And on property that, according to the Miami mayor’s letter, consists of 96% wetlands.
This turned into the topic of a lively discussion at this week’s Collier County Commission meeting.
Although the airstrip has belonged to Miami-Dade for decades, the detention center sits in Collier. The commissioners made it plain they’d been blindsided by the state like everyone else and wanted nothing to do with whatever happens when the next Ian storms ashore.
  Collier County Commissioner Rick LoCastro, via Collier County website
“Sitting here in the middle of hurricane season, I sure would hate to see this plop in our lap,” Commissioner Rick LoCastro said. “A thousand detainees that were sitting in tents [and] now need food, shelter, transportation, and all that.”
“You’re spot on, because even [the land] in between the taxiways is quite low and quite wet,” agreed county emergency management director Dan Sherman. “The contractors are going to have their hands full with anything temporary, even on a good day during the rainy season.”
Hey, maybe the contractors building the site are using undocumented immigrants for all the hot and sweaty construction work. After all, that’s the way we do construction here in Florida.
 Environmental harm
Sherman told the Collier commissioners that state officials had first visited the airstrip in February, but didn’t tell anyone what they were up to.
“It’s a location we’ve been looking at with law enforcement for a while,” Uthmeier told right-wing podcaster Benny “I Swear I Didn’t Know I Was Being Paid Handsomely for Spreading Russian Propaganda” Johnson this week.
He called the swampy site a low-cost alternative to an actual prison and bragged, “As of this morning, the federal government has approved our detention facility plan. … We’ll have 5,000 beds out there by early July.”
Uthmeier didn’t mention anything about consulting environmental experts about the prison’s effect on the Everglades. It’s too bad, because there are likely to be plenty.
  Eve Samples, via Friends of the Everglades
“Negative environmental impacts would include wetland degradation, building construction (even if temporary), water and sewer facilities, light pollution, traffic and emergency services,” Eve Samples, the current executive director of Friends of the Everglades, wrote in a letter to DeSantis. So far, he hasn’t responded, and I bet he never will.
  Kevin Guthrie via Florida Division of Environmental Management
The letter that state Emergency Management Division Director Kevin Guthrie sent to Miami-Dade and Collier officials over the weekend doesn’t mention any of that stuff. Instead, it simply urges the two counties to “work collaboratively … to complete the transaction in an expedient manner.”
The letter shows Guthrie failed to do his homework. He didn’t know who the Collier commission chair was, or that Collier had no claim on the airstrip. He also thought $20 million would be a good price for the property, apparently unaware that recent appraisals said it’s worth $190 million.
Instead of negotiating, the state just swooped in and seized the property on Monday. As justification, Guthrie cited a two-year-old emergency declaration from DeSantis that claimed immigrants are a dire threat to the state — not the boon that farmers, construction companies, and hotel managers know them to be.
The premise of our huge state and federal immigration crackdown — 3,000 arrests a day! — is the implied promise that the detainees will be evil drug dealers, human traffickers, and violent gangbangers. Instead, we’re seeing ICE scoop up an evangelical pastor in Wimauma, a breast-feeding mom in Orlando, and even a born-in-America U.S. citizen in Leon County.
Now picture those poor folks having to sleep in a tent in the Everglades in the heat of summer, fending off skeeters while squishing through the mud to use a Port-A-Potty, fleeing in terror as a hurricane bears down.
Fortunately, I think the opponents of this Gator Gulag have a secret weapon to stop it.
It’s Uthmeier.

 Mr. Oopsie-Daisy
No one voted for Uthmeier. DeSantis appointed him attorney general to reward him for doing such a bang-up job running the governor’s failed presidential campaign.
In his short time in office, he’s already earned the dubious distinction of being the only Florida attorney general to be found in contempt of court.
He also did such a terrific job running the campaign to defeat the ballot initiative to legalize weed that he embroiled both DeSantis and his wife in the Hope Florida scandal (or as I like to call it, “Hope Florida Doesn’t Notice”). One Florida House Republican even accused Uthmeier of fraud and money laundering, and now there’s a criminal investigation.
Before that, as DeSantis’ chief of staff, Uthmeier coordinated the program that fooled asylum-seekers in Texas into boarding taxpayer-funded flights to Martha’s Vineyard. That stunt backfired spectacularly when those immigrants were granted visas as crime victims.
My point is that Uthmeier has been a colossal jinx for DeSantis. He’s a human whoopie cushion, a pratfall waiting to happen. I’m surprised his nickname isn’t “Oopsie-Daisy” Uthmeier.
Who knows? With his track record, maybe we’ll accidentally wind up with enough money to fully restore the Everglades the way we’ve been trying to do for 25 years. I think Marjory would like that.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dade-County-airstrip-in-Ochopee-via-screen-grab-from-Uthmeiers-X-account-1024x501.png,,,2025-06-26 08:01:55.040713

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The Democratic Attorneys General Association is putting big money behind Jay Jones, announcing Thursday a $1 million investment in his campaign to flip Virginia’s attorney general seat and restore Democratic control of the office.
“Jones is a committed public servant who has always put his constituents and their rights first, which is why DAGA is excited to make this early investment to flip the seat back to blue,” the group said in a statement.
The high-dollar move came just one day after the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), the party’s national arm for state legislative races, announced a $400,000 boost to Democratic House of Delegates candidates and a new wave of endorsements in competitive districts. 
The back-to-back funding announcements signal a coordinated national effort to reclaim power in Virginia, where Republicans currently hold all three statewide offices and Democrats remain in control of both chambers of the legislature. 
DAGA President Sean Rankin said the time to act is now, casting Jones as a critical check on recent Republican policies, particularly those of President Donald Trump. 
“Virginia needs an attorney general like Jones who will hold Trump accountable for his unlawful actions,” Rankin said. “Jay Jones is running a campaign to defend democracy and fight for Virginia families, and we are confident he will deliver for the commonwealth as the next attorney general.”
With “so much at stake,” Rankin added, “it’s vital we take back this seat in November, and we’re committed to working with Jones to make that happen.”
Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk and the son of the late Judge Jerrauld C. Jones, won the Democratic nomination last week after narrowly defeating Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor in a hard-fought primary. 
The victory marked a political comeback for Jones, who previously lost the 2021 Democratic nomination for attorney general to then-incumbent Mark Herring. In November, Jones hopes to unseat Republican Jason Miyares.
A graduate of UVA and the University of Virginia School of Law, Jones has focused his campaign on reproductive rights, voting access, criminal justice reform and standing up to what he describes as “an increasingly extreme Republican agenda” at both the state and federal levels. He has said that Virginia’s next attorney general must be prepared to challenge legal efforts to roll back civil liberties and democratic protections.
The $1 million investment is one of the largest early commitments DAGA has made this cycle and underscores the strategic importance of the Virginia race. Attorney general contests have become a national battleground for policy fights ranging from abortion and gun rights to election law and corporate regulation.
Meanwhile, the DLCC’s newly endorsed candidates include Lindsey Dougherty, who’s challenging Republican Del. Carrie Coyner in the 75th District; Leslie Mehta, taking on Del. Mark Earley Jr. in the 89th; May Nivar, running against Del. David Owen in the 57th; and Kacey Robins Carnegie, vying for an open seat in Hampton Roads after GOP Del. Baxter Ennis opted not to seek re-election.
All four won their primaries last week and are now seen as key players in the battle for control of the House. The DLCC described the candidates as part of a broader strategy to “move Virginia forward” and flip seats Democrats narrowly lost in previous cycles.
Virginia’s 2025 election is shaping up to be a high-stakes test for both parties, with all three statewide offices — governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general — on the ballot, alongside the entire 100-member House of Delegates. 
With national figures and outside money pouring into the commonwealth, the contests are likely to preview messaging and strategy ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Twelve jurors had found Marvin Rice guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend. But they could not unanimously agree on whether he should live or die. Missouri is one of two states where a judge gets the final say when jurors can’t agree on the punishment — even when they vote 11 to 1 for life, as they had in Rice’s case.
He then sentenced Rice to death.
“It was a very lonely and daunting position to be in,” Parker, now a defense attorney in south-central Missouri, told The Marshall Project – St. Louis recently.

Defendants were previously sentenced to life without parole when Missouri jurors deadlocked in a capital case. That’s the default most states with the death penalty use today. A few conduct a new penalty phase. Since Missouri changed its law in 1984, Rice is one of at least 18 people who have been sentenced to death by a judge. Four of them have been executed. 
Missouri is an outlier in allowing judges to impose death. Some say judges have a better legal understanding of the death penalty than juries and argue that some crimes are so heinous that death is appropriate even when a jury isn’t unanimous. Opponents say the process undermines the importance of juries and that one person should not decide life or death. They also say the way Missouri’s statute is written is unconstitutional. 
“It is an issue that remains an issue,” said Robert Dunham, an attorney and director of the Death Penalty Policy Project.
There’s also a racial component when it comes to the death penalty in Missouri. Of the 18 people sentenced by judges, 11 — or 61% — were Black. Forty-one percent of all the defendants sent to death row in the state were Black, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center. That is dramatically disproportionate in a state where 11.7% of the population is Black, according to U.S. Census data.
Rice was later resentenced to life without parole on account of other violations in his case, including comments from the prosecution that infringed on Rice’s Fifth Amendment rights referencing his decision not to testify. 
 From death row to life

The jury in Joseph Whitfield’s 1994 trial in St. Louis also voted 11 to 1 for life in prison without parole. 
Whitfield’s life was spared after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Ring v. Arizona, which ruled in 2002 that only a jury can decide on facts necessary to impose the death penalty. In Whitfield’s case, the Missouri Supreme Court said jurors must first agree on two categories of facts to impose death: the presence of an aggravating circumstance and that it outweighs any mitigating factors. These steps would continue to be a source of legal disputes in life-or-death decisions for years to come.
In the third and final step, the so-called mercy step, jurors decide if they still want to impose death. That can be carried out by jurors or, if they cannot agree, a judge. 
In several Missouri cases where a judge had been the decider, it wasn’t clear where jurors hit a roadblock in the process or what aggravators and mitigators they had discussed.
Execution date set for man sentenced to die by a Missouri judge over 2005 murder

Eleven of the 18 judge-imposed death sentences have been changed to life. Most were a cascading consequence of Ring and Missouri’s subsequent decision for Whitfield, who died in prison on May 26 at age 85, according to the Missouri Department of Corrections. 
Among them was Deandra Buchanan. In March 2002, he was found guilty of fatally shooting his aunt, girlfriend and stepfather. The jury could not agree on a sentence. 
The judge handed down death.
He was resentenced to life without parole by the Missouri Supreme Court in the wake of the Ring decision. He was not present when the court revisited his case. In September 2024, public defender Tyler Coyle filed a motion arguing Buchanan’s life sentence was invalid because he had a right to be in court. 
A judge denied the motion on June 16. Coyle said he will appeal. 
 A recent execution

Amber McLaughlin was sentenced to death by St. Louis County Circuit Judge Steven Goldman in November 2006. McLaughlin became the first openly transgender person to be executed in the U.S. when she died by lethal injection on Jan. 3, 2023. 
Before becoming a judge, Goldman — then a prosecutor — helped devise the law that gave judges the power to impose death sentences.
Other states have moved to limit judicial death sentences. In a 2016 decision from the Supreme Court of Delaware, the justices said the state’s capital punishment statute was unconstitutional because it allowed judges to make findings on the aggravating circumstances and weigh those against mitigators. The ruling ended the death penalty in Delaware. Only Missouri and Indiana continue to permit a judge to impose death when a jury is hung. Indiana is less active when it comes to capital punishment, having executed 15 people since 2000. Missouri has executed 60, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center.
Goldman said judges have more familiarity with the death penalty. 
“I think judges are well qualified to do it, probably more so than juries in that regard,” he said. 
Retired Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Wolff said the right to a jury trial is fundamental. 
“Especially in death penalty cases, but in every case that jurors hear, the jury is, among other things, a conscience of the community,” Wolff said. 
As McLaughlin’s execution date approached, Wolff and six retired circuit judges wrote to then-Gov. Mike Parson, urging him to commute McLaughlin’s sentence to life without parole. They said her sentence had been reversed in 2016 because her trial attorney failed to present information about her mental health. That mitigating evidence could have tipped the scales when the jury couldn’t agree. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals later overturned the 2016 decision. 
When Goldman sentenced McLaughlin, he acknowledged there were conflicting rules and said it wasn’t clear what mitigating circumstances were considered by the jury, according to court transcripts. 
Larry Komp, a federal public defender who represented McLaughlin in her appeals, said he didn’t think the court’s actions were constitutional. 
“But I guess it is in Missouri,” he said. 
The Missouri Supreme Court itself has noted the importance of juries in death penalty cases. In denying a stay for Kevin Johnson before he was executed in 2022, the court emphasized that the jury had found the aggravators, weighed them and decided on death. 
If officials genuinely believed in juries, Komp said, “Amber wouldn’t have been executed.” 
 Waiting on death row

Missouri has cleared much of its death row, primarily through a steady stream of executions that picked up as the pandemic waned. The state carried out four executions in 2023 and another four in 2024. Craig Wood, 57, and Lance Shockley, 48, are two of the eight people remaining. Both were sentenced by judges. 
During an appeal in Wood’s case, the Missouri Supreme Court backtracked on the three-step process juries go through. Now, a jury only has to unanimously agree on the presence of an aggravator.
Several attorneys said they doubt questions about the process authorizing judge-imposed death sentences would be taken up by the courts again. That leaves it up to the Missouri Legislature. 
In the past eight years, at least 14 pieces of legislation were drafted to repeal the law allowing judges to impose the death penalty. Most were sponsored by Republicans. 
Another bill to repeal the law got a hearing this year in the Senate, where it was debated for over 90 minutes. It was sponsored by state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold.
“It is my firm belief that one person in the state of Missouri should not hold the power of the state to kill somebody,” she said during Senate debate. 
The bill died.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250620_Kim_STL-JUDGE-DEATH-PENALTY_header-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

Get rid of states? Legal scholar Stephen Legomsky, who taught for 34 years at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, has just published a book, “Reimagining the American Union,” that proposes a radical idea: Abolish state government. The Conversation’s politics and democracy editor, Naomi Schalit – a former statehouse reporter herself – interviewed Legomsky about the provocative idea behind his book, in which he advocates moving most of the functions of state government down to the local level, closer to those represented and governed by it.
 You propose abolishing states. Why?

The book is a thought experiment. The proposal I’m offering is long term. I realize we need states during the current political moment.
I think the states are the root cause of many, if not most, of the current dangers faced by U.S. democracy. I also see the states as a significant source of fiscal waste. We don’t need three levels of government – national, state and local – all regulating us and all taxing us. Two would do just fine. And after careful, detailed analysis, I concluded that every benefit ever claimed for state government could be achieved at least as well, and in many cases better, by the local governments.
 I’m imagining the framers sitting in Independence Hall. And you go back in time and suggest to them not having states. I think most of them would drop dead at the thought, because it ultimately implies a much more powerful federal government. What would you say to them?

After they stop laughing, I would emphasize that I’m not proposing a wholesale transfer of power from the states to an all-powerful, all-knowing central government. Yes, some of the functions currently performed by the states could better be performed at the national level, but I’m proposing that the lion’s share devolve down to the local governments, which are even closer to the people they represent than the state legislatures can ever be.
Some of the most ardent Federalists, including Alexander Hamilton and James Wilson, referred to the states as “artificial beings” or “imaginary beings.” They accepted the states only because keeping them was politically essential to getting the required nine state ratifications, not because they thought states were a good idea.
 What functions would your plan hand over to the federal government?

A prime example is licensing. I looked up all the different occupations that require state licenses. I was astonished: practically every health care profession, barbers, engineers, lawyers, architects, the list is endless.
If you live near a state line, you can’t practice in both states unless you get two licenses. If you move to another state, you have to get another license. This seems silly. The human anatomy, human hair, engineering principles, don’t change as you cross from New York to New Jersey. Nor do we need 50 different state driver’s licenses; a single national license administered through local agencies would be more efficient.
 You say states are the root cause of the greatest threats to American democracy. What are those threats?

The structural threats are those that are baked into the Constitution itself. The Electoral College is one. On five occasions, the Electoral College has awarded the presidency to the candidate whom the voters rejected nationwide. And there were many, many near misses where the popular vote loser almost became president, making many such future instances a statistical certainty.
Perhaps even more important, every state, no matter how large or how small, gets the same number of U.S. senators. In fact, a majority of the U.S. population is represented by only about 18% of the Senate. The minority gets the other 82%.
These counter-majoritarian defects in the elections of both presidents and senators have a ripple effect. They skew the composition, and thus the decisions, of the federal courts. Three of the current Supreme Court justices were appointed by President Donald Trump after he had lost the national popular vote; five of the current Supreme Court justices were confirmed by senators who collectively represented only a minority of the U.S. population.
Here’s one especially jarring statistic: From 1969 until today, the Democratic presidential nominees won the national popular vote in a slight majority of the elections. Yet, during the presidential terms that resulted from those elections, Republican presidents have gotten to make 15 of the 20 Supreme Court appointments.
The Constitution also gives the states broad powers to regulate and run national elections. State legislatures have used those powers to pass gerrymandering, voter suppression and other counter-majoritarian laws.
 If you devolve these functions and services to localities, wouldn’t you end up with a mirror of the current state-level structure? Wouldn’t this just send a lot of state personnel down to the local level?

Yes, much of that structure would devolve. However, I see that as a good thing. Devolution is unavoidable in a country this size. Not everything can be done by the central government. The question for me is, do we need two levels of subordinate political subdivisions or one? One seems more efficient. And when problems are too big for one local government to handle on its own, it can partner with other local governments or with the national government, just as many local governments do today.
 If there were no states to gerrymander or pass voter-suppression laws, wouldn’t some national government agency just do it instead?

Redistricting would be performed by a nonpartisan redistricting commission that I propose be made up of technicians, mainly demographers, statisticians and geographers, under broad, general principles enacted by Congress. That’s what almost every other democracy in the world does today.
 Why did you write this book?

For a long time, I’ve been distressed about so many of the dangers to our democracy. So, one day, I found myself compiling what ended up becoming a fairly long mental list of all of my democracy-related grievances.
 A list of grievances like in the Declaration of Independence!

That’s a nice analogy. And as I thought about that list, it suddenly struck me that the vast majority of these problems couldn’t occur without states. That got me thinking about whether we really need states in the first place.
 If it’s just a thought experiment, something that’s not going to happen, why would you think it’s worthwhile spending time writing this?

And why would I be so vain as to think anybody would want to waste their time reading it?
 And your answer is, ‘Because I’m an academic!’

It’s that, plus more. I do hope there’s some scholarly value in this. But I’m also writing for the long term. States are secure for now, but history teaches us that the more distant future is full of surprises.

Steve Daines (R-Montana) speaks at a rally in Bozeman in support of Senate candidate Tim Sheehy and former President Donald Trump on Aug. 9, 2024. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montanans cherish our wide-open spaces because they are the backbone of our economy, the spectacular beauty that makes Montana special, and the shared birthright of every American.

So when Sen. Steve Daines quietly collaborated with Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to slip an amendment into the so-called “big beautiful bill” that would have forced the sale of as many as 3 million acres of public land and opened approximately 250 million more to auction, they weren’t proposing “budget savings.” They were engineering the largest transfer of wealth from taxpayers to wealthy private interests in American history.

Daines proudly messaged Montana would be exempt—knowing another member of Congress could add it back in at any time. His office never produced a single safeguard to prevent it. Make no mistake: Daines signed off on a plan to slice up America’s outdoor legacy for hedge funds, developers and foreign mining conglomerates.

Only after after a wave of public outrage from wildlife and land conservationists, hikers, campers, anglers, hunters, and recreation businesses and the Senate Parliamentarian ruled the amendment extraneous under the Byrd Rule—did Daines reverse course. This was not an act of accountability. It was damage control. Had the parliamentarian ruled the other way—or had the scheme remained under the radar—Daines would have proceeded with his scheme.

Equally troubling is Sen. Tim Sheehy’s complicity.

While Montanans flooded phone lines to protect our lands, Sheehy only offered support for the broader bill. His failure to promptly oppose Daines’ land-sale scheme speaks volumes about where he stands when corporate donors clash with Montana’s values and economy.

The amendment would have erased habitat for wolves, elk, wolverines, grizzlies, Canada lynx, and hundreds of other species, and fast-tracked drilling and logging. It would have undercut an economy that depends on healthy, accessible landscape that generates billions annually. Every acre siphoned into private hands would be one less for the average camper, hunter or mountain biker seeking solitude under big skies.

Daines hopes voters will only blame Sen. Lee. But Montanans—and all Americans who treasure public lands—must never forget or forgive his egregious co-authorship to liquidate the public trust. Trust is earned through consistent action based on values, not reversals and rewritten press releases. If Daines and Lee find a loophole to the Byrd Rule, the next land-grab could appear at 2 a.m. on the last pages of a must-pass bill.

Moving forward we must demand permanent protections. Congress must pass legislation with a clear and permanent “no-sale” clause for our public lands—no loopholes, no carve-outs. Public lands, no matter their location, belong to all of us.

We must also hold Daines and Sheehy accountable. Don’t let Daines off the hook for co-authoring a massive public land giveaway. Don’t forget Sheehy’s attempt to distract from his complicity by pointing to Montana’s temporary carve-out—while still praising the amended bill.

If ever there was a time to support conservation groups, it’s now. We are out-funded by special interest dark money groups and their lobbyists. Keep calling, writing, and showing up. Politicians count on our exhaustion. Prove them wrong.

Public lands are our inheritance. The BBB land-sale fiasco showed just how close we came to losing them. Vigilance and public outcry defeated greed this time. Let’s make sure Senators like Daines and Sheehy—beholden to the wealthy and special interests—never get another chance to steal our land from us again.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
 Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.










The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares


“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
 Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.
Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
 Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.
“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin is calling on the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office to reconsider plans to adopt the use of facial recognition technology. Like the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), the sheriff’s office is considering acquiring facial recognition technology from the company Biometrica. The company has offered MPD free access in exchange for 2.5 million images, jail records, and other related data of people who have passed through Milwaukee’s criminal justice system, including many who presumably haven’t been convicted of a crime. 
“Given all the public opposition we’ve seen to the Milwaukee Police Department’s push to expand their use of facial recognition, the news of the Sheriffs office’s interest in acquiring this technology is deeply concerning,” Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director for the ACLU of Wisconsin, wrote in a statement for an ACLU press release. “Law enforcement’s use of facial recognition software poses a number of serious threats to civil rights and civil liberties, making it dangerous both when it fails and when it functions.” 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Just days ago, Milwaukee County Sheriff Denita Ball revealed that her office was looking into adopting facial recognition software. Ball told county supervisors during a June 17 meeting of the Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and General Services Committee Urban Milwaukee reported, that she was assessing a data-sharing agreement for the technology. MCSO did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Like MPD, the sheriff’s office is exploring an agreement with Biometrica, a company which has pushed back against concerns about privacy and the use of its surveillance tools. Biometrica offers a third-party facial recognition algorithm to agencies like the Milwaukee police and the sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office states that rather than using the technology for untargeted surveillance, it aims to use facial recognition software to identify people once investigators have an image of a criminal suspect. Ball says that facial recognition would never be the sole basis for an arrest or charges, Urban Milwaukee reported.
On Thursday, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors will vote on a resolution requiring the creation of a regulatory process for adopting facial recognition technology. Both at the county and city government meetings, however, law enforcement agencies have been met with public skepticism about their exploration of facial recognition technologies. 
Tension bubbled up during a hearing before the Milwaukee Equal Rights Commission last week. Police department Inspector Paul Lough  said that facial recognition could provide important leads for investigations similar to those derived from confidential informants and information databases used to run names. During the hearing, MPD officials presented examples of cases in which facial recognition technology helped solve crimes. “Whether or not they would’ve…may or may not have been solved without the use of facial rec., it’s hard to say,” said Lough. “Some probably would have been, some might still be open. But the important part of it is that all of the ones that we’re going to go over are very predatory in nature where there’s exigent circumstances to solve them quickly.”

MPD Capt. James Hutchinson went over two investigations from March 2024 which utilized facial recognition technology. One involved a drive-by shooting, where a passing car opened fire on a pedestrian, who died on the scene. Hutchinson explained that MPD obtained images from surveillance cameras, which were then sent to partner agencies with the ability to run facial recognition requests. Within 16 hours, the police captain told the commission, a potential suspect had been identified. 
“We don’t know who they are when we get those pictures back, but we have ways of vetting that information, confirming the identification provided to us,” said Hutchinson. “And that’s what we did in this case.” Unique tattoos helped narrow the search to a man who was wearing a GPS bracelet. When officers went to conduct an arrest, they found two alleged shooters, their guns and the car they are believed to have used. Hutchinson said that a trial is pending for both suspects arrested in that case. 
Facial recognition was also used in a sexual assault case, which occurred two days before the shooting. A victim had been followed home in the rain by a man offering her his umbrella, and asking for money. He mentioned that he’d already tried asking for money at a nearby gas station. As they walked, he held a gun to her head and forced her into a garage where he assaulted her. Officers were able to locate the garage with the victim’s help using Google Maps, and later the gas station the man had mentioned before. Surveillance camera photos potentially capturing the man were sent to other agencies for facial recognition assistance, which came back with images of a man who was on probation for sexual assault. He was identified both by the probation agent and the victim, and was sentenced to 20 years of incarceration. 
MPD listed 13 additional cases where it used facial recognition, including a string of taco truck robberies on Milwaukee’s South Side involving a group of masked assailants. Although they appeared careful to cover their faces, one suspect let his mask down briefly, which was seen by a camera, and sent to a partner agency for identification. In that case, three to four potential suspects were identified by the technology, each with a certain percentage of certainty such as 97%, 95% and so on. After further investigation, detectives identified those responsible for the taco truck robberies as people flagged by the  facial recognition search with the lowest percentage of certainty.

During public testimony, several people expressed concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition technology. Facial recognition software has been shown to have trouble identifying non-white faces, and is prone to errors particularly when identifying people of color. Some feared that defendants might have trouble learning how facial recognition was used in their cases, and felt that police oversight was lacking. Others pointed to the 2.5 million images MPD would give to Biometrica in exchange for the software licenses, and argued that such a move would only further harm community trust in the police. Because the images include mugshots, it’s possible that people whose images were included in that transaction will not be convicted of a crime after being  arrested or detained at the jail for a period of time. Other questions included  what access federal agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), would have to MPD’s facial recognition system. 
“As we recently found, MPD has been using facial recognition technology on the faces of Milwaukeeans for years, without being transparent with the public or the FPC,” Krissie Fung, a member of the Milwaukee Turners and Milwaukee’s Fire and Police Commission (FPC), said during public testimony. “Because there’s no standard operating procedure to provide guidelines around their process, relying on MPD to follow their own gentlemen’s agreements and internal process is just not how oversight works.” 
Fung also said MPD Chief Jeffrey Norman acknowledged when he was reappointed that there is no way to guarantee the safety of the data and faces of Milwaukeeans, and that the data would be going to a third-party company the city does not oversee and which uses algorithms the city will not be able to  access. “MPD’s proposal is to trade 2.5 million mugshots in exchange for this license which, by the way, includes my mugshot,” said Fung. “I believe that there are serious legal concerns that have not yet played out in the courts, and that would open us up to significant lawsuits.”

“I cannot help but wonder if the reason Biometrica is so thirsty to trade 2.5 million ‘jail records or mugshots’ in exchange for free access to this technology, is that they assume that those jail records are Black faces, and they clearly need more Black faces to train their inaccurate algorithm,” Fung added. “But we don’t need to let them get those Black faces from Milwaukee.”
“I don’t know a single person in this city that trusts the police,” said Ron Jansen, who has testified about law enforcement at previous city and county meetings. “So the last thing Milwaukee needs to do is hand this department a tool that creates even greater opportunity to harm the people of this city.” 
“This is not free,” Jansen added.  “… the cost is 2.5 million mugshots of residents, non-residents, whatever. Anybody who’s been through the system here in Milwaukee…2.5 million human beings…Human beings, maybe half of which or more, were never convicted of a crime. This includes people who were wrongfully arrested, or accused, or just anyone who was ever booked into their custody. And while I was writing this, I thought, ‘that also includes people who’ve already been victimized by this department.’ People who have been beaten by the police. People who have been wrongfully accused by the police. This is your biological data, my biological data, everyone’s biological data, and it is being sold to a private company without your consent, all so that they can expand their surveillance network.” 
Jansen asserted that the millions of images could include protesters, teachers, even state Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who was wrongfully arrested by MPD during a curfew. “His arrest record is likely in there,” said Jansen. He also raised the 2025 case of officer Juwon Madlock, who used his access to police databases to pass intelligence about confidential informants and the home addresses of  targets to gangs searching out rivals. “If this is already happening, imagine what will happen when their abilities get expanded,” said Jansen.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Congress is trying to push the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” into law through a legislative shortcut known as reconciliation. At its root, reconciliation means restoring harmony, mending what’s broken, and finding common ground. 
In our personal lives, it’s a path toward healing. But in Congress, that word has been twisted.
It is now being used to force through legislation that would strip health care and food access from millions of Americans, including thousands of Oklahomans, with little debate, no bipartisan support, and devastating consequences for families.
The budget reconciliation process, created in 1974, was designed to fine-tune fiscal policy. It was never meant to serve as a backdoor for major policy changes. It was intended to be used sparingly to balance budgets, not to upend lives. But today, it is being exploited. The current reconciliation bill is being rushed through without transparency, accountability or consensus. And if passed, it will cause real harm right here in Oklahoma.
An estimated 15 million people nationwide could lose their health coverage. As many as 172,000 of them live in Oklahoma — a state already struggling with access to care and ranked near the bottom in health outcomes.
The bill could slash Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits at a time where inflation and food insecurity in our rural communities are spiking. It could end enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, making insurance unaffordable for working families and seniors. It would also gut Medicaid, a program nearly 1 in 4 Oklahomans depend on.
This is not fiscal responsibility. It is cruelty disguised as policy.
I’ve lived what many families are facing. I remember when my youngest daughter had the flu and needed antibiotics. Our Medicaid had just lapsed due to a paperwork issue. I was told it would take two weeks to reprocess. I sat in my car outside the pharmacy, torn between paying out of pocket for the prescription or keeping our electricity on.
I chose the medicine because, for my family, living without electricity is less harmful than living without medication. I’ll never forget the feeling of panic and helplessness from having to make that choice. But what happens in summertime extreme heat episodes when people need medicine and electricity to survive? There is no choice when living without either could mean death.
That’s the reality of poverty. It is not just numbers on a budget sheet. It is day-to-day survival. It means deciding between food and medication, between health and heat. 
These are not abstract policy outcomes. They are real decisions families are forced to make because lawmakers continue to choose politics over people.
The bitter irony is, Congress is using reconciliation to divide and dismantle instead of to heal. The very meaning of the word has been lost in the rush to pass harmful policies. There is nothing reconciliatory about cutting food and health care from families while handing tax breaks to the wealthy.
It’s important to reflect on why our Republican congressional representatives Stephanie Bice, Josh Brecheen, Tom Cole, Frank Lucas, and Kevin Hern chose to support a reconciliation bill that removes vital resources from the very communities they represent. 
As a lifelong Oklahoman, I am not just disappointed. I am disheartened. We elect our representatives to fight for us, not to turn a blind eye to our struggles. It is painful to see them back legislation that would cause real harm to the families and communities they swore to protect.
The bill is now in the Senate. Will senators James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin turn their backs on us or will they listen to the voices of their constituents, neighbors and church members who will feel the impact of this bill the most?
Oklahoma has a proud tradition built on the idea of community. We pride ourselves on the Oklahoma Standard, which is neighbors helping neighbors and showing up in times of need. After tornadoes and wildfires, we do not ask who deserves help. We simply give it. But no one, no matter how hardworking, can thrive when the basic supports are stripped away.
Cutting health care and food aid is not aligned with Oklahoma values. It is a betrayal of them.
Hopefully our Oklahoma delegation will choose to lead and show Washington what reconciliation should look like.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho can enforce a state law that bans children from receiving gender-affirming care.
For a few months in early 2024, a federal court injunction blocked Idaho from enforcing the state law for all children in Idaho. But in April 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the judicial block to only apply to the minors who sued over the law.
The lawsuit’s dismissal on June 18 ended judicial blocks, allowing Idaho to enforce the law, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office says.
“No one has the right to harm children,” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement. “For two years, my office defended Idaho’s common-sense law that protects kids from experimental procedures with lifelong, irreversible consequences.” 
The lawsuit was dismissed because the suing transgender minors moved out of state, ACLU of Idaho announced.

The same day as Idaho’s lawsuit was dismissed, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar state law in Tennessee, ruling that children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class, the Tennessee Lookout reported. 
“Idaho has done what it set out to do – drive out transgender people who don’t want to tolerate the unnecessary hostility toward them,” ACLU of Idaho Advocacy Fellow Jenna Damron said in a statement. “I wish I could say this ruling is surprising, but I’m not surprised. Still, I want every trans kid out there to know: You are loved. You are worthy. And we will keep fighting for you, no matter what this court says.”
Idaho doctors brace for impact on impending gender-affirming medication ban

Idaho’s law, passed in 2023, bans puberty blockers, hormones and surgical interventions for Idaho youth seeking gender-affirming care. But the law doesn’t ban all gender-affirming care for children, such as mental health services, hair removal, speech therapy, and period suppression. Idaho doctors previously told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
If doctors violate Idaho’s law, they could face a felony criminal charge. Surgeries were already not happening on minors in Idaho, the Sun previously reported.
The Alliance Defending Freedom, an influential conservative Christian law firm, helped represent Idaho in the lawsuit. Labrador and the law firm in 2023 signed an agreement to allow the firm to represent Idaho, for free, in litigation. 
ACLU of Idaho says it is still working on other lawsuits to protect trans rights, including challenges to Idaho’s law banning trans students from participating in sports teams of their same gender and against Idaho’s ban on using public funds for gender-affirming care, including in prisons.

(Getty Images)The charter school movement in Indiana is growing with a new option designed for rural families called microschools – each tailored to the community it serves. 
This fall, Eastern Hancock Schools in partnership with the Indiana Microschool Collaborative, will open Nature’s Gift Microschool — a small school located in the woods of Nameless Creek Youth Camp, about 30 miles east of Indianapolis. 
Collaborative board member Scott Bess, who is president and CEO of the Indiana Charter Innovation Center, said urban areas in Indiana have almost every option available for schools – traditional schools, charter schools or private schools. But suburbs and rural regions face limited choices, often forcing families to drive long distances or homeschool children, which is not always an option for everyone. 
“You can set up microschools in areas where you don’t need a 100,000 square foot building and all of the infrastructure,” Bess said. “You don’t need 400 students in places where the population wouldn’t support that.”
Nature’s Gift Microschool, in development for 18 months, welcomes K-12 students on a first-come, first-served application process. The school will operate as a public charter school, meaning it receives state and federal funding like any other public school. However, its small size and administration model allows more funding to go directly into the classroom, Bess said.
Indiana lawmakers passed more than two dozen K-12 education laws and funding changes in the state’s next two-year budget. 
Despite a statewide teacher shortage, Bess said teachers have been eager to join microschools and shown strong interest. He said many are drawn to the increased flexibility and the opportunity to work more closely with students. 
  Eastern Hancock Superintendent George Philhower
According to Bess, microschool teachers are not asked to prepare lesson plans every day and sit down with a group of 25 or more kids. Each classroom is multi-age, making the teacher more of a coach or facilitator. 
Eastern Hancock Superintendent George Philhower helped launch the microschool after speaking with local parents who opted out of sending their children to district schools. 
“The Indiana Microschool Collaborative is designed to give families more flexibility while ensuring students are still connected to a supportive school community. It’s one way we’re working to make education more personal, relevant, and responsive to the needs of students and families. We believe models like this can help Indiana better serve those who may not thrive in a traditional setting.” Philhower said. 
Bess said the goal of the IMC is to make all of the microschools hyper-local, driven by community demand. 
“This isn’t something where we’re going to say, hey, we’re going to open a new school in this community, and like no one asked for it, this is going to be more community, parent, student driven asking us, hey, we’d love to have you here,” Bess said. 
He said that in the next 10 years, they are expecting hundreds of microschools to open across the state. They are still collaborating with districts to find ways for students to participate in clubs or athletic programs since microschools will not have their own. 
This is not the first of its kind in Indiana. The Purdue Polytechnic High School Lab School opened in the fall 2023 in Indianapolis with about 20 students, and is among the dozen microschools across the state. 
“There’s no ‘this is exactly what a microschool is,’” Bess said. “In the following years under Indiana Microschool Collaborative they will all be different because the community they are serving is different. The students they are serving are different and the parents certainly are different.”

Due to shifting demographics, many Wyoming school districts are facing cuts to Title I funds for things like tutoring, professional development and kindergarten prep. 
The post Declining federal funds, late notice extinguish Ms. Paula’s preschool ‘magic’ appeared first on WyoFile .","At the head of a classroom in Lander, Paula Vincelette held up a small plastic pig and asked a dozen preschoolers to help the pig build a house with bricks. The students-turned-builders intently mimed the construction of small imaginary homes on the carpet in front of them. 
As Vincelette continued with the story of the “Three Little Pigs,” she paused often with prompts and questions. On cue, her rapt pupils enthusiastically repeated the famous tagline: “Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!!” 
It may have looked like a simple storytime, but Vincelette incorporated elements meant to prepare these children for the kindergarten classroom next year. Like constructing a house brick by brick, they were honing their listening skills and building vocabulary; learning how to raise their hands and speak in turn. Later, when she paired them up to build their own little story sets using actual props, they worked on sharing, body awareness and communication. 
As the early childhood education liaison for Fremont County School District 1, Vincelette has done this kind of work for five years. Along with direct instruction, she has also worked with child care providers and parents in her overarching goal to build better early childhood education foundations for district children. 
Her position, however, is coming to an end. The school district discovered late this spring that its 2025-26 federal Title I funds — which supplement state and local funding for low-achieving children — would be cut by roughly $86,000. Administrators made what they described as an extremely difficult choice to terminate the position.
Although the end of the early childhood education job comes amid a torrid of federal cuts fueled by President Donald Trump’s DOGE efforts, this one is unrelated. Title I funds are calculated based on demographics, specifically the number of children living in poverty. The number of Fremont County children living in poverty declined from 227 in the last cycle to 182 in this one, according to the Wyoming Department of Education. 
A similar demographic shift is occurring across much of the state. But what can on its face be interpreted as a positive trend had the downstream effect of reducing funding in most of Wyoming’s school districts. Notice from the federal government of decreases was months late, leaving many administrators scrambling after budgets were set. And, in places like Fremont County, it means an end to what many parents and supporters call a life-changing educational opportunity.

“Our family definitely benefited from Paula’s programs,” said Lander mom Amelia Decker. Decker started attending Vincelette’s free programs for families when her older son was a baby, received individual help when he was in preschool and enrolled him in the kindergarten transition session last summer. 
“Her advice, the space she offered for myself and other parents, and the learning opportunities about how to interact with my children shaped me as a mother and opened up so many connections for our family,” Decker said. 
In an era when educational experts say the role of early childhood education is crucial, many in Fremont County hope the district will be able to reinstate Vincelette’s position in the future. 
Census numbers and federal funds
The number of Wyoming children ages 5-17 living in poverty dropped between the 2022 and 2023 U.S. Census, the basis for calculating ‘25-26 Title I allocations. The number fell by nearly 700 children, from 11,420 to 10,731, according to WDE calculations. The state’s total population of children ages 5-17, meanwhile, remained relatively stable, barely budging from 98,774 to 98,764. But statewide public school enrollment has been falling for at least five years, a trend educators attribute to factors like more parents deciding to homeschool their children. 
The poverty-related shift resulted in a statewide drop of a little over $1 million for the federal Title I funds compared to the ‘24-25 school year, state figures indicate. 
Though it’s hard to say what specific mix of factors contributed to the trend in Wyoming, tax credits and stimulus payments in conjunction with relief programs were credited with the largest nationwide one-year drop in childhood poverty in 2021. 
Funding impacts for the incoming school year vary between districts. A decrease of 160 students in Natrona County District 1, for example, created a funding drop of roughly $63,000, and in Albany County School District 1, a decrease of 37 children living in poverty resulted in a loss of roughly $6,000. 
But in Teton County School District 1, the number of children in poverty increased from 134 to 153, which resulted in a funding bump of $307,000. The majority, however, will receive less Title I money. 
Fremont County School District’s Title I Coordinator Deidre Meyer’s job every year is “to look at our funding and see where this money is going to best serve our students under Title I,” she said.  


Under the federal regulations, Meyer noted, “the majority of the Title I funding for preschool is supposed to be spent on Head Start and [Community Development Services].”
Up until late May, she was operating under the assumption that the funding level was stable. But late that month, she received an email from the Wyoming Department of Education with the updated federal allocations. Those updates normally arrive by February. That’s when Meyer realized she would have significantly less to work with, she said. 
She attempted to move funds around, she said, but it wasn’t enough. Ultimately, she cut the early childhood liaison position because it was the option that affected the smallest number of students while still fulfilling the Title I grant requirements, she said. 
“It was very hard,” Meyer said. “It was a tough one.”
The timing only made it harder, FCSD1 Superintendent Mike Harris said. By the time the May 21 notification arrived, “our staffing decisions are pretty much done.” 
The tardiness, he said, “put a lot of districts in a tough spot. For those that are getting reduced funding now, they’re looking at their proposals and their projections, and they’re having to revise a lot.” 
It is unclear why the projections were so late this year, but the federal Department of Education has been in flux since the Trump administration laid off an estimated 1,400 employees this spring. That issue is tied up in litigation. 
A passion for early education 
It’s never a pleasant experience to learn you will no longer have a job, Vincelette said. Despite that, she had no ill words about the district and said she understood the difficult choice. 
Vincelette grew up in Rock Springs and pursued elementary education at the University of Wyoming. There, she studied under renowned UW professor Nikki Baldwin. 
“The way she taught was making you really think outside the box and push the quote-unquote standard of what we think early childhood should be,” Vincelette said. “I really connected with that.”
She also found inspiration in the deliberate and thoughtful curriculum at Laramie’s Early Care and Education Center, where her own two kids attended. 
Vincelette moved to Lander nine years ago to work as a preschool teacher for the school district. She transitioned to the early childhood education liaison five years ago, initially as part-time.

The position aimed to support the early childhood education landscape in a broader sense. To do that, Vincelette worked with local preschools and kindergarten classrooms to model and teach weekly lessons based on needs. She offered a free, weekly “Little Explorers” program for families with children under 5 to encourage learning and play. She advocated developmentally appropriate learning, worked with the family consumer science class at the high school and led the summer “Lights On” program for children about to enter kindergarten.
Vincelette is an adherent of evidence-based models, and a big part of her approach is learning through play. 
If educators present lessons “in a playful manner, students are going to remember that,” she said. Connecting it to joy and fun makes it more effective for small children, she said. 
She learns a lot from young children, she added, who have a purity, rawness and presence of mind she finds refreshing. 
It appears she has taken a page from that presence of mind in this situation. Instead of panicking about finding a new job, Vincelette said in the Lander classroom during a break in the summer pre-kindergarten program, she spent the final weeks of her job absorbed in the work.
‘Kid magic’
Back in the classroom, Vincelette’s way with kids was evident. Whether asking them to touch their ears while listening, telling the story with a toy wolf or asking them to place hands on top of their heads to show they were finished, she commanded their complete attention.  
Following story time, the children moved through play stations around the room — painting, handling fragile water beads, building with magnetic blocks, practicing handwriting with a magnetic “pen” among them. The stations were designed to help build things like motor skills, body awareness or language foundations, Vincelette said.

“Miss Paula has ‘kid magic,’” a local kindergarten teacher wrote in a testimonial after news broke that the position had been terminated. Vincelette collected a number of these in an effort to provide proof of how impactful the work has been. She hopes funding will be available in the future to support the reinstatement of something similar. 
Supporters hope so too. In the pages of testimonials, kindergarten teachers, preschool directors, parents and mentees praised her singular talent with small children during an era when evidence of the importance of early childhood education on long-term outcomes of success is mounting.
They credited Vincelette with quelling behavioral issues and igniting imagination, equipping parents with tools to encourage learning-based play at home, transforming teachers’ approach to instruction and easing transition into the classroom for all kids, including those who didn’t attend daycare or preschool.  
“Her absence will be profoundly felt by students, teachers, and families alike,” another teacher wrote. 
Decker, the Lander mom, recently watched her son finish kindergarten. While he has his ups and downs, she said, “he is thriving academically and as a person. I credit so much of that to Ms. Paula.”

Legislators mull increasing Medicaid payments, enhancing provider recruitment programs and other potential remedies.
The post Births fall in Wyoming hospitals as lawmakers study maternity care gaps appeared first on WyoFile .","Births continue to fall in many Wyoming hospitals as lawmakers seek remedies for widening gaps in maternity care across the state. 
Hospitals in Casper, Cheyenne, Rock Springs, Cody, Douglas and Lander are seeing declining deliveries, data from the Legislative Service Office shows. Four other hospitals — in Riverton, Kemmerer, Rawlins and most recently Evanston — have shut down birthing facilities entirely in recent years. When Evanston announced its closure at the end of 2024, it cited declining demand. 
Wyoming’s maternity gap issue appears to be most acute in Central Wyoming, according to Curtis Biggs, Gov. Mark Gordon’s senior policy advisor, where SageWest Hospital in Lander is the main birthing facility serving a huge area of Fremont and Sublette counties. 
“We are seeing a concerning trend of a decline in those births in that particular hospital, with a lot of births shifting to Thermopolis,” Biggs told the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health & Social Services Committee Monday. The latter hospital was the only one presented that has experienced a significant spike in deliveries.

A dearth of maternal health care has made pregnancy and childbirth increasingly tricky in widening swaths of Wyoming, a 2023 WyoFile investigation found. This is evident in Fremont County, where moms are opting to temporarily relocate to places like Denver and even the East Coast to deliver babies. It is evident in Rawlins, where families have to travel Interstate 80, a notorious stretch of highway that closes frequently in the winter months, to deliver in Laramie. And it is evident in Teton County, where overflow patients from elsewhere in the state are straining providers. 
Lawmakers made maternity care a top issue of study for the 2024 legislative off-season and began to identify a complicated mix of challenges for providing such care in rural places. 
Maternity care is back on the table this summer as policymakers work to improve doctor recruitment, regulations and a complex system of health care reimbursements. Despite some steps forward in the past year, as Biggs explained to lawmakers, the options for families seeking robust maternal health care remain scant or nonexistent in many parts of the state. 
The problem 
A Wyoming Health Department assessment found that nearly half of the state’s counties lacked a practicing OB-GYN in 2024. The State Scorecard on Women’s Health and Reproductive Care ranked Wyoming 42nd that same year. The state placed behind all of its neighbors.
Solutions have been elusive. Complicating the issue are provider challenges like low birth volume in rural areas, high costs of medical malpractice insurance, financial viability struggles for hospitals, abortion ban impacts on doctors, liability concerns and barriers for midwives to deliver in hospitals.

Along with the 2024 legislative committee study, the OB Subcommittee of Gov. Gordon’s Health Task Force also worked to explore solutions. That group narrowed its focus last summer to three areas: how to better utilize midwives, doulas and family physicians alongside obstetricians in delivery care; the possibility of creating OB medical fellowships to bolster care in Wyoming; and regionalizing the state’s maternity care.
The Joint Labor Committee took up the issue once more as an interim topic in 2025. During its two-day meeting this week in Casper, Deputy Director of the Wyoming Department of Health Franz Fuchs and Gordon’s policy advisor Biggs laid out the situation anew. 
“The primary problem we’re really diagnosing this with is hospital viability,” Fuchs said. “We believe that labor and delivery closures are really a symptom of broader financial stress on the hospitals, whether it’s due to low volume generally or management issues.”
That financial stress can come from a host of issues, he said, including low volume of births, management issues, nurse labor shortage and provider recruitment challenges, fewer women of childbearing age creating declining demand and comparatively low Medicaid payment rates. When stressed, hospitals look to offload services, he continued, and labor and delivery is an attractive candidate because it’s not profitable.  
Fuchs offered several options for aiding hospitals, including increasing Medicaid hospital payment rates for deliveries, increasing Medicaid payments to delivering providers, increasing funding for provider recruitment programs and increasing provider education opportunities or incentives for medical students. 
Other ideas that came up during the meeting were malpractice tort reform, mobile units that can travel to underserved areas and more oversight of the services local hospitals provide. 
Steps and directions 
Some steps have been taken to address the issue. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming is launching a program in July to support maternal health and respond to growing concerns about access to care. The Maternity Care Program will include a subscription service for prenatal vitamins and remote monitoring for high-risk pregnancies or those living in areas with little or no maternity care, among other services. 
Another step is a new OB residency track through the University of Wyoming Family Medicine Residency Program at Cheyenne. 
“We have residents selected that will be on an OB track starting in July when they start their second year, which means our real goal is for them either then to be able to get into an OB fellowship following residency, or  simply to go get a job, hopefully some place in the state,” said Dr. Jacques Beveridge, a Cheyenne OB-GYN. 
He also echoed a common sentiment when he urged lawmakers’ “favorable consideration of increasing Medicaid payment.”
As vice president of the Wyoming Hospital Association, Josh Hannes served on the governor’s health task force OB subcommittee.
If the committee is not OK with the current state of maternity care, Hannes said, “and where we believe it’s going to go if there’s no intervention, and you believe that the state has a role to play in doing better, then I think there’s a number of valuable recommendations that have been presented that could take bill form. We would be supportive of those.”
Ultimately, committee members voiced support for pursuing bills that would: help give midwives more authority to deliver; raise Medicaid reimbursements for obstetrics; offer protections for pregnancy resource centers; look into mobile health units; and study other states’ models for helping to pay for malpractice insurance.  
In addition, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, who chairs the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, said she would like the health department to consider removing the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of recommended vaccines for pregnant women.

The Big Beautiful Bill will have some ugly consequences for health care costs in the Equality State, writes Nate Martin. 
The post Congress is about to hike up Wyoming’s health insurance costs appeared first on WyoFile .","The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is supposed to be all about tax breaks. 

Opinion

But the bill actually cancels a tax break that could skyrocket health insurance costs for tens of thousands of people in Wyoming and drive up prices for all of us.
Wyoming’s Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis love to talk about all the tax breaks that the Big Beautiful Bill is supposed to create. 
But they’re awfully quiet about getting rid of this one. 
As it’s written, the “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminates major tax credits that people in Wyoming use to buy private health insurance off the federal Healthcare Marketplace, via healthcare.gov.
By eliminating these tax credits, the bill would double, triple, or even quadruple the cost of insurance premiums many people in Wyoming pay. 
The result will be even tighter family budgets, more people without insurance, more medical debt, bankrupted hospitals, sicker communities, and a sicker workforce.
Currently, a single person earning $62,000 a year in Wyoming can buy a year’s worth of medical insurance for $5,270 thanks to Marketplace tax credits. If the Big Beautiful Bill eliminates those credits, that price will increase to $11,810, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
That’s more than double the cost. And that’s not the worst of it.
Older people in Wyoming who aren’t quite eligible for Medicare will see the biggest increases. 
Right now, a 60-year-old couple earning $80,000 a year together can buy health insurance from the Marketplace for $6,970 to cover both of them. 
Again, this is thanks to tax credits.
Under the Big Beautiful Bill, the cost will shoot up to $44,392 a year just for insurance premiums.
For most people nearing retirement, this cost will simply be impossible to pay.
Just shy of 40,000 people in Wyoming get their health insurance through the Marketplace, KFF Health News reported. 
These are mostly people who are self-employed or who work for small businesses that don’t offer job-based coverage, or they’re people who string together two or three part-time gigs. 
If you’ve never bought health insurance off the Marketplace — I did for years — what happens is that you select a plan from a private company, like Blue Cross Blue Shield, but you pay a lower price than you normally would as an individual customer. 
Your Marketplace tax credit covers the difference.
Americans have been eligible to buy health insurance with Marketplace tax credits since 2014. During the pandemic, Congress created “enhanced” tax credits that made insurance affordable for even more people.
These enhanced credits have been wildly popular in Wyoming. The number of people who got coverage with Marketplace tax credits in Wyoming increased by more than 75% since 2020, according to KFF Health News.
These “enhanced” credits are what the “Big Beautiful Bill” seeks to eliminate. 
This will mean a total loss of health coverage for 11,000 people in Wyoming. 
But that’s not all. The way it’s set up, Marketplace tax credits are basically subsidy payments to private insurance companies. 
When private companies lose a source of revenue, what do they do? 
They raise prices for the remaining customers.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming is the state’s largest insurer — covering more than 100,000 people — and the largest local vendor for coverage on the Healthcare Marketplace. They stand to lose significant business thanks to the “Big Beautiful Bill” and will react by driving up premium prices for the rest of us.
On top of the thousands of people who totally lose coverage as a result of canceling the Marketplace tax credits, roughly one in five people in the state will face a premium increase on their job-based or other private insurance.
Tax breaks are great for the people who need them. 
Right now, families in Wyoming need a break to help shoulder the cost of healthcare in our state, which is the second-highest in the nation.
Unfortunately, our elected leaders in Congress are too busy cheerleading tax cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill that will mostly benefit the richest people and corporations in America, all while driving up our national debt and increasing your health care premiums.
That doesn’t seem like much of a break to me.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers sent more than 100 bills to the governor’s desk on the final day of session on Wednesday, though less than half of the bills that had been vying for funding. 
Among the bills legislators passed in the final hours are measures to provide exclusive rights to internet gaming for Wabanaki Nations, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns and add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results. 
Two bills aimed at helping with housing affordability, one by altering the real estate transfer tax to protect mobile home parks and another to establish a property tax relief task force, are also now on the governor’s desk. Another bill passed by lawmakers on Wednesday would establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
And others would alter state government, including a change to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department and another to make it so a simple majority, rather than current two-thirds, of each chamber could extend the Legislature’s work beyond the statutory adjournment date.
These bills are not guaranteed to become law quite yet. The Maine Legislature adjourned sine die, or finally, and does not plan to reconvene until the start of the second regular session in January 2026. But Gov. Janet Mills now has 10 days to either sign or veto the bills passed on Wednesday. With the Legislature now adjourned, any bills Mills doesn’t sign will be “pocket vetoed.” 
So far this session, Mills has vetoed five bills, all of which lawmakers sustained on Wednesday.
All non-emergency laws passed this session will take effect on Sept. 24 unless the bill text notes otherwise. 
The 117 bills lawmakers passed on Wednesday followed the recommendations of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, which voted those proposals off of what’s known as the appropriations table on Tuesday.
These amount to about 40% of the total number of bills — nearly 300 — placed on the table throughout the session. Legislation on the table has largely already passed both chambers on initial votes but still needed to be funded.
While some of these bills could now become law, the appropriations committee reduced or struck altogether the allocations of most given limited resources. (More details here.)
One of the proposals it amended that now awaits approval from Mills is a measure to provide more funding for reproductive health care. 
The budget addition the governor signed into law last week provided $3 million for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
The bill now on the governor’s desk, LD 143, had initially called for $6 million toward these services, but the appropriations committee advanced an amended version on Tuesday that would instead provide up to another $3 million from the available unappropriated surplus by the end of the current fiscal year. 
It was clear Republicans opposed the measure in committee, with Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) saying she was “thoroughly disgusted.” But both chambers ultimately enacted it as amended on Wednesday, with the Democratic majority and Republican Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford backing it. 
But other proposals were approved as is. That was the case for one of the most debated bills in the appropriations committee on Tuesday: LD 1937, which sought to require hospitals and their affiliates to provide financial assistance programs for medical care.
Republicans on the committee criticized it as a measure that will increase hospitals’ costs while they’re already struggling, while Democrats countered that the bill would make sure people who don’t have insurance still have access to health care. 
The state delayed Medicaid payments to hospitals this spring after Senate Republicans refused to back a change package to address the urgent deficit without structural reform to the program. Now, hospitals are also bracing to possibly take on more costs for the uninsured due to proposed cuts to Medicaid in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
But the committee left on the table the majority of the bills that had been placed there this year.  
Among those bills were two that sought to ensure the already required teachings of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively implemented across all Maine schools. 
LD 1474 sought to permanently establish a Wabanaki studies specialist in the Maine Department of Education, while LD 1202 sought to create an African American Studies Advisory Council.
Two other bills that the committee did not move off the table would have expanded the state’s infrastructure to track and test sexual assault forensic examination kits, commonly called rape kits. These preserve evidence left behind during an assault through a forensic medical examination that survivors can choose to undergo immediately after a sexual assault. DNA evidence from these kits can then be used to solve and prevent crimes.
LD 549 would have established a statewide tracking system for such kits, and LD 1816 would have conducted an inventory of existing kits in the possession of law enforcement. 
Defying the appropriations committee decision, Bennett, the sponsor of LD 549, attempted to suspend the rules to take both his bill and LD 1816 off the table on Wednesday. His motions failed. “It’s unfortunate that the appropriations of the committee hasn’t responded to the urgent needs of some people of the state of Maine,” Bennett said. 
Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Somerset) also attempted to do the same for LD 182, which would provide per diem payments for MaineCare residents of the Maine Veterans’ Homes. His motion also failed. 
Appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said Tuesday night that the committee intends to carry over bills still on the table into next year, though they were not listed among the nearly 200 bills approved for carry over in a joint order passed on Wednesday. 
Each of the legislative policy committees requested that some of the bills in their possession be carried over to next year. In addition to these, the joint order included some bills that had remained tabled in the chambers upon adjournment. 
One of those measures was LD 1822, the proposal for a comprehensive data privacy law passed by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. Meanwhile, both chambers voted down a competing data privacy measure, LD 1088. (Read more about these proposals here).

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Legislative Council on Wednesday approved the nearly two-dozen topics that lawmakers will examine in interim study committees through the end of October.
A whopping 400 topics were suggested by lawmakers and agencies but were narrowed down to 22 “through a bipartisan process” involving legislative leadership, according to Legislative Services Agency Executive Director George Angelone. The resolution was approved in a voice vote.
Selected subjects range from the value of public lands to a look at medical debt. The panels tasked with studying them can play key roles in teeing up legislation for the next session — but don’t always.
“It just allows people to gather and have more, both formal and informal, conversations about sometimes complex topics,” House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, told reporters.
House and Senate heads will assign members to each committee in the coming weeks. The two chambers trade off who chairs the groups, and it’s the Senate’s turn this year.
What made the cut
Leaders from both parties enthused over one panel tasked with studying the value of Indiana’s recreational public lands, like state parks. It must consider the direct and indirect impacts of that land on local economies, including tourism, employment, health and more.
“It’s more than just a space for families to go for camping, for recreation. It’s also a huge economic boom for our state,” said Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington.

Her counterpart, Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, said quantifying the land’s value won’t lead to selling it off: “That’s not what I have in my mind.”
“We all know how valuable they are and how important they are, but the study committee will kind of flesh that out a little bit,” said Bray, R-Martinsville.
Another panel will consider medical debt: protecting debtors’ homes from liens or sales, collections or property lien limits, salary garnishment limits, monthly payment caps, and more.
Huston wrote one of the letters proposing that it be among the topics studied.
“We just have heard from a lot of different folks of what a financial burden that becomes to people, and how hard is to overcome it, and there’s very little pathway to resolve (it),” he said. “… We’ll take a look at it and see what options are available to us.”
Huston emphasized low-income Hoosiers or those who’ve needed particularly expensive procedures.
Yoder was also supportive, telling reporters, “Too many families are one medical crisis away from losing a home, losing their well-being, and we need to study that.”
Lawmakers will also review the “efficiency and effectiveness” of various state-created bodies with a focus on the work they’ve produced and how they’re funded.
It echoes an effort begun last year — although only one of the nine examined at the time had any current members show up to defend them.

“I couldn’t even begin to tell you the number of boards, commissions and study committees out there, and some of them might not be as productive as you might want them to be,” Bray said.
The panel might consider consolidating some, or getting rid of others that “haven’t been doing substantive work” recently, he added. “… It’s probably an exercise that should happen more often, is to take a look and see what’s really a productive effort and what’s not.”
Other topics include a review of child fatalities, water safety education, public school administrator salaries, long-term care insurance costs, postpartum checkups and artificial intelligence in state government, among others.
Several statutory committees and task forces — like for health care costs and Medicaid oversight — weren’t assigned any topics.
“We had a lot of legislation in those areas (over) this last session, and sometimes you’ve got to let some of those issues bake a little while, to see, before you have a new issue that you really have to grapple with,” Bray explained.
Other action
Separately, the council authorized Angelone to short five national organizations on Indiana’s membership dues.
They are the Council of State Governments, Education Commission of the States, National Conference of Insurance Legislators, National Conference of State Legislatures and National Council of Legislators from Gaming States.
“The general concept is that we would pay 5% less than the invoiced amount,” Angelone said, recalling the 5% budget cuts forced on state agencies following a grim revenue forecast.
The council took similar action in 2011, he continued, and paid the deficit amount in a later year. But the resolution approved Wednesday doesn’t have a built-in payback provision.
And, the 2011 move was negotiated to maintain Indiana’s membership, Bray said. Although this year’s “haircut” wasn’t, he expected the state to retain its place in those organizations.

(Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.











We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University



But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Jeff Landry vetoed budget language that would have provided insurance coverage for obesity medication like Wegovy to state employees. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry struck language from the Louisiana budget plan that could have provided state employees and public school teachers with insurance coverage for popular weight-loss medication over the next year. 
The governor does not think the state would be able to cover the cost for the obesity drugs on a long-term basis. 

“These drugs can cost $1,000 a month per person,” Landry wrote in his letter to state lawmakers about the veto. “Even temporary coverage could set expectations for long-term use that Louisiana simply cannot afford.” 

The provision would have affected those enrolled in state health insurance plans with the Louisiana Office of Group Benefits. The office provides coverage to 223,000 people, including state employees, public school teachers, retirees and their dependents. 

It’s not clear how many would have been given access to the weight-loss medication before the governor’s veto. 
The struck-out language called for those health plans to “incorporate semaglutide medications for the purposes of weight loss” into their pharmacy benefits, but only if it didn’t cost the state self-insured plans more money. 
The coverage was also only guaranteed for the 2025-26 budget cycle, which runs from July 1 through June 30, 2026.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Semaglutide is sold under the brand names Ozempic, Rybelus and Wegovy and has become a popular weight-loss tool in recent years. It was originally developed to treat Type II diabetes and is supposed to be taken indefinitely. Patients are expected to regain weight they lost if they stop using the medication.

Prescription prices can lower when semaglutide is initially prescribed because of rebates drug manufacturers offer. But as Landry observed, the medication is very expensive, especially if those discounts are discontinued. 
Louisiana also has a higher-than-average obesity rate of 40%, compared with just 32.8% nationally, which means more people would likely qualify for the treatment. 
“If just a small portion of eligible employees begin using them, the long-term costs could quickly climb into the tens of millions,” the governor wrote in his veto message. 
North Carolina and West Virginia initially offered to cover weight-loss drugs for their state employees but ended up cutting the benefit when the price tags for doing so skyrocketed. Connecticut and Illinois have continued to offer weight-loss drug coverage to their state employees – but at a cost of at least $40 million and $210 million, respectively. 
Even if it can’t be used for weight loss, Landry said state health care plans will continue to offer semaglutide to Type II diabetes patients.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wegovy.jpg,,,2025-06-26 07:01:20.476403

Let’s be clear: This isn’t just political posturing. This bill, backed by fossil fuel interests and already passed in the House, would strip away the very tools Wisconsin families, businesses, farmers and communities are using to lower energy costs, create jobs and build a more resilient future. The damage to our state would be both immediate and long-term.
In Wisconsin alone, 82 clean energy projects are currently in the pipeline. These projects represent not just thousands of jobs and billions in investment — they’re the backbone of a 21st-century economy. From wind turbine manufacturing in Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley to solar installations in rural communities, Wisconsinites are hard at work powering our future.
If the “Big, Broken Bill” becomes law, it threatens to cancel or delay many of these efforts. Clean energy tax credits would vanish. The Solar for All program and clean manufacturing investments would be eliminated. Tax incentives for electric vehicles, energy-efficient buildings, and sustainable agriculture would be repealed. These aren’t just policy tools — they’re direct investments in our people, places and potential. Many Wisconsin communities have used these credits to launch local projects that reduce taxpayer dollars through direct pay for solar, geothermal and clean vehicles.
And we can’t afford to go backward. Energy demand is skyrocketing — especially with the rapid expansion of AI and data centers. Experts warn electricity bills could jump by 70% in the next five years if we don’t act. Clean, renewable energy remains the cheapest and fastest option to deploy. Gutting these investments would lead to higher prices, more power interruptions and less energy reliability — leaving Wisconsin families and businesses to bear the cost.
Without these programs, household energy costs could rise by up to $400 a year. That’s a hidden tax hike on working families — piled on top of rising costs from tariffs and supply chain disruptions already straining our economy.
Even worse, the bill guts EPA pollution standards and allows major polluters to sidestep environmental compliance. It’s a taxpayer-funded giveaway to fossil fuel interests, trading our health, air and water for short-term corporate profits.
Let’s not forget Wisconsin’s farmers, who were just beginning to benefit from billions in IRA investments for conservation, renewable energy and carbon-smart agriculture. With grant contracts abruptly canceled, many family farms are left holding the bag, having made plans in good faith only to be blindsided.
We can do better. Wisconsin has the talent, tools and environmental leadership tradition to lead the clean energy economy. Clean energy already supports more than 71,000 jobs in our state. With the right investments, we could add 34,000 more and grow our economy by $21 billion by 2050.
We’re also home to over 350 clean energy supply chain companies. With support from IRA tax credits and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), we can expand local manufacturing of batteries, solar panels, wind components, EV systems and smart grid technology — positioning Wisconsin as a national clean energy hub.
This is the kind of forward-thinking, common-sense investment we need. It creates good jobs, lowers energy bills, strengthens supply chains and revitalizes communities.
The Senate still has time to act. Let’s urge our lawmakers, regardless of party, to reject this harmful bill and stand with the workers, innovators and families building a cleaner, stronger Wisconsin. Our policies should reflect our shared values of fairness, innovation, resilience and stewardship — not special treatment for polluters.
This isn’t about partisan politics. It’s about economic survival, energy independence and the future we want to leave our children.
It’s time to move forward, not backward, with a smarter stronger, and more sustainable Wisconsin.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)CHADRON — While recreational trail development in eastern Nebraska has hit a roadblock, progress is being made in the northwestern portion of the state to extend the nation’s longest rail-to-trail project, the Cowboy Trail.
The expansion comes as the 317-mile-long trail marks it’s 30th anniversary, when the national Rails to Trails Conservancy, which purchased the abandoned Chicago & North Western railroad line, donated it to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.
On a recent weekend, a group of bicycle enthusiasts set out from this northwest Nebraska college town to “monkey wrench” a single-track trail from Chadron eastward along a rarely used portion of remaining railroad track.
A simpler trail
The idea was to create a trail inexpensively and quickly by mowing a path in the right-of-way beside the track, rake out the rough spots, and then beat a trail into the hard soil by riding on it.


Celebrating the Cowboy Trail
Several events are planned this year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Cowboy Trail, which extends 317-miles across northern Nebraska, crossing through 30 towns.
Events culminate Sept. 5 with a celebration in Valentine that includes a bike ride, a dinner and a social hour on the railroad bridge that spans the Niobrara River east of the community.
For information about all of the events, access the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission’s website.


“We call it monkey wrenching or a guerrilla trail,” said George Ledbetter, a retired newspaper reporter, avid biker and treasurer of the Northwest Nebraska Trails Association.
The work is among efforts by several trails groups in the region that, in recent years, have extended the Cowboy Trail another 17 miles from Gordon to Rushville and obtained grants to build needed bridges along the as-yet undeveloped segment west to Chadron.
That undeveloped segment, from Rushville to where the guerrilla trail ends 5 miles east of Chadron (where Game and Parks ownership ends), is expected to be constructed and completed in 2026.
“Then we will have 40 contiguous miles from Gordon to Chadron,” said Alex Duryea, the recreation trails manager for the state Game and Parks Commission.
Ledbetter said connecting the Cowboy Trail with downtown Chadron via the “guerrilla trail” will provide a needed link for cyclers eastward through the scenic Pine Ridge and on to Hay Springs, Rushville and Gordon. It also will fill a gap in an ambitious plan to develop a cross-continental trail, the Great American Rail-Trail, which would extend across Nebraska from Omaha to Harrison.
“The Cowboy Trail is one of the gems of the whole rail-trail network of the whole nation,” he said.
Northwest Nebraska bike riders have already seen what a developed bike trail can do for visitation. In the nearby Black Hills of South Dakota, the Mickelson Trail draws an estimated 70,000 riders a year. Expansion of the Cowboy Trail would enhance tourism in the Pine Ridge area of Nebraska, a pine-studded area that includes Chadron and Fort Robinson State Park and vast tracts of national forest land.
“Obviously, out here, our big draw is outdoor recreation — hiking, biking, hunting and horseback riding,” said Kerri Rempp, tourism director of Discover Northwest Nebraska. “Giving people safe places to ride only increases our ability to attract tourists.”
Completing the Chadron-to-Rushville portion still would leave a 91-mile gap in the Cowboy Trail from Gordon eastward to Valentine. Duryea said that while there’s interest in completing that segment of trail, a local group to coordinate that effort and seek local and grant support has not yet emerged.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Expansion of the Cowboy Trail in northwestern Nebraska comes as trail enthusiasts struggle to bridge a gap in trails between Lincoln and Omaha across Cass County. The Cass County Board recently declined to affirm a 10-mile pathway for a trail to bridge a gap there, declining to OK months of work selecting a preferred route. A county board subcommittee is now at work trying to find an acceptable alternative route.
Such roadblocks aren’t unusual for trail development, and the Cass County connector trail lacks an abandoned rail line to follow, forcing up the cost and the need to find right of way that’s acceptable for nearby landowners.
“It takes time and it takes support from local trail users to develop new trails,” Rempp said. “These things are not cheap. They take a lot of time, and they take a lot of work.”
Support matters
Local “buy in,” Duryea said, is essential as well.


Less of a burr in Cowboy Trail’s saddle
“Goats heads” or puncture vine has been a plague upon the Cowboy Trail in sections since it was opened.
The spiny seeds produced by the invasive plant can puncture tires, causing delays and headaches during bike rides.
But Alex Duryea, trail boss for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, said a dent in the goats head population has been accomplished via some spraying, and, for the past two years, use of a mechanical removal device called a “sticker burr roller.”
A foam roller catches the burrs, which are collected by the slow-moving device, he said.
Duryea said that you still might get a flat tire from a goats head on the Cowboy Trail, but the removal device has reduced complaints.

The Northwest Nebraska Trails Association was founded in 2017 after being inspired by the success of trail advocates in Gordon and Rushville via the Cowboy Trails West group.
Besides its Cowboy Trail work and advocacy with state and national groups, the organization has produced maps of mountain bike and hiking trails in the Pine Ridge, Toadstool Park and around Chadron State College, and it has helped with a Volksmarch held in May at Fort Robinson.
Trail advocates, Ledbetter said, had thought the Rushville-to-Chadron portion might be completed sooner, but a grant to build that segment fell short of the project’s cost and provided only enough funds for a required environmental study and to build bridges along that portion. Then, he said, flooding that damaged the eastern portion of the Cowboy Trail in the Norfolk area delayed work on the western portion.
More recently, financial help and support from the Chadron Rotary Club, the Discover Northwest Nebraska group, the national Rails-to-Trails Conservancy and the City of Chadron have led to the planned development of the five-mile segment from downtown Chadron to where the Game and Parks part of the trail begins.
The railroad that still owns that five-mile section of track and leases it to park idle railcars, agreed to allow the trails group to utilize right of way along the track. Some informational kiosks have been installed already, and a local Eagle Scout built a bench for trailside rests.
The City of Chadron soon will take bids to build a one-mile segment from the downtown area, Ledbetter said, and the Northwest Nebraska Trails group has signed an agreement with the city to maintain and develop the remaining four miles.
Rather than wait for funding to lay down a crushed livestock trail on the remaining segment, he said local cyclists decided to mow a path and lay down a single-track trail by holding rides every Saturday morning. Volunteers have removed trees, branches and even barbed wire from the path and have used rakes and hoes to smooth the path where necessary, Ledbetter said.
The trails group is talking with local health officials about establishing trails and safe paths within Chadron and about establishing trails to connect with Chadron State Park and about extending the Cowboy Trail westward to Crawford and points west.
“Our goals are pretty huge really and we hope we can keep it going,” he said.

(Courtesy of the Bureau of Land Management)Newspapers, TV and social media have been blowing up lately, shining a light on a provision tucked in the U.S. Senate’s version of the “Big Beautiful Bill” that would force the sale of public lands. The last couple of days have been dizzying. The sell off language has been removed, only to be added back, then changed multiple times. In, out, in. Enough already. 
Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill

Selling off our public lands is wildly out of step with the values of people across our state. These are the lands where we hunt, fish, camp, hike, ride ATVs and horses, watch wildlife and find solitude. They’re our heritage — and our birthright. And that birthright is under threat.
Republicans and Democrats, ranchers and river runners, hunters and hikers — we may not agree on everything, but we all agree that public lands should stay in public hands. 
Let’s be clear about what selling public lands means: Idahoans will lose access to land that has always belonged to them. “No trespassing” signs will go up. Gates will be locked. 
This is not hypothetical. This is not alarmism. This is a real threat. And Idahoans have stepped up to confront this threat. Thousands of Idahoans have spoken out. Together we’ve called, written and visited the offices of our senators to voice our deep opposition to these land sale provisions. And it made a difference. Both U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch have now issued statements opposing the sale of public lands.

As this fight rages, those who want to steal your land have tried to dodge criticism and throw you off by repeatedly offering up different versions of language. But no “kinder, gentler” version of selling off public lands changes that selling off our public lands is still selling off public lands. It is a betrayal of all Idahoans and all Americans. It is a terrible idea and sets a terrible precedent for future sell offs of our heritage.
You see, Sen. Crapo is not just any senator. He’s the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the very committee responsible for writing this bill. In plain terms: this is Sen. Crapo’s bill. If the language forcing the sale of public lands gets removed, it will be because he made it happen. If it stays in, it’s because he allowed it to stay.
Sen.  Crapo, Idahoans are counting on you. You have the power — and the means — to stop the sale and privatization of the lands Idahoans and Americans enjoy for hunting, fishing, camping, snowmobiling, and more. Heed the calls of Idahoans and remove this terrible provision from the bill. You’ve told Idahoans you oppose selling off our public lands. Now is the time to turn that statement into action.
Sen. Risch, we need your leadership here too. As a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as someone who has championed public access in the past, your voice matters. We need you to make it crystal clear that selling public land is unacceptable and must be stripped from this bill.
Let’s not forget what’s at stake. These lands support our economy. They sustain our rural communities. They protect our water, our wildlife and our way of life.  They’re also a legacy. It’s our duty to protect them for those who will come after us. If we allow them to be sold now, they will be lost forever. And future generations will look back and wonder why we didn’t fight harder.
Idahoans believe in collaboration, in common ground, and in the power of citizens to influence policy. That’s exactly what’s happening right now. Idahoans are speaking up. They’re standing up. And they’re watching closely.
So to Sen. Crapo and Sen. Risch, we say this: thank you for listening to your constituents. Thank you for opposing this terrible idea. Now, let’s finish the job.
Strip the public land sale provision from the reconciliation bill. Keep public lands in public hands. And show the nation that when it comes to defending our shared heritage, Idaho leads.
Because once these lands are gone, they’re gone. Let’s not let that happen — not on our watch.

(Getty Images)The “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” that is making its way through Congress contains big cuts for disability services in West Virginia — a state with the nation’s highest rate of people with disabilities. 
One in three West Virginia residents live with a disability, according to federal data. The state’s system supporting thousands of people with disabilities is already over stretched due to health care deserts and a shortage of community group homes.
Republicans in Washington’s megabill calls for the elimination of all University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, including the one housed at West Virginia University, through funding cuts to the Administration for Community Living.
  Lesley Cottrell
“The impact will be immediate,” said Lesley Cottrell, director of the WVU Center for Excellence in Disabilities, which provides free services to 340,000 West Virginians living with a disability and their families through a network of programs and six clinics.
The center oversees the state’s only feeding and swallowing clinic. Cottrell said that without federal funding, the clinic won’t be able to serve patients, including children, who struggle to eat. 
The programs around the state have also helped children with communication disorders interact with the world by using augmentative and alternative communication devices, supported individuals with traumatic brain injuries and helped people with disabilities find jobs.
The budget bill lumps the nationwide developmental disability programs into diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which leading Republicans don’t want to fund amid a GOP-crack down on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
Cottrell said categorizing the CED program as DEI is an unfair description. 
“Without placing any judgment on DEI programs or initiatives … We are not, by definition, a DEI program in the sense that anyone — family or individual with those disabilities — can get our services for free. We don’t separate it by age, gender, ethnicity, race,” she explained. “Some of the foundations of DEI initiatives just aren’t present.”
The university provides a $500,000 match in funding, and the WVU CED promotes research aimed at tackling disability-related issues relevant to West Virginia.
The center employs more than 100 people through its office and contract positions. Many of those jobs would be eliminated if federal funding is eliminated through the bill, Cottrell said. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., declined to comment on the bill since negotiations continue. President Donald Trump said he wants the massive spending bill on his desk by July 4, but several major disputes — including pending cuts to Medicaid funding that would impact West Virginia — have yet to be resolved in the Senate. 
Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., and West Virginia’s Republican Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore did not return requests for comments for this story.
Several other disability-focused groups could see funding cuts because of the bill, including Disability Rights West Virginia. 
“The proposed federal budget cuts to the protection and advocacy systems like Disability Rights of West Virginia will be disastrous for the state, persons with disabilities and public safety,” said Mike Folio, DRWV’s legal director. 
The budget bill contains spending reductions for the federal departments of health and education, which would impact DRWV, according to Folio.
“DRWV received less than $2 [million] in federal funds in 2024 and stretched those dollars to monitor 176 separate facilities in West Virginia and conduct nearly 400 monitoring visits to protect our grandparents, mothers and fathers, children and family members,” he added.
DRWV serves as the state’s federally mandated protection and advocacy system for people with disabilities in West Virginia. The organization has alerted lawmakers and media to issues in state-run hospitals for people with disabilities, including patients being unnecessarily held at William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital in Weston without appropriate therapy and support services. 
The organization also discovered that a nonverbal, elderly man died in 2024 from burn injuries after being left too long in a whirlpool of scalding water at a state-run long-term care facility.
According to Folio, DRWV fills the regulatory gaps that state run offices can’t cover. 
Cottrell said the funding cuts won’t just impact people with disabilities but could also weaken funding that supports respite care for families and programs that help parents whose children are awaiting a potential autism diagnosis. 
“That’ll all be gone,” she said.

Everything Medicaid is under attack and many of the greatest health achievements in the last 15 years  are about to be rolled back.  
Medicaid is a critical lifeline to dental care for people with disabilities, kids and families with low incomes. Children enrolled in Medicaid have guaranteed, comprehensive dental benefits and Medicaid dental benefits are a significant driver of access to dental care for low-income working-age adults and seniors. Medicaid dental coverage also improves oral health outcomes for adults and children alike.
Additionally, Medicaid dental benefits are a driver of economic health for individuals and states. Adults with Medicaid dental coverage spend less out-of-pocket on dental care, helping them avoid medical debt and freeing up resources to meet their basic needs and engage in their local economy. For many adults, being able to afford dental care could be the key to getting a new job or advancing in their current one. When adults have Medicaid dental coverage, their job prospects and job performance improve. And adults with good oral health have more job opportunities. The improved oral health associated with Medicaid dental benefits could save states at least $273 million per year. Medicaid cuts will harm oral health.
According to Gina Sharps, West Virginia Oral Health Coalition executive director, numerous studies show that Medicaid adult dental coverage lowers overall health care spending on chronic disease management and emergency department usage. Emergency department visits alone cost an estimated $2.1 billion per year, and research indicates that nearly 79% of these visits could be addressed in a dental office — a potential savings of up to $1.7 billion per year. It also boosts oral health outcomes for patients and increases employment opportunities.
The high cost of dental care, particularly out-of-pocket costs, remains a major barrier to care. And for many families, Medicaid is one of the only affordable options to obtain oral health services. It is no wonder that it is also extremely popular, with over 74% of voters supporting better oral health access in Medicaid. However, adult dental services in Medicaid are considered “optional” for states and therefore at particular risk for being cut or scaled back if states lose Medicaid funding.
Current congressional proposals to cut or cap Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for billionaires would threaten the health and livelihood of tens of thousands of West Virginians. These cuts would lead to devastating dental coverage losses and ballooning medical debt, of which dental bills are already a key driver. In general, Medicaid cuts would push good oral health out of reach, causing avoidable dental problems to become emergencies and costing the health care system millions of dollars in unnecessary spending.
Reductions in federal Medicaid funding could lead states to roll back Medicaid expansion or cut program eligibility taking away health care from millions of seniors, kids and low- income adults. Additionally, the 23 million adults who rely on Medicaid for dental care would suddenly be left with nothing. In addition to reducing access to care and worsening oral health outcomes, dental coverage loses also decrease work productivity. Many adults who lose Medicaid coverage would go completely uninsured; some may be able to switch to private coverage through their state’s marketplace or their employer, but there are no requirements for private medical insurance to cover oral health.  
Additionally, major changes or cuts to the program could also put access to kids’ oral health coverage at risk even though it is mandatory. Cuts to Medicaid oral health benefits would lead to immediate and lasting harm. 
When families lose Medicaid coverage, they are more likely to go without oral health coverage than obtain expensive, private insurance. As a result, individuals forgo preventive care and early interventions, ultimately ending up in the emergency department for care at higher cost for the patient, hospital systems, states, and taxpayers.
Good oral health not only enables you to functionally perform as a human being — like speaking, smiling and eating — it is also important for communication, human relationships and financial prosperity. Poor dental health carries serious consequences that can lead to systemic and costly health conditions, such as oral health cancer and even heart disease. 
This is especially the case for those who have the biggest obstacle in getting access to dental care — rural and lower income households. 
Oral health is health and any cuts to Medicaid will have drastic consequences for both.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Tyler Lizenby)A decade ago, Kaila Adia Story and Missy Jackson were determined: Whether or not the United States government ever recognized them as a couple, they would marry. 
The two, who live in Louisville, had dated for three years by the time the United States Supreme Court took up Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark case that ultimately led to nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage on June 26, 2015. 
But before the nation’s highest court ruled 5-4 in favor of marriage equality, couples like the Story-Jacksons didn’t know where their futures stood. 
“We knew that the Supreme Court at the time was talking about same sex marriage,” Kaila said. “I just really did not have a lot of faith in the court, just from growing up in a homophobic society.” 
In May 2015, Kaila attended a conference in Florence, Italy, and Missy — the “woman out of my dreams” — went with her and proposed. 
Missy proposed before knowing they could legally marry, she said, because all that mattered was Kaila and her. She is used to “living on my own terms,” she said, and the next step was a commitment ceremony with Kaila. 
“I hit all the boxes of all the protected classes: Black, female, being a lesbian,” said Missy, 52. “Every day, we’re fighting to just exist. So I’m used to that. You either gotta be quiet, or you take up space. And then the way my mama raised me is: I belong in every room I go to.” 
For Missy, legal marriage is a “piece of paper,” and “the real commitment is to each other.” Their marriage was going to be “valid, regardless” of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Missy said.

“By the time SCOTUS announces that same sex marriage is legal, I knew that I wanted to (have a) wedding, and I knew that we were going to have a wedding and get married,” Kaila said. “Because it wasn’t legal, I thought that it was going to be just something smaller and much more intimate, but it became huge.” 
The day same-sex marriage was legalized, Kaila cried. She had never imagined that in her lifetime, she would be able to marry the woman she loved, legally, in Kentucky. 
“I couldn’t believe how things had lined up, how I didn’t feel like I was going to fall in any kind of deep love when I moved here (from Michigan), and then to be surprised and joyous by that, and then to go even farther, and to get engaged in this really romantic place, and then to come back a month later and realize that we’ll actually be able to get married and it will be legal,” she remembered. “I was blown away.” 
Kaila and Missy married April 9, 2016. 
“It was a wonderful time to finally have a legal acknowledgement that our unions are true, deep, loving — and just like everyone else’s,” Kaila said. 
‘A wonderful time,’ followed by ‘firestorm’

The Obergefell decision was immediately followed by a “firestorm” and “spotlight” on Kentucky, said Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky.
“When there is a victory, or when we do take a step forward in our civil rights and civil liberties, there’s often backlash to that,” Duke told the Lantern. “And the backlash here in Kentucky was almost immediate in terms of county clerk defiance.” 
Duke was referring to former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who made national headlines for denying same-sex marriage licenses in 2015 over her religious beliefs. Davis was briefly jailed that year.  
A decade after the Obergefell decision, political and religious conservatives still debate and challenge the landmark ruling. 
Davis has kept her legal case alive since then. The Christian law firm representing Davis, Liberty Counsel, is now moving to use her case as a way to overturn Obergefell using the same legal logic that undid Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion. 
And, at a national meeting in early June of thousands Southern Baptists, the nation’s top protestant denomination voted in favor of pushing for an overthrow of Obergefell. 
When the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas said at the time that the court should overturn Obergefell. 
Meanwhile, in 2024, the American Civil Liberties Union said it was tracking 588 bills it considers “anti LGBTQ.” 
The 2015 decision was never going to end all opposition to the LGBTQ community, Duke said, but “it felt significant. I definitely could not have envisioned in 2015 that we would be where we are today, 10 years later.” 
Kentucky doesn’t have a statewide fairness ordinance, which is “civil rights legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and to dismantle systemic racism,” according to the Fairness Campaign. At least 24 Kentucky communities have their own fairness ordinances, though. 
Conversion therapy still has a green light in the state. The discredited practice attempts to alter gender expression and sexual attraction that diverges from heterosexual normativity “with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome,” according to the The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 
Work on both of these issues, and more, “still continues,” Duke said. “Certainly within the past couple of years, the transgender community has been singled out and targeted specifically. Those attacks have been very intense.” 
Duke referenced the 2023 law passed in the Kentucky statehouse that banned certain medical care for transgender minors, such as hormone treatments. 
“I do think that there are many ways that, especially within the Kentucky General Assembly, that LGBTQ folks, particularly trans folks, have unfortunately become a political pawn,” Duke said. 
She takes issue, she said, with “culture war issues” being “prioritized as if they’re the most pressing issue in the commonwealth.” 
A ‘disheartening, disconcerting and devastating” time

The ongoing pushback against their community doesn’t affect the Story-Jacksons’ day-to-day lives, though it’s an upsetting time. 
“Both of us feel grateful to be with one another, to be married. We still celebrate and are excited about who we are,” Kaila said. “We’re in community with really, really great and supportive people who support our marriage, but … it’s really disheartening, disconcerting and then devastating right now, in certain ways, when it comes to watching the news, to seeing not only the attacks on same sex marriage, but the attacks specifically on trans communities, the attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion in work spaces.” 
In 2024, the Kentucky General Assembly banned DEI offices and programs in public colleges and universities in line with a national trend of pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion. 
In his second term, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders gutting DEI programs and activities across the federal government. The Trump administration also recently withdrew grant money promised to the University of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab, citing DEI issues in the withdrawal letter.

“This fixation on wanting to return to a time in which people were brutalized, dehumanized, not seen and felt as if they needed to be hidden — I’m not sure why anyone wants to return to that kind of political and social moment,” Kaila said. “It wasn’t good then. That’s why we left that moment.” 
Missy, who works in a steel mill, is surrounded by people who are her opposites, she said, including some who’ve never met a gay person before.
Living open, she said, shows people that “we’re not that much different.” 
“We’re the same; we’re no different. I have a dog, you have a dog,” Missy said. “I belong, and I’m supposed to love who I love, and I’m happy. We have a happy life. We have a healthy life.” 
‘We’ve always fought back.’ 
Kaila is an author, an associate professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, with a joint appointment in the Department of Pan-African Studies, at the University of Louisville, and the Audre Lorde chair in Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. In these roles, she finds herself guiding young people through a tough political moment. 
Her students, she said, “are completely intolerant of the hate that they’re seeing directed at their friends and loved ones and people in their community.” 
It’s making them “almost completely apathetic to the electoral process” and “completely despondent around politics in general.” 
“I think all LGBTQ people know that in each decade, in each political moment, we have never, ever been safe as a community,” she said. “What we also recognize is that in each instance where we have always had such visceral and severe attacks on our communities — and this moment is probably the most severe — we have shown up for each other and for ourselves in each instance, fighting back and demanding for our communities to be treated in a different way.” 
The message she works to leave her students with, she said, is “we’ve always fought back” and rejected “gender and sexual tyranny.” 
“Even though this period, this moment, has been dehumanizing, disheartening and really, really depressing …. recognize that we have always responded, socially, politically, culturally,” Kaila said. “This time period should be no different.” 
Still, fighting against homophobia is “exhausting,” she said. 
“I saw this meme the other day that said, ‘if you’re tired of hearing about homophobia, imagine living through it.’ I’m tired of hearing about it; I’m tired of dealing with it,” she said. “I’m 45 years old. I’ve been gay in all these different cities and all these different places, and it’s so tiring and exhausting to keep having to defend your right to live as you are.” 
‘Black, gay and free’

It’s unclear if the challenges to Obergefell have enough legal validity to be successful, Duke said, but pointed out that the Supreme Court has proven it’s “willing to roll back rights that people have enjoyed.” 
Kaila Story-Jackson, meanwhile, said she has even less faith in the high court in 2025 than she did in 2015. 
“I don’t have much faith in SCOTUS maintaining the Obergefell decision, just like they did not maintain the Roe v Wade decision,” she said. “It’s interesting, because my faith in the court in 2015 wasn’t top tier, but right now, in 2025, it’s way below. I will be thrilled and blown away if they are able to uphold this. I think it’s absurd that folks have only been allowed to be legally married and recognized for 10 years, and there’s already this kind of backlash and pushback in response to it.” 
For now, she and Missy focus on what brings them joy: their dog, Denver, and traveling together — including a potential return to Italy next year. 
“At dinner time, we’ll talk about what’s happened today, because every day is some event, but we don’t get completely mired down. Our life is still full of community and fun and joy,” Kaila said. “I still, every day, wake up feeling Black, gay and free.”

(Courtesy of Pennsylvania Environmental Council)Anyone who doubts the economic importance of outdoor recreation in Pennsylvania should visit rural Huntingdon County, home of Raystown Lake. Thousands visit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-operated recreation area each year to boat, fish, and camp, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars spent at local businesses. 
Or rather, they used to. 
On a typical Memorial Day weekend, Raystown Lake would be packed. 
But this year, in the wake of federal staffing cuts and the resulting closure of a major campground, normally thriving operations near the lake are struggling to stay afloat. One proprietor told the Philadelphia Inquirer the campground closure has cut their business in half. Another described the scene to WJAC-TV as a “ghost town.”

Compare Raystown to any of Pennsylvania’s 124 state parks, where business is booming. Earlier this year, the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) reported a nearly 30 percent increase in state park campground reservations, and with vacation season now fully underway, tourist dollars are pouring into communities with open public lands. 
Already a $19 billion industry, Pennsylvania’s outdoor sector is only getting bigger as financially-pinched vacationers across the northeastern U.S. increasingly seek out adventures closer to home, and people are turning to the outdoors for peace and relaxation.
DCNR is working hard to maintain its spectacular resources, while also meeting growing demand, but new opportunities also await. Last month, state lawmakers got a peek at one of those opportunities on a tour of what could soon be the commonwealth’s first underground state park: the sprawling four-mile cave complex known as Laurel Caverns. 
The Cale family has stewarded the privately owned site in Fayette County for almost a century, welcoming visitors since 1964. This year, owner David Cale is ready to realize his lifelong dream of making the caverns a free, public amenity.
Acquiring Laurel Caverns won’t cost taxpayers a dime, since the Cales intend to donate the 400-acre property. All that’s required is a modest investment to update and staff the facility, which — judging from the nearly $2 billion visitor dollars spent annually in the Laurel Highlands — will soon deliver big returns in economic activity and community benefits. 
That investment is part of Governor Shapiro’s 2025-2026 budget proposal, which includes funding for trails and public lands statewide. 
Among them is the popular Glen Onoko Falls hiking trail near Jim Thorpe, which would reopen as a state park site after being closed to hikers since 2019. Like Laurel Caverns, Glen Onoko is already an established attraction with a proven record of drawing visitors who spend money locally, not to mention a spot beloved by generations of Lehigh Valley residents.

Just as important as opening new parks, the Shapiro budget also increases funding for DCNR to manage and improve our existing public lands across the state. These funds support everything from trash removal and picnic shelters to resort-class amenities enjoyed by locals and visitors alike, such as the golf course and swimming pool at Caledonia State Park.
As lawmakers hash out the budget in the coming weeks, they would do well to consider Raystown Lake, and what happens when we fail to support the outdoor assets that give back so much to our communities and the businesses that sustain them. 
The good news is that leaders in both parties understand why investing in public lands and outdoor recreation is an easy win for the economy, the environment, and all Pennsylvanians. Present and future generations of Pennsylvanians will thank Gov. Shapiro and state legislators for making our communities more livable and prosperous.

Kelly O. Hayes, the acting U.S. Attorney for Maryland, is acting no more.
Hayes was sworn in Tuesday as the next U.S. attorney for the state, replacing former U.S. Attorney Erek Barron, who left in February.
Hayes was chosen for interim post by Attorney General Pam Bondi, but someone nominated by the attorney general can only hold the post in a interim capacity for 120 days. After that, falls to the judges of the district to appoint a successor.
After the clock ran out of Hayes’ interim appointment, with no replacement nominee coming from the White House, the judges of the district voted to appoint Hayes to the job. She took the oath of office Tuesday, administered by Chief Judge George L. Russell III, and will serve until a replacement is nominated and approved.
Hayes said in a prepared statement that she was “honored by the confidence” the judges placed in her to serve.
“It is a privilege to lead this great office and to work alongside such dedicated public servants committed to upholding the rule of law and seeking justice on behalf of our communities,” her statement said. “I look forward to continuing to zealously combat criminal activity to ensure public safety and to steadfastly represent the interests of the United States.”
Hayed was raised in Montgomery County, attended the University of Maryland, College Park, and received her law degree from the University of North Carolina School of Law. After clerking for Judge Janis L. Sammartino in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, she joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland in 2013.
She served as principal deputy chief, deputy chief and, since 2021, as chief of the district court’s Southern Division. As chief, she oversaw all criminal investigations and prosecutions for the district. She also served as deputy appellate chief for the district.
Hayes has made “public safety, national security, and the protection of children …  top priorities for the District,” according to the news release.

Shingledecker comes home to Chesapeake Conservancy
In its search for new leadership, the Chesapeake Conservancy turned to an old friend, announcing Wednesday that one of its former vice presidents would be taking the helm. Susan Shingledecker, who served as the conservancy’s vice president and director of programs from 2017 to 2020, will step in as CEO on Sept. 8, according to a news release from the conservancy.

The Conservancy, which is based in Annapolis, focuses on land conservation and water restoration in Maryland.
Shingledecker will replace Joel Dunn, who left the nonprofit in December after 14 years. He went to the Campaign for Nature.
“Susan’s return is a homecoming we are thrilled to celebrate,” said Chesapeake Conservancy Board Chair Stephanie Meeks in a statement. “Following a nationwide search, the Board is confident that Susan brings the strategic leadership, nonprofit management experience and deep passion for the Chesapeake Bay that this role requires.
Shingledecker, who lives in Severna Park with her husband and two sons, comes from Earth Science Information Partners, where she served as executive director. ESIP, a Severna Park nonprofit funded by cooperative agreements with NASA, NOAA, and USGS, works to encourage scientific collaboration in the earth and climate science field.
“I’m honored to return to Chesapeake Conservancy and lead this incredible team working to protect the nation’s largest estuary and one of the most iconic and vital landscapes in the country,” Shingledecker said in the statement. “My five years at ESIP have given me an incredible understanding of the opportunities for data to inform our conservation work, increase our efficiency and grow our impact.”
Is it that time already?
The 2026 primary election is a year off — June 23, 2026 — which means it’s time for candidates to start lining up. It’s probably well before time, actually, but judging by the emails landing in our inbox in recent days, it’s never too early for some candidates. In State House races:
– Three of the four Republican incumbents in District 5, which includes parts of Carroll and Frederick counties, are running as a team for reelection. Sen. Justin Ready and Dels. April Rose and Chris Tomlinson are touting their “strong, conservative record”. Ready, the Senate minority whip, serves on Senate Finance Committee. Rose, in her second term, is the assistant minority leader and serves on the Economic Matters Committee, while Tomlinson, a freshman, is chair of the Carroll County delegation and a member of the Judiciary Committee.

Rose and Tomlinson face challenges in the GOP primary from Steve Whisler, a member of the Carroll County Board of Education who filed way back in March, and Sallie Taylor, a party activist who served as a staff member for former Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and Del. Dan Cox. She filed in April.
The fourth incumbent in District 5, Republican Del. Christopher Bouchat, told the Baltimore Sun last fall that he was disgusted with Annapolis and would not seek reelection. But not too disgusted, apparently — he told The Sun last week that he’s running for governor, although he has yet to file. He hasn’t told Maryland Matters anything because he has not returned several days worth of calls.
– Nobody claims to be running for governor in southeastern Baltimore’s District 46, so the four Democrats there getting the gang back together and running as a team. Sen. Bill Ferguson and Dels. Luke Clippinger, Mark Edelson and Robbyn Lewis tout their success bringing millions to district projects, investing in schools, pushing for affordable housing and fighting “the chaos and lawlessness of the Trump administration,” among other achievements. Ferguson, first elected in 2010, has been president of the Senate since 2020. Clippinger, also elected in 2010, is chair of the Judiciary Committee. Lewis, appointed in 2016, serves on Environment and Transportation and Edelson, a freshman, is on the Appropriations Committee. They are the only four filed in the district so far.
– In Montgomery County’s District 18, Democratic Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher did not announce a reelection team. But there were plenty of other names on his reelection announcement, which listed more than 60 endorsements already from federal, state and local lawmakers, beginning with Gov. Wes Moore (D) down to community leaders. Waldstreicher, who was elected in 2018, has been vice chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee since 2020, where he has led on various criminal justice reform measures, including the Gun Safety Act of 2023. “I’m humbled that these diverse community leaders and elected officials are supporting my re-election campaign,” Waldstreicher said in his announcement.
His District 18 mate, Del. Aaron Kaufman (D), filed paperwork for reelection last month, the only candidate actually filed in the district so far. Kaufman, elected in 2022, serves on the House Judiciary Committee. The freshman delegate, who has cerebral palsy, highlights his advocacy on disability rights such as legislation signed into law this year on powered wheelchairs.

The Republican-led state Senate passed both measures earlier this year. They now head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. The votes occurred just hours after the Senate approved a House measure dealing with the same topic.
Senate Bill 227 targets K-12 education, while Senate Bill 558 focuses on public colleges and universities. The bills would prohibit what sponsors describe as “divisive concepts” from being taught in the classroom.
These measures are part of Republican-led efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the public sector — in government, higher education and K-12 education.
Several Democratic representatives denounced the legislation targeting K-12 schools and universities as harmful in Wednesday’s House floor debate. “It is un-American to be anti-diversity, equity and inclusion,” said Rep. Amos L. Quick III, D-Guilford.
Opponents also contend the bills will chill academic freedom and honest discussions about historical oppression and that the prohibitions are vaguely worded. “What this bill does is chill teachers. They will be reluctant… to teach about the Trail of Tears, or Japanese internment camps… some of these things that are crucial to North Carolina history,” said Rep. Marcia Morey, D-Durham.
Separately, the North Carolina Senate on Wednesday passed House Bill 171, (“Equality in State Agencies/Prohibition on DEI”) which would ban state agencies from promoting, supporting, funding, implementing or maintaining workplace DEI, including in hirings, dedicated staff positions and offering or requiring DEI training. 
State workers who violate the measure could be subject to removal, a fine of up to $5,000 and potential civil litigation. And the state auditor’s office, currently held by Republican Dave Boliek, would conduct “periodic” audits of agencies to assure compliance.
Sen. Danny Britt, R-Hoke, described the bill as ensuring “everyone should be treated equally across the board.” An amendment adopted on the Senate floor added provisions that would require internal grievance processes before civil actions can be filed.
Another amendment would require that only a prevailing party could receive attorney fees. The bill had originally seemed to indicate that complainants who challenged alleged DEI activities unsuccessfully could receive them. Britt stated he believes this change “would eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the number of unfounded DEI claims.”
Sen. Val Applewhite of Cumberland County said the bill is not about protecting merit. “It’s about protecting privilege. It’s about fear, fear that as this nation grows more diverse… the grip on power by a shrinking few is slipping away.”
The bill will now go back to the House for concurrence with the Senate amendments.
To overcome a potential veto from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, House Republicans would need at least one Democrat to vote with them if all members are present.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)  The race to the legislative finish line this year was every bit as drama-filled and frenzied as expected. Restrictions on assault weapons got top billing, including on the eight-and-a-half hour marathon that marked the final day of the session, but there was plenty more to crow about and criticize during the jam-packed final weeks.
Here are five wins you might have missed from the 2025 Rhode Island General Assembly. Stay tuned for the losses, coming Friday.

 1. Shekarchi zones in on housing 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi succeeded in his push to boost housing production in Rhode Island for a third consecutive year, with 10 of the 12 bills of his legislative package clearing the Senate in the final days of the session. (All 12 had already secured approval in the lower chamber.)
That includes two bills sponsored by Shekarchi: one to expand electronic permitting and another to amend the state’s building code by centralizing the responsibilities of various officials, commissions, and boards involved in building and fire code permitting.
Other bills passed include measures to allow townhouses wherever duplexes are permitted, require mixed-use zoning in every community, and promote the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings into housing.
“Rhode Island’s housing crisis was decades in the making and is taking a sustained effort, over the course of years, to address,” Shekarchi said in a statement Monday.  “I am so appreciative of all of the partners who work with me to address our housing shortage, and this progress is the result of our collaborative efforts.”
Legislation that would have allowed development of vacant state-owned land did not make it across the finish line. Shekarchi described the bill as in need of some “fine-tuning,” pledging to work with the Senate on it again next year.  
Also left hanging by the Senate was legislation that would have eased local restrictions on subdividing large parcels of land, despite having passed in the House on May 15. However, Shekarchi noted that elements of the stalled bill were addressed in one of the successful 10 bills, which sought to eliminate unnecessary red tape and delays in local land subdivision more broadly.
Senate President Valarie Lawson said while there were concerns with the bill, she intends to continue to work with Shekarchi and other lawmakers to encourage further housing development.

2. All rise for AG Neronha 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s skilled litigation style persuaded lawmakers to his side on a host of policy changes and added funding for his office for new hires.
Neronha initially sought 13 more staffers for his office, asking for $1.7 million to fund the hires in his fiscal 2026 budget request to Gov. Dan McKee. McKee’s proposed spending plan did not offer any of the money, or additional employees.
Neronha subsequently revised his request, asking lawmakers in the House Committee on Finance for four, rather than 13, hires, funded by settlements his office had won for the states. Lawmakers included an $848,000 allocation of state settlement money for the extra AG staffers in the final fiscal 2026 budget.
Neronha thanked lawmakers for funding the hires in a statement Tuesday.
“The people of my Office show up to work every day with one goal: improve the lives of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha said. “These four additional attorneys will share in that goal, and deliver for the residents of our state.”
Neronha scored wins on several policy changes, too, including a change to state procurement to ban “bid-rigging” by public officials. The Neronha-backed legislation taking aim at McKee’s involvement in “steering” a state education contract to the ILO Group in 2021, passed unanimously in the Senate on the final night of the session, having already secured approval by a strong majority of the House. 
Lawmakers also signed on to versions of some of Neronha’s proposed remedies for the health care crisis, such as using Medicare reimbursement rates as the standard by which to hike corresponding Medicaid payments to primary care providers, and doing away with cumbersome and time-consuming pre-authorization requirements for primary care providers.
Finally, the AG’s office staved off an eleventh hour challenge by House Republicans to his authority over state settlements. GOP lawmakers unsuccessfully attempted during the House budget vote on June 17 to siphon $11 million from the AG’s fiscal 2026 funding as a quid pro quo for what they argued was an unconstitutional overstep of his authority. Neronha had already set in motion a plan to spend the $11 million state settlement from the Route 6/10 contamination lawsuit on pediatric dental care in Providence. 
Speaking to reporters after the June 17 House budget vote, Shekarchi affirmed Neronha’s authority over the state settlement funds.
“If this particular settlement was unfair, the solution is to appeal that,” Shekarchi said. “What we’re doing with the money is helping underprivileged children with health care and dental care is a good thing and I will never be against that.”
Neronha’s office did not return inquiries for comment Tuesday.

3. Republicans at the ready for 2026 
The most high-profile victory of the session belongs to those who supported a state ban on assault-style weapons — even if the final legislation did not go as far as some had hoped. 
But state Republicans wasted little time turning “L” on what they say is a matter of Constitutional rights into a potential win for the party and its candidates in the 2026 election cycle.
GOP Chairman Joe Powers initiated the call to action Friday night, declaring it was actively recruiting candidates to challenge the “anti-Constitution, anti-liberty legislators” who voted to limit assault-style weapons in the state.
“We now have a clear, targeted list of every legislator who voted to betray their oath — and their time is running out,” Powers said in a statement. “To every Rhode Islander who still believes in the Constitution — we’re not going to fix this by posting memes or yelling at the TV. We fix it by running for office, knocking doors, and taking back this state seat by seat.”
His call to action has already been met with a flurry of responses — a few dozen potential candidates have reached out to the Republican Party in just the last four days, Powers said Tuesday night.
Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz of North Smithfield debuted a new “Keeping the Spirit of 1776 Alive” fundraising campaign Tuesday morning, seeking support and donations to retain and boost the Republican’s 14-person presence on Smith Hill.
It’s no secret that state and local Republican party committees have struggled to recruit candidates for state and local office, diminishing their voice in a solidly blue state. Could the contested ban on assault weapons sales change the tides in their favor?
“I think it can’t hurt,” said Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican and former House minority leader.
Newberry had already heard rumblings of potential Republican challengers coming out of the woodwork to run against Sen. John Burke, a West Warwick Democrat who voted for the revised assault weapons ban in committee, and again on the floor, last week. Burke in a text Tuesday declined to comment, noting the 2026 legislative elections are still more than a year away.
Powers also declined to reveal details of party strategy, but said the GOP is eyeing specific legislative districts to mount challenges next year, with plans in the works well before the legislature’s final vote on the assault weapons sale ban.
“We saw the writing on the wall,” Powers said in an interview. “We’re not dummies.”

4. Hands off those cat claws  
Your furniture may hate you, but your cat will soon thank you. Lawmakers in the final days of session approved companion bills that ban declawing felines unless it’s for therapeutic use, such as to treat recurring infections or an abnormal condition in the claw that comprises the feline’s health. Anyone who violates the ban faces a fine up to $1,000. 
State law already prohibits landlords from requiring their tenants’ cats to be declawed, carrying a similar fine to the legislation banning the practice statewide.
“Declawing is painful, unnecessary and inhumane — it’s no way to treat any pet,” Sen. Melissa Murray, the Woonsocket Democrat who sponsored the bill, said in a statement. “Fortunately, there has been growing awareness of the risks and cruelty of declawing.”
Declawing a cat is viewed as similar to severing a human finger at the last knuckle, according to written testimony by the Animal League Defense Legislative Fund. The organization stated that scratching is a normal, healthy behavior for felines as it allows them to stretch their back muscles, relieve stress, and keep their nails in good condition.
The proposed ban also saw support from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Paw Project, and Humane World for Animals. 
But not all advocacy groups supported the legislation. The Rhode Island Veterinary Medical Association submitted a letter saying the decision to declaw should be left up to vets, not the state.
New York was the first state to ban declawing cats in 2019, followed by Maryland in 2022 and Virginia in March 2024. Massachusetts legalized a similar ban earlier in the year.
  A bill weakening public notice requirements for sale of self-storage units passed the Rhode Island General Assembly on the final night of the legislative session. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)
5. Self storage sale protections that could have been 
It might seem odd to celebrate failed legislation. But Rep. Cherie Cruz refused to let the outcome diminish her joy over a rare demonstration of bipartisan support for protections for self-storage unit renters in the lower chamber Friday.
The proposal aims to weaken public notice requirements that self-storage facility owners have to give before selling off contents of “abandoned units.”
Cruz successfully petitioned her legislative colleagues to support a floor amendment to the House version that gives storage unit renters 15 days, rather than one, to access their unit after defaulting on a payment, and extends the amount of time storage unit owners have to advertise pending sales online.
“This bill wasn’t my top priority, but it was something I saw as a basic right to notice,” Cruz said in an interview Tuesday. She noted that the housing crisis has forced people to move into smaller spaces, potentially doubling or tripling up with family or friends and putting their belongings in self storage. 
Cruz’ amendment scraped through in a 32-31 vote, with support from progressive and moderate Democrats and nine of 10 chamber Republicans. Adding to the drama of the narrowest vote margin of the night: Rep. Brandon Voas, a Cumberland Democrat, missed the vote on the amendment, but later asked to have his vote recorded as a ‘“no.”
His request was shot down because it would have changed the outcome — against the chamber’s rules. 
Cruz called it “democracy in action,” noting the rarity for floor amendments on any issue to pass without leadership’s backing.
“It gave me hope,” she said.
But her triumph was fleeting; minutes later, the chamber approved the unchanged, Senate version of the bill, which sets a one-day window for renters to access their units after defaulting on payments, and only requires online notice of a sale once a week for two consecutive weeks.
Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat and bill sponsor, did not vote for Cruz’ amendment, though Cruz said Hull told her he thought it “made sense.” Hull did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment.
Robert Jacquard, a lobbyist paid $3,500 a month to represent the Self Storage Association, said in an email Tuesday that he would work with Cruz on her ideas for additional notice requirements during the “offseason.”

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)This week Virginia has set new heat records and come close to beating old ones for this time of year. The Richmond airport recorded a temperature of 99 degrees at the hottest part of the day on Tuesday, Roanoke reached 99, and Alexandria reached 98. Those high temperatures come at a crucial time for many crops growing across the commonwealth.
“We are at a critical point for certain crops like corn that are either about to pollinate or our pollinating and so it will have an impact,” said Wilmer Stoneman, vice president of agriculture development and innovation for the Virginia Farm Bureau.
Virginia’s largest commodities include corn, soybeans, cotton, peanuts and wheat. In the summer, crops are pollinating but high heat reduces the pollen survival rate, which could impact yields down the road. 
“When it comes to corn there’s research that’s been done that says for every day you’re above 90 degrees consecutively you can have a 3-5% reduction in yield during bloom period,” said Matthew Chappell, director of Virginia Tech’s Tidewater Agricultural Research and Extension Center.
While some may have lamented the amount of rain Virginia experienced this spring, those soggy days and others to come are helping save crops as the temperature rises. The state’s soil is very moist which helps keep crops alive, even though rainy days may make it difficult for farmers to get tractors through their fields. The National Weather Service in Wakefield predicts showers will fall across most regions of the state this weekend and some days next week. 
“This is the time of year we need a little temperature but we have to have rain,” Stoneman said.
If things were to take a turn towards drier patterns while high temperatures persist, then farmers would have cause to worry. As of Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that no counties in Virginia are under drought conditions. This year the state has seen an average of three inches more rain than normal.
“This time last year it turned hot, but it also turned dry. We had what a lot of people consider a mini drought and it basically went from a bumper corn crop the year before to basically no corn crop,” Stoneman said. “Producers had half over or didn’t produce any corn last year.”
Chappell said that this year is not necessarily hotter than past years; rather the extreme heat is happening earlier than usual during a delicate time in the growing process for multiple crops. The heat also puts restraints on when laborers can be in the fields tending to crops, as heat indexes can reach extremely dangerous levels.
“Extremes and prolonged weather extremes are always a tough hurdle for farmers to to deal with, but they’re resilient folks,” Stoneman said, adding that the rain is welcome and necessary. “We can’t have all sunshine and make a crop.”
Stoneman also said the wet soil is contributing to a humid weather pattern that can help form thunderstorms that will provide more rain. But that precipitation needs to be widespread across the growing fields to have a big impact on crops.

This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Tennessee Lookout . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. 
ProPublica and the Tennessee Lookout are continuing to investigate Harpeth Financial, which owns Flex Loan operator Advance Financial and online sportsbook Action 247. To tell us about the experience you had with either or both companies, call or text reporter Adam Friedman at 615-249-8509.
Jeanette Thomas had just made her first payment on a loan from payday lender Advance Financial when she said the company emailed her with “good news.” She could borrow $206 more. 
The solicitation was a relief to Thomas, a 62-year-old grandmother who had already exhausted the $783 disability check she receives each month since her health conditions render her unable to work. 
Over the next few months, Thomas made the required minimum payments on what started in 2019 as a $400 loan to buy Christmas presents. But each time she did so, the company invited her to borrow almost all of the payment back, she said, with emails or letters like “Access Your Cash Today” or “You’re Already Approved.”
“They kept trying to rope me in,” Thomas said.
In the months that followed, the company continued to expand her credit, allowing Thomas to borrow close to $1,600 in total. In the emails and letters that Thomas kept, Advance never stated how much it would cost if she continued to reborrow. 
Thomas had read her original loan documents warning that the loan carried a high 279.5% interest rate and would be challenging to pay off. But as the loan balance grew, Thomas came to realize she was trapped. By the spring of 2021, Thomas had paid Advance almost $4,000, yet she still owed more than $1,000 and was paying more than $200 a month to cover the interest, depleting the disability checks that were her only source of income.
Until the Flex Loan, reborrowing or rolling over payday loans was against the law. Tennessee lawmakers first banned reborrowing when they passed the state’s payday lending law in 1997. They reaffirmed that protection in 2011 when they updated that law.
When Tennessee lawmakers passed a 2014 law allowing Flex Loans, they included no such provision.
Instead, the bill’s sponsor, current House Speaker Cameron Sexton, said the loans could be better for borrowers because it required them to make a monthly minimum payment that covered all fees, interest and 3% of the principal. This key provision would ensure that borrowers would always be paying down the principal on the loan.
Thomas and more than a dozen borrowers told the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica that Advance has encouraged them through emails and notifications to borrow back the value of almost all of the payments they made, tearing a hole in the safety net the law tried to put in place. 
All but one of the 14 borrowers who spoke to the newsrooms for this story reported having reborrowed at least once as part of their Advance loan. As with Thomas, Advance made them eligible to borrow more shortly after paying, even though they were often making the minimum payments and almost immediately borrowing the money back to cover the cost of the payment they just made.  Advance went on to sue 12 of these borrowers once they stopped being able to afford the loan.
  Advance Financial sent ads to several borrowers telling them they were eligible to borrow more. (Obtained by Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. Highlighted and redacted by ProPublica.)
Andrea Heady, 45, was sued by Advance in Knoxville for over $7,300, despite having paid the company nearly double what she ultimately borrowed. She initially took out $750 through a Flex Loan after the hours at her university job were slashed in June 2020.
“I’ve always sent money home to my mom,” who was taking care of Heady’s sister, she said. “It was COVID. My aunt and uncle were very sick, then they passed away and I just needed money.”
Heady said Advance would send her notifications letting her know she could borrow more. One email appeared as a financial statement, but included in bold and large text was the amount she had available to borrow. The statement did not provide a payment schedule, a new loan amount, the total cost of the loan or how long it would take to pay off making minimum payments, information a lender would have been required to provide if she’d been borrowing on a credit card.

Heady reborrowed on her Flex Loan over a dozen times over the next 18 months as Advance increased her credit limit seven times. She stopped paying when her monthly payments of $650 equaled a quarter of her paycheck. 
Heady hoped the company would forget about her, but it didn’t. In 2024 Advance sued and won a wage garnishment against her. Ultimately, Heady will end up paying Advance over $14,000 on the $3,850 she borrowed. 
David Hill, a 36-year-old from Nashville, started by borrowing $175 from Advance in February 2020. Each month he would repay the full borrowed amount, including interest and fees, and reborrow the principal, often on the same or next day. Over 18 months, he reborrowed almost 80 times.
“COVID happened and I was going through financial trouble,” Hill said. “I would get a check and pay it off. But then I would have to borrow it back to have money.”
Via email, Advance kept increasing his credit limit and encouraging him to borrow more. “Dear David,” started two of the emails, which contained notes like “good news — you have $645 available.” Hill eventually reached a point where he couldn’t afford the minimum payment, totaling over $400 a month. 
He stopped paying and the company sued him in 2023 for over $4,700.

The Lookout and ProPublica sent detailed questions to Cullen Earnest, the senior vice president of public policy at Advance Financial. Earnest repeated what he said in a previous statement, that the company has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau. He added that the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions has received just 91 complaints about flexible credit lenders since 2020, representing less than 0.001% of all new flex loan agreements, and that this data reflects the satisfaction of the vast majority of Advance’s customers.
The Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica previously reported that the company has sued over 110,000 Tennesseeans since it began offering the Flex Loan in 2015, making it one of the largest single plaintiffs in the state. One of the subjects in that story reborrowed on her Flex Loan over a dozen times, turning $4,400 in borrowed cash into more than $12,500 in payments to Advance. The company sued her and won a judgment that led to the garnishment of her wages. 
Christopher Peterson, a senior official with the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2012 to 2016 and a contributor to multiple reports about payday loans, said the agency sought to limit reborrowing on payday and title loans because the desire to borrow again often indicated that borrowers couldn’t afford the loans and would be paying them off forever. That is especially true of the Flex Loan in Tennessee, he said. 
“It’s a nasty loan,” he said.
 A better loan?
The CFPB began targeting high-interest lenders in 2013, releasing a report on the dangers of payday loans and how reborrowing often led to debt traps. 
With the threat of federal regulation looming, Advance Financial Chairman Michael Hodges started working with Tennessee lawmakers to create a new type of high-interest loan that would avoid federal oversight, he told the Nashville Business Journal. 
In Tennessee’s state House, Advance and other high-interest lenders turned to Sexton to sponsor the legislation.
Sexton was then the majority whip, a position typically reserved for ambitious state House members hoping to travel up the party’s ranks. Sexton also knew banking. He worked at a local bank as a business development executive, a position he still holds today, along with having a seat on its board.

Starting in the spring of 2014, Sexton began guiding Flex Loan legislation through Tennessee’s state House committees. On the surface, the bill appeared to be a new type of loan with a 24% interest rate, which would be significantly cheaper than the triple-digit interest on payday and title loans. But the actual cost could be found in the bill’s details, which gave lenders the right to charge a 0.7% daily customary fee, which over a year adds another 255.5%.
Official video recordings from legislative committee hearings show that neither legislators nor Sexton discussed reborrowing or the loan’s interest rate. 
When Sexton took to the Tennessee House floor in April 2014, his colleagues showed him deference because of his banking experience, said former Rep. Craig Fitzhugh, a rural West Tennessee Democrat and the minority leader at the time, who sponsored the original payday lending legislation in 1997.
During the hearing, Fitzhugh asked Sexton if he thought the soon-to-be-created Flex Loan was “a step up for consumers” compared to payday and title loans. Sexton said that was a “fair statement.”
When a lawmaker asked about the interest rate, Sexton said it was 190% to 210%, which is lower than the actual rate. But Sexton once again assured lawmakers that the minimum payment would reduce the cost of the loan for consumers. 
“When you reduce the principal each and every month, obviously you’re decreasing the amount of interest,” Sexton said from the House floor.
The Flex Loan legislation passed the Tennessee House 83-6, with Fitzhugh abstaining from the vote. Fitzhugh said the high-interest lending landscape in Tennessee has only “gotten worse” over the past decade because of Flex Loans. 
Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat, said she regrets voting for the Flex Loan legislation and feels like proponents of the legislation misled her.
“I definitely would not vote that way today, and would like to work to fix that massive mistake that’s hurt so many Tennesseans,” Johnson said. 
A spokesperson for Sexton did not respond to questions from Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica.  
Since passing the Flex Loans bill in 2014, Sexton has received over $105,000 in contributions to his campaign and political action committee from Advance Financial and its affiliated PACs, making them one of his largest contributors. 
No money for food
Over five years after the law passed, Jeanette Thomas walked into an Advance Financial store three weeks before Christmas 2019 and filled out an application.
Thomas said she listed her income, gave them her debit card number and permission to directly charge her bank account the required monthly minimum payment. A borrower isn’t required to put up any assets, like a car or future paycheck, to get a Flex Loan. 
  Thomas wound up in a debt trap, borrowing again and again to keep herself afloat. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had tried to restrict reborrowing to protect consumers from falling into this kind of hole. (Stacy Kranitz for ProPublica)
Unlike some other borrowers, Advance allowed Thomas to pay monthly, instead of biweekly, because that’s how she received her federal disability benefits. Thomas said she suffered physical abuse for decades that left her with a traumatic brain injury.
The company deposited $400 into her account the same day she walked into the store. 
At the time of the loan, Thomas had been trying to build a better relationship with her two sons and three grandchildren. She used the money to purchase gift cards, art supplies and toys. She was happy to be able to give her family something for the holidays. 
Thomas’ first minimum payment to Advance was due Dec. 31 and was a manageable $51.78. That December had been cold, and when Thomas’ heat bill came in $50 higher than normal, she started to worry. 
Then, just two days after her loan payment, Thomas said an unsolicited email arrived from Advance telling her she was eligible to borrow $206 more. Thomas thought she could afford it. Why would Advance loan her money she couldn’t pay back, she said she thought. 
What Thomas did not realize was her first bill had only been for a 13-day payment period, meaning she’d been charged less than two weeks of interest. By taking the additional loan for an entire month, her monthly payment would almost triple to $130 per month. 
Over the next two months, the company offered her a lifeline, extending her credit limit enough that she could make her payments with the money she’d just borrowed. 
Eventually, Advance stopped increasing her credit limit and her monthly payment had increased to $230 a month, almost a third of her disability check.
Thomas cut her spending to the bone, hoping that a few months of payments would get her out of debt. She turned to friends to help pay for food, and to a local church to cover her utility bill. 
Thomas said Advance sent her mailers and emails multiple times a month, offering to let her borrow any of the principal she had paid off. She tried to resist, but inevitably, she would have an unexpected expense, like medical bills from a series of mini strokes. 
Thomas found herself in the position the CFPB had warned about when it sought to restrict reborrowing. Former CFPB official Peterson, who’s now a law professor at the University of Utah, helped work on the agency’s 2017 payday regulations. At the time, the agency wrote that consumers who reborrowed would inevitably be forced to choose between making an unaffordable payment on the loan or paying for necessities like food or rent.
By May 2021, Thomas could no longer afford to pay. The company kept her loan open and unpaid for 90 days, allowing the interest and fees to accumulate, nearly doubling the amount due to $1,700. Advance then charged Thomas two times in one week, withdrawing $430, or half of her monthly budget.
  Thomas continues to receive bills requesting a minimum payment of $226.49 years after closing her account with Advance Financial. (Obtained by Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.)
“I can remember just lying in my bed, stomach hurting and doubled over in pain because I couldn’t get something to eat,” Thomas said. 
Not knowing where to turn for help, Thomas filed a complaint with the Tennessee attorney general’s Division of Consumer Affairs. In her complaint, she wrote that Advance “needs to stop abusing their power.” 
“Now I cannot pay my rent,” she said. 
The state investigated the case and took no action. By October 2022, Advance noted on one of Thomas’s monthly bills that it had “written off” her loan and closed her account. Unlike the other 110,000 Tennesseans who fell behind in their payments, Advance hasn’t sued Thomas, whose federal benefits are protected from garnishment. 
The company also agreed in a letter to the state to “cease all communications” with Thomas, but Advance continues to send bills requesting a minimum payment of $226.49.

“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
Living longer
People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
Uncertain grants
Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
Skipping pills
In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

It’s not that often that floor debates in the North Carolina legislature shed much light on important subjects.
One impressive exception to this rule took place this week, however, when Durham Democratic Senator Sophia Chitlik addressed a bill that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state government.
In her remarks, Chitlik pointed out a glaring problem that has afflicted numerous bills advanced by Republican lawmakers this year – bills that that they, the sponsors, claim are designed to end all discrimination and promote quote “equal opportunity.” Namely, they were all drafted and sponsored exclusively by white men.
As Chitlik’s remarks served to highlight, the Senate features several members from groups long targeted for blatant discrimination in our society – women, people off color, LGBTQ people – and it only stands to reason that any bill worth its salt on the subject would include at least some involvement from them. But of course, they don’t.
The bottom line: The anti-DEI bills aren’t about ending discrimination — they’re about protecting it. Arguments to the contrary are simply delusional.

The PCS (Proposed Committee Substitute) to House Bill 59 would expand eligibility requirements for existing county programs that give property tax breaks to citizens 65 and older and to those with permanent disabilities. The programs are administered by all of North Carolina’s 100 counties, but state lawmakers must sign off on any changes.
  Rep. Erin Paré (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rising property taxes, particularly in the state’s urban centers, are making it increasingly difficult for seniors and citizens with disabilities to stay in their homes, State Rep. Erin Paré (R-Wake), a bill sponsor, told committee members.
“I’ve heard from people who are in their 80s who bought their homes 50 years ago and they just simply cannot, based on their fixed income as a senior citizen, afford to live there anymore because they can’t afford their property tax bill,” Paré said. “It’s very sad because at that age, they want to stay in their home, of course, and they don’t want to move, and this is a desperate situation for them.”
The committee gave a favorable report to the PCS and referred it to the House Finance Committee. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 349, a bill that Paré said does “almost the exact same thing” is winding its way through the Senate. With the General Assembly set depart Raleigh for an extended summer break this week, final approval — if it occurs — will almost certainly not occur until later in the summer or fall.
The current relief menu
North Carolina currently offers three property tax relief programs for qualified homeowners that are administered by counties:

The Elderly/Disabled Homestead Exemption is for residents 65 years or older or those who are totally and permanently disabled. The program excludes from taxes the greater of $25,000 or 50% of the assessed value of the owner’s permanent residence.
The Circuit Breaker limits the amount of annual property taxes the owner pays on their permanent residence. Eligibility is limited to homeowners who are 65 and older or who are totally and permanently disabled. The tax bill is limited to a fixed percentage of income, and any taxes owed above that limit is deferred until a “disqualifying event” such as the owner’s death. This program requires a new application to be filed every year.
The Disabled Veteran Exclusion program excludes up to the first $45,000 of the appraised value of the permanent residence of a disabled veteran who has a total and permanent service-connected disability or who received benefits for specially adapted housing. There is no age or income limitation for this program.

 Increasing eligibility
Under HB 59, a provision would be added to the program for elderly citizens and those with disabilities who are married. Currently, income cannot exceed $37,900 for a married couple. It would increase by 15% to $43,585 for a couple under HB 59.
Also, a new income eligibility provision would be added to the Circuit Breaker program. A household of two earning up to 70% of area median income (AMI) would qualify. Currently, the income limit is $56,850. Paré noted that the income limit for Wake County would jump to $68,495 for the Circuit Breaker program under HB 59.
“By connecting this to average median income, we’re trying to apply it uniformly, but it really addresses more of those high cost of living areas where there’s move of a problem,” Paré said.
For some counties, Paré said, existing program qualifications and income eligibility requirements will be better than those proposed under HB 59.
Counties would absorb tax revenue losses if HB 59 becomes law, Paré said when asked by Rep. James Roberson (D-Wake) if Wake County leaders were prepared for such a scenario. Paré estimates tax revenue losses of $15 million for Wake County if the bill becomes law.
“What I can tell you Rep. Roberson, there’s nothing in the bill that makes a county whole as a result of this by the state, if that is what you’re asking me,” Paré said.
Paré added that she worked with the Wake County Tax Administrator Marcus Kinrade and others on the bill.
“He’s [Kinrade] obviously the tax administrator and not an elected county commissioner, but I would say that in my discussions with county commissioners, that they have been looking for this, wanting to support something like this,” Paré said.
  Rep. Donny Lambeth (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) said he welcomes legislation to ease tax burdens for senior citizens and other populations vulnerable to rising property taxes.
“I hear this a lot from senior citizens in my district because property taxes, in fact, have gone up so much over the last 10 years for houses and house values have gone up, so it it’s become a big issue, particularly in my county,” Lambeth said. “I think you have come up with a reasonable solution. Will there be some impact to the counties? Yes, but I don’t think that there will be a major impact to the counties, so I wholeheartedly support doing something to try to help these individuals.”
 Residents and advocates weigh in
John Adcock, a Wake County resident, spoke in favor of the bill, noting that Wake County has raised property taxes four consecutive years. Adcock said his tax bill has increased 43% since 2020. And while he would not qualify for the tax help under HB 59, Adcock said his mother would if she were still alive and the bill became law.
“If she had lived to this year, her property taxes on her residence would have increased by 85% over the last five years for life,” Adcock said. “It’s my belief that my mother would have qualified for this exclusion, and by operation of this bill, her tax bill would be cut in half for 2026.”
He said property tax hikes, increases in insurance premiums and local government sales taxes all contribute to the “financial burden of homeownership.”
“From a Wake County residence perspective, the way county commissioners have talked about housing affordability, yet their tax policies say the exact opposite” Adcock said. “By the adoption of this bill, the General Assembly will have a direct and tangible impact on housing affordability for those that qualify for this exemption.”
  Mary Bethel (Photo: NC Coalition on Aging)
Mary Bethel, chairwoman of the North Carolina Coalition on Aging, said transportation was the biggest issue people faced 40 years ago when she began advocating for seniors. The big issue now, she said, is concern about property taxes.
“We constantly hear from people, particularly those as Rep. Paré said have been in their homes for decades, who basically cannot afford their property taxes,” Bethel said. “This is happening not only in large metropolitan areas like Wake County where you’ve got a lot of big homes that are expensive, going up in neighborhoods that have lower income homes, but it’s also happening in smaller counties too where the property tax base is their primary source of revenue, so it’s a big issue.”
Bethel said a provision that would remove the tax deferment from the Circuit Breaker program would likely encourage more people to use the program. She said the program isn’t utilized as much as others because homeowners don’t want heirs to inherit their debt.
“It’s going to take a lot of education of older adults and persons with disabilities to assure them their property is not going to have a lean placed on it,” Bethel said. “I think this is a step in the right direction.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Property-taxes-iStock-Getty.jpeg,,,2025-06-26 05:01:56.870275

[…]","Getty Images.A Franklin County judge said Ohio’s private school voucher program is unconstitutional in a ruling this week. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s office is planning an appeal of the decision.
The court granted a summary judgment, which is a ruling that comes from a judge without the need for a full trial in the case.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page said the General Assembly has “exceedingly broad powers to tax, organize, administer and control the common school system,” but those powers “do not include unlimited discretion.”
The judge pushed back on private school voucher supporters’ claims that the program is a subsidy program providing scholarships, rather than a separate system of schools.
The idea of the “EdChoice” vouchers as a scholarship program instead of a system of schools “is mere semantics,” Page wrote, due to the fact that the state pays schools directly, rather than parents.
“More importantly, private schools participating in EdChoice receive substantially more state funding per student than public schools,” Page wrote. “Where EdChoice participating private schools are inexplicably receiving double the per-pupil state funding than public schools, it is difficult to say that EdChoice is simply a scholarship that follows and/or benefits the students as opposed to a system that benefits private schools.”
The state spent nearly $1 billion on private school vouchers in 2024 alone as near-universal eligibility was approved by the Ohio General Assembly.
The ruling rejected one of the claims from voucher opponents, an accusation that the voucher program created segregation in public schools as white students leave to attend private schools. The judge said no evidence of “discriminatory intent” was shown.
Though the judge ruled the voucher program unconstitutional, she allowed the program to continue “in recognition that this decision may cause significant changes to school funding in Ohio and the high likelihood that the parties will immediately appeal.”
Public school advocates praised the decision as not just a good one, but the constitutionally correct one.
“Any ruling different than the one we got would have been a horrific surprise and a mistake according to the constitution,” said William Phillis, executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, one of the leaders of the lawsuit.
A spokesperson for Senate President Rob McColley said the suit was “a shameful case of bench-shopping from a radical organization that prefers to vilify parents and children who simply want a better educational environment than they have now.”
A history lesson
The lawsuit was a constitutional challenge to Ohio’s private school voucher program. It started in January 2022, when opponents of the program filed their case in Franklin County, alleging violations of two clauses of the Ohio Constitution.
The first was a claim that the voucher program violated the requirement in the constitution that the state support a “thorough and efficient” system of public education, and the second claim alleged a violation of the state’s equal protection clause.
The case included an attempt to question Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman back when he was the Senate’s president, about legislative measures to support the voucher program and the process of implementing the program statewide. Huffman fought a subpoena and argued he had nothing to share in a deposition, adding that legislative privilege protected him from such questioning.
The court allowed Huffman to avoid an in-person deposition, instead requiring him to submit to written questioning, a decision he appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court.
Many Ohio school districts signed on to the lawsuit, including districts in Columbus, Cleveland Heights-University Heights, Richmond Heights, Huffman’s hometown of Lima, and Barberton. Individuals and parents of students also joined as parties to the lawsuit.
The schools and voucher opponents argued the funding that was being given as part of the program was taking away funding from public schools, who serve the vast majority of students in Ohio.
Page noted in her decision that in fiscal year 2022, more than $300 million went to about 575 chartered non-public schools through the voucher program, and of the schools that received the funds, 154 were given voucher funds for 75% or more of their enrolled students.
The judge also brought up arguments from certain schools who joined the lawsuit, who said “inadequate funding” has caused lay offs or suspensions of teachers and staff, causing overcrowded classrooms and insufficient support.
Page said the amount of records in the case “is unquestionably voluminous,” with reference materials “from before Ohio’s statehood up to the General Assembly’s modification of EdChoice in (Ohio House Bill) 33,” the previous state budget bill.
The 47-page court decision included its own history of school funding legislation and legal battles, which included education debates at “the forefront of Ohio’s leaders’ decision-making during the (state) Constitutional Convention of 1850.”
Ultimately, out of that convention came the current language of the constitution, requiring the General Assembly to “secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state; but no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any part of the school funds of this state.”
Several state constitutional conventions attempted to change this wording, even proposing leaving out the “religious or other sect” language.
Delegates at an 1873 convention said removing the language on religious sects would “leave the Constitution so crippled that the various religious denominations may divide the common school fund among them, for the support of sectarian schools.”
“The moment we consent to do so, we deal the death blow to the system of common schools, upon which expanded and improved by increasing experience and wisdom, more than upon anything else … depends the perpetuity and efficiency of our American institutions and government,” another delegate said in 1873.
‘School choice’
Private school voucher supporters, including Ohio’s legislative leaders and Gov. Mike DeWine, have argued Ohioans should be free to choose the school they want to send their students to, instead of being tied down to “underperforming” public schools in the area in which they live. The mantra of “school choice” is one that has sounded from Republican state leaders and federal GOP leaders alike.
In Tuesday’s ruling, Page said the non-public schools who receive private school vouchers are largely religious, and are able to deny enrollment to students based on their own standards.
These schools aren’t subject to anti-discrimination laws, Page wrote, therefore they can turn students away based on religion, sexual orientation or disability.
“By bestowing participating private religious schools with complete control over prospective students’ participation, the ‘school choice’ here is made by the private school, not ‘as the result of independent decisions of parents and students,’” Page wrote, citing previous case law.
The Catholic Conference of Ohio released a statement expressing their disappointment in the ruling, but also emphasizing their confidence that the private voucher program “will prevail” on appeal.
“The Catholic Church will continue to advocate for and defend programs that support parents as the primary educators of their children and enable them to select a school that best suits their child’s needs,” the statement from conference Executive Director Brian Hickey said.
The heads of Ohio’s education unions said the ruling was just a confirmation of what public schools have known already, “that Ohio’s unsustainable and costly private school vouchers are draining public funds and preventing legislators from fully funding the quality public school education that every child … is entitled to under the Ohio Constitution,” as Ohio Federation of Teachers leader Melissa Cropper put it.
Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro said though he expects this ruling to be the first step in a longer process through appeals, the ruling “represents a huge victory for Ohio’s public school educators, school communities and students.”
“The work does not stop here,” DiMauro said in a statement. “But I am confident this initial ruling will ultimately stand up through the appeals process, and Ohio can once again dedicate its resources fully to funding our public schools and ensuring all Ohio students can get the world-class education they deserve – no exceptions.”
A request for comment from House Speaker Matt Huffman was unreturned as of Wednesday afternoon.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-26 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Zohran Mamdani’s upset in NYC mayoral primary resonates in CT,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/26/zohran-mamdanis-nyc-mayor-cuomo-lamont/,CT Democrats called Mamdani’s win significant but warned against proclaiming him the answer to what went wrong in the 2024 presidential race.,"Inevitably, Gov. Ned Lamont was asked Wednesday about the stunning victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary by a 33-year-old socialist, Zohran Mamdani, over the 67-year-old former governor, Andrew Cuomo, whom Lamont had recently, if awkwardly, identified as his favorite. 
“Mamdani ran a hell of a race, didn’t he?” Lamont said, as a Democratic Party in the throes of an identity crisis rushed to find larger meaning in the upset. “He surprised the hell out of the establishment world down there. And I salute him for the job he was able to get done.”
Elected Democrats in Connecticut, Lamont included, called Mamdani’s victory significant for his youth and message, while most also cautioned against instantly proclaiming him as the answer to what went wrong in the 2024 presidential race.
The premise of generational change embodied by a candidate promising things largely anathema to Lamont — higher taxes on the rich, free buses, universal child care, a freeze on rents of rent-controlled apartments — comes during a particularly difficult week for a 71-year-old Connecticut governor whose brand is fiscal discipline and stability.
Lamont vetoed two bills placed on his desk by the Democratic majorities of the General Assembly, acts that reinforced his political identity as a centrist — an image that makes him a formidable opponent for a Republican challenger should Lamont seek a third term in 2026 — but antagonized the left of his own party.
At a press conference Monday explaining the vetoes of an affordable housing bill and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, Lamont also made an unforced error: identifying Cuomo, who resigned after a sexual harassment scandal, as his preferred candidate for mayor.
On Wednesday, Lamont praised Mamdani while noting that Democrats have hardly renounced centrists. He pointed to Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats recently nominated moderate suburban women for governor. 
But the governor readily conceded Mamdani’s win demonstrated an appetite for change — and he claimed some common ground.
“There’s a lot of frustration out there,” Lamont said. “And some of what Mamdani was saying, we’ve already done. He’s making a big down payment on universal pre-K. You know, we’re doing that as well.”
Lamont says the highlight of the recently concluded legislative session was the creation of an off-budget early childhood trust fund that will raise salaries for child care workers, increase access and provide free care for families earning no more than $100,000 and discounted care for others. 
“So I share a lot of his aspirations, where he wants to go,” Lamont said of Mamdani. “We probably get there in different ways.”
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, a candidate for governor if Lamont does not run again, said Mamdani won by talking about affordability.
“Clearly, those issues spoke to people,” Bysiewicz said.
Mamdani, who was endorsed by the union-financed Working Families Party, ran on a promise to increase affordable housing, open city-owned grocery stores and raise the city’s $16.50 hourly minimum wage to $30. 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he found Mamdani’s victory easy to analyze.
“It is so easy to see right now that people are hungry for fighters. They’re hungry for people to be authentic,” Duff said. “They’re hungry for people to stand up and give people a voice. And they may not always have to agree with you, but they will respect the fact that you stood up and you fought for them and their values.”
Lamont’s two recent vetoes put him at odds with labor, affordable housing advocates and fellow Democrats, including Duff.
His veto of the strikers bill was expected and came with a consistent and clearly stated rationale. But his veto of an affordable housing bill that had been drafted largely to his specifications infuriated lawmakers. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, was bracing for hard questions about the housing veto Wednesday night at a House Democratic caucus. Ritter and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, had called the vote on the housing bill after assuring the rank-and-file Lamont was on board.
“So we’re going to get some flack from this, from people who are going to say, ‘Well, you guys said, ‘It was all set.’ And we’re going to say, ‘We thought it was all set.’ And so it’s not good for anybody,” Ritter said. “It’s not good for him, it’s not good for us.”
A leader in Connecticut For All, one of the liberal advocacy groups that have clashed with Lamont over state spending, was quick to assert that Mamdani’s win was a rebuke to Lamont and his style of governing.
“Tonight’s NYC Mayor results sent a strong message to corporate democrats like Governor Lamont — it’s time for bold leadership that centers the needs of the working class,” Constanza Segovia, an organizer, said in an emailed statement Tuesday night. “Lamont’s endorsement for an accused sexual harasser and disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo is indicative of all of his choices lately — wrong and out of touch.”
Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a liberal weighing a run for governor, was reluctant to find evidence of vulnerability by Lamont in Cuomo’s defeat — in part because of one of same factors cited by Segovia, the sexual harassment scandal that dogs the former New York governor.
“You need to be really aware of luck — and that’s not to in any way detract from that race — but I think that Mamdani got lucky to be against a truly unsympathetic competitor, where Ned is a nice guy and is really likable,” Elliott said.
Ritter had a similar take: Cuomo’s problem was less being a moderate than not getting past the scandal that led to his resignation.
“I think it’s time for him to go and retire,” Ritter said of Cuomo. “But my reasons for that are not because he’s moderate. My reasons are because of his actions.”
Comptroller Sean Scanlon,  a potential gubernatorial candidate if Lamont does not run, said he was unsure if the granular details of Mamdani’s platform were a formula path for Democrats elsewhere.
“But I certainly think he ran an incredible campaign,” Scanlon said. “And I think there is a yearning right now amongst not just Democratic voters but all voters, for young, energetic candidates that are laying out a vision for where they want to take their city or their state or the country, and focusing on affordability, which is the No. 1 issue to everybody in this country, and something that we as Democrats don’t talk about enough.”
Scanlon is a fan of “Abundance,” the new book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. As Klein recently observed on the New York Times op-ed page, “The book is largely a critique of how Democrats have governed in the places where they’ve held power.”
“His main take, and I agree with it, is that Democrats have become the party of defending institutions that most people think are broken, and explaining why things are complicated and hard, as opposed to being willing to just break things that are wrong,” Scanlon said. “And I think we have become victims of that reality and letting perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Scanlon also offered a pithier assessment.
 “I have been saying this to a lot of people today: Young plus change, plus focus on affordability — minus socialism — is the recipe for Connecticut Democrats.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SRR_0456-TRANSIT-0625-DE-140-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-26 05:01:56.870275

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — A Maryland man facing criminal charges in Tennessee, after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, will remain in jail until at least Friday as a federal judge weighs whether prosecutors have the power to keep him from being “precipitously deported.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, appeared Wednesday in a downtown Nashville courtroom for a hearing to set the conditions of his release while a criminal case against him moves forward. 
Abrego was indicted by a Tennessee grand jury June 6 on two criminal human smuggling charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The indictment occurred while Abrego was housed in a Salvadoran prison, where U.S. immigration officials dispatched him after a routine traffic stop.
 A Department of Justice attorney later conceded Abrego’s deportation had been a mistake. His case has come to symbolize the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. 
Wearing an orange jumpsuit and seated next to his attorneys, Abrego occasionally glanced in the direction of the gallery where his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, sat in the first row. It was the couple’s wedding anniversary, she told reporters earlier in the day.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia to appear in court for possible release, a move federal prosecutors oppose

But as Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes went over the terms of Abregos’s pretrial release, defense attorneys raised the specter that he could instead face deportation. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials are expected to take Abrego into custody immediately once he is released by the federal court. 
Sean Hecker, an attorney for Abrego, sought a decision by the judge that Abrego’s release would be conditional on prosecutors working to ensure that he would not be deported while the case remains ongoing.
Hecker also sought assurances that Abrego would not be housed in Texas, Louisiana or other parts of the country that could impede access to his attorneys.
In support of his request, Hecker noted prosecutors and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had a history of coordination and cooperation in Abrego’s case.  
DHS and federal prosecutors coordinated to bring charges against Abrego, including facilitating his return from El Salvador to face an indictment in Tennessee; they also established agreements with potential witnesses against Abrego to halt their own deportation cases, Hecker said. 
But acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire indicated he could make no promises about either Abrego’s placement in an ICE facility accessible to his attorneys or to prevent his deportation. He told the court that he would “do his best.”

“I will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, but obviously I can’t tell them what to do,” he said. McGuire noted that ICE — a department within the federal homeland security agency — is not a party to the case.
McGuire had unsuccessfully sought to keep Abrego in the custody of the U.S. Marshals, who typically oversee detainees awaiting trial on federal crimes. 
In an order issued over the weekend, Holmes denied the prosecutors’ petition, ruling that Abrego had a right to release while awaiting trial.
“These are the sort of practical implications of that (the judge’s decision),” McGuire said Wednesday. 
Holmes has given attorneys until noon Friday to submit legal arguments that address the question of “what can the government do to ensure Mr. Abrego will not be precipitously deported.”
Prosecutors, meanwhile, are pursuing an appeal of Holmes’ weekend decision to release Abrego.  
U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, Jr., separately on Wednesday, set a July 16 hearing day to review prosecutors’ request to revoke Abrego’s release from the custody of U.S. Marshals. 
The criminal charges Abrego faces stem from a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop alleged the trip was part of a years-long human smuggling scheme in which Abrego was a paid driver who transported migrants who illegally crossed the southern border to destinations across the country.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
As Tennessee lawmakers debated a new universal voucher program earlier this year, one financial analysis projected that 65% of vouchers would go to students already enrolled in private schools.
Now, it will be impossible to determine whether that projection was accurate.
Tennessee families do not have to report their previous school enrollment in the new statewide voucher program application, a gap that will leave Tennesseans in the dark about whether the program will significantly expand private school access for public school students or send millions in public funds to students already enrolled in private schools.
State education officials won’t explain why they aren’t asking about prior enrollment, data which is regularly collected by other states administering similar voucher programs.
The Tennessee Department of Education has not responded to Chalkbeat Tennessee inquiries about the decision and whether the state intends to collect additional information in the future.
In a statement, Gov. Bill Lee’s office said the legislation enacting the program did not require the state to collect the information.
The lack of data collection on these issues is a notable departure from the state’s initial voucher program, the Education Savings Accounts initiative. The program, available in three counties since 2022, continues to require parents to report the specific school their child was previously enrolled in to apply.
The new voucher program application also does not require families to report household income if they are applying for one of the 10,000 available slots without an income cap.
Tennessee launched applications in mid-May for the program, which will provide 20,000 students with about $7,295 to spend at private schools. In the first year, half of the vouchers are set aside for families who earn below a certain income cap, with the other “universal” half open to all applicants.
Rep. Caleb Hemmer, a Democrat from Nashville who has been critical of the Lee-backed voucher program, has requested further information from state education officials about why they’re collecting less data about students in a significantly expanded program.
“Even if you’re pro-voucher, you would think you’d want some of this information so you could see where these parents are moving their kids from,” Hemmer said.
The new application stands in stark contrast to similar voucher programs around the country.
States like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and Alabama regularly collect and publish data surrounding previous school enrollment, and lawmakers have used similar data as a marker to gauge which communities the programs are reaching. In March, Alabama officials released data showing more than 66% of applicants to the program were already private school or homeschooled students. The first year Florida’s voucher program expanded, the state released data showing about 69% of students were already enrolled in private schools.
Hemmer sharply criticized the Tennessee Department of Education this week, questioning whether it was a calculated decision to “shield some of this information so they don’t have to worry about negative headlines.”
“It’s a new program, and these data collections are very crucial to understanding how and if these programs work,” Hemmer said. “This is a signature initiative of the governor. I would think the governor’s office and the Department of Education commissioner in charge of managing this would want to know everything possible in how this is operating.”
K-12 Education Subcommittee Chairman Kirk Haston, a Republican from Lobelville, said he was less concerned with the lack of prior enrollment information and suggested the new voucher application shouldn’t be compared to the previous program.
“One of the key pieces of data to me is if the funds are getting back to Tennessee taxpaying parents,” Haston said.
State officials have remained tight-lipped about many details of the EFS application process through the summer. The governor’s office has appeared closely involved in communications about the program, which has been Lee’s signature issue for many years.
In May, following media inquiries, Lee’s office and TDOE released a joint statement noting that more than 33,000 people had applied for the program.
How many applicants the state has accepted or denied is not yet clear.
The TDOE has not responded to Chalkbeat Tennessee requests this summer for how many applicants have been accepted or provided specific information on whether the department has filled 11 positions the legislature funded to help administer the voucher program.

When the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this month released its piece of a federal budget bill, Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., said it took a “commonsense approach” to the federal Supplemental Assistance to Needy Families, or SNAP program. 
However, the approach could also be seen as an unfunded mandate to states and local governments — and an attempt to hassle some of the most vulnerable off of a program meant to keep them from going hungry, critics say. 
The changes to the program colloquially known as food stamps are part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which faces a July 4 deadline. 
It would give $4.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. In an analysis, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, estimated that 70% of the benefit would go to the “top 10% of the income distribution.” 
Many unaware of threats to Ohio Medicaid, advocates say

To try to pay for it, congressional Republicans want to slash federal programs for the poor. They include cuts to Medicaid that could cost 770,000 Ohioans their health coverage. 
They also include an estimated $300 billion in cuts to SNAP — by far the largest in history. That would cost millions of children, elderly, disabled and working Americans nutrition assistance, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported. About one in nine Ohioans would be among them.
Anti-hunger advocates are scrambling to keep up with whether the provisions in the Senate Agriculture committee bill will meet parliamentary muster. But they seek to shift the burden onto states in multiple ways.
One is to increase states’ share of the cost to administer the program from 50% to 75%. Another is to make states start paying a share of the program cost based on their error rates.
The two measures would work together to dramatically increase state costs and fundamentally alter the program, said Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks. 
“There are underlying, systemic threats to the benefits of every eligible person because of the way the reconciliation package is designed,” Novotny said Wednesday. “I fundamentally believe that every child — if they’re seven or 10 or 14 — if they’re in a household in need of benefits, we need to make sure they’re nourished and that we live up to the commitment that we collectively made as a country.”
The program provides debit cards for food. To qualify, Ohio recipients generally have to have net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four. Benefits averaged $6.28 per person, per day last year.
The reconciliation bill would force states to pay for part of the program on a sliding scale based on error rates. They’d have to pay starting at 5% and up depending on how often they were found to pay recipients too little or too much in benefits. 
It also would greatly increase error rates by eliminating the current tolerance for small errors — those up to $57.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services and the large counties that administer the program gather information on gross income, family characteristics and living expenses to determine eligibility, and at what level. 
“It’s really complicated, but that determines what eligibility is for that household,” Novotny said. “If at any point in that process, there is any error made at all — if the benefit amount is calculated a dollar too low or a dollar too high — that will count toward the error rate. 
“Right now there’s a certain level of forgiveness because of the complexity of the calculation, but that would end. The error rate will go up. It will be impossible for a state to stay below a threshold of 5% because we’re talking about millions and millions of touches.”
If Ohio had an error rate of 6% or less — which it doesn’t, even under the current, more-tolerant system — the state would have to pay $158 million more a year into the program, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. At the top end, with an error rate of 25% or more, Ohio would have to pay $790 million more a year.
Under Ohio’s most recent, more-forgivingly calculated error rate, 15%, the state would have to come up with $473 million a year.
“An error rate is not fraud,” Novotny said. “It’s not the fault of the person applying for benefits. It’s a worker or a computer system making an error.”
In addition, by forcing states to pick up a huge additional chunk of the cost to administer the system, error rates stand to go up even further.
Ohio’s benefits system is now so under-resourced that SNAP beneficiaries face a two-to-three-hour wait time when they call to start or annually re-enroll for benefits, for their six-month check-ins, and when they need to report material changes in income, Novotny said. Adding 50% to states’ administrative burden would only increase wait times and the chances for harried workers to make mistakes, she said.
“Our system is already under a lot of duress in terms of access,” Novotny said.
She added, “People have trouble getting through the system already. That’s already part of the program. That’s not new. What the reconciliation text would do is exacerbate that in many ways. It would take away federal funding to support that process. So the state and the counties would have to invest more in just maintaining that level of service, which is already underfunded. And it would introduce additional complexity into every touch that is made with every household.”
On Tuesday, Novotny traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with aides to Ohio Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, both Republicans. She said neither official is on the Agriculture Committee and she wanted to explain how the SNAP changes would manifest in Ohio.
“We’re trying to talk to them about the impact it would have on Ohio,” she said. “It really is a serious, permanent, structural change to the program that we believe should be undertaken much more thoughtfully.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)A pair of former Democratic state lawmakers warned the General Assembly not to approve a controversial plan to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium and other sports facilities in the future. State lawmakers went ahead anyway.
The state budget, approved Wednesday afternoon, includes a provision to take ownership of unclaimed funds that have been in state custody for more than 10 years. It’s a dramatic change for the state.
To this point, Ohio has followed the broadly agreed upon best practice of holding funds in perpetuity until a claimant comes forward.

“These are funds held in trust. This is not state property,” attorney and former state Rep. Jeff Crossman argued. “These funds belong to all those hardworking Ohioans across the state with forgotten savings accounts, uncashed checks, overpaid utility bills — they’re not abandoned.”
Crossman and former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann, who is also a former state senator, have put together a class action lawsuit, and they’re promising to file it immediately if the stadium funding plan gets signed into law.
“We’re not anti-stadium,” Crossman insisted. “We’re anti-theft.”
Is that legal?
Although Ohio’s proposal is a sharp departure from current state policy, it’s not the first time a state has imposed a deadline on unclaimed funds.
A small handful of states have a statutory cutoff after which funds become state property — a process known as “escheatment.” But those states wait more than twice as long as Ohio is proposing or limit the process to small dollar amounts.
Muddying the waters further, Ohio lawmakers have dipped into the unclaimed funds account several times in recent years.
The plan’s architect, state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, points to those transfers as vindication. Importantly, those previous transfers amount to borrowing money; unlike Cirino’s plan, no one lost the right to reclaim their property.
Can they do that? Ohio Senators propose novel, if questionable, Browns stadium funding plan

Crossman and Dann acknowledge it is legal for the government to take ownership of private property, but only in extraordinary circumstances. They insist the state hasn’t met that bar.
“This is an unconstitutional taking of property,” Dann argued.
He brought up a 2006 eminent domain case in Ohio called Norwood v. Horney. The city of Norwood wanted to seize dozens of homes and businesses to make way for private development. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected that effort.
“The government cannot take private property based on speculative claims of economic benefit alone,” Dann explained. “There must be a legitimate, direct public purpose. This plan fails on both fronts.”
Crossman added that while the Norwood case dealt with real estate, the court made no distinction between real property and any other.
“And let me be blunt,” he insisted, “if this plan collapses in court and delays stadium funding, it’s not going to be our fault. It’s going to be the legislature’s fault, who forced this through knowing full well that it was unconstitutional.”
What’s next?
Following his chamber’s vote, Senate President Rob McColley said “I’m confident we’re on good constitutional grounds.” He added he’s skeptical Dann and Crossman will be able to prove their clients have suffered actual damages from the changes.
“Because everybody who has money in the fund still has 10 years to come get the money,” he argued, alluding to a ten-year grace period for those whose funds are part of the first wave swept into stadium fund.
“And so there is no harm, there are no damages for those individuals,” McColley added. “So I think it’s going to be a tough case for them to prove all the way up.”
In addition to establishing a new funding stream for the Browns stadium, lawmakers added in a provision that will likely make it easier for the team to pick up stakes in Cleveland, and settle in nearby Brook Park instead. After Art Modell moved the first iteration of the Browns to Baltimore, rechristening the team as the Ravens, lawmakers placed restrictions on owners moving teams after receiving public support.
The budget tweaked that provision. It now only applies when moving a team out of state.
McColley defended the change, arguing it still requires teams fulfill the terms of their lease and that tethering the team to its current location was never the intention. “That would have been an insane intention to have when the law was passed,” he added.
“What this is doing is protecting the taxpayers,” McColley argued. “Basically saying you have to fill out your lease, you have to satisfy your obligation, and if you receive state funding, you have to remain in the state of Ohio.”
Despite criticism of the plan, lawmakers are certainly treating it as a going concern. The Senate’s budget calls for transferring $1.7 billion out of the unclaimed funds trust, but that first draft only appropriated the $600 million the Browns want for their stadium.
But after negotiations with the House, lawmakers want to appropriate a full $1 billion for sports and cultural developments. That puts $400 million at the ready for other facilities around Ohio.

“They’re saying we don’t care that you own this money,” Dann argued, “We don’t care that we’ve appointed ourselves, the state, as the fiduciary for that money. We’re going to just dump that responsibility right now and give it out to somebody who has helped us in our campaigns. That is not a constitutional process.”
Gov. Mike DeWine could always veto the provision, but to this point he has declined to take a position on using unclaimed funds. However, DeWine’s spokesman Dan Tierney criticized the preemptive lawsuit threat.
“Wow,” he said in an email. “We haven’t even received the budget bill yet, let alone the Governor having signed it. But given that the former Attorney General gave us the Sunshine Express, his need for speed shouldn’t be surprising.”
During his time as attorney general, Dann added flames to the side of a government SUV and decals dubbing it the Sunshine Express to highlight his office’s work on public records. But that SUV wound up at the shop in the first place because a staffer in Dann’s office turned it in with extensive body damage and no explanation.
But for their part, Dann and Crossman expressed some optimism that DeWine might step in.
“Republicans do not have the corner on bad ideas in this building,” Dann said, arguing Democrats have been on the wrong side of plenty of unconstitutional proposals. “Our hope is that the serious legislators and the governor who stood on these steps and swore an oath to the Constitution will decide to follow the Constitution.”
Crossman added that as a former attorney general himself, DeWine “should recognize the constitutional problems.”
“You can’t balance a budget on broken promises, and you can’t build a stadium on stolen property,” Crossman argued. “And if the legislature won’t defend Ohioans’ rights, we will.”

(Traci Brimhall)Kansas poet laureate Traci Brimhall is offering poetic sustenance to Kansas and beyond.
Brimhall, two years into her term, is busy, and her appointment has seen an outpouring of support and excitement. It is a testament to her commitment to Kansas and poetry. Brimhall’s latest poetry book, “Love Prodigal,” was shortlisted for the Julie Suk Award, which recognizes the best poetry book published in 2025 by a literary press. The Guggenheim New York, in collaboration with the Academy of American Poets, has announced Brimhall as their poet in residence for 2025. 
I’m in awe of Brimhall. She has maintained such a high level of poetic output and programming across Kansas while still serving as the director of the creative writing program at Kansas State University and teaching as a distinguished professor of English at the university.
I asked Brimhall how the laureateship has impacted her teaching and how the University has supported her new role.
  Traci Brimhall
“One really great direct benefit to my teaching is that I’ve been able to make several internships for students to help with laureate projects,” she said. “I’m glad I can fund students to do work in arts advocacy. And I am really grateful that Kansas State has been so enthusiastic about my work as laureate. Different departments have invited me to give talks; I’ve done a university podcast on food and poetry; and I gave the commencement speech for the College of Arts & Sciences last spring. I feel arts and humanities often feel overlooked in many academic spaces, and it is wonderful that a land grant institution that has a lot of agricultural focus can also see the value of the arts.”
Poetry is growing in Kansas with each event Brimhall facilitates, and there have been many. In Poetry Harvest: Poems for the 2024 Kansas State Fair, she curated new works from Kansas poets to showcase at the event, which is held annually in Hutchinson. Thematically, the poems were predominantly agrarian and included quilting, dairy, woodworking, farming, horses, flower displays, and much more. A deep pride and sense of place are apparent. 
Brimhall has stated in her op-ed about the state fair poems that she is working to “unite the state’s agricultural roots and the literary arts.”
“Since so much of my Laureate work has been about connecting food and poetry, the Kansas State Fair seemed like a natural fit!” Brimhall shared. “There are already so many exhibits about food and the arts, and I wanted to see poetry included among the other domestic arts like quilting and flower arranging. I was lucky in that both the State Fair and the Kansas Chamber of Commerce were also excited because I couldn’t have done it alone. I paired 20 Kansas poets with 20 exhibits around the fair, and we put those poems on posters that got displayed across the fair for two weeks. And we even got to organize a poetry reading on one of the stages!”
She continues bringing poets to the table. During one library talk, the community had a potluck lunch. That’s further evidence of the cultivation of care that arises from within the places Brimhall visits.
“Southwest Kansas! A library did a potluck lunch to feed everyone, and someone told me that they were afraid of poetry before my talk,” she said. “They also said that my recipe cards for poetry lines helped them write their very first poem. That felt really special, and I hope they write many, many more poems.” 
Community through communion is how Brimhall is bringing the culinary and literary arts together. There is nourishment and fulfillment to be found in her work. Her most recent creative endeavor is a poetry cookbook.
“I wanted to connect more culinary arts with the literary arts, so I asked 20 chefs across Kansas to contribute recipes,” Brimhall said. “There are food trucks and farms and restaurateurs and Netflix chefs all participating and offering recipes. I asked them to make the recipes accessible for all Kansan — so economically accessible and easily sourced. Ten percent of the cookbook copies will be donated to food banks across the state. I then paired 20 poets with those 20 recipes and had them write response poems.”
Meadowlark Press, a Kansas press in Emporia, is publishing “Eat Your Words: A Kansas Poetry Cookbook.” That’s intentional.
“For me, it was important that all the funds go to supporting Kansas literary endeavors,” Brimhall said. “I want to see our State’s arts economy thrive.”
Brimhall is in full stride as she continues to travel across the state with poetry in hand. And I am beyond excited to read her latest collection of poetry, “Love Prodigal” (Copper Canyon Press, 2024). 
In a stunning interview on KPR Presents, Brimhall spoke about her latest book and shared that she wants “love to be the energy that fuels her art.” It’s apparent to me that at the center of her work is love. We are fortunate to have Traci Brimhall as our state’s poet laureate. She is pouring so much care into Kansas in the form of a poem. I look forward to what the next two years will bring.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)For those who care about the future of life on earth and the destiny of our children, there is nothing more frightening than watching the fossil fuel greed-induced blindness of Trump and the MAGA cult ruthlessly wiping out every single gain toward preventing a climate collapse and opening the door to a deadly acceleration of carbon emissions. 
It is no time to mince words, we are witnessing nothing less than the last chance to prevent the overwhelming suffering of literally hundreds of millions of our own children and future generations as the life support systems of the planet are irreparably crushed.
Here in Ohio we have our own version of this horrendous scenario playing out. 
Seemingly blinded by greed to the point where they do not even see the consequences for their very own children, fossil fuel interests in our state — aided and abetted by similarly blinded Republicans in the Ohio Statehouse — have now embarked on an effort to do no less than completely shut down utility scale solar projects. 
They are doing so through two primary vehicles. One is to use their exorbitant wealth to spread distortions and misinformation to the public in areas where solar projects are proposed. 
The second is to infiltrate their influence directly into the agency that makes solar project siting decisions — the Ohio Power Siting board (OPSB) — and skew the process so radically that pro-solar advocates are left with hardly any chance to ever win.
In this running battle over the green future of Ohio, one area that stands out in importance is the Frasier solar project in Knox County. 
It does so because nowhere else in the state have the lines of the conflict been drawn more clearly. It started with the fossil fuel industry blatantly jumping into the fray without even any real attempt to conceal its identity. 
As is usually the case, it formed a local “front group” — called “Knox Smart Development” — but it was obvious where the money and propaganda were coming from.
While trying to ban anyone from outside the county to even testify, they invited a speaker all the way from Chicago to attend a so-called “town hall” meeting where the climate crisis was characterized as a complete hoax. 
He came from the Heartland Institute — the very same source hired by the tobacco industry to spread lies about smoking not being a danger to health.  
In this same “town hall” — the concept known for democratically allowing all points of view — a speaker who came to present a pro-solar view was actually denied entry.   
Next was the extreme step of actually purchasing the local newspaper so it could be used as a tool to spread misinformation. 
This was exposed by a national group called ProPublica — which has actually won the coveted Pulitzer Prize for the excellence of its investigative work. 
All this manipulation was not allowed to hide in the dark. Not only were commentaries published here in the Capital Journal, but a documentary to expose the corruption was produced by this writer and distributed throughout the county.

But the Frasier battle is also notable because it will put to the test two strategies that are now becoming prominent in the effort to shut down utility scale solar. 
The first is the manipulative claim that agricultural land is being “taken out of production.” 
The solar developer for Frasier — Open Road Renewables — has designed the project so that sheep grazing will be integrated into almost the entire acreage. Continued agricultural use has now been specifically designed into the project. 
Yet the opposition continues to hold the signs and yell the same words despite the point now being rendered meaningless. Will they be allowed to get away with this?
Frasier will also crystallize whether the attempt by fossil fuel interests to skew the entire decision process will be successful. 
They are doing so by getting the Ohio Power Siting Board to essentially grant “veto power” over projects to a small handful of local officials — despite the fact there’s actually a state statute that prohibits the granting of such local jurisdiction.  
Even more unbelievably, these local officials are not even being asked to present *any rationale* whatsoever for *WHY*  they oppose a project.
All they do is say no, and the extra power they have been given results in the project being rejected. 
It is the antithesis of a democratic process. 
Fossil fuel pressure can be applied to just a few select individuals and once they are “locked” into the opposition, not even a majority of the public has any ability to affect the outcome. 
The power siting board has objected to calling this a “rigging” of the process. But in all honesty what else can it be called? The legality of this bald-faced power grab is now being deliberated at the Ohio Supreme Court.   
Ohio is not just one state among many. 
It is the fifth most prolific producer of carbon emissions, placing an immense weight of responsibility on our shoulders related to our children and future generations. 
Jake Zuckerman reported for Cleveland.com in March: “Ohioans and their elected representatives have killed enough solar development to roughly power the state’s three largest cities in the three years since state lawmakers passed one of the nation’s most stringent restrictions on new solar development.”
The stakes are high, and our planet is currently losing. 
The Ohio Power Siting Board cannot claim ignorance of the issues. It has acknowledged that these concerns about skewing the process have been raised. In the name of our collective future, it must change course.

The budget now heads to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s desk for his signature, which he must sign by June 30. He can line-item veto provisions in the budget. 
Anti-LGBTQ provisions 
A handful of anti-LGBTQ+ provisions are sprinkled throughout the budget, including a provision that would only recognize two sexes — male and female.

“Do we really have to make a law that says that men are men and women are women?” state Rep. Gary Click, R-Vickery, asked. “Do we really have to define that? We shouldn’t have to, but apparently we do.”
The budget would require public libraries to put books related to sexual orientation or gender identity in an area of the library that is out of sight for minors. 
“If moms and dads want their kids to be indoctrinated within that, that’s up to the moms and dads, but we’re not going to put it in children’s faces in the children’s sections of the libraries,” Click said. 
Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, called out the library provision. 
“If you are one of the 20% of young people who identify as LGBTQ, you’re not going to be a hero in that story,” he said. “We have to have more books that show you as a leader, as a champion, as a hero.”
The budget would also ban Pride flags from being flown at public buildings and prohibit giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
“We are not hanging out the welcome mat for people from the LGBTQ community,” said Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood. “We should be a place where folks can just be who they are authentically and live and let live.”
Higher education provisions 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship awards the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to attend an Ohio college or university. 
Under the final version of the budget, scholarship recipients must sign a statement of commitment to live in Ohio for three years immediately after graduation starting in fiscal year 2027. 
“If we want our young people to stay in Ohio, to start their careers in Ohio, to start a family in Ohio, we need to put our money where our mouth is, and we are doing that in this budget,” said Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville. 
The Senate’s version of the budget would have required scholarship recipients sign a promissory note, but the final version of the budget instead requires students to sign a statement of commitment to live in Ohio for the first three years after graduating college. 
“It was deemed (the promissory note) was a little bit heavy-handed and so we tried to roll that back,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon said. 
The budget allocates $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million in fiscal year 2027 for the Governor’s Merit Scholarship. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship. Eighty-seven percent of Ohio students accepted the scholarship in its second year and 11 rural counties had a 100% acceptance rate. 
The budget ties a portion of the State Share of Instruction to compliance with Senate Bill 1, a new higher education law banning diversity efforts, creates post-tenure reviews and an American civic literacy course, among other things. 
The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges and each university must submit a report showing compliance to the House and Senate higher education committees by March 1, according to the budget. 
Housing provisions 
The budget kept housing provisions the Senate added to the budget — $90 for the Residential Development Revolving Loan Program and $10 million for the Residential Economic Development District. 
The Residential Development Revolving Loan Program supports new, single-family residential homes in rural areas of the state. 
“If we want to grow our population, we have to have places for folks to live,” Stewart said. “This is going to be directed to small counties. We can’t be growing housing just in the three C’s, we need to be growing housing all across Ohio.”

After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
Uber, Lyft oppose some bills that aim to prevent assaults during rides

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
Thousands are suing states over sexual abuse in juvenile detention facilities

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sexual assault survivors can now track their rape kits in most states

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Taylor, in which a group of Montgomery County parents are suing for the right to take their children out of classes that have LGBTQ-themed books. (Photo by Nathan O’Neal/Cronkite News)The Supreme Court case Mahmoud v. Taylor has already been cast in stark moral terms: On one side, a public school district trying to foster inclusion and tolerance; on the other, a group of religious parents resisting progress.
But this case is not about banning books or rejecting diversity. It is about whether parents have a limited right to excuse their young children from specific public school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs. That’s a First Amendment question — not a culture war skirmish — and it deserves to be treated as such.
The families challenging Montgomery County schools are Muslim, Christian and Jewish. Their children attend elementary school, where a handful of picture books featuring same-sex couples and discussions of gender identity are used in literacy lessons. The parents are not asking that these books be removed. They are asking for notice and the opportunity to opt out of particular lessons, so they can address those topics at home, in accordance with their faith.
The district initially allowed such accommodations. Then it reversed course. No more opt-outs, not even for kindergartners.
The district says its curriculum reflects its commitment to inclusivity, and that letting  families withdraw from certain lessons could undermine that goal. But the parents are not asking the state to affirm their beliefs — only to give them space to raise their children without contradiction from mandatory school messaging.

We’ve seen versions of this question before. In West Virginia v. Barnette (1943), the Supreme Court ruled that public schools could not force students to salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance. In Abington v. Schempp (1963), the court barred mandatory Bible readings in public classrooms. Though the content in those cases differed, the principle was the same: Public schools may not compel students to participate in messages that contradict their convictions.
The message in Mahmoud is not patriotic or religious, but it still carries moral weight. The lessons are designed to promote inclusion and affirm diverse identities and family structures. The question is whether families may decline to participate when those lessons conflict with their religious beliefs.
The district allows opt-outs in other contexts — for example, when students object to religious songs in choir or to depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in literature. But it has drawn a hard line at objections from religious families responding to LGBTQ-themed books. As Justice Gorsuch noted, when the government allows some exceptions and not others, it raises concerns about religious discrimination.
In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia (2021), the court held that when a policy allows officials to grant exemptions, it cannot deny a religious exemption unless it can meet the highest standard of constitutional scrutiny. That reaffirmed a core principle of the free exercise clause: When government creates space for individualized judgment, it must treat religious claims with the same respect it gives to others.
Understandably, some worry about a slippery slope. If parents can opt out of LGBTQ-inclusive material, what about civil rights history, feminism, or even basic science? That concern is real, but not new. Courts have long been able to distinguish between good-faith conscience-based requests and efforts to undermine public education.
The deeper problem is that we increasingly treat constitutional questions like Mahmoud as moral referenda. Once a case is framed as progress versus prejudice, there’s no room left for pluralism. Disagreement is interpreted as hostility. Rights become conditional on political alignment.
Yet the genius of the First Amendment is that it protects conscience across lines of ideology. If secular parents have the right to object to religious instruction in schools then religious parents should have the right to seek limited accommodation from secular messaging that conflicts with their faith.
You do not need to agree with the parents’ theology to understand why their rights matter. If public education is to serve a pluralistic society, it must allow space for real moral diversity. That includes LGBTQ students and families, and it also includes those whose beliefs about family and identity are shaped by longstanding religious traditions.
The court’s decision in Mahmoud could help reestablish that balance. But for the conversation to move forward, we must first abandon the assumption that all dissent is an attack. Sometimes it is simply an act of conscience. And in a constitutional democracy, we are supposed to protect that — even, and especially, when we disagree with it.  Stories default to familiar caricatures, offering little to promote a nuanced understanding of the complexity of the case. Mahmoud provides an opportunity to tell a new and better story — of a society in which deeply held differences can coexist.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/scotusfacade-1024.jpg,,,2025-06-26 03:00:36.086112

(Screenshot from Court TV)House lawmakers grappled Wednesday to find a path forward on a report that dozens of police-custody deaths previously ruled accidental or of unknown causes by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner have been reclassified as homicides.
The report, the result of a four-year review of 1,300 cases between 2003 and 2019, was presented to the House Judiciary Committee by Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and Towson University psychology professor Jeff Kukucka, who led the audit.
It revealed the potential of racial and pro-police biases in the office led by former Medical Examiner David Fowler that led to the incorrect characterization of some deaths as accidental. The report, originally released last month, included several recommendations, most of which are administrative, Brown said.
“None of the recommendations require legislation,” Brown said. But, “they all could be done by legislation. If you’re going that path, we respectfully ask that we’d be involved to help shape that.”
Judiciary Committee Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) said the committee would likely meet again to discuss the issues, if not before the start of the 2026 General Assembly session, then shortly thereafter.
The hearing was the latest in the sudden unraveling of the legacy of the office under Fowler, who led it form 2003 to 2019, when he resigned.
Questions arouse after Fowler was called as an expert witness in the trial of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, a white police officer who was ultimately convicted of murder in the May 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in police custody. As part of Floyd’s arrest, Chauvin knelt for up to nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, who said repeatedly that he could not breathe.
Medical examiner audit reclassifies dozens of police-restraint deaths as homicides

Local autopsies determined that Floyd’s death — captured by witnesses on cellphone video that went viral — was a homicide.But Fowler testified that he would have ruled Floyd’s death caused by “excited delirium” rather than police actions.
Excited delirium was a catchall term used to describe aggressive behaviors related to mental health or substance abuse issues. It has been disavowed by the American Medical Association and the National Association of Medical Examiners, and Kukucka said Wednesday that it has since been abandoned by Maryland’s medical examiner’s office.
Fowler’s testimony triggered outrage, and a 2021 letter signed by 450 medical experts called on Maryland officials to reexamine deaths in police custody and medical examiner’s office practices under Fowler.
That audit involved independent review of Maryland cases by a dozen forensic pathologists around the globe, who determined that 48  police-custody deaths during Fowler’s tenure should be reclassified as homicides. The audit said 32 of the 48 cases reclassified as homicides involved victims who were Black, the other 16 were white.
The reviewers determined that the office was more likely to determine a death was homicide if the victim was white, at 44%, but only 16% if the person who died was Black.
“As AG Brown mentioned, it’s a pattern that is consistent with the possibility of racial bias,” Kukucka said. “That homicides are being under-counted in general, but they’re being under-counted even more dramatically if the decedent is Black.”
Kukucka also said the medical examiner’s office certified 14% of restraint deaths as homicides when police were involved, but that nearly quadrupled, to 54%, if the restraint was applied by a security guard, emergency medical personnel, or some other individual who was not a police officer.
Kukucka and Brown reiterated the findings do not imply criminal wrongdoing or liability. But an executive order issued by Gov. Wes Moore (D) directed the attorney general’s office to work with local state’s attorneys to review each case.

“We will determine whether reinvestigation is warranted in these matters,” Brown said. He later said if a case would need to be reopened, that’s “if, and only a big capital, bold if, there was evidence that suggested prosecution.”
Baltimore County State’s Attorney Scott Shellenberger (D) said in a brief interview Wednesday afternoon any cases referred to his office will be reviewed that “might change the status of a case.”
“It’s going to take a bit [of time] because we’ve got to put together the files again,” Shellenberger said. “We’ll have to really do some digging.”
Legislation not needed, but…
During the virtual committee hearing, Del. Robin Grammer Jr. (R-Baltimore County) asked the researchers defined homicide.
Kukucka used an example of a hunter who shoots at game, but misses the animal and accidentally shoots and kills another hunter. From a death investigation standpoint, he said “that death is a homicide.”
“So how does the office of the chief medical examiner differentiate between an accident and a homicide?” Grammer asked. “Where’s the actual different difference here? Because it could be accidental when a person dies, and now you’re subject to felony murder, or if it’s negligence, maybe manslaughter.”
Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County) asked Brown if any of the audit’s recommendations should be codified into legislation.
Some of the recommendations included requiring better quality autopsy photos from the medical examiner’s office (some were black-and-whites); sending mental health experts on some emergency responses; and reviewing audit cases the pathologists determined a cause of death to be a homicide.
Brown said the recommendations can be handled administratively such as through the medical examiner’s office or the state Department of Health.
Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the committee, asked about a recommendation to conduct a follow-up audit in another five years. Bartlett asked why not sooner, especially with the biases noted in the audit.
Kukucka said five years provides more time to collect data to conduct a comprehensive audit.
“After two or three years, there may simply not be enough cases to draw firm conclusions,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-14-132-1-1024x640.png,,,2025-06-26 01:59:10.512272

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)Montana, Oregon and Pennsylvania have joined the ranks of states where older people outnumber children, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates to be released Thursday morning.
The ratio of people older than 65 to children younger than 18 grew in every state, according to a Stateline analysis of the estimates, which measure age changes in mid-2024 compared with earlier years.
Other states where older people already outnumbered children in 2023: Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. That grew from just four in 2020: Florida, Maine, Vermont and West Virginia.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The trend bodes poorly for the future number of young adults who can help care for older relatives, according to a report published last year by the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
“America’s health and aging care system is unprepared to support its large and growing older adult population,” the report concluded. It said health care likely will become scarcer and more unequal if the nation’s older population grows to 73 million as projected by 2030, from the roughly 61.3 million in the latest 2024 estimates.
The new census estimates show Maine and Vermont have the highest ratios: about 1.3 older people for every child, followed by New Hampshire (1.2), Florida and West Virgina (each about 1.1).
New England’s labor force has been slow to recover since the pandemic, partly because of an aging population, according to a report published in January by the New England Public Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
‘Are nursing homes our only option?’ These centers offer older adults an alternative.

Florida has many of the counties with the highest ratios of older people to children, the census estimates show.
Among larger counties with 100,000 people or more, older adults outnumber children the most — by 8 to 1 — in Florida’s Sumter County, home to most of The Villages with its fast-growing retirement communities.
The ratio is 3 to 1 in Florida’s Charlotte and Sarasota counties, as well as North Carolina’s Brunswick County and Massachusetts’ Barnstable County, where Cape Cod is located.
The ratio is 2 to 1 in New Mexico’s Santa Fe County, Arizona’s Mohave and Yavapai counties, and in five Florida counties.
The nation’s median age reached a new historical high at 39.1, up from 38.9 in 2023, the census also found. The median age was below 30 until 1980 and below 20 until 1870.
Maine’s population in 2024 was the oldest of any state, with a median age of 44.8; Utah’s was the youngest at 32.4 as of 2024.

I was one of more than 1,100 volunteers from all 50 states who gathered at the 2025 Alzheimer’s Impact Movement (AIM) Advocacy Forum. Hosted by the Alzheimer’s Association’s advocacy arm, the forum is an annual three-day event that brings together people like me – people with personal stories, loved ones lost, and a deep drive to make change.

Erin Mahoney in Washington, D.C. 
This year, our Connecticut delegation included ten passionate advocates from across the state. On the final day of the forum, we went to Capitol Hill and met with our Connecticut members of Congress to share our experiences and ask for their support.
I advocate in memory of my mother, who died of younger-onset Alzheimer’s in 2018 at just 65 years old. She was vibrant, funny, and brilliant — the kind of person who lit up a room. But Alzheimer’s slowly stole her from us, piece by piece. I watched my mother, once fiercely independent, lose her words, her ability to care for herself and eventually, her life. The grief of that loss never fully fades. But I’ve learned to channel it into purpose.
Each year, I return to D.C. not just for her – but for the millions of Americans living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and the caregivers who carry so much of the burden, often in silence. In Connecticut alone, over 80,000 people are living with Alzheimer’s, and more than 100,000 unpaid caregivers provide support to loved ones. This is a public health crisis hiding in plain sight.
At the forum, we asked our members of Congress to support increased research funding through the National Institutes of Health, continued funding for the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, protections for Medicaid coverage, and access to affordable and timely diagnostic tools — including coverage for biomarker testing. We also advocated for better education and training for primary care providers, who are often the first point of contact for families facing a dementia diagnosis.
This is emotional work and not always easy. I’ve spent years sharing my story, following up with offices, and posting about advocacy on social media. I keep going because I know the silence around this disease is part of what allows it to persist.
If I’ve learned anything, it’s that the most powerful change doesn’t always start in headlines or press conferences. It starts in living rooms and support groups, in the quiet hands of caregivers, and in stories shared on Capitol Hill. Advocacy is often invisible labor – but that doesn’t make it less important.
I hope Connecticut’s lawmakers continue to lead the way in this fight. Alzheimer’s doesn’t care who you are, where you live, or what party you belong to. It steals futures and fractures families – and the time to act is now.
Until there’s a cure, we need compassion. We need resources. And we need to keep showing up.

It is incumbent upon us as food justice advocates and caring citizens to express our concern regarding billions of dollars in proposed cuts and administrative changes to nutrition assistance programs, most critically, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
We denounce actions taken to ﬁnd savings for the budget reconciliation bill from reforms to SNAP, such as stronger work requirements and cost-sharing with states. Cutting into nutrition assistance programs further compromises democratic principles already in peril.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other food security measures, including the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), emerged in the 1940s after World War II with a complex set of objectives. These programs initially served, in part, to manage overproduced commodities through charity-based food and nutrition security systems, but did so within a framework that has inadvertently contributed to the growth of ‘Big Ag’ and ‘Big Food.’ 
Despite their complex intent, these programs address critical issues like hunger and malnutrition, stimulate economic development, help prevent social unrest, and contribute to a more peaceful society. Serving mostly children and seniors, SNAP and NSLP stand as the country’s largest and second-largest food security safety-nets. 
As a nation bound by our shared responsibility for one another’s welfare, we must protect these programs from any endangerment and recognize their role in preserving peace, nourishing our most vulnerable populations, and strengthening our democracy.
Connecticut faces a deepening food insecurity crisis. The 2025 Map the Meal Gap report reveals that one in seven Connecticut residents, or 14.3% of the state’s population, are food insecure. This translates to over 516,000 people struggling with hunger, a concerning increase of more than 10% from the previous year. Jason Jakubowski, President and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare, underscores the severity of the situation, stating, “The new Map the Meal Gap report conﬁrms that food insecurity is getting worse in Connecticut and it’s getting harder to address.”
In 2024, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provided a crucial safety net for nearly 400,000 Connecticut residents, representing one in nine state residents. A total of $885 million in SNAP beneﬁts were disbursed that year. However, it is important to recognize that many recipients received limited assistance, with some seniors’ monthly beneﬁts amounting to as little as $60.
SNAP serves as a powerful economic driver. Every dollar invested in SNAP generates up to $1.80 in economic activity. Furthermore, SNAP oﬀers vital market support to farmers and small businesses while promoting the physical and mental well-being of seniors and individuals with disabilities.
However, SNAP does more than just help with food; it’s a gateway to other essential services. When families lose their SNAP beneﬁts, their children also lose automatic qualiﬁcation for free school meals. Meg Zimmerman, Program Manager at End Hunger CT!, emphasizes this crucial connection: “SNAP is not only the most eﬀective anti-hunger program in the country, but it’s also a key pathway to other anti-hunger programs, such as free school meals.” She explains that schools use data-matching to identify students who receive SNAP and automatically enroll them in free school meal programs. This automatic certiﬁcation is highly eﬃcient, saving administrative time and money. However, if families are cut oﬀ from SNAP, fewer children will be directly certiﬁed for school meals, meaning eligible kids could slip through the cracks and go without access to proper nutrition.
We ask that our U.S. Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal  embrace a new vision, alongside food and farm assistance programs, that are led by communities empowered by their own food, land and watershed sovereignty.
Connecticut is fortunate to have a diverse coalition, predominantly Black and Brown farmers, growers, food entrepreneurs and policy advocates who are leading a movement towards an equitable, just, resilient and regionalized food system rooted in interdependent relationships.
The charitable food system is stretched thin. Food banks and pantries cannot shoulder the responsibility of unprecedented levels of food insecurity, especially as diminishing federal food and farm assistance programs compound an already fraught system. We all must employ our imaginations and pave pathways towards a food culture where access to food, land and watersheds is upheld as a human right.
We invite you to join us as a food system changemaker and uplift the following programs – although by no means an exclusive list:


Federal Policy/Programs such as: Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement (LFPA) Local Food For School Cooperative Agreement Program (LFSA) and the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) and the Land Capital Market Access Program (LCMAP)
State Policy/Programs such as: School Meals For All CT, Local Food For Local Schools Incentive Program, CT Grown For CT Kids Grant and Food Recovery Initiatives
Community-Based Organizations such as: Liberated Land Cooperative, Sovereign Land Trust, Fairgate Community Farm, Green Village Initiative, Brass City Harvest, Northwest CT Food Hub, CT Farm To School Collaborative and New Connecticut Farmer Alliance

We must underscore the profound value and potential that lies in the synergy between federal and state policy programs and community-based organizations. This interconnectedness is critical for eliminating not only food insecurity, but the diverse social, economic, and ecological issues that are direct consequences of the industrial food system’s detrimental impacts. 
We ask that Murphy and Blumenthal use their position of inﬂuence, and power, to support these programs and to integrate them into their narrative around a larger vision for a democratic society. Transformation in the food system, informed and guided by said programs, will lead us towards the creative connections, authentic well being, thriving communities and stronger democracy we all long for.
We are grateful for their representation and sincerely thank them for their courage in defending our democracy at a time rife with challenges.

Jared Polis speaks at the Colorado Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)A Denver judge on Wednesday blocked the Colorado governor’s office from forcing a state employee to hand over records to federal immigration authorities on 35 sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant children in the state.
The information was sought in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena from April.
The preliminary injunction, handed down by Denver District Court Judge A. Bruce Jones, applies only to Scott Moss and staffers in the Division of Labor Standards and Statistics within the state’s labor department. Moss is the division’s director.
“I will not enjoin the governor from otherwise responding to this subpoena if that’s what he wants to do,” Jones said. “And it’s not to say that there isn’t some other workaround where somebody could ask one of his supervisees to do something and they do it. I’m not enjoining them from doing it. I’m enjoining the governor from requiring that they do it.”

The ICE subpoena seeks personal information, such as addresses, telephone numbers, emails and employment history, on 35 sponsors of immigrant children, purportedly in order to check on the children’s welfare and investigate any potential child abuse. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, decided to comply with the subpoena in late May after some deliberation.
That’s when Moss filed a lawsuit against Polis alleging that disclosing the data would violate a state law against data sharing with ICE unless it is for a criminal investigation or under a judge-signed subpoena. Moss’ lawyers argued in court this week that the subpoena does not fit that standard because it does not point to any specific, ongoing criminal investigation and could be an attempt from federal immigration authorities to find the names and addresses of people to put in deportation proceedings.
“It’s essentially a fishing expedition,” Moss lawyer Laura Wolf said in court on Monday.
In his testimony, Moss said that during an April 29 meeting with representatives from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, the attorney general’s office and the governor’s office, “nobody expressed the view that the production should be made in light” of the state law.
“We all agreed that if there were concerns about child welfare, those should be looked into by appropriate folks. But we all agreed that we had not seen any evidence of any harm to children,” Moss said. “If we had any evidence, it could be routed the appropriate way. There are state and local agencies that cover such things.”
CDLE director Joe Barela then told Moss in late May that Polis had changed his mind and wanted to produce the records requested by the subpoena.
“He said that the governor didn’t want to be accused of not helping ICE prevent any harm that might be happening to any children,” Moss said Tuesday in court. “He said that the governor … thought that the criminal exception (in the law) … gave him ‘cover.’”
Polis’ lawyers argued this week that the subpoena related to criminal matters, and that Moss was not at risk professionally if he decided not to tell his employees to produce the information. That could have meant Barela, or some other official, would make the order.
“But the statute isn’t about protecting me personally. It’s about protecting the individuals named from having their (personal identifying information) released in a potentially injurious way. It wouldn’t make me feel any better if, to save me from the trouble, other state employees would have this thrust upon them,” Moss said Tuesday.
Colorado in recent years has enacted state laws, including legislation signed in 2021 and earlier this year, that limit the sharing of data about immigrants with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Two unions that represent state employees, Colorado WINS and AFL-CIO, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said the governor’s office is reviewing next steps.
“We will abide by the court’s decision as we have always said we would,” she wrote in an email. “Governor Polis remains committed to fully and promptly cooperating with federal criminal investigations into child trafficking and exploitation, while protecting unaccompanied children in Colorado. We hope if information is needed for criminal investigations, that going forward (Homeland Security Investigations) will provide subpoenas for state information consistent with this ruling.”
Polis has repeatedly said that he welcomes federal help to detain and deport “dangerous criminals.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)I have only lived in Alaska for 24 years, but have a lifetime of Alaskan adventure under my belt. During my time here I have worked as a biologist, field archaeologist, lodge owner and wilderness guide. In my off time, I have explored thousands of miles by dog team training for and running the Iditarod and Yukon Quest among other races, floated hundreds of miles of wild rivers, and hiked hundreds of miles of tough terrain. I have filled my family’s freezer yearly from the abundant fish, wild game and berries this land has to offer … every single one of these activities have been done almost exclusively on our public lands. Public lands are more than lines on a map, as Alaskans, we are tied to the land for food, economic benefit and recreation. These public lands are our shared inheritance, our greatest privilege — and our most fragile asset. 
So when Congress tries to sell them out from under us, we pay attention.
Buried in the Senate Budget Reconciliation Bill, H.R.1, is a clause that originally would have mandated that the federal government make between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres for over 250 million acres of public lands available for sale. That includes drawing from at least 82 million acres in Alaska alone. You can view these lands on a chillingly detailed interactive ArcGIS map. While the Senate parliamentarian removed this provision, at least one senator is seeking to revive it.
Under the original plan, you may find some of your favorite places in Alaska illuminated like a for-sale sign in our front yards. I see sections of the Iditarod and Yukon Quest trail, ready to be blocked, I see my little private remote lodge property completely surrounded by lands to give away, I see the spots where my family gets its food, I see the spots where we take clients on dog mushing expeditions. Mainly, I see my Alaskan life being erased by senators with no clue what these lands mean to many. 
Supporters of this public lands sell-off frame it as a way to reduce the federal deficit, return lands to the people, and to create “affordable housing.”  But Alaskans are too smart to fall for that. These lands already belong to the people. Selling them is not “returning” them — it’s liquidating them. For private interests. Forever. The majority of these lands in Alaska are far from population centers and any housing that would be created would be far from affordable. New housing developments would need roads, infrastructure, and services which currently do not exist. Eligible lands close to population centers are already heavily used for recreational purposes and bring immense benefits to these communities.
What do we get in exchange? Practically nothing. According to the Wilderness Society, the estimated revenue from these sales is negligible compared to the $459 billion that outdoor recreation contributes annually to the U.S. economy. Alaska’s share of that pie is substantial. Our guiding businesses, lodges, outdoor gear shops, bush pilots, and even small-town gas stations and restaurants depend on the access and abundance that public lands provide.
The loss goes far beyond economics. Once these lands are privatized, access is likely to be shut off. No more family hikes to berry patches, no more hunting camp with the friends, no more snowmachine access across snow-covered valleys. Subsistence communities — especially Alaska Native villages already navigating land constraints — would bear the brunt of these closures. It’s a direct threat to food security and cultural traditions. 
Maps published by Field & Stream, Outside Magazine, and High Country News show just how widespread this threat is. From the Brooks Range to the Wrangells, from Interior trapping trails to Southeast’s Sitka Blacktail country, the lands on the chopping block are your lands. And the  proposal was not vague. The text of H.R.1,Section 20305, explicitly instructs the Department of the Interior to identify federal lands “suitable for disposal” — a designation often made with little regard for public recreational use, hunting and habitat value, or subsistence rights.
This is not the first time we’ve had to defend public lands from attack—and it won’t be the last. But the scale of this threat is historic. Alaska has more public land at stake than any other state and this isn’t stopped now, we risk losing access to the very places that define who we are.
This really is a nonpartisan issue. Every outdoor enthusiast in Alaska is a public land owner and should be paying attention.  Millions of acres of Alaskan opportunity are at risk of being able to be sold to the highest bidder. Alaskans will not trade 100-year access for a one-time payout. Our lands are not a budget line. They’re a birthright. They are what makes us Alaskan.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis-Pool/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Democratic leaders rallied Wednesday against the congressional budget and tax cut bill, fearing changes to the national food assistance program will blow holes in state budgets and leave Americans hungry.
Four Democratic governors and two U.S. senators slammed the proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which they referred to as “ugly” and a “big beautiful betrayal of a bill” during a press call.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota led the call. She and U.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Laura Kelly of Kansas and Matt Meyer of Delaware took turns lambasting the Republican legislation.
“I’m very concerned about not only the money that this is going to cost but also the chaos that it’s going to create for so many people who will just give up and end up going hungry,” Kelly said.
The Democrats told stories of seniors, children, veterans and families who they worry will suffer as a result of cuts.
“They’re going to have that pain in their stomachs and throughout their body when they’re trying to go to bed or when they’re waking up in the morning of not having enough to eat,” Beshear said.
The bill changes by the day. Recent modifications from the U.S. Senate would require states to contribute a combined $128 billion to the federal food assistance program, which historically has been fully funded by the federal government. States would be required to contribute more money, the higher their payment error rates. States currently contribute half of administrative costs, but another provision in the bill seeks to reduce the federal government’s share by $27 billion, or 25%, creating additional costs for states.
The changes to SNAP from the Senate are multifold, but many are driven by cost-cutting measures and restricting eligibility.
The current proposal would bolster work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries and restrict eligibility for people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. Both provisions are designed to save the government almost $100 billion by making benefits more difficult to access for low-income families. The proposal also could eliminate internet expenses from utility benefit calculations, reducing the amount of money beneficiaries receive each month. That change is expected to save the government $11 billion.
The Democrats criticized Republicans for touting the bill as cutting costs while it is projected to add $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in the next decade.
Two of the bill’s food-benefits provisions — the state contribution requirement and restricted eligibility for immigrants who aren’t lawful permanent residents of the U.S. — broke a Senate rule, according to the budget committee. Those provisions either need to be fixed or, if left in, will be subject to a 60-vote threshold.
“That has not deterred the Republican leadership from continuing to search for workarounds, and apparently have found one,” said Kelly.
Republicans recently adjusted the language of the state contribution provision, and the Senate parliamentarian took it under review
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate rules and agriculture committees, anticipated word on whether the new language violates a Senate rule by Thursday. Regardless, she said, Democrats intend to oppose the bill.
Most of the bill’s funding is a result of shifting costs in the billions to states, she said.
The majority of states have balanced budget rules, Klobuchar said, “so they would be forced to choose: pay for food assistance or reduce law enforcement, reduce education or reduce health care.”
Klobuchar quoted a letter Democratic governors sent Tuesday to congressional leadership, explaining their qualms with states taking on SNAP costs.
“These cuts from Congress don’t just increase state costs,” the letter said, “they make it nearly impossible for states to effectively plan for these long-term budget impacts.”
Most states have already finalized budgets ahead of the June 30 end date of the 2025 fiscal year.
Klobuchar said 4 million Americans will lose SNAP benefits as a result of the bill, which includes 1 million seniors, 800,000 parents with school-age children and 1.4 million people who live in areas where finding a job is difficult.
SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6.20 per person per day. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to more than 42 million people across the country. Around 115,000 Delawareans, 186,000 Kansans, 700,000 Kentuckians, 1.1 million Massachusetts residents and 360,000 Minnesotans receive monthly SNAP benefits as of March, according to preliminary estimates from the USDA.
Healey, of Massachusetts, said that for every one meal that a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine.
States don’t have the resources to fill gaps left behind by the proposed cuts, she said.
Kelly estimated Kansas, in administrative costs alone, will have to find more than $15 million per year to operate SNAP, which she called a conservative estimate. She expected Kansans in need will lose their benefits, especially if bolstered work requirements pass. She said they sound “really good” in theory, but worried the requirements and reporting will create hurdles for people who are “legitimately qualified” for benefits.
“We’re going to see the same thing happen with SNAP that we saw with Medicaid in states that were forced to, or did, put in work requirements,” she said.
Beshear drew a connection between the bill’s SNAP provisions and similar cuts that would weaken funding to rural hospitals. Kentucky has the highest number in the nation of rural hospitals at risk, with 35 facing closure. Beshear said those hospitals are often major employers. If rural hospitals close as a result of the bill, he said, Kentuckians are more likely to fall on hard times and turn to assistance programs like SNAP for help. But the proposed cuts to SNAP will make that more difficult, he said. Beshear criticized the cuts through the lens of religion, reciting the biblical story of the loaves and fishes.
“In a country where we grow enough food so that no one has to go hungry,” he said, “no one should go hungry.”

(Photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey)The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will allow oil and gas workers to more intensely harass polar bears away from people and equipment near the Beaufort Sea. 
A new rule, scheduled to take effect Thursday, follows a series of lawsuits brought by environmental groups who claimed that the federal government failed to adequately justify prior rules that allowed lower levels of harassment. 
Under federal regulations, “level B harassment” takes place when someone annoys an animal enough to change its behavior, typically steering it away from an object or person. 
“Level A harassment” takes place when that annoyance has the potential to injure the animal. 
In 2024, the 9th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals said in an order that it doubted federal officials’ claims that there would be no class A harassment against polar bears and directed the Fish and Wildlife Service to reexamine its approach.
With that order in hand, the service rewrote its rules “to allow the … Level A harassment of polar bears that may result from industry activities.”
A spokesperson for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, a trade group, said that organization was still analyzing the proposed new rules and didn’t have additional comment.
But the change drew opposition from environmentalists.
“Polar bears are the poster children for animals at risk from our rapidly heating climate and they need far more protection than this rule provides,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, by email. “It’s horrific that the Trump administration ignored the science to greenlight more harm to polar bears while also proposing to open up more oil drilling in their habitat. Polar bears were already being driven toward extinction, and Trump is hitting the gas pedal.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Democrat Rob Sand held his first of 100 planned town halls on the campaign trail for Iowa governor Wednesday, he emphasized he wants to be a public servant who doesn’t abide by party interests — and shared policy positions where he differs from most Democrats.
At the event at the Theater Arts Center in Waukee, Sand started by asking how many people in the crowd were Republicans, independents, and people who voted against him in elections, asking the audience to clap. Many did.
He then led the crowd to sing “America the Beautiful” with him before launching into his reasons for running for governor and answering questions from the crowd.
Sand, the only Democrat to currently hold statewide elected office in Iowa as state auditor, said though he is running as a Democrat, he is not a fan of political parties. When he first registered to vote, he registered as an independent, Sand said, but later “picked my poison” by registering as a Democrat to vote in political primaries. However, he said, “we should be talking about the fact that it is poison, we should still be talking about the fact that no matter what your party is, partisanship in this state and in this country has gone too far.”

He said he wants to focus instead on policies and ways that government can work to better serve Iowans on the campaign trail.
“Let’s talk about issues,” Sand said. “Let’s talk about integrity. Let’s talk about ideas. Let’s learn what the facts are by talking to all the different stakeholders involved, and then figure out what a good thing to do is that we can actually implement, and then talk about that.”
While Sand is currently one of the highest-profile candidates in the 2026 race for governor and entered the race with more than $8 million from the 2024 calendar year, he is also running as a Democrat — a potentially tough sell following several election cycles where Republicans have won big across state and federal offices in Iowa.
Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to not run for reelection in 2026, combined with national discontent with President Donald Trump’s administration and Congress, could put Democrats, including Sand, in a better position for the upcoming election than previous years. However, Sand said he does not want to focus on advancing a Democratic agenda as governor, but on enacting policies that will improve Iowa.
He criticized Reynolds’ comments at several events that she is in friendly competitions with other GOP governors to pass tax cuts and certain policies.
“We have a governor right now who has talked about the fact that she thinks she’s in competition with other Republican governors to enact policies those Republican governors are in states that are nothing like Iowa, that can pursue policies that would not work in Iowa,” Sand said. “… I cannot understand that mindset. I can’t. I would work with anybody to do something good for the state of Iowa, but also (if) someone’s trying to do something bad or suggesting something that I don’t think would work here, I wouldn’t be interested in it. I have seen too much of policies getting imported from elsewhere that don’t work for Iowa.”
In addition to saying he would not be interested in following a party agenda, Sand said he supports certain policies opposed by many Democrats. When asked by a member of the audience about limiting unhealthy foods available for purchase through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Sand said he is generally supportive of a restriction. Democrats and hunger advocates often oppose SNAP restrictions, saying it is an unnecessary restriction for families in need seeking food.
“I think that one is a good idea,” Sand said. “People who criticize it as paternalistic, saying like, ‘Oh, well, you know, you shouldn’t decide what they’re going to buy with SNAP.’ Well, feeding people might be paternalistic too, and I feed my kids, and we don’t buy them pop. And I think that makes sense.”
But he said he does not support certain components of these proposals, pointing to Reynolds’ waiver excluding certain foods like candy and soft drinks from SNAP approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May that would allow for candy to be purchased if it has flour in it. Sand asked “Gee, I wonder, was there someone that makes flour that had a role in crafting that legislation?” and said these measures need to pass the “smell test” if implemented.
Sand has also made other comments differing from typical Democratic positions, including answering “no” when asked on the WHO AM Simon Conway show in May if “biological boys or men should play women’s sports.”
Republicans have criticized Sand for portraying himself as moderate in his gubernatorial campaign. At an event earlier Wednesday, potential GOP gubernatorial candidate Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, called Sand a “wolf in sheep’s clothing.”
Though he said emphasized his moderate bonafides, Sand also said there are many measures passed by Republicans that he would oppose as governor. When asked about how he would work with Republicans at the Statehouse, who hold majorities in both chambers, Sand said Iowans could expect “more vetoes, probably.”
Sand said he would work across the aisle to advance measures he believe would help the state, but said that being a Democratic governor working with GOP-led chambers would mean some priorities are unlikely to pass.
“No one can honestly sit here and tell you, ‘I’m going to do this and I’m going to do that,’ because when we have divided government, it’s hard to get a lot of things done,” Sand said. “It also, though, means that for the folks out there who tend to be on the other side of the aisle, who are Republicans, having a Democratic governor doesn’t mean that I get to do everything I want, either. It means that we’re just going to have balance in the state of Iowa.”

We want young children, especially those living in poverty, to receive quality early childhood services from birth to Grade 3. We want families to feel welcome at our schools. And for the last 11 years, we’ve achieved that in the Omaha area under an ambitious initiative: the Superintendents’ Early Childhood Plan.
So, in March, when a national early childhood expert spoke in Omaha about the importance of forging strong relationships between schools and families, several current and former superintendents found ourselves nodding in agreement and recognition.

The plan was developed by superintendents and school staff, alongside the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska, to ensure all children are ready to learn and excel. Eleven superintendents endorsed it unanimously in July 2014.
It is funded through the vision and leadership of the Learning Community and stands as an example of
collaboration that extends beyond school boundaries.
Our support remains steadfast to this day, as the plan serves more than 2,800 children at the more intensive School as Hub sites.
That number climbs to 15,000 students affected when you consider school administrators and staff who receive professional development, coaching and other services.
National perspective
At the March 27 Superintendents’ Plan gathering, we listened as speaker Edward Manuszak, the executive director of early childhood at Washtenaw Intermediate School District in Michigan and a former superintendent himself, talked about early childhood education’s return on investment and the path that Omaha-area school districts have blazed.

 Who is participating

	The Metropolitan Omaha Educational Consortium includes the following superintendents:

Jason Buckingham, Ralston Public Schools
Bary Habrock, Elkhorn Public Schools
Travis Lightle, Gretna Public Schools
Mike Lucas, Westside Community Schools
Aaron Plas, Bennington Public Schools
Melissa Poloncic, Douglas County West Community Schools
Matthew Ray, Omaha Public Schools
Andrew Rikli, Papillion La Vista Community Schools
Jeff Rippe, Bellevue Public Schools
Ryan Saunders, Springfield Platteview Community Schools
John Schwartz, Millard Public Schools.



Influenced by the Superintendents’ Plan, Manuszak encouraged school districts to adopt a similar model in Monroe County, Michigan. “You’re leading the nation with this work,” he said.
The event was attended by dozens of education partners, including superintendents, principals, school staff, community and nonprofit leaders, and members of the Learning Community Coordinating Council. Improving outcomes for children in our community requires a
communitywide response.
Under the plan, there are now 10 School as Hub schools providing comprehensive services to families in the Bellevue, Douglas County West, Millard, Omaha, Ralston, and Westside districts. Bennington, Elkhorn, Gretna, and Papillion-La Vista receive consulting to meet district-specific early childhood goals.
Local progress
Here’s what this looks like in practice:
Home visitors show new parents how to read and talk to their infants to spark brain development. Families can enroll their child in high-quality preschools. Teachers and principals receive training on the best early learning practices.

(Courtesy of Buffett Early Childhood Institute)
And we know one key fact—it is working. Principals at School as Hub schools report 100% of Kindergarten classrooms met growth goals for math and reading. These schools also found improvements in teacher-child interactions and instruction through 3rd Grade. Participating families note increased connection with school staff and reduced stress.
Schools are engaging families in new and meaningful ways:

In addition to home visits and family engagement, Omaha Public Schools is leveraging staff to build a community and child care network through training and a collective focus on early childhood success. That includes new community facilitators who connect North and South Omaha schools with community child care programs serving future Omaha students.


In Millard, where deeper parent and guardian engagement has been a priority, Sandoz Elementary celebrates students’ family history and stories at its school events.


At Westbrook Elementary in Westside, an after-school “park and play” program allows babies and toddlers to play together while parents pick up their school-age siblings.

This kind of work is slow and deliberate. Success does not happen overnight. But we are honored to participate in an innovative program helping children learn long before they enter our school doors.
These early years matter so much. Let’s continue to make the most of this crucial time so all children have the opportunity to succeed.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After nearly 40 years in Alaska’s state Capitol, Sen. Lyman Hoffman is calling it quits. 
On Wednesday, the Bethel Democrat confirmed that he will not seek reelection in 2026 and will end a political career that has left him as the longest-serving state legislator in Alaska history.
“Forty years is enough,” Hoffman said on Wednesday.
“I’m going to go back and become a civilian, and I’m going to talk with Rep. Edgmon and encourage him to file for my seat,” Hoffman said, referring to Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham.
Hoffman was elected to the state House in 1986 and to the state Senate in 1994. That year, his closest opponent was Edgmon.
“He’s from the region. He’s been in politics for over 20 years. I think we would have more continuity in having a seasoned person to represent the Senate district,” Hoffman said of Edgmon.
By text message, Edgmon said he is “taking a serious look” at running for Senate.
“Senator Hoffman’s announcement today was not unexpected; however, it still comes as a bit of a gut punch because of what he has meant not just to rural Alaska but to the state as a whole,” Edgmon said. “His departure is going to be a huge loss to the Legislature.”
Hoffman confirmed that he doesn’t intend to run for governor or any other office.
“The family life — that’s the toughest part. Leaving home, leaving family, leaving friends for three to six months out of every year, it puts a big strain,” he said. “So a lot of kudos out to my wife Lillian for putting up with me to do what I love to do.”
In a 15-minute phone interview, Hoffman reflected on his career, saying that in addition to a law that requires the state to fund rural schools, his biggest achievements were those related to energy. He successfully created an endowment fund for the Power Cost Equalization program, which subsidizes rural power costs, and that endowment now is worth more than $1 billion.
Other successes also were related to energy.
“We passed legislation to set up a weatherization program, and we’ve weatherized over $600 million worth of homes,” he said.
If the trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline is built, 20% of gas-sale royalties will be reserved for rural energy development, thanks to Hoffman’s work.
“I think that overall, the work I’ve done on energy is probably the most important thing,” he said. 
Asked what has changed in the Capitol during his 40 years, he said the power of rural legislators is now taken for granted. Earlier in his career, it wasn’t.
For the past 10 years, rural legislators have played a kingmaking role in the closely divided state House and Senate, frequently determining whether a Republican-led coalition or a Democratic-led coalition controls each body.
“There were times when rural Alaska wasn’t at the table, and I think that’s the biggest change,” Hoffman said.
“Even if you talk to urban legislators, I think the caliber of and the participation of rural legislators is well respected today,” he said.
When asked what advice he would give a new legislator, he said that it’s important to know that “the relationships you make directly affect your influence,” so it’s important to make friends.
“The top people that are out there — Senator (Gary) Stevens, Senator (Bert) Stedman, Senator (Donny) Olson. All of us have over 20 years of experience in the Senate, and we are good friends, and so I think it’s all about relationships and keeping your word to each other.”
During his time in office, the state’s population has grown, as has the influence of Alaska Native corporations, including Native health corporations.
“I’m chairman of the Bethel Native Corporation, and have been for around 30 years. Our wealth has multiplied by 20-fold. You know, I think that in the state … Native corporations have changed the state of Alaska for the better,” he said.
As he prepares to leave office, Hoffman said he thinks the state’s biggest unresolved issue is the affordability of living in Alaska, particularly with regard to the cost of energy.
“That’s why I spent so much time on it,” he said of energy issues.
“The unfinished business, I think the biggest one that is going to have a major impact on energy, is the gas line,” he said.
The high cost of energy in rural Alaska is also why he’s been interested in micronuclear reactors.
“Right now, people in rural Alaska are spending up to 50-60% of their disposable income on energy, and if they had that 50-60% reduced down to 10%, that would be a windfall to them, and that would change the way people look at Alaska, because it’s in many instances, it’s pretty expensive to live here because of energy,” he said.
“If we can crack the energy equation in the next two decades, I think that’s going to change the face of Alaska.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)A state-mandated racial equity study in Colorado has raised a total of more than $1 million and is a month ahead of schedule, according to a presentation Wednesday at the Colorado Capitol by the study’s leaders to the Black Coloradan Racial Equity Study Commission.
The commission oversees the ongoing History Colorado study, which is looking into inequalities, both historic and current, caused by racism in Colorado. 
The commission was established in June 2024 through Senate Bill 24-53. The law did not come with any state budget allocation, and the study instead derives its funding through grants, foundations and donations. The three-year study began work in the fall and will cost a total of $1.8 million. Fundraising efforts continue in an effort to bring in the remaining $740,000 needed.
“It’s a big deal to know that we’re doing something that’s simultaneously data-driven and community-funded,” said Colorado Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat who chairs the commission. “It’s powerful.”

The study focuses on the harms of racism in areas including housing, banking, employment, education, health care and criminal justice. The commission will make legislative recommendations based on the study’s findings.
The study examines the long-term economic inequalities that have stemmed from now-unlawful racist practices like hiring discrimination and redlining, which refers to race-based discrimination in real estate markets. Redlining was particularly prevalent in Colorado during the 1930s. 
Study leaders are also working to document the damages of racist violence throughout Colorado history, including at least seven lynchings of Black Coloradans in the late 1800s and bombings targeting Black Denver residents in the 1920s.
“We’re moving (through the study) with a sense of commitment, a sense of fervor and a sense of care,” History Colorado Program Manager Chloé Duplessis said. “As we all know, for far too long, there has been an absence of care when it comes to Black and Brown bodies, livelihoods and access to quality of life.”
Study leaders have uncovered that several lawmakers throughout Colorado’s early history either owned slaves or came from slave-owning families, including three U.S. senators.
Study leaders announced that they are scheduling several listening sessions to be held in Pueblo, Colorado Springs and Denver on Saturdays throughout September and October. These sessions will be open to the public, with a focus on hearing the stories of Coloradans, answering their questions and engaging them in the study’s research process. 
“Everything about this journey is not just for research purposes, but to honor and build capacity within the community,” Duplessis said.

Task force co-chair and Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, encouraged members during a meeting Wednesday at the University of South Dakota’s Sioux Falls campus to look at all options to cut budgets, reallocate funding, or raise or implement other taxes in order to achieve the group’s goal.
“If we’re going to actually go through this exercise of looking for property tax relief, then we have to turn over each rock, all of these rocks,” Karr said. “Even if I don’t believe I’m going to find what I’m looking for, I feel like there’s an obligation to look underneath and see what’s there.”

Lawmakers adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal earlier this year to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments. That new law will take effect next week. Rhoden has also proposed an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes. 
Another idea pitched by Sen. Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, on Wednesday would separate school funding from property taxes and create a new state sales tax of 1% dedicated to education funding. The 1% tax would apply to most products and services that are currently exempted from sales taxes, and would stack on top of the existing state sales tax rate of 4.2% for other transactions.
Lawmakers plan to discuss both ideas and others that might arise throughout the summer as they consider introducing legislation next winter to ease the tax burden for homeowners. The task force was created during this year’s legislative session. 
According to a presentation from the Legislative Research Council, the amount paid in property taxes by South Dakota homeowners increased 38.8% between 2020 and 2024. Owner-occupied properties accounted for 44.3% of total property taxes paid in the state in 2024.
Local government officials and representatives warned the group repeatedly Wednesday against knee-jerk reactions to recent increases and asked for consideration of the consequences of limiting revenue for local governments. Some members of the public encouraged lawmakers to make cuts or eliminate property taxes altogether.

Counties: Reduce unfunded mandates or open another revenue source
Counties and schools depend on property taxes for much of their revenue, while cities receive some property tax revenue but are more dependent on sales taxes. The state also depends on sales taxes and does not receive any revenue from property taxes.
County representatives told committee members that their budgets are already bare-bones.

Minnehaha County Auditor Leah Anderson said her county is losing money to complete some state-mandated services, such as mailing new license plates. Clay County Commissioner Geoffrey Gray-Lobe said his southeastern county cut its budget to essential services due to funding issues and decisions, despite high property taxes.
Any reductions in revenue would lead to cuts to infrastructure, road maintenance or public safety, county representatives warned, while saying about 80% of county budgets are spent on unfunded mandates imposed by the state.
Part of that cost includes public defenders and state’s attorneys required to be provided and funded at the county level, said Dan Klimisch, a Yankton County commissioner and president of the South Dakota Association of County Commissioners.
“Reduce or eliminate unfunded mandates,” Klimisch said, “or give us another revenue source.”
Cities, schools warn of budget cuts
Mike Jaspers, Sioux Metro Growth Alliance board chair, said lower property tax revenues could hurt communities because they wouldn’t be able to build infrastructure to support eventual growth and have a “balanced community.”
“Down the road, my biggest fear is forcing the hand of communities of what they will look like versus what they’d like to look like,” Jaspers said.

Sioux Falls Director of Finance Shawn Pritchett said the city experienced a 59% increase in expenses due to an increase in population and inflation over the past decade. The budget increased by 58% in that same timeframe.
“At its core, maintaining property taxes isn’t just about growing government,” Pritchett said. “It’s about trying to keep pace with our growing community.”
Amanda Mack, Harrisburg city administrator, listed millions of dollars of costs to build roads and  a new fire station to accommodate the city’s growth. South Dakota’s impending property tax changes, including a cap on the amount of growth that can be factored into property tax increases, will force the city to take on more debt, she said.
“These needs will not go away nor can they be ignored,” Mack said.
Jamie Nold, incoming superintendent for Sioux Falls School District, said the state’s largest district eliminated $3 million from this year’s budget, will do the same next year, and will reduce the budget by $1.5 million the year after to make up for less-than-desired state funding increases.
“People want to come here for the amenities that they have, not for the things they don’t have,” Nold said.
Some local governments seek to opt out of property tax limitations
According to the Legislative Research Council presentation, 69 taxing districts exercised their right to opt out of property tax limitations in fiscal year 2025, in order to raise more revenue. About 94% of those were approved without a public vote.
Most of the opt-outs happened in school districts, accounting for about $10 million in new opt-outs in fiscal year 2025. Less than $4 million in opt-outs were initiated by counties.
The number of active opt-outs among schools decreased from 66 in 2020 to 62 in 2024, though the total funding from opt-outs increased from $31.1 million to $34.1 million. The highest active opt-out is in Sioux Falls, at $11 million annually.
“As we look at opt-outs, we need to understand why they exist and how local governments have had to make that determination,” said Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish. “We can’t lump them all together.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/591A0214e-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:59:25.811264

TOPEKA — Democratic leaders rallied Wednesday against the congressional budget and tax cut bill, fearing changes to the national food assistance program will blow holes in state budgets and leave Americans hungry.
Four Democratic governors and two U.S. senators slammed the proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which they referred to as “ugly” and a “big beautiful betrayal of a bill” during a press call.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota led the call. She and U.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Laura Kelly of Kansas and Matt Meyer of Delaware took turns lambasting the Republican legislation.
“I’m very concerned about not only the money that this is going to cost but also the chaos that it’s going to create for so many people who will just give up and end up going hungry,” Kelly said.
The Democrats told stories of seniors, children, veterans and families who they worry will suffer as a result of cuts.
“They’re going to have that pain in their stomachs and throughout their body when they’re trying to go to bed or when they’re waking up in the morning of not having enough to eat,” Beshear said.
The bill changes by the day. Recent modifications from the U.S. Senate would require states to contribute a combined $128 billion to the federal food assistance program, which historically has been fully funded by the federal government. States would be required to contribute more money, the higher their payment error rates. States currently contribute half of administrative costs, but another provision in the bill seeks to reduce the federal government’s share by $27 billion, or 25%, creating additional costs for states.
The changes to SNAP from the Senate are multifold, but many are driven by cost-cutting measures and restricting eligibility.
The current proposal would bolster work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries and restrict eligibility for people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. Both provisions are designed to save the government almost $100 billion by making benefits more difficult to access for low-income families. The proposal also could eliminate internet expenses from utility benefit calculations, reducing the amount of money beneficiaries receive each month. That change is expected to save the government $11 billion.
The Democrats criticized Republicans for touting the bill as cutting costs while it is projected to add $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in the next decade.
Two of the bill’s food-benefits provisions — the state contribution requirement and restricted eligibility for immigrants who aren’t lawful permanent residents of the U.S. — broke a Senate rule, according to the budget committee. Those provisions either need to be fixed or, if left in, will be subject to a 60-vote threshold.
“That has not deterred the Republican leadership from continuing to search for workarounds, and apparently have found one,” said Kelly.
Republicans recently adjusted the language of the state contribution provision, and the Senate parliamentarian took it under review
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate rules and agriculture committees, anticipated word on whether the new language violates a Senate rule by Thursday. Regardless, she said, Democrats intend to oppose the bill.
Most of the bill’s funding is a result of shifting costs in the billions to states, she said.
The majority of states have balanced budget rules, Klobuchar said, “so they would be forced to choose: pay for food assistance or reduce law enforcement, reduce education or reduce health care.”
Klobuchar quoted a letter Democratic governors sent Tuesday to congressional leadership, explaining their qualms with states taking on SNAP costs.
“These cuts from Congress don’t just increase state costs,” the letter said, “they make it nearly impossible for states to effectively plan for these long-term budget impacts.”
Most states have already finalized budgets ahead of the June 30 end date of the 2025 fiscal year.
Klobuchar said 4 million Americans will lose SNAP benefits as a result of the bill, which includes 1 million seniors, 800,000 parents with school-age children and 1.4 million people who live in areas where finding a job is difficult.
SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6.20 per person per day. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to more than 42 million people across the country. Around 115,000 Delawareans, 186,000 Kansans, 700,000 Kentuckians, 1.1 million Massachusetts residents and 360,000 Minnesotans receive monthly SNAP benefits as of March, according to preliminary estimates from the USDA.
Healey, of Massachusetts, said that for every one meal that a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine.
States don’t have the resources to fill gaps left behind by the proposed cuts, she said.
Kelly estimated Kansas, in administrative costs alone, will have to find more than $15 million per year to operate SNAP, which she called a conservative estimate. She expected Kansans in need will lose their benefits, especially if bolstered work requirements pass. She said they sound “really good” in theory, but worried the requirements and reporting will create hurdles for people who are “legitimately qualified” for benefits.

“We’re going to see the same thing happen with SNAP that we saw with Medicaid in states that were forced to, or did, put in work requirements,” she said.
Beshear drew a connection between the bill’s SNAP provisions and similar cuts that would weaken funding to rural hospitals. Kentucky has the highest number in the nation of rural hospitals at risk, with 35 facing closure. Beshear said those hospitals are often major employers. If rural hospitals close as a result of the bill, he said, Kentuckians are more likely to fall on hard times and turn to assistance programs like SNAP for help. But the proposed cuts to SNAP will make that more difficult, he said. Beshear criticized the cuts through the lens of religion, reciting the biblical story of the loaves and fishes.
“In a country where we grow enough food so that no one has to go hungry,” he said, “no one should go hungry.”

Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will reexamine current recommendations around childhood vaccination schedules and Hepatitis B immunizations, members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices announced during a meeting in Atlanta Wednesday.
The committee, which meets three times a year, does not typically garner much public interest. However, this meeting is the first since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismissed all 17 members of the committee and replaced them with a slate of eight hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics, launching the little-known committee into the national spotlight.
Medical experts, including the American Medical Association, expressed dismay at Kennedy’s appointment of the new committee members, which the organization said occurred “without transparency and proper vetting to ensure they have the expertise necessary to make vaccine recommendations to protect the health of Americans.”

“We urge the Administration to reconsider the removal of the 17 ACIP members who have deep expertise in vaccines so physicians can continue to have confidence in ACIP’s recommendations,” AMA President Bobby M. Mukkamala said in a statement.
Six former ACIP chairs also authored an op-ed after the former committee members’ dismissal, warning that “if relevant scientific expertise on vaccines is not maintained, access to vaccines may fundamentally change.”
The move was also made in direct contradiction with a promise from Kennedy to Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy ahead of the secretary’s confirmation in February. Cassidy says Kennedy pledged to “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes.” 
Cassidy, a doctor who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary, called for the meeting to be delayed until members with more expertise in vaccines could be appointed to the panel, but was unsuccessful. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski also expressed concern about the backgrounds of the new panelists.
The committee is now chaired by Martin Kulldorff, a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who was fired in 2024 after declining the COVID-19 vaccine, and has spoken out against blanket vaccine mandates during the pandemic. 
“Secretary Kennedy has given this committee a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine when making vaccine recommendations, and that is what we will do,” Kulldorff said in his opening remarks. He also disputed characterizations of his skepticism of vaccine mandates as “anti-vax.”
“Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee, issuing false accusations and making concerted efforts to put scientists in either a pro- or anti-vaccine box,” he said. “Such labels undermine critical scientific inquiry, and it further feeds the flame of vaccine hesitancy. To thoroughly scrutinize and assure the safety and efficacy of vaccines is a pro-vaccine position.”
Other appointees to the committee include Robert Malone, a doctor and biochemist who said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise” and Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses who also serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization that advocates for vaccine exemptions.
One member of the committee, Michael Ross, had already withdrawn from the committee by the time the body convened for the two-day summit in Atlanta. Kennedy, who was attending a “Make America Healthy Again” event in Oklahoma, was not present at the meeting. 
‘Completely unprecedented’
As the committee met inside, dozens of people braved the sweltering heat to hold what they called a “parade of preventable diseases” to highlight the dangers of limiting the public’s access to vaccines. They also called for the committee to be restored to its previous makeup.
A whole colorful cast of pathogens were represented just outside the center’s entrance, from influenza to HPV to meningococcus. Dr. Deblina Datta carried a leg brace to represent polio.
“This is what we don’t want to see again. When we introduce vaccine skepticism, we are going to see people wearing this,” Datta said holding up the brace.

Datta spent more than two decades at CDC working on immunizations, with six years with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. She called the abrupt overhaul of the committee alarming.
“While a healthy skepticism of vaccine policy is good, this level of skepticism and the sources of the skeptics being put onto ACIP is calamitous,” Datta said. “And it’s absolutely eroding the public’s faith in the ACIP to dictate policy.”
Katrina Kretsinger, who retired from the CDC two years ago after working mostly on vaccine-preventable diseases, said she has major concerns about the changes made to the committee.
“This is completely unprecedented,” she said. “And I really don’t think it’s going to have any credibility.”
But she said she is also trying to have “a little bit of wait and see” attitude about the new members.
“I would say that there’s a number of them who seem like they are reasonably well qualified, and then there are others of the seven who come with a very clear anti-vaccine agenda and are well known for viewpoints that are really hard to defend based on the scientific merits,” Kretsinger said. “It’s very disappointing.”
ACIP’s new agenda
The new ACIP appointees are scheduled to spend two days reviewing safety and efficacy data on COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella (MMRV), Influenza, Anthrax and Chikungunya vaccines before voting on new immunization recommendations.
However, Kulldorff said the committee also plans to commission new working groups dedicated to evaluating the impact of childhood vaccines and investigating the timeline for the recommended administration of Hepatitis B vaccines in newborns. The committee will also be reexamining vaccines that have not been reviewed within the last seven years.
“In addition to studying and evaluating individual vaccines, it’s important to evaluate the cumulative effect of the recommended vaccine schedule,” Kulldorff said.
Thursday’s agenda also includes a presentation from Lyn Redwood, the former head of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy. 
Redwood, who is not a CDC employee, is expected to argue that a preservative used in a small portion of flu vaccines, known as thimerosal, causes autism. According to the CDC, research has shown no connection between thimerosal and autism or any other source of harm, and the chemical was taken out of childhood vaccines in the U.S. in 2001.

,DC,2025-06-26 00:08:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,GOP mega-bill stuck in US Senate as disputes grow over hospitals and more,"Ashley Murray, Shauneen Miranda, Jacob Fischler, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-mega-bill-stuck-us-senate-disputes-grow-over-hospitals-and-more,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans appeared deeply divided Wednesday over how to establish a fund for rural hospitals to offset the budget impacts of Medicaid cuts in the “big, beautiful bill.”The hospitals, which are generally already hurting financially, rely heavily on Medicaid, a state-federal partnership that provides health insurance for low-income households and for some people with disabilities.GOP senators haven’t yet reached agreement on how to structure the fund, or on dozens of other unresolved provisions in the sweeping package, even though leaders hope to begin voting as soon as Friday. Still up in the air were agreements on major provisions of the measure involving the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s food aid program for low-income people and a proposed selloff of certain public lands.Republican leaders continued to project optimism. “We’re well on our way to getting this bill passed this week,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech, continuing to press ahead toward a self-imposed Fourth of July deadline. Others saw it differently. Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson cast doubt on the short timeframe leaders have set to reach final agreement and move the bill through both chambers.""We're still discussing some pretty fundamental issues,” Johnson said. “I'm just laying out the reality of the situation. We've got a lot of work to do.”‘The only person up here that’s ever ran a rural hospital’Dueling plans to establish the rural hospital fund to ease the threat of Medicaid cuts circulated among senators working to finalize the massive tax and spending cut measure, but an agreement had not surfaced by late afternoon.Unofficial details showed Senate Republicans eyeing the inclusion of a $15 billion fund — $3 billion a year between fiscal 2027 and fiscal 2031 — to help rural hospitals, according to multiple reports.But Sen. Roger Marshall, who sits on the Senate Committee on Finance, said he wants to increase that fund to $5 billion annually, with “half of that going to rural hospitals, and half of it going to primary care and prescription drugs and throw in physical therapy and occupational therapy, all the others as well.”The Kansas Republican and physician said “we should probably only do it for four or five years and then regroup and see where we are.”“I'm the only person up here that’s ever ran a rural hospital — I actually know something about them,” he added.While Marshall said he loves “90%” of the broader bill, he said not nearly enough is being cut.“But I can't get the votes to do that, so it’d still be the largest cut in spending in my lifetime anyway,” he said, noting that “it’s going to be hard for the House to vote against it.”Fund size criticizedOn a midday call with reporters, Traci Gleason with the Missouri Budget Project said the stabilization fund being batted around by lawmakers “would fall well short of addressing these problems.”“Forty-three percent of Missouri's rural hospitals are at risk of closing, and 17% are considered to be at immediate risk,” said Gleason, who spoke during a virtual press briefing organized by the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.“Those figures don't account for all of the other health care providers in rural communities, like federally qualified health centers and others that operate on these incredibly thin margins. So the massive cuts to Medicaid are what is creating the problem and the only real way to address it is for Congress to not make these massive cuts,” she said.‘Problematic’ Medicaid cutsSen. Susan Collins was advocating for a much bigger rural hospital stabilization fund, at $100 billion.“I don't think that solves the entire problem,” the Maine Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said.“The Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that's problematic as well.”Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia said that the $15 billion “is better than zero.”“You know, naturally, I'd want it to be as high as it possibly can,” he said, adding that rural hospitals are the “lifeblood” of his state.Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a loud voice against Medicaid benefit cuts, said a stabilization fund is a “good idea but we're still going to have to address the longer term effects of this.”When asked for a dollar figure, Hawley said “it depends on the structure of it.”Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said he keeps hearing the Senate will take a procedural vote on Friday, though that isn’t set in stone. “Should be a fun weekend for all of us,” Cornyn said. “Can't wait.”Once the Senate votes on what is called a motion to proceed, there’s a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate before the chamber must begin its marathon amendment voting session and eventually a passage vote.SNAP provisionsSenate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said a revised version of his committee’s bill had not yet been reviewed by the parliamentarian.The updated text alters a section restructuring the cost-share of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a key food assistance program for low-income people.The provision would require states for the first time to shoulder some of the cost of the program’s benefits. The amount a state owes would be determined by its error payment rate, with greater error rates requiring a higher state share.Complex rules govern what can and can’t be included in the measure. The Senate parliamentarian ruled the language in the initial proposal did not comply with the chamber’s reconciliation rules.The updated proposal would allow states more flexibility during the policy’s phase-in in fiscal 2028, allowing them to choose either the error rate in fiscal 2025 or fiscal 2026.Boozman told reporters that change sought to respond to the parliamentarian’s ruling.The parliamentarian “asked us to allow them (states) to use a different time frame — essentially gave them more time to understand what their error rate would be and to plan for it,” Boozman said. “And so we adjusted for that and I think we satisfied it.”Lee and public landsSenate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Mike Lee of Utah reportedly narrowed a provision that would mandate the sale of Bureau of Land Management lands. He has not publicly said where it stands with the parliamentarian.A committee spokesman did not return messages seeking clarification Tuesday and Wednesday, but a version of the changes obtained by news media shows changes consistent with what Lee proposed Monday.Those changes include limiting the mandated sales to only the BLM — and not U.S. Forest Service lands, as Lee had initially proposed — and lowering the percentage of the agency’s lands that must be sold to between .25% and .5%. The initial proposal required between .5% and .75%.The updated provision would also only require lands located within 5 miles of a population center to be sold and exempts lands that are currently used for grazing or another “valid existing right that is incompatible with the development of housing,” according to a copy of the changes obtained by hunting and angling publication Outdoor Life.The provision has sparked opposition from Western lawmakers, including a handful of conservatives.But it also has its share of supporters. Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan told reporters he had not seen the updated text but remained supportive of the idea.“I've been supportive of what Sen. Lee is trying to do,” he said. “We have a lot of public lands in Alaska that the federal government abuses. But we're in a good discussion on that, so I need to see the update.”",,,,2025-06-25 20:59:25.811264

A long-awaited scientific report commissioned by Polk County says farm pollution threatens the ability to drink clean water and to safely interact with central Iowa streams, Iowa Capital Dispatch has learned.
The county announced its Central Iowa Source Water Research Assessment in 2023 and heralded it as a first-of-its-kind, unbiased and comprehensive examination of the watersheds that feed the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers, which converge near downtown Des Moines.
The topic is acutely important: Central Iowa Water Works recently banned lawn watering — for the first time ever — to prevent nitrate concentrations in its treated drinking water from exceeding a federal health limit.

Further, there are plans to spend more than $120 million to make the area a major destination for water recreation. That includes installing a machine near the confluence of the rivers to generate waves suitable for surfing.
But sampling shows the rivers routinely have fecal bacteria concentrations that exceed safe limits for swimming.
The assessment’s final report — dubbed “Currents of Change” — was expected to be released earlier this year, but the county has thus far declined to make it public. The county has denied requests to release it under the state’s open records law on the basis that the report is still in draft form.
A county spokesperson has declined to comment about the situation.
Groups that are potentially affected by researchers’ findings have reviewed some or all of the report.
“This is not new information that we have a water quality issue in Iowa,” said Stephanie Oppel, executive director of Iowa Confluence Water Trails, which seeks to enhance water recreation in central Iowa with public funding.
Oppel said her organization — commonly known as ICON — does not dispute the underlying data that was collected for the project but disagrees with conclusions that central Iowa streams might be unhealthy for recreational activities. She said she didn’t know why the county has delayed the release of the report.
“All recreation is not without risk,” Oppel said. “There is some sort of risk.”
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, a powerful group that advocates for agriculture, did not respond to requests to comment for this article.
The report is more than 200 pages and is the result of about 4,000 hours of analysis and assessment by a team of researchers who were commissioned by the county, according to a copy of the report obtained by the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
Two people who examined that copy and have viewed the original report confirmed the copy is authentic.
The analysis is based on data and research that spans decades. It is the product of work by 16 researchers at a variety of institutions, including the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, Drake University, the U.S. Geological Survey and a federal lab in Illinois, the Argonne National Laboratory.
The report contains a detailed look at the characteristics of the region, the river contaminants and their sources, and their effects on water quality. The researchers also made about two dozen recommendations to help remedy the problems and for future research.
The analysis covered a wide variety of contaminants but focused on several tied to agriculture, including nitrate, phosphorus, fecal bacteria and toxins produced by microbes.
Nitrate problem is uniquely Iowan
Federal data show that the highest stream nitrate concentrations are “predominantly found in Iowa,” the report said.
And an analysis of intensively farmed areas in four other states showed that the high concentrations are an anomaly: “Successful agriculture can coexist with substantially lower river nitrate levels,” the report said.
Nitrate is limited by federal regulators for drinking water to prevent blue baby syndrome, a condition in which infants are deprived of oxygen. But research has tied elevated nitrate consumption to colorectal cancer, thyroid disease and other ailments in adults.
Central Iowa Water Works, the largest drinking water utility in the state that serves more than a half million people, implemented this month a first-ever lawn watering ban for the Des Moines metro. That has helped prevent the utility’s water from exceeding the federal nitrate limit.
The utility employs a robust nitrate-removal facility, but nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers — its primary water sources — have spiked in recent weeks along with summer water demand. The utility also blends the river water with other sources to reduce nitrate but was struggling to keep pace with demand.
River nitrate in Iowa has ballooned in the past two years, according to Iowa Water Quality Information System data. That follows a nearly four-year drought that ended last year and likely allowed nitrate concentrations to build in cropland soil.
The report Polk County commissioned concludes that nearly 80% of nitrate in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers is directly tied to agriculture.
Specifically, the nitrate sources are synthetic fertilizers, livestock manure and soybeans, which have a symbiotic relationship with microbes that produce nitrate.
The report said an additional, unspecified amount of nitrate contaminates the landscape when ammonia from manure goes into the atmosphere and disperses.
Nitrate is an important fertilizer for corn, but it can quickly leach into streams via surface runoff and through the vast expanses of underground tubing that drain saturated crop fields.
More than three-quarters of cropland in the upper Des Moines River watershed has the drainage tiling, the researchers found.
The state’s 12-year-old Nutrient Reduction Strategy has encouraged farmers to voluntarily reduce their stream pollution with a variety of conservation practices, often with the help of state funding. But the researchers said such efforts need to be “outcome based,” meaning those practices should be monitored to determine their effectiveness at reducing the pollution.
An example is sampling water going into and out of wetlands that are designed to reduce pollution to measure nitrate reductions.
Further, the researchers said state regulators need to improve their oversight of livestock manure disposal. They said the records related to the disposals and soil testing are not digitized and make it difficult to discern whether certain areas are getting too much manure.
It’s common for hog confinement operators in Iowa to store manure for months and then spread the animal waste on fields. The fecal material contains nitrogen and phosphorus that crops need to thrive, although not in ideal ratios, so farmers might also use commercial fertilizers.
Iowa is the nation’s top pork-producing state, with about 24 million pigs at any given time. That stresses the environment, the researchers determined.
“In parts of the watersheds, manure produced exceeds the capacity of surrounding lands to absorb it as fertilizer,” the report says. “This surplus manure becomes waste, contributing to the contamination of surface and groundwater.”
A threat to paddlers?
Excessive bacteria concentrations are the most pervasive stream impairment in the state, according to a biannual analysis that is required by the federal government.
Water is sampled for E. coli bacteria to gauge its overall risk for pathogens that can sicken people. That includes a range of ailments from skin rashes to digestive diseases.
The state routinely monitors its park beaches for bacteria and their toxins and posts swim advisories when beach water is unsafe during summer months. There is no similar program that monitors streams.
And the rivers have more bacteria, according to the researchers’ analysis of sampling data.
For example, data from warm months of the year revealed that the Raccoon River near Fleur Drive in Des Moines exceeded safe swimming concentrations in a little more than half of the samples. The concentrations exceeded safe limits for recreational activities that require less contact with river water about 15% of the time.
Fecal bacteria can come from livestock and wildlife, and numerous human wastewater treatment facilities discharge into streams.
“Microorganisms, such as viruses and bacteria, that cause diseases in humans have been found in central Iowa’s waterbodies and pose risks to aquatic recreators,” the researchers concluded. “Targeted efforts to remove human and animal pathogen sources and improve monitoring are needed to reduce risks of illness.”
What’s next?
Polk County has said it will release the report next week. A spokesperson for the county declined to comment further about its release and how much the county spent to commission the report.
The researchers condensed their work into a summary that included a list of their primary concerns:
– Livestock manure and its regulation to prevention stream contamination.
– Nitrate and phosphorus pollution from agriculture.
– Pathogens from human and animal waste.
– Algal blooms that emit toxins and are fed by fertilizers and manure.
– Urban and rural land alterations close to streams that introduce contaminants and promote flooding and erosion.
They also developed about two dozen recommendations to improve water quality. Key among them are:
– The state should provide more money to improve wastewater treatment facilities that discharge to streams.
– The state should create a public database that shows where and how much manure is applied to land, and it should also take steps to reduce the impacts of manure on water quality. That includes reducing the overapplication of manure and regulating the timing of its application to reduce stream contamination.
– Prepare for further restrictions on drinking water contamination, including a potential reduction in the allowable amount of nitrate concentrations. Research has indicated that current regulations might not be sufficient.
– Implement “outcome-based” water quality conservation practices and improve row crop production sustainability.
– Improve data collection to further evaluate contaminants.
– Improve the understanding of health risks and communicate them to the public.
“The suggested initiatives not only address immediate concerns such as nutrient pollution, microbial contamination, and chemical spills, but also pave the way for long-term sustainability and resilience of the regions’ water resources,” the researchers concluded.

The 79-year-old Vietnam War veteran who experienced post-traumatic stress disorder was pronounced dead at 6:16 p.m. 
“First I would like to thank everyone for a humane way of doing this. I want to apologize to the victim’s family,” Jordan said, adding thanks to his wife and lawyers and asking for forgiveness. 
“I love you very much,” he said as his last words. “I will see you on the other side, all of you.”
Prison officials confirmed Jordan was unconscious after injecting a sedative before following with injection of two other injection drugs – a check ordered by a federal judge who greenlighted the execution late last week. This was part of a federal lawsuit challenging the lethal injection protocol in which Jordan was a lead plaintiff. 
In January 1976, Jordan found himself desperate for money and made a plan to kidnap the family member of a bank employee and demand funds. The Vietnam War veteran had a job lined up and had moved his family to Louisiana, only to find the position was filled, according to his clemency petition. 
He spent a few days looking for work before calling the Gulfport bank where Charles Marter worked as the commercial loan agent. Jordan found the man’s address in the phonebook and went there, posing as an electric company worker to get the banker’s wife, Edwina, to open the door at gunpoint. Her toddler son was left unharmed at home. 
Jordan had Edwina drive to the DeSoto National Forest. As she tried to run away, Jordan shot in her direction, hitting her in the head. Afterwards, he called Edwina’s husband to demand $25,000 in ransom. After two failed money drops, Jordan was arrested. 
He went to trial that year and received a death sentence, only for it to be overturned multiple times due to questions about the legality of Mississippi’s death penalty law. It wasn’t until 1998 and four trials later that the sentence stuck. Then Jordan began years of appeals. 
Eric and Kevin Marter, the now-adult sons of Edwina, and her husband Charles did not travel to Parchman to witness the execution, but Edwina’s brother planned to attend with help of his family, Kevin Marter said. 
Family members left without offering comment. 
Ahead of the execution, Eric Marter said he wanted Jordan’s sentence to be carried out sooner rather than almost 50 years later after his mother’s death. 
“I don’t want him to get what he wants,” Marter, who was 11 in 1976, said about Jordan’s efforts to fight his death sentence. 
Jordan’s wife, Marsha, witnessed the execution along with his attorney Krissy Nobile of the Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel and his spiritual adviser, the Rev. Tim Murphy. Such advisers have been allowed to accompany death row inmates since a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
After the execution, Attorney General Lynn Fitch said her office has pressed for justice and was pleased to be able to provide the Marter family, friends and the community with closure. 
Leading up to the execution, Jordan petitioned the U.S Supreme Court and the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to step in. The appeals court denied a stay of execution Tuesday, and the high court denied request for a stay and writ of certiorari Wednesday afternoon – about an hour before the execution. 
Tuesday evening, Gov. Tate Reeves reviewed Jordan’s clemency petition and said he would not intervene in the execution, noting circumstances of the crime, how Jordan admitted his guilt, multiple trials and appeals. 
Frank Rosenblatt, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law, submitted the clemency petition that included letters of support from at least a dozen people, including Jordan’s wife, his sister and a pastor. 
“Richard is all of these things: a patriot; a Vietnam Veteran; a man of faith; a good son, brother, and friend; and he is an exemplary inmate who has worked to prevent this type of crime from happening ever again,” Rosenblatt wrote in Jordan’s petition. 
Organizations including Death Penalty Action and Catholic Mobilizing Network circulated petitions that called on Reeves to stop Jordan’s execution citing similar factors, including how he experienced post-traumatic stress disorder from his military service. Death Penalty Action’s petitions were delivered to the governor’s office Tuesday. 
During an afternoon news conference, Parchman Superintendent Marc McClure said Jordan seemed talkative and was telling stories about his past. He had been moved to a holding cell Sunday evening, and before the execution he visited with family, his attorneys and spiritual advisers. 
He requested chicken tenders, French fries, strawberry ice cream and a rootbeer float for his last meal, prison officials said at the earlier news conference. 
Starting in the afternoon, demonstrators gathered outside Parchman in the Delta and the Governor’s Mansion in Jackson. Death Penalty Action also hosted a virtual vigil. 
Minutes before the execution, a group gathered outside the prison entrance and offered prayers for Edwina Marter, her family, Jordan and his family. Among them were Rev. Jeff Hood, an Arkansas-based spiritual adviser who has accompanied 11 death row inmates to the execution chamber and has spoken out against the death penalty. 
Jordan’s execution is the third in the past decade, with the most recent taking place in December 2022. 
Thirty six people remain on death row in Mississippi, and the Attorney General’s Office is seeking execution dates for three – Willie Jerome Manning, Robert Simon Jr. and Charles Ray Crawford.

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A bipartisan panel of Washington state lawmakers devoted to increasing civility in politics is formally denouncing the murder of a Minnesota state lawmaker and attempted assassination of Donald Trump as violent attempts to “undermine our democratic process.”
“Disagreements should not translate to violence. Furthermore, disagreements on policy never justify political violence, against anyone,” the Joint Select Committee on Civic Health declared in a statement approved at a meeting Wednesday.
The five-paragraph statement went on to condemn this month’s slaying of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, and last year’s two failed assassination attempts on Trump as he campaigned for president, as attempts by individuals to thwart the rule of law “simply because they disagree with something.”
Rep. Dan Bronoske, D-Lakewood, a committee member, called it a very clear statement that “we can’t revert to, let me put it bluntly, targeted assassinations of anyone who’s involved in politics, whether it’s the current president of the United States or the former Speaker of the House in Minnesota.”
Meanwhile, in Congress, the U.S. House unanimously approved a resolution Wednesday condemning the June 14 attacks on Hortman and Hoffman. 
The Washington state panel is made up of a dozen members, three from each of the Democratic and Republican caucuses in the House and Senate. It is chaired by Democratic Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, who has championed bringing greater civility to politics.
Sen. Ron Muzzall, R-Oak Harbor, said the violence is a result of an inability in politics to have “constructive dialogue” and to disagree without being disagreeable.
“The truth of the matter is, we’re trying to get in at the ground level to stop all of that,” he said, referring to the broader goals of the panel.
Later, after approving the statement, lawmakers pondered their next steps. Most agreed they needed to be more proactive in talking with those of the other political party and those with different views.
“The value of that cross-party relationship building is that ultimately it makes each of us feel valued and, I think, that’s such an alien concept sometimes,” said Rep. Chris Stearns, D-Auburn.
Heck suggested bringing in a leader of the National Institute for Civil Discourse and providing the lawmakers on the committee with training, making them “ambassadors” who could “spread the gospel of engaging with respect, seeking common ground and disagreeing constructively.”
The committee’s statement mirrors the tone of one put out by the leaders of the four legislative caucuses following the Minnesota attack.
“There is no doubt that this kind of political violence stokes panic and distrust in our system of democracy. We must stand united against it, no matter our party allegiance or personal beliefs,” said House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.
On a related front, the state Public Disclosure Commission on Thursday plans to issue a statement clarifying how candidates can use their campaign and surplus account funds for expenses tied to personal safety.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/melissa-hortman-memorial.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-25 23:48:42+00:00,CT Mirror,Kennedy’s new vaccine panel alarms pediatricians with inquiries into long-settled questions,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-panel/,"Kennedy's hand-picked seven-member committee announced inquiries into some long-settled questions, including the children’s vaccine schedule.","ATLANTA (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s new vaccine advisers alarmed pediatricians Wednesday by announcing inquiries into some long-settled questions about children’s shots.
Opening the first meeting of Kennedy’s handpicked seven-member panel, committee chairman Martin Kulldorff said he was appointing a work group to evaluate the “cumulative effect” of the children’s vaccine schedule — the list of immunizations given at different times throughout childhood.
Also to be evaluated, he said, is how two other shots are administered — one that guards against liver-destroying hepatitis B and another that combines chickenpox protection with MMR, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
It was an early sign of how the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is being reshaped by Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official. He fired the entire 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.
“Vaccines are not all good or bad,” Kulldorff said. “We are learning more about vaccines over time” and must “keep up to date.”
His announcement reflected a common message of vaccine skeptics: that too many shots may overwhelm kids’ immune systems or that the ingredients may build up to cause harm. Scientists say those claims have been repeatedly investigated with no signs of concern.
Kids today are exposed to fewer antigens — immune-revving components — than their grandparents despite getting more doses, because of improved vaccine technology, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
The American Academy of Pediatrics announced Wednesday that it would continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it “no longer a credible process.”
“The narrative that current vaccine policies are flawed and need ‘fixing’ is a distortion,” said the AAP’s Dr. Sean O’Leary. “These policies have saved trillions of dollars and millions of lives.”
The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they’re available, such as at pharmacies.
After Kennedy’s abrupt dismissal of the existing expert panel, a number of the CDC’s top vaccine scientists — including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings — have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.
And shortly before Wednesday’s meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist appointed to the committee stepped down. According to the Trump administration, he withdrew during a customary review of members’ financial holdings. 
Scientists show data that COVID-19 vaccines protect pregnant women and kids
First on the committee’s agenda Wednesday were COVID-19 vaccinations. Kennedy already sidestepped the panel and announced the vaccine will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women.
Yet CDC scientists told the panel that vaccination is “the best protection” during pregnancy, and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.
COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the CDC. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 — especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC’s presentation.
The new advisers weren’t asked to vote on Kennedy’s recommendations, which raise uncertainty about how easily people will be able to access COVID-19 vaccinations this fall.
After CDC staff outlined multiple overlapping systems that continue to track the vaccines’ safety, several advisers questioned if the real-world data really is trustworthy.
Vote on RSV protections is postponed
Also Wednesday, the committee took up RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.
In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants — a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women — that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. The antibody proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.
“People need to understand what a spectacular accomplishment these results are,” said ACIP member Dr. Cody Meissner, of Dartmouth.
The committee postponed until Thursday a vote on whether to recommend another company’s newly approved antibody shot as well.
Flu shot recommendations to be debated
At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps green light the annual fall vaccination campaign.
But a vote set for Thursday also promises controversy.
The panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism.
In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders. By Wednesday afternoon, the analysis had been removed from the committee’s website.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25176558180279-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

[…],"Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill. (Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Attorney General Liz Murrill is pressing the Louisiana Supreme Court to come up with standards that she hopes will bring to an end the extended appeals of five people facing the death penalty. 
Murrill announced Wednesday she is filing writs with the state’s highest court regarding the post-conviction appeals available to persons sentenced to die. She takes issue with convicted defendants waiting decades to pursue relief, which then delays their executions.
Louisiana resumed the death penalty after a 15-year hiatus in March, when Jesse Hoffman, 46, was executed with nitrogen gas. He was convicted in the 1996 kidnapping, rape and murder of 28-year-old Mary “Molly” Elliot. She was abducted in New Orleans, then raped and killed in St. Tammany Parish.

“As I’ve said over and over, the family members of these victims deserve justice,” Murrill said in a statement. “It’s shameful they wait decades to see justice carried out. It serves no valid purpose. … I’m hopeful that the Louisiana Supreme Court will grant review to give clear direction to lower courts and we can finally move these cases forward.”
The attorney general said some district courts have acted on their own to create exceptions to a state law that already provides clear direction for post-conviction relief. State Supreme Court justices are being asked to provide uniform guidance for all courts to follow, Murrill said.
Cecelia Koppel, an attorney who represents clients on death row and directs the Center for Social Justice at Loyola University College of Law, said in a text message that the attorney general’s news release constitutes “meritless grandstanding.”
“The AG’s filings have nothing to do with speeding up cases, but instead seek to confuse, delay, and prevent these individuals from having their day in court,” Koppel said.
Murrill’s writs have been filed in the cases of Antoinette Frank, Robert Miller and Larry Roy, and more filings are planned Monday for David Henry Bowie and Marcus Reed, according to the attorney general’s office.
Frank, a former New Orleans police officer, is the only woman on death row in Louisiana. She was found guilty in the 1995 murders of her NOPD partner, Ronald Williams II, and sibling restaurant owners Ha and Cuong Vu. Rogers Lacaze, Frank’s co-conspirator in the botched armed robbery of Kim Ahn Noodles restaurant, was sentenced to life in prison.
Miller was given the death penality for the robbery, rape and fatal stabbing of his 67-year-old Baton Rouge landlord in 1997. The woman was not identified in court records.
Roy was convicted in the 1993 double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s ex-husband, Freddie Richard Jr., and her elderly aunt, Rosetta Silas, in Cheneyville. A Rapides Parish judge issued a death warrant for Roy in February, setting his execution date for March 29. But the warrant was withdrawn once District Attorney Phillip Terrell was made aware Roy had not exhausted all of his appeals.
Bowie was found guilty in East Baton Rouge Parish of strangling John Smith at Smith’s home after losing all of his money to him in a dice game, according to court records. Police said Bowie used shoelaces and the cord of a clothing iron to murder Smith.
Reed was convicted in Caddo Parish of killing brothers Jarquis, Jeremiah and Eugene Adams in 2010. Police said the fatal dispute was over an allegedly stolen video game console.
The five are among the 54 people facing execution in Louisiana.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The chaotic final days of the New Hampshire budget process may soon be over. 
On Wednesday evening, hours before the House and Senate were scheduled to meet, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she had come to an agreement with legislative leaders after a week of discord. 
The statement, released just after 6 p.m., did not specify what the agreement entails. But it suggested that some of the major issues Ayotte had raised with legislators’ previous proposal have been resolved.
“I am pleased we were able to reach a compromise that delivers a fiscally responsible and balanced budget for all of New Hampshire,” Ayotte said. “We have protected our most vulnerable, created an even brighter future for our children, and stood up for those who have made our state the safest in the nation.”
The agreement could provide an exit route yet for lawmakers who had been facing a potential budget veto and continuing resolution. But it will need to pass the House, where some Republicans have not been happy with the final budget. 
Lawmakers have until June 30 — Monday — to pass a funding agreement or the state could face a sweeping shutdown.
Here’s what you need to know ahead of Thursday’s votes. 
What is in lawmakers’ budget agreement reached last week?
While both the House and Senate passed their own versions of the budget at different points this spring, the latest version was passed last week by a “committee of conference” — a panel of House and Senate negotiators.
Most of that compromise agreement follows the version of the budget the Senate passed, and included more spending than the House’s version but less than what Ayotte wanted, according to an analysis by the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
But the negotiators added some new elements. Their budget reduced funding to the University System of New Hampshire, revised the “targeted aid” school funding formula to include a cap for large school districts, and rolled back an increase to retirement benefits for a key group of first responders championed by Ayotte. 
Those differences drove the wedge between Republicans that threatened the package’s future. Depending on the details, Wednesday evening’s agreement could remove that wedge. 
Why were the governor and Republican lawmakers at odds?
Within an hour of the committee of conference budget passing on June 12, Ayotte condemned changes it made to “Group II” benefits. Ayotte’s original budget had restored benefits that were reduced in 2011 to a group of about 1,500 police officers, corrections officers, and firefighters in order to address a funding hole in the pension fund; the committee of conference reduced funding toward that effort. 
Ayotte also raised concerns about funding cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services and a change to the school funding formula that gave Manchester public schools less money than her budget did. And she pledged a veto if those elements were not fixed. 
The veto pledge inspired a volley of harsh words between Ayotte and Senate President Sharon Carson, which aired publicly this week.
“We did not keep a promise to those law enforcement, firefighters, corrections (officers) in the system,” Ayotte said in a radio interview with Jack Heath on Monday, speaking about the 2011 changes. “We changed their retirement midstream, and I was trying to fix that. I ran on that. I thought it was important for recruitment and retention and trust.” 
Carson said Ayotte’s changes would be too expensive and could threaten the health of the retirement fund. 
“I have no idea what she’s trying to do,” Carson said on Tuesday, also speaking to Heath. “She is threatening 1.4 million people in the state of New Hampshire for the benefit of 1,550 people.” 
Under legislative rules, lawmakers are not allowed to make changes to the two budget bills, House Bill 1 and 2. Those must receive an up or down vote. But lawmakers could potentially choose a bill with a fiscal impact that had been tabled earlier in the session, remove it from the table, and attach an amendment that included the fixes agreed to by Ayotte and lawmakers Wednesday.
Such an agreement would still require the underlying budget to pass. Speaking before the compromise agreement was reached Wednesday, House Deputy Speaker Steven Smith said he would vote for the committee of conference budget. But he declined to comment about whether the rest of his Republican caucus would.
Senate Minority Leader Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, a Portsmouth Democrat, said Senate Democrats would oppose the budget, criticizing it for expanding education freedom accounts and containing too-little funding for social services.
“I think what has become clear is that the Republicans have decided to craft this budget following their own agenda,” Perkins Kwoka said in an interview. “And you know, it’s left them with few partners to work with.”
What happens if lawmakers vote down the budget agreement Thursday?
If the budget fails to pass in either the House or the Senate Thursday, there will be no funding agreement in place beginning July 1, the start of the next state fiscal year.
To prevent that outcome, Ayotte has raised the possibility of a continuing resolution should the budget fail. That would keep agencies funded at similar rates, without any of the policy changes in the current budget, while the House, Senate, and governor went back to negotiations. 
In order to pass a continuing resolution, a supermajority of two-thirds of lawmakers in each chamber would need to vote to allow a late legislative item. In the Senate, that would be 16 members; if all 16 Republicans voted in lockstep, they could do that.
But in the House, Republicans make up just about 55% of the body; depending on attendance, they would likely need Democratic votes to allow a continuing resolution to be passed. 
On Wednesday, the Executive Council formally approved Ayotte’s request for a special legislative session to be held Friday, as a contingency if lawmakers can’t pass a budget or a continuing resolution Thursday.
Smith blasted that idea, noting that many members have jobs or make plans on Fridays.
“That is the product of a rookie governor that has no clue how state government works,” Smith said. “You don’t just say on 72 hours notice ‘everyone come in on Friday.’ It’s not gonna happen.”
What might a continuing resolution look like?
In 2019, when Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed a budget passed by House and Senate Democrats, the Legislature passed a 90-day continuing resolution that kept funding even, for the most part.  That’s the arrangement that Ayotte asked for in her proposal for a special session that was approved Wednesday. 
But that’s not necessarily what might emerge this time. The Legislature could impose a longer or a shorter continuing resolution period, and lawmakers could change how much state agencies receive.
On Wednesday, Democrats suggested Republican leaders were favoring a continuing resolution proposal to fund the government at 90% of current levels, necessitating about $700 million in funding cuts. Republican lawmakers have not publicly commented on those plans.
Should that proposal come forward, Democrats would likely back a different short-term funding plan that moves forward with 100% of funding. But while lawmakers must vote with a two-thirds majority to suspend the rules, the passage of the continuing resolution itself would require only a majority vote, giving House and Senate Republicans more leeway. 
“What we’d like to see is that the CR is as close to current spending levels as revenue can support,” said Perkins Kwoka. “Because there’s a lot of programs that are really on the margin here. We’re talking about homeless shelters, we’re talking about SNAP, like there are places where they just can’t afford that cut.”
What happens if the Legislature does not pass a continuing resolution?
If no continuing resolution is passed, the state would be plunged into uncertainty. 
There is little precedent for this possibility. The state has passed its fiscal deadline without a continuing resolution just twice in modern history: in 1959 for two days, and in 1977 for 12 days, according to a 2013 paper by Joshua Elliott for the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank. 
Both instances were chaotic, according to the paper. Unlike the federal government, which can continue to maintain critical functions if Congress fails to authorize spending and initiates a shutdown, New Hampshire does not designate certain employees as “essential.” 
In both situations, lawmakers reached an agreement to give retroactive back pay to state employees in time for their paychecks. But in 1977, the state attorney general said state employees were not obligated to come to work if no spending agreement were in place, according to the paper. 
Today, there is another option for the state: emergency funding. RSA 9:13-d allows the governor to declare a civil emergency and ask the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee — a panel of House and Senate members — and the Executive Council to “authorize such expenditures, by any department or agency, as may be necessary to effectively deal with said civil emergency.”
The condition for invoking this is “such imminent peril to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this state so as to require immediate action to remedy the situation.”
The state would continue to collect taxes even if there were no spending agreement in place; without a budget, that revenue would go to the state treasury as “funds not otherwise appropriated.” An emergency declaration could theoretically allow the governor to draw from those funds, with approval from the fiscal committee and council.
But the fix would be hamfisted at best. And the deep uncertainty — including to the state’s credit rating — means the possibility is not attractive to most lawmakers. 
“We have identified some potential contingency plans, at least, to keep critical operations going if a shutdown were to happen,” said Attorney General John Formella in an interview Wednesday.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3123149-Ayotte-bail-press-conference-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)In the shadow of Three Mile Island’s iconic cooling towers, state Rep. Tom Mehaffie recalled Wednesday how his father, 50 years earlier, built a career and a life around the nuclear power plant. 
“When Constellation left and this plant shut down, a lot was missed,” Mehaffie said, noting the fortunes of businesses and the community followed that of the plant in Dauphin County. 
Now, state government and energy and tech industry leaders are betting on its rebirth as an example of Pennsylvania’s readiness to power future industries, including electricity-intensive artificial intelligence data centers. 
In a $16 billion deal between owner Constellation Energy and Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers, Three Mile Island is set to return to service as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Let’s not just open this plant, let’s open business,” Mehaffie told a tent full of Constellation Energy workers gathered to celebrate progress in the plant’s restoration, including an expedited review that cuts about a year off the project’s timeline.

About 10 miles south of Harrisburg near Middletown, Three Mile Island was the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that transfixed the world. But after that partial meltdown in one of the plant’s two reactors, the remaining Unit 1 continued safely producing electricity for another 40 years. 
In 2019, Constellation determined the facility was no longer economically viable and put plans in motion to permanently decommission the reactor. With peak energy demand, driven largely by data centers, predicted to grow up to 17% by 2035, the plant’s capacity is now in high demand.
“We made a mistake in shutting down this plant, but we’re not here to dwell on that mistake,” Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said, noting that hiring staff for the recommissioning process is ahead of schedule because many former workers returned.
The plant’s reopening will support at least 650 permanent jobs and hundreds more for building-trade workers during the recommissioning process.

Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomed the returning workers Wednesday, as he highlighted the role of nuclear power in his energy plan.
“We’re going to make sure you never have to leave again,” Shapiro said. “This is going to be one of those places where the jobs get passed down from generation to generation, where fathers talk to their daughters about the work that they did, and their daughters pick up that mantle of energy leadership right here at Crane.”
Shapiro has outlined a plan over the last two years to ensure the commonwealth remains a leader in the competitive energy market, by leveraging the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Shapiro noted his administration intervened to ensure the Crane center would be able to quickly reconnect to the regional power grid that serves Pennsylvania and all or parts of 12 other states.
PJM Interconnect, which operates the grid and ensures adequate energy supplies, has a backlog of projects waiting to be approved for connection. The company created its Reliable Resource Initiative last year to expedite the interconnection of 51 shovel-ready generating resources that include battery storage, nuclear and natural gas facilities, a PJM spokesperson said.
Shapiro, who describes himself as an “all of the above energy governor,” noted the state has four operating nuclear power plants that provide nearly one-third of its energy.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Shapiro said. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said the Crane center is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring nuclear energy online with the speed needed to match the growth of artificial intelligence. 
“It’s a unique opportunity where we can bring together a supportive community, state and a skilled workforce that is absolutely the best kept secret ingredient,” Hollis said. 
Microsoft’s agreement to purchase all of the Crane center’s 835 megawatt output demonstrates the importance of abundant energy for tech industry growth, Shapiro said.
“That is a heck of a signal of the optimism people feel about Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting that Amazon also recently announced a $20 billion investment in a data complex near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County.
PJM interconnection president and CEO Manu Asthana said as the state swelters through its first heatwave of the summer, the growth in demand for energy is apparent. PJM this week recorded an all-time peak in electricity production, nine gigawatts larger than last summer’s peak. Asthana said the difference is equal to 11 times the Crane center’s planned output.
“What we’re talking about here is not hypothetical. Our country needs this power. All of our citizens need this power just to keep their lights on, to stay warm, to stay cool,” he said, adding that ensuring power for all that plus AI is a matter of national security.
“I can’t imagine by 2030 what artificial intelligence will enable us to do and strategically, for our country, for our state, for our region, it is critical that we win that race, and the power that you produce here is critical to winning that race.”

The Senate, however, probably won’t vote on the House-written mini-budgets before legislators begin their multi-week break on Thursday. 
“I think it’s unlikely that it’s something that we will take up or have time to take up,” Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters Wednesday. 
“We haven’t had conversations as to the contents of that bill, and if the idea is you’re going to send something over the day before we’re adjourning and haven’t had conversations with us and have some agreement or understanding as to what’s in there, I don’t think that’s a serious effort to do anything,” he said. 
The legislature will recess without having passed a new comprehensive budget to begin the fiscal year that starts July 1. House and Senate Republicans have not been able to bridge their considerable differences over spending and future taxation. 
Under state law, government operations will continue into the next fiscal year without a new budget, based on previously approved spending. But new government projects and raises for teachers and state employees remain in limbo. Legislators are discussing returning to Raleigh for a few days of work each month, if they have things to do. 
Senate Democrats criticized Republicans, who control both chambers, for failing to pass a budget. Approving a budget is the General Assembly’s main job. 
Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said legislators should not be going home without passing budget.
“Literally, lives are hanging in the balance,” she said. “Agencies need funding, and yet, we’re saying, ‘Oh, we’ll just tap out,’ because the Republicans who control the House and Senate can’t sit down and talk. 
“They need to be starting to put people over politics and they’re not doing that very well right now,” she said. 
Both the Senate and House have passed stop-gap budgets intended to fund a few projects leaders determined need new or extra funding beginning July 1. House Speaker Destin Hall said Tuesday his chamber would not consider the Senate proposal. 
House Republicans countered with two measures. These are the House-written bills Berger said the Senate is unlikely to consider. 
One House-written bill included provisions approved in the House version of a comprehensive budget during the spring that would give teachers average raises of 6.4% and state employees 2.5% raises. The bill would also cut state jobs by 20% across agencies. It passed the House on Wednesday 94-19.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Agriculture policy experts in a press conference Wednesday hosted by Environmental Working Group said the massive budget reconciliation bill waiting for debate and approval in the Senate, would drive further dependency on farm safety nets, and have negative effects on small- and medium-sized producers.
The bill pulls money from the federal nutrition programs and to pay for federal farm subsidies, which the analysts argued would go to “some of the wealthiest people in farm country.
The budget reconciliation bill, commonly referred to as the “one big beautiful bill” comprises budgets across the entire government, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture which oversees farm programs, and nutrition programs. Its budget is typically determined by omnibus legislation known as the Farm Bill.

Environmental Working Group reported USDA paid $279.4 billion in commodity subsidies in 2024, and that from 1995 through 2024, the top 10% of commodity farms received nearly 80% of commodity subsidy payments. 
Joshua Sewell, a director of research and policy at Taxpayers for Common Sense, said this trend would only get worse under the reconciliation bill, as it boosts crop guarantees and references prices by 10-20%. 
Sewell said the bill further prioritizes larger commodity farmers by eliminating a current provision that restricts farmers with adjusted gross incomes of $900,000 or more from receiving certain USDA benefits. It would also increase annual payment limits from $125,000 to $155,000 per person actively engaged in the farm. Sewell and others on the press call said means the taxpayer-funded payments could go to spouses and other family members associated with a farm.
“It’s the largest, most successful operators who are going to harvest most of the benefits of these loopholes and increases,” Sewell said.
The bill also authorizes the enrollment of up to 30 million new base acres, or a farm’s crop-specific acreage eligible for certain benefits. Sewell said it “virtually guarantees annual payments for peanuts, cotton and rice” because of significant increases to those crops’ reference prices and commodity title program spending. 
Sewell said those crops, which are primarily grown in southern states, are benefiting from “southern dominated” ag committees at the Capitol and lawmakers that are “padding the pockets of their own self interests and their states.”
Sewell said senators should reject the massive spending in the bill and instead focus on tailoring safety nets and social programs “to actual need” and spending “at a level that we can afford.” 
“This bill advocates austerity and food aid, while deepening dependency on farm subsidies for, as has been mentioned, only a select few,” Sewell said. “It’s the exact opposite of what our nation and our farmers need.” 
Ferd Hoefner, former policy director at National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, said the bill would lead to more farm consolidation, economic concentration and a harder time for beginning farmers and small- to medium-sized farm operations trying to compete in the rental and real estate markets.
“It’s just going to further consolidate an already consolidated commodity industry,” Hoefner said. “It’s a waste of taxpayer resources … And it makes total fallacy out of the idea that we have a farm safety net — it is not a safety net, it is a commodity support system, virtually without limits.” 
Hoefner said there have been efforts in the past, supported by Republican lawmakers, to add stricter subsidy rules and to close loopholes in the system via Farm Bill policies.  
“I guess that was yesterday when they had a different philosophical belief,” Hoefner said. “But now, the more for the 1% the better.”
Paying for subsidies with cuts to SNAP
An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office of the bill’s agriculture provisions found the bill would dramatically decrease spending on nutritional programs, by cutting funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by about 30%,  while increasing spending for farm subsidies. 
The analysis predicts the bill’s cuts to the SNAP program will have net savings of $294.7 billion from the federal deficit over the next 10 years, but also shows the bill increases spending on farm assistance and other programs by $56.4 billion over the next 10 years. 
Sewell said the move to drastically cut from SNAP is a political “bait and switch” used in Farm Bill negotiations before. He said while farm subsidy regulations are put in effect almost immediately after a bill passes, the SNAP and nutrition provisions usually have longer implementation dates and get changed before they are implemented.  
“The siren song of slashing SNAP is repeatedly used to distract from the real goal of the ag committees, which is raiding the Treasury for politically favored crops,” Sewell said. 
According to the CBO figures, 93% of the total increase to ag spending comes from changes to the “farm safety net” or farm programs and crop insurance.
U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-AR, as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Chairman said in a June 11 statement the reconciliation bill takes a “commonsense approach” reforming SNAP and helping rural Americans.
“It’s about being good stewards of taxpayer dollars while giving folks the tools to succeed,” Boozman said. “At the same time, our farmers and ranchers are facing real challenges, which have been unaddressed for too long. This legislation delivers the risk management tools and updated farm bill safety net they need to keep producing the safest, most abundant and affordable food, fuel, and fiber in the world.”  
Senate Democrats removed language Monday from the House version of the bill that would have shifted some of the SNAP costs to individual states. 
Researchers: Reconciliation process harms the bipartisan nature of farm policy
Researchers from the University of Illinois and Ohio State University in a review of the CBO analysis said the reconciliation process, if the bill passes, would have “effectively broken the larger Farm Bill coalition that has made reauthorization possible for over 50 years.”  
“The bill violates one of the cardinal rules of Farm Bill politics by reducing food assistance to offset increases in farm assistance,” the researchers wrote. 
Sewell said lawmakers in the agriculture committees are “abusing” the reconciliation process to “pad the pocketbooks” of “politically favored farm interests.”  
“And frankly, they’re doing it at the expense of our nation’s fiscal health,” Sewell said. “We need a fiscally responsible Farm Bill. We want a fiscally responsible farm bill, but we need lawmakers to ensure both food and farm safety nets are affordable and effective.”  
The Farm Bill, which is typically reauthorized every five years, was last passed in 2018 and Congress failed to reauthorize, choosing instead to extend the 2018 policies, in 2023 and 2024. 
The budget reconciliation process is an expedited process for considering bills and policies by embedding them in a congressional budget resolution and allowing the policy to pass with a simple majority in the Senate. 
A press release from National Corn Growers Association expressed a similar frustration in wrapping farm policy into the budget reconciliation bill. 
 “NCGA’s farmer leaders have long stood on the policy position that farm bills should be comprehensive and bipartisan, and that they should include farm programs and nutrition programs,” the organization’s president Kenneth Hartman Jr. said. “Given that budget reconciliation provides only a partial pathway for select components of the farm bill, we would like return to a bipartisan, comprehensive approach to future farm bill debates.”  
The group, which represents corn growers across the country, acknowledged the bill fulfills some of the legislative priorities the it had, like expanding farm insurance support for beginning and veteran producers, doubling funding for the Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program, and “strengthening” the farmer safety net with modifications including a reference price increase for corn.  
“However, corn growers remain concerned with the imbalance of investment across various commodities and potential impacts of the changes to the (Price Loss Coverage) program,” the statement read. “The legislation unfairly expands the concept only to corn growers.” 
The budget reconciliation bill passed the House at the end of May and U.S. senators are expected to begin their “vote-a-rama” of the massive piece of legislation any day now. 
Sewell said the language in the budget reconciliation bill would not have made it through either chamber’s ag committees as a normal Farm Bill. 
“Lawmakers, thus, in our opinion, should reject this flawed Farm Bill and demand an actual Farm Bill debate outside of reconciliation,” Sewell said.

Free.,"Trump drive to defund NPR, PBS resisted by Republicans from rural states",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-drive-defund-npr-pbs-resisted-republicans-rural-states,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s request to claw back $9.4 billion in previously approved spending on foreign aid and public media ran into significant opposition Wednesday, potentially dooming its path forward in the Senate. Numerous GOP lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee, including Chairwoman Susan Collins, expressed concern at how the proposed rescissions would affect American “soft power” as well as local radio and television stations that rely on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — many in rural America.Collins, R-Maine, highlighted opposition to cutting already approved funding for CPB, which goes toward National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service and hundreds of local stations outside the nation’s larger metropolitan areas. “The vast majority of this funding, more than 70%, actually flows to local television and radio stations,” Collins said. “In Maine this funding supports everything from emergency communications in rural areas to coverage of high school basketball championships and a locally produced high school quiz show. Nationally produced television programs such as ‘Antiques Roadshow,’ ‘Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,’ are also enjoyed by many throughout our country.” Collins said she understands objections to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting providing funding to national NPR operations, given what she called its “discernibly partisan bent.”“There are, however, more targeted approaches to addressing that bias at NPR than rescinding all of the funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Collins said.Effect on AlaskaAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski appeared to signal she also opposes cancelling funding that Congress previously approved for public media and told White House budget director Russ Vought that she wanted him to understand the ramifications on her home state.“I hope you feel the urgency that I'm trying to express on behalf of people in rural Alaska, and I think in many parts of rural America, where this is their lifeline, this is where they get the updates on that landslide, this is where they get the updates on the wildfires that are coming their way,” Murkowski said.“And so how they will be able to not only get the emergency alerts that they need, but also the weather reporting to make sure that fishermen … can go out safely. So that these communities can be connected when a deadly landslide has come through,” she said.Rural radio in South Dakota, NebraskaSouth Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds pressed Vought to ensure uninterrupted federal funding to local radio stations in rural areas of his home state, even if Congress rescinds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s appropriation.“First of all, we have Native American radio stations in South Dakota. They get their funding through NPR – 90 some percent of what they use. They will not continue to exist if we don't find a way to take care of their needs,” Rounds said. “It's not a large amount of money, but would you be willing to work with us to try and find a way for these places where, literally, they're not political in nature?“These are the folks that put out the emergency notifications. They talk about community events and so forth. But they're in very, very rural areas where there simply isn’t an economy to support buying advertising on these stations.”Vought appeared to agree to work with Rounds, before saying that if Congress approves the rescissions request for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the administration wouldn’t pull back funding until the next fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1. Vought also pledged to work with Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer to ensure people in rural areas will have a way to learn about emergency alerts if the rescissions request is approved.“I am very concerned also about the emergency alerts that come to many places in Nebraska only through that rural radio,” Fischer said. “We're a state of vastness, very sparsely populated areas that don't receive cell service in many cases. It's difficult even with landlines in many areas of my state.”Reductions to AIDS reliefChairwoman Collins also said during the nearly three-hour hearing that cutting funding on certain global health programs, including the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, “would be extraordinarily ill-advised and short-sighted.”“PEPFAR has saved more than 26 million lives and enabled 7.8 million babies to be born HIV-free to mothers living with HIV,” Collins said. “This program remains a bipartisan priority of Congress. After years of commitment and stable investment the finish line is in sight. The United States has the tools to fulfill PEPFAR’s mission and get the job done while transitioning HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention to country ownership by the year 2030.”Collins argued that the Trump administration is unlikely to spend foreign aid dollars on the same “questionable projects” that were part of the Biden administration.“Unless the current administration plans to continue these controversial projects that it has identified — which I very much doubt — those projects alone cannot be used to justify the proposed rescissions,” Collins said.Just before Vought began giving his opening statement to the committee, a group of protesters in the room stood up and began to yell in an attempt to preserve PEPFAR funding. They were escorted out by U.S. Capitol Police.Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Defense spending subcommittee and former majority leader, appeared to reject some of the proposed foreign aid cuts, arguing they eroded American influence around the world.“There's plenty of absolute nonsense masquerading with American aid that shouldn't receive another bit of taxpayer funding. But the administration's attempt to root it out has been unnecessarily chaotic,” McConnell said.“In critical corners of the globe, instead of creating efficiencies, you've created vacuums for adversaries like China to fill. Responsible investments in soft power prevent conflict, preserve American influence and save countless lives at the same time. So if we're concerned about spending, and we should be, it's important to remember what wars cost.”South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, however, announced that he will vote for the rescissions package, arguing that some ways the Biden administration spent funds in the PEPFAR account deserved rebuke. ""No more preaching to me. I'm going to vote for this package. And do you know why I'm going to vote for this package? Just as a statement that PEPFAR is important but it's not beyond scrutiny,” Graham said. “That how you run the government has consequences. Don't lecture me about being mean or cruel.""How rescissions workThe Trump administration sent Congress the $9.4 billion rescissions request in early June, allowing the White House budget office to legally freeze funding for the various programs included in the proposal for 45 days while lawmakers decide whether to approve or reject it.The request called on lawmakers to zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting during the next two fiscal years, a total of $1.1 billion in previously approved spending.It proposed more than $8 billion in cuts to numerous foreign aid accounts run by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, including health programs, initiatives that promote democracy, economic development, peacekeeping activities and refugee assistance.One of the rescissions proposed lawmakers claw back $500 million of the $4 billion that Congress previously approved for “activities related to child and maternal health, HIV/ AIDS, and infectious diseases.“This proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs.”The House voted mostly along party lines in June to approve the request in full, sending it to the Senate, where it has been on the sidelines for weeks as Republicans instead work toward an agreement on the party’s “big, beautiful bill.”The rescissions bill isn’t subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so it only needs the support of 50 Republicans and Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote to become law. That, however, must happen before the 45-day clock runs out on July 18.If Senate leaders do not schedule a floor vote, or that vote does not get the necessary support, the Trump administration would have to spend the funding as previously planned. And the White House budget office would be blocked from sending up a rescissions request for the same accounts for the remainder of President Donald Trump’s time in office.Senate floor consideration also comes with unlimited amendment debate, giving senators from both parties the chance to call for votes on whether to keep or eliminate each proposed rescission.Any changes to the bill would require it to go back across the Capitol for a final vote in the House before the deadline.",,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

That was before the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion protecting abortion based on privacy in Roe vs. Wade in 1973.
“He told me the story of staying at the bedside of a woman all night watching her die as the police hounded her to get her to tell them the name of the doctor that performed her abortion,” Cahill said in written remarks. “She refused. Jim vowed after that that if abortion ever became legal, he would learn how to do it as part of his family practice training. He kept his promise.”
The late Dr. James Armstrong is the same person in the often cited Armstrong vs. State of Montana case from 1999, in which the Montana Supreme Court found abortion to be protected as part of the privacy provision in the state Constitution.
Abortion remains generally legal in Montana, but Tuesday marked the third anniversary of the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned federal privacy protections for abortion, and this week, medical providers and advocates for reproductive freedom are assessing milestone changes in medical care since Roe.
Cahill, who worked with Armstrong in Montana for years, shared a talk she gave in spring 2024 about providing abortion care in her career and her work with Armstrong, and other advocates shared reports with other anecdotes.
In her talk, Cahill said when she came to Montana to work with Dr. Armstrong in 1976, “he was so busy performing abortions that he could not take care of his regular family practice patients.
“I helped fill that need.”
Earlier, when she was in training in inner city New York, Cahill said she cared for terrified teenagers.
“I took care of 11- and 12-year-old girls in labor from rape by their fathers or brothers, or another family member, in pain and frightened, screaming for their mothers, not understanding what was happening to them,” Cahill said.
In 2002, she said, she was asked to set up a reproductive health clinic at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, a couple of years after medication abortion had become legal.
Rochester had a significant Somali refugee population, and Cahill wrote about helping one woman in particular through a medication abortion.
“Complete female circumcision is practiced in Somalia,” Cahill wrote. “It’s called infibulation. A woman’s complete labia is removed from the urethra to the anus, and the lacerated tissue is joined together with what becomes scar tissue.
“Only two very small holes are allowed to remain, one for urine and one for menstrual blood. When a Somali woman marries, a physician cuts through that scar tissue in order for her to have intercourse with her husband, and confirmation that she is a virgin.”
She said the Somali woman she saw couldn’t speak English well, but she said “he” had “put water on her” while she was sleeping, and she hadn’t had her menstrual cycle since.
Cahill said she examined the woman and was shocked to see the infibulation, and after an abdominal ultrasound, she learned the woman was six weeks pregnant.
If the woman had to continue the pregnancy, she likely would have been thrown out of her refugee community, and probably would have killed herself, Cahill said. She said surgical abortion was out of the question because of her “female circumcision,” but providers gave her a medication abortion.
“When she returned for her two-week checkup, having bled so she knew we had gotten her period going again, all she could do was hold my hands and kiss them continually. Her smile would have blinded you,” Cahill said.
This week, Montanans for Choice Take Action released several reports with more recent experiences women have had related to abortion care and restrictions. One report discusses six deaths in Texas and Georgia.
Another, called “The Rise of Pregnancy Criminalization,” said Montana hasn’t seen many cases of criminalization, but it said the state is primed “for lawmakers to promote and enforce laws to control people’s pregnancies.”
It shared a December 2024 story from Texas, citing coverage from the Los Angeles Times. It said a Texas woman spent five months in prison after having a miscarriage in a restaurant bathroom stall.
“After restaurant employees contacted authorities, the woman and fetal remains were taken to a hospital,” the report said. “The woman was detained, charged with abuse of a corpse, and remained in prison for five months before charges were dismissed. She was held in jail despite the medical examiner’s determination she had a miscarriage and the fetus was nonviable.”
It said Montana is one of 11 states with a broad “personhood provision” in legal code. The Montana Abortion Control Act of 1999 “reaffirms the tradition of the state of Montana to protect every human life, whether unborn or aged, healthy or sick,” but it also said Montana courts have generally found the law’s provisions to be unconstitutional.
Armstrong’s obituary said the clinic he and Cahill shared was destroyed by arson in the winter of 1994.
In 2014, an arsonist destroyed Cahill’s original All Families Healthcare, and four years later, Helen Weems, a nurse practitioner, opened up a new All Families Healthcare to carry on the legacy, according to the Flathead Beacon.
Published on the Buffalo Hill Funeral Home & Crematory site, Armstrong’s obituary said he worked 35 years before he retired. After Roe, it said, he incorporated “safe, legal abortion work” into his family practice in Kalispell.
“In addition, he found great satisfaction from delivering the babies of women he had himself delivered years earlier,” the obituary said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1422564336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 20:02:42.052503

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)As a June heatwave scorches through Rhode Island, labor tensions threaten to boil over in the state’s health care sector. 
Unionized nurses at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital voted Monday night to authorize a potential strike, while medical and support staff at Butler Hospital, off the job since May 15, were formally deemed locked out by the state’s labor department on Tuesday, making them eligible for unemployment benefits. 
“We are feeling strong and unstoppable — now management’s only option is to sit down with us and come to a fair and equitable agreement for everyone,” Joe Maini, a mental health worker at Butler and member of the bargaining committee, said in a Tuesday night statement. 
The United Nurses and Allied Professionals (UNAP) Local 5098 represents roughly 2,500 nurses, case managers and technical and support staff who work at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital, both in Providence. SEIU 1199NE represents the 800-strong Butler workforce which comprises the nursing, clerical, dietary, technical and mental health staff at the Providence psychiatric hospital. 
Both unions’ contracts expired on March 31, and both will have the chance to hash things out again with their employers.
On Wednesday, Butler workers and owner Care New England returned to the bargaining table after two days of bargaining last week proved fruitless. 
“Our commitment remains strong: to reach a sustainable agreement that values our workforce and supports Butler Hospital’s mission,” said Mary E. Marran, Butler’s president and COO, in a statement Wednesday. 
Marran pointed people to the ButlerInfoForYou.org website, which went live in late January ahead of contract talks, for additional information on the day’s negotiations. The site has become a public landing for management’s side of the bargaining saga. A newsfeed on the site was updated with developments from 10:15 a.m. Wednesday, noting that the hospital and union’s bargaining committees had convened. 
The negotiations come a day after the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training ruled that unionized workers at Butler can receive unemployment dating back to June 1, when the hospital informed picketing staff that it intended to find their permanent replacements. That maneuver, labor officials determined, amounted to a “constructive lockout” under state law, as the hospital cut off strikers’ wages and benefits while paying temporary laborers. 
Strike notice ‘in hand’ 
Meanwhile, over at  Brown University Health — the parent organization of Rhode Island and Hasbro hospitals — spokesperson Kelly Brennan told Rhode Island Current on Wednesday that while a new, formal negotiating session has not yet been scheduled, the two parties are scheduled to meet Monday.
“They’re resuming talks, but it’s not a negotiation session,” Brennan said.
Brennan added that a hospital statement issued Tuesday was still applicable. According to the written statement, the hospital submitted its “last, best and final offer” on June 6, one Brennan described as a “competitive and comprehensive [offer], reflecting months of good-faith bargaining.” 
The hospital offered a “market-competitive proposal” with retroactive raises, step and COLA pay adjustments, and benefits totaling $50 million spread across the next three years. The union voted to reject that offer.
UNAP and Brown Health have been negotiating since January, ahead of their seven-year contract’s expiration. All in all, there have been 26 negotiating sessions with no conclusion.

Unions are required to give 10 days notice for a strike.  
According to Brennan, if notice is given, “Rhode Island Hospital is fully prepared to activate its comprehensive strike plan” which could cost the hospital “tens of millions of dollars in temporary staffing to ensure continuity of care.”
About a dozen UNAP members gathered Tuesday afternoon to host a press conference near Rhode Island Hospital to challenge their employer’s claims. Most of the workers huddled underneath the shade of a tree to avoid the oppressive afternoon heat. Frank Sims, the UNAP 5098 president and a worker at the hospital, took to the microphone to call the contract “unacceptable.”
“Management’s last offer was insulting and does nothing to improve the recruiting, retention or employee morale,” Sims said. “The members of this union are tired of seeing their coworkers, new and experienced, leave for greener pastures in neighboring states where the pay and benefits are better and healthcare workers are treated with the dignity they deserve.”
Lynn Blais, the president of the entire UNAP organization, said the strike notice was “in hand” and that the union and Monday’s meeting  had “probably the largest turnout we’ve ever had for a membership vote.”  
What did Blais think about Brennan’s statement that the hospital would spend millions in temporary labor?
“We would tell them to take the money that they want to budget for scabs…and invest it in the workers today,” Blais said.
Health care costs a stumbling block 
Prominent in both labor disputes is employer-sponsored health coverage. The UNAP workers say Brown Health’s most recent contract proposal would shift $1 million in health insurance costs onto union members at the cost of more than $1,000 per insured worker.
Butler workers lost their health insurance on May 31 and have cited lackluster health benefits in several iterations of management’s proposals. Care New England appeared ready to address this at Wednesday’s negotiations, and posted to its website that it was unveiling a new health care package that adds a second $0 premium plan for full-time employees and further reduces premiums across tiers. Otherwise, the new offer is the same as the package submitted June 5, that raised minimum wages to at least $18.03 for all employees and created a $100,000 support fund for workers injured by on-the-job violence.
Butler striking workers and management return to bargaining table

A 2024 brief by the Rhode Island Business Group on Health (RIBGH) attributed employers’ rising health insurance expenditures to growing hospital costs, which now make up nearly half the total spending for commercial insurance plans.
Al Charbonneau, executive director of RIGBH, said in a Wednesday afternoon phone call that he’s no champion of unions. After all, he previously spent time on the other side of the equation as a hospital manager. 
“What strikes me is when I look at hospital expenses, I don’t see the money going into labor, frankly,” Charbonneau said. “I’m a management person, but…you know, try to run a hospital without a nurse. Just try to do it.”
Things have changed over the past two decades, Charbonneau said, with one tide in particular carrying the sea change: The rise of hospital systems, which tend to incur substantial development costs, and ultimately raise prices with minimal impact on quality of care. Salaries also seem to lack “strategic thinking,” Charbonneau said, “because it’s all going up about 3% a year over the last 10 to 12 years.” 
“Then the hospitals go to the General Assembly and say, ‘We need more nurses. We need to pay our nurses more.’ And the question is, where did the money go?’”",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_8323-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 19:08:34.847561

A tiny independent school, beloved by parents and students, struggled with finances despite recent fundraising efforts.

This story by Robert F. Smith, with additional reporting by Jeff Potter was first published in The Commons on June 24.
WESTMINSTER — After completing its 25th school year of operation, the Compass School recently and abruptly announced that it will be permanently closing.
Though it had planned on operating for at least another year, financial difficulties the school had been facing for some time proved worse than expected.
Those lingering problems, combined with what its board president termed a “domino effect” of circumstances, prompted the school’s board of directors to unanimously vote to close the school immediately.
Debts of $250,000, declining enrollment, and the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic were cited as the combination of reasons for the board’s decision.
Compass was founded in 1999 with the purpose of providing the region with an alternative to traditional education, particularly for middle-school-age children. As the years progressed, it added more grades until it served students in grades 7 to 12.
In an email sent June 9, Board Chair Christine Armiger and Co-heads of School Gabe Allen-Fahlander and Louise Hodson told families that “on Friday, June 6th, we learned that a key piece of our financial plan for next year has fallen through. Without it, there is no way for us to open the school for the 2025-26 school year.”
With “a heavy heart and deepest admiration for everyone at the Compass School,” Armiger, Allen-Fahlander and Hodson informed the community of the board’s decision.
The letter was sent out after the school year had wrapped up, with staff and students expecting the school to be operating for at least another full year ahead.
The building, at 7892 US-5, has been closed up since, and the school’s website has been scrubbed of almost all content and states, “Founded in 1999 by dedicated educators and parents, Compass has closed its doors after 26 years of innovative education.”
A domino effect
In its letter, the directors explained that throughout the last three months the board, staff and community came together and “worked incredibly hard to save the school, raising extensive funds and expanding board membership, as well as bringing in outside expertise as consultants and advisors.”
But the board said that “ultimately, these efforts could not overcome a financial deficit that made it impossible to offer another year of programming.”
Armiger spoke to The Commons on June 23, prefacing her remarks with her intention of being “respectful to parents, teachers, students, and alumni who worked overtime to do what they could to propel us forward” in their attempts to keep the Compass School alive.
She said the school had been struggling with a number of forces, including an overall decline of the population of school-age children of more than 25% between 2000 and today, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
In its annual 990 form filed with the IRS — analogous to a tax return for the nonprofit world — the school posted healthy yearly surpluses from 2011 to 2015. Starting in 2016, the filings show a number of years of losses even before the pandemic hit in 2020.
Meanwhile, the school “that thrived on its smallness” and not long ago had more than 70 students ended with approximately 50 students in its final year.
The school went public with its financial problems this past winter, sparking a series of fundraising efforts that raised at least $68,000 toward the $250,000 budget deficit, the Brattleboro Reformer reported in April.
Armiger said that between those fundraising successes and the school community envisioning a smaller and more sustainable program, things were looking up. In April, the school announced on an Instagram post that it would open for the next year.
Then came what she called “the domino effect.”
First, a new “wonderful and significant” donor, excited for a long-term relationship with the school, could not commit to a significant donation immediately, Armiger said.
“We still felt confident that a bridge loan we applied for could still get us through [in conjunction with] another outreach campaign to bring in support we’d need until the other money came in,” she said.
But then the bridge loan was denied, which Armiger called “the nail in the coffin.”
Looking back, she said that the overall environment for independent schools is “another tough reality.”
Armiger, a science instructor and director of environmental programs and sustainability at Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, said that “another tough reality is that it’s hard even for schools with significant endowments.” As a young school, Compass never had the opportunity to build wealth and resources, and the community itself is not a place where “you can wrangle up a few hundred thousand in a pinch.”
Instead, she said, the school “absolutely overextended itself with financial aid.”
Two other factors stressed the vulnerable school, Armiger noted. The first was the “declining ability for private-pay families to pay tuition” based on the skyrocketing costs that have hit every family budget hard in the years since the pandemic.
The second was the school’s reliance on tuition funds for students from towns that offer that option. Presuming that Gov. Phil Scott will sign into law the state education reform bill, passed by both the House and the Senate, new reforms and restrictions will curtail which towns can offer that option to its youth.
Heavy hearts
Compass held what has become its last graduation ceremony, for 14 students, on May 31. It ended the year with approximately 50 students and 12 staff.
The school, once described on its website as “the perfect place to get inspired, take risks, learn from mistakes, get invested in your education, and be surprised by what you can do,” prided itself in “developing strong thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and collaborative workers with the ability to adapt to changing conditions.”
Westminster resident Charmion Handy, parent of a former Compass student, said the announcement was unexpected and came as a shock and that she was “saddened to hear of its closing.”
“Compass School taught our children how to be lifelong learners,” she said. “They provided a learning environment that was rich and diverse, balancing traditional studies with hands-on opportunities to explore topics of interest.”
Rick Gordon, one of the school’s founders, called Compass “a model for what is possible in education.”
Gordon served as the school’s longtime director and retired in 2020 after more than 20 years there.
“We were honored to attract extraordinary educators who had undying belief in every child and unparalleled dedication to supporting every student in their academic and personal growth,” he said. “It was the highlight of my career to be part of this incredible community.”
Molly Bruce Patterson, a board member, alum, and Bellows Falls resident, said, “It is hard to express how much Compass has shaped my life since graduating in 2004.”
Gus Shepard, an executive board member and a member of the first graduating class, said that “students often share how their lives were transformed by their Compass experience, and parents frequently express that Compass saved their child.”
Handy agreed. “Whether it was through Community Service Week, Project Week, or the various class trips throughout New England and abroad, students were exposed to a world beyond,” she said.
She noted that in addition to educating the students, Compass “had a unique way of including parents and families, by encouraging community service at the school, sharing knowledge to students in the classroom or at after-school activities or for the many parent-focused workshops.”
“I am so incredibly grateful that my children experienced this educational opportunity and have grown to be good people as a result of their Compass School experience,” she said.
Shepard said that many students who faced challenges in more traditional educational settings went on to achieve great success in college, careers, and communities. “Unfortunately, demographic shifts in the region led to a significant decline in student enrollment compared to when the school began,” he added.
Hodson, the co-head of school, was also the longest-serving teacher at Compass.
“I am heartbroken to close our doors,” she said. “I am saddened for the future students who will miss the opportunity to participate in our community. Thank you to all the teachers, students, and families who have worked to keep our doors open. We take immense pride in the educational experiences we have provided to so many learners.”
What’s next
Windham Northeast Supervisory Union Superintendent Andy Haas said that the closing of Compass “came as a shock to us.”
“Compass has been part of our community for many years, meeting the needs of students and families,” he said. “WNESU has enjoyed our relationship with Compass.”
He said that the district looks forward “to welcoming students to Bellows Falls Middle School and Bellows Falls Union High School. We have been communicating with families since the announcement and will continue to ensure the transition to our schools is as seamless as possible.”
Haas said that approximately 22 WNESU families are affected by the closing. Two of the students are middle schoolers, the rest are high schoolers.
Haas said he knows of three who have requested to attend Green Mountain Union High School in Chester, or Leland & Gray Union High School in Townshend.
As for BFUHS, Haas said that “we have already registered several students.”
As to what will happen with the school building and its 8.8-acre parcel if the school’s corporate entity dissolves, it must turn over remaining assets to another nonprofit once it has resolved its financial obligations.
The school’s bylaws stipulate that its assets must be directed towards meaningful educational endeavors. According to data from the town listers, the total assessed value of the land and building is $2,181,700.
A June 9 news release from the Compass board noted that, “proceeds from the sale of the building are expected to establish a foundation to support personalized learning and continue the kinds of educational experiences that have defined [the school].”
That degree of finality is tough for those who loved the school and worked to keep it alive.
“I love my work on the board at the Compass School — a school that’s so deeply embedded in the community,” Armiger said. “I love its origin story and think that against our better judgment we kept it going as long as we possibly could for the sheer love of it.”
Faculty, she said, “loved working at that school and couldn’t imagine working at another school because they loved working there so much.”
“I think there are still some of us who hold out hope or dream that a sustainable version of school could emerge,” Armiger said. “But it’s hard to imagine right now in this moment.”

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on June 24.
Overshadowed by the recent detention of two migrant workers in Vermont, the annual mobile Mexican Consulate event at Christ Church in Montpelier brought at least 132 people from around Vermont to the capital city on Saturday, June 21. Notably fewer people attended compared to last year, when over 200 attended.
Organizers and participants alike were palpably aware of the June 14 detentions of the two members of Migrant Justice (a sponsor of the event). In prior years, the event would spill into the Christ Church courtyard, with food, tables for eating and socializing, music, outdoor health checks and up to three entrances into the building. This year — because of heightened awareness of raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Border Patrol that have increased under the Trump administration — there was only one entrance and exit, according to Deb Jerard, a Christ Church co-warden. 
Peppy fiddle notes rang from the courtyard, thanks to the Vermont Fiddle Orchestra and Make Music Day, a local event happening at the same time, but organizers decided to keep everything else inside the building.
Asked if the church felt like it needed extra precautions this year, Gerard responded “Yeah, we were more concerned, definitely.”
Nonetheless, Gerard said, the Boston-based Mexican consulate, which holds mobile events throughout New England, “kept reassuring us that they have not had any problem with these events.”
Security was also on hand, according to a staff member from Migrant Justice, and there were a couple of incidents that made people jumpy. One volunteer at the event told another that someone had been in the building “taking notes” — then realized at least two reporters had stopped by. Another told a Mexican consulate worker about a “suspicious vehicle” — a large black SUV with dark tinted windows — that had been idling behind the church for 30 minutes. (It turned out not to be an issue).
One participant, Olga (who asked that The Bridge not use her last name), noted that the risk of an ICE detention is on everyone’s minds right now.
“Given the current political situation, there’s nowhere that’s safe, whether we’re at home in bed, or here at the consulate, there’s always the risk of detention,” Olga said, through a translator.
Olga said she came to the event to update some documents, and while there, also got a blood glucose test from Bridges to Health, a migrant health program through the University of Vermont Extension.
“I also come in to help share information about Migrant Justice and knowing your rights with my communities,” she said.

Bridges to Health had three medical providers on hand, and was joined by the People’s Health and Wellness Clinic (a free clinic in Barre), which offered vaccinations, noted Naomi Wolcott-MacCausland, who oversees migrant health programs with Bridges to Health.
“When the consulate comes to this area, I coordinate the health there, which is an opportunity for people to get health screenings, consult with a doctor, or get vaccines while they’re waiting for their documents with the Mexican government to get processed,” Wolcott-MacCausland said. The program also helps people coordinate with their local health clinics and figure out health insurance, she noted.
After talking about her experience with the mobile Mexican consulate, Olga asked if she could say one more thing.
“I wanted to mention that as a community right now, we’re fighting against the detention of two of our leaders, Jose “Nacho” Ignacio De La Cruz and Heidi Perez, a father and stepdaughter. That’s something I want to make sure everyone’s aware of. And for my part, I’m a mother and I’m putting myself in the position of Heidi’s mother and Nacho’s partner who’s still here, free, but crying and heartbroken. It’s devastating.”
Olga said she is asking for community support to help free them and suggested visiting migrantjustice.net for updates and more information.

(Photo Courtesy Gila NF)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ announcement June 23 in Santa Fe that her agency is seeking to repeal the “Roadless Rule” has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups in New Mexico and across the country. 
Nixing the rule means 58 million acres of land across the country could lose protections from road construction and logging the areas have enjoyed since 2001. Environmental groups, including New Mexico Wild, have said stripping the protections could spell the end of some of the last wild places in America. 
“This will cause immense damage to public lands, drinking water, and wildlife, and also threatens to increase wildfires,” a Climate Forests Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups, said in a joint statement Tuesday. 
A news release from New Mexico Wild notes that the Forest Service received 1.6 million comments in favor of the “Roadless Rule” when the agency was considering it more than 20 years ago, “more comments than any other rule in the nation’s history.”
About 1.6 million acres, or about 2,500 square miles, in national forests in New Mexico are currently protected.

A Source New Mexico review of Forest Service data shows that the Gila National Forest, one of five national forests in the state, could lose the most protected land to roads and other development. 
More than 730,000 acres of the Gila’s 3.3 million acres of land is currently protected, though about 45,000 acres of it does allow roads to be built or rebuilt under certain circumstances, according to a Source New Mexico review. The Gila National Wilderness recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. 
Rollins, in her speech Monday at the Western Governors’ Association meeting, touted the repeal as a way to protect forests against wildfires and also to put more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests. 
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests,” she said.
Environmental groups have pushed back against Rollins’ claim that the repeal could reduce the risk of wildfire. New Mexico Wild’s statement Tuesday said “human-caused fire ignitions are far more likely in roaded landscapes.”
Since Monday, the USDA website about the “Roadless Rule” has now been updated with next steps about what repeal will look like, including an environmental analysis; consultation with tribes and affected states; and compliance with the Endangered Species Act. 
“More information will be released as the rescission process gets underway,” the website says.

Vermont State Police have identified the man who drowned Tuesday in Lake Champlain as Darren Kemp, who was originally from South Africa. 
Kemp, 30, lived and worked at Basin Harbor Club, which spans parts of Vergennes and Ferrisburgh. On Tuesday, Kemp swam in Lake Champlain near the club, but did not emerge from under the waters, according to a police press release. 
State Police received word of the drowning incident around 9:25 p.m. and reported to the scene along with the Vergennes Area Rescue Squad and the Addison, Charlotte, Ferrisburgh and Vergennes fire departments. First responders carried Kemp from the waters to shore, but efforts to revive him were not successful.

Kemp was pronounced dead at approximately 10:10 p.m, and the Chief’s Examiner’s Office in Burlington will perform an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death. There is no evidence the drowning death is suspicious, according to police.
This is the second reported drowning in the state in the span of a week, after an 18-year old Burlington High School student Eljak Menjwak died in the New Haven River in Bristol on Saturday. 
Like other states in the East, Vermont has been hit with extreme heat, humidity and thunderstorms this past week, leading many people to seek relief in or near bodies of water.
The state’s Department of Health has identified more than 400 cooling centers where Vermonters can seek shelter from heat waves this summer.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-25 22:23:15+00:00,CT Mirror,"PURA chair admits to deleting texts, fueling criticism of top utilities regulator",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/marissa-gillett-pura-deleted-text-messages/,The messages are being sought by gas utilities in a lawsuit. Gillett said texts on her personal phone were set to delete after 30 days.,"Criticism of Connecticut’s top utilities regulator ratcheted up again this week, after it was revealed in court that she had deleted text messages being sought by a pair of gas utilities in an ongoing lawsuit challenging last year’s cuts to gas rates.
During a hearing in that case Monday, an attorney for Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chair Marissa Gillett said text messages on the chair’s personal cell phone were set to automatically delete after 30 days. Among the messages that were deleted, the attorney said, were texts with a state lawmaker who had penned an op-ed in the Connecticut Mirror harshly criticizing the state’s two largest utilities: Eversource and United Illuminating’s parent company, Avangrid.
The admission was first reported by the Hartford Courant, and immediately prompted a fresh round of rebukes from lawmakers. 
“I think this was a part of a systematic process of not being transparent,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, who called for Gillett to resign. “It speaks to a lot of the problems that have come out of that agency.”
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he would like the legislature’s newly-created Government Oversight Committee to look into the matter. “I think we need more answers,” he said.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, expressed exasperation over the controversy, saying that he’s advised lawmakers in the past to avoid discussing public business on their personal devices. 
“This is the danger when you do this, you don’t have the same software and functions,” to ensure messages are properly archived, Ritter said. “I would be concerned if it were anybody, not just her.”
Representatives for Gillett and PURA did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday. 
Gillett, who has led PURA since 2019, survived a tough renomination battle earlier this year in which many Republicans questioned her leadership style as well as the state’s persistently high cost of electricity. Lawmakers ultimately voted to confirm her appointment to a second, four-year term at PURA, though her tenure as chair is separately due to expire next month.
Gov. Ned Lamont has yet to say whether or not he will reappoint Gillett as chair, though he defended her Wednesday when asked about calls for her to step aside.
“It’s a little ironic that the person who is most likely to hold Eversource accountable, which is Marissa Gillett, and do everything she can to protect the consumer in terms of pricing, is the same person that they want out of there and replaced with another retired legislator,” Lamont said.
When asked specifically if he had concerns about the deletion of her text messages, however, Lamont said he was not familiar with the controversy — or auto-deletion technology, in general.
“If we think there should be no auto-deletes allowed on any, you know, government phone, we should make that a rule,” he said. 
Government employees are required to abide by retention schedules for public records set for each state agency, including work-related communications on their public and private cell phones.
“We generally discourage the use of personal devices, because it can get complicated, switching back and forth,” said Colleen Murphy, the executive director of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Coalition.
The op-ed in question has become a key point of contention in a lawsuit by two of Avangrid’s gas utilities challenging the regulator’s decision last year to cut gas rates. The piece, titled “Don’t believe the utility company propaganda,” was published on Dec. 19 under the names of the two co-chairs of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee: state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport.
In February, the Courant published text messages from Steinberg obtained through a public records requests in which Gillett promised to send him a “draft” several days before the op-ed was published. Steinberg responded that he “should be available to review release/op Ed.”
Soon after that story was published, Avangrid’s attorneys sought additional information about the drafting of the op-ed through legal discovery, arguing that its authors showed a clear bias against the company. If Gillett played a role in drafting the piece, they argued, she should have been prevented from participating in the case that ultimately resulted in PURA slashing the utility’s gas rates by $35 million.
Both Gillett and the two lawmakers have repeatedly denied that she had a role in writing the piece. Attorneys for PURA have argued that word “draft” in her message referred to a piece of proposed legislation.
“I have said emphatically I never discussed any aspect of this editorial with her ever, other than to say after the fact that we got a good response,” Steinberg said Wednesday.
Asked whether, in hindsight, the preservation of Gillett’s texts would have avoided such a dispute, however, Steinberg said he agreed. “A lot of these things that are being alleged, at the time seemed pretty innocuous,” he said.
In a series of increasingly accusatory legal filings over the last several months, attorneys for the utilities and PURA have fought over the release of additional records, including the “draft” referenced in Gillett’s text. 
In one brief filed on June 6, Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander, who is representing PURA, said both Gillett and her chief of staff, Theresa Govert, had reviewed their work and personal phones and not found any relevant messages concerning the op-ed. 
When pressed about the matter by Superior Court Judge Matthew Budzik on Monday, however, Hollander conceded that Gillett’s messages with Steinberg had been subject to the auto-delete function on her phone, and that efforts to restore them from backup were unsuccessful.
“With respect to this conversation that took place on two different days, on that personal cell phone, those are not retrievable,” Hollander said, according to an official transcript of the hearing. 
On Wednesday, Budzik issued an order allowing Avangrid’s attorneys to depose both Gillett and Govert within the next two weeks to determine the extent to which either “may have reviewed and/or commented upon the December 19th op-ed.” Attorneys will also be allowed to ask about the deletion of any documents subject to the judge’s previous discovery order. 
A copy of the judge’s order, which was not immediately available online Wednesday, was provided to the Connecticut Mirror by Avangrid.
Representatives for both Avangrid and the attorney general’s office declined to comment publicly on the case Wednesday, instead referring to the court record.
“We need to get to the bottom of this,” John Cerreta, an attorney for the utilities, said during the hearing Monday, according to the transcript. “We need to find out whether these responsive documents exist, what they are, whether they’ve been deleted, and whether they can be recovered.”
The escalation of the dispute between PURA and Avangrid came this week as Wall Street credit-rating agency Moody’s downgraded the rating of the state’s largest electric utility, Eversource, citing Connecticut’s “least credit supportive utility regulatory environment in the US.”
Executives at both Eversource and Avangrid have repeatedly complained that regulators’ decisions in Connecticut have stifled their ability to access credit necessary to make investments in energy and gas infrastructure across the state.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee is scaling back his controversial proposal to sell off public land around the West.
According to a new version of the bill obtained Wednesday by Politico, Lee still intends on selling off parcels of public land — but there are several new guardrails in place, after the original proposal received widespread backlash and was deemed in violation of Senate rules by the body’s parliamentarian. 
Notably, U.S. Forest Service land is no longer eligible for sale, and the bill language states that only Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, land will be disposed of. 
The BLM will be required to dispose of between 0.25% to 0.5% of its land — previously the requirement was for 0.5% to 0.75% of land. And the bill states only parcels within five miles of the “border of a population center” will be eligible. 
That means the BLM would be required to sell between 612,500 to 1.225 million acres in 11 Western states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Montana remains exempt.

Here are other major takeaways from Lee’s latest proposal: 

Nominating a parcel for sale would require a description of how development of the land would “address local housing needs (including housing supply and affordability) or any infrastructure and amenities to support local needs associated with housing.” 
The bill also states that any land that’s sold “shall be used solely for the development of housing or to address any infrastructure and amenities to support local needs associated with housing.”
The secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior must consult the governor of the state where the land is located, and any local governments or tribes, “regarding the suitability of the area for residential development.” 
Land that’s nominated by state or local governments that is adjacent to “developed areas,” has access to existing infrastructure and is “suitable for residential housing” would be prioritized. 
Sales that reduce “checkerboard” landscapes — the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa — and federal land that’s isolated and difficult to manage would also be prioritized. 
The land would be disposed of by “competitive sale, auction, or other methods” to ensure it’s sold at fair market value. 
Land that has a grazing permit or “valid existing right,” which includes an oil and gas lease or mining claim, is exempt. 
According to the bill, 5% of the proceeds from any sale will go toward local governments. 
An additional 10% of proceeds will go toward “hunting, fishing, and recreational amenities” and the deferred maintenance backlog for BLM land in the state where the land is sold.
The bill allocates $5 million to hire appraisers, solicit nominations for land sale and other related duties. 
Anything “federally protected” is excluded — that includes a national monument, park, conservation area, wilderness preserve, seashore, historic site, memorial, historic park or recreation area. 
The bill expires in 2034.  

Lee’s original proposal received widespread criticism from Democrat and Republican politicians, as well as environmental, veteran, hunting and fishing groups. 
It would have required the U.S. Forest Service and BLM to sell between 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres in the West, and the bill’s definitions meant that more than 258 million acres would be eligible for sale, including 18.7 million acres in Utah.



Let us know what you think...


 


But on Monday, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough said Lee’s proposal violated Senate reconciliation rules, meaning it would require more than a simple majority to pass. That same day, Lee signaled he would make changes to the bill. 
“I’m still listening,” he wrote on social media Tuesday. “I’m working closely with the Trump administration to ensure that any federal land sales serve the American people — not foreign governments, not the Chinese Communist Party, and not massive corporations looking to pad their portfolios. This land must go to American families. Period.” 
But environmental and public land advocacy groups are still doubtful. The group Center for Western Priorities identified a number of recreation spots that would still be eligible for sale under Lee’s proposal — among them are the Sand Flats Recreation Area, the Portal Trail, parts of Poison Spider Mesa, Millcreek Canyon and the Moab Rim Trail, all located near Moab. 
“Sen. Lee’s legislation is still the largest sell-off of public lands in U.S. history,” said Laiken Jordahl with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement Wednesday. “It still leaves millions of acres of cherished public lands at risk of being lost forever to the ultra rich and destructive sprawl developments, including near Arches and Zion national parks. It’s still overwhelmingly out of step with the values of Americans everywhere.”

The Trump administration withheld billions of dollars in funding allocated by Congress to build out electric vehicle chargers in many states.

Federal funds to build out electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Vermont are still on hold after a Tuesday federal court ruling opened up funds for other states. 
In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Washington partially issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Trump administration to release funds that it withheld this winter. But the judge denied Vermont’s claims, deciding the state didn’t prove it would face “irreparable harm” if funds were left on hold. 
Some clean energy advocates in Vermont think the hold is harmful. 
“Americans in rural parts of the country — blue, red and purple — are worse off because these funds are not out the door,” said Ben Edgerly Walsh, Climate and Energy Program director for Vermont Public Interest Research Group. 
And now the state will have to keep fighting if it wants change.

“The Attorney General is very disappointed with this outcome and will continue to explore legal options to protect Vermont’s interests and funding in this case,” said Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, over email. 
In February, the Trump administration, through the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, withheld billions of dollars allocated by Congress to build out electric vehicle chargers in many states. In response, Vermont filed the lawsuit, along with 15 other states and Washington, D.C., in May against those two offices.
In the suit, the states bit back, claiming that both entities overstepped their authority by trying to interfere with funding that was designated by Congress. 
Before funds were put on hold, Vermont was set to receive $16.7 million in federal funding for charging projects across three years, according to court documents. 
Based on that award, the state originally planned to pay a total of $9.3 million to different contractors who would build out charging stations around the state. Now, without federal funding, “Vermont cannot fund all of the projects,” it claimed in court. 
“It’s absurd that the Trump administration is tying the law into knots in order to keep this money out of Vermont and these other states,” Walsh said. 
While Vermont has more charging ports per-capita than most states, it still has a long way to come, Walsh said. When more charging stations are publicly available, it’s more viable for renters and low-income Vermonters to own electric vehicles, he said. 
In court, Vermont, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., didn’t submit documents proving federal approval and reapproval of their state plans, according to court documents. The three were the only jurisdictions denied funding in the judge’s ruling.

Utah senator trims plans, calling targeted BLM land “unused,” “mismanaged” and “only appropriate for housing.”
The post As Wyoming protests, public land sell-off ‘just getting started’ appeared first on WyoFile .","In the face of a backlash, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee has revamped his public land sell-off measure to target only Bureau of Land Management holdings while also declaring, “we’re just getting started.”
A reconciliation budget proposal revised by Lee’s Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee targets BLM land within five miles of undefined “population centers.” It puts checkerboard BLM holdings back on a priority list for his “mandatory disposal” measure and takes lands under permit for grazing off the auction block.
The revision would shift 15% of revenue to local governments and conservation. The bill would appropriate $5 million to carry out the mandatory sales, which are designed to be offered within 60 days of passage and regularly thereafter.
Lee has not said or mapped how much land must be sold, ostensibly for affordable housing.
“Folks like Elon Musk …  will make money off the public lands that should belong to the American people. That’s horseshit.” Martin Heinrich
“We haven’t put out maps because there are a whole bunch of criteria established by the legislation, and those criteria are very difficult to reduce to a map,” Lee told conservative radio host Charlie Kirk in a video posted on X.
But opposition to Lee’s measure comes from “all walks of life,” said Land Tawney, former president and CEO of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. That includes “Democrats, Independents, Republicans, hunters, anglers, bird watchers, kayakers, ranchers [and] loggers,” he said Wednesday at a roundtable hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.
Heinrich excoriated Lee’s measure.
“Eighty-five percent of the money from these sales would go to pay for tax cuts,” Heinrich said. “That means that folks like Elon Musk, who already own[s] 4,400 acres of land in Texas [worth] some $3.4 billion, will make money off the public lands that should belong to the American people.
“That’s horseshit,” Heinrich said.
A spectrum of opposition
Lee’s plan to include U.S. Forest Service land in the “mandatory disposal” provision flunked a parliamentarian’s rules test that limits reconciliation budget measures to relevant budget matters. The revised provision must undergo the same scrutiny, Democrats say.
Heinrich poo-pooed the notion that Lee’s measure would result in affordable housing. “An out-of-town billionaire can show up, buy a 100-acre parcel and throw a trophy home on it,” he said.
Powell resident Mike Tracy criticized Lee’s linking of public land and affordable housing.
“If you put those two concepts in the same sentence,” he said of Lee’s proposal, “it makes them seem somehow related, maybe even somehow causal.
“It makes people not feel comfortable speaking out against it because who wants to be against affordable housing?” he said at the roundtable. “I don’t think it’s proper to say that they’re related.”
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, had a message for Lee. “Don’t come into our states and dictate what should be done.
“It is clear they’re trying to sell this public land to pay for this reconciliation package, which gives tax cuts to billionaires,” she said. “That’s what this is about.”
“Right now, we are pissed,” said hunting advocate Tawney, who represented American Hunters and Anglers. “They want to defund, dismantle and then divest,” he said of President Donald Trump’s administration.
Native American tribes are upset, too, said Hilary Tompkins, former solicitor for the Department of the Interior.
“The Southern Ute Indian tribe in southwestern Colorado is concerned because they have off-reservation hunting and fishing rights on an area that includes BLM lands,” she said. “They have not heard from anyone who is advocating for this proposal about the impact on those off-reservation treaty rights.”
Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon sees opportunities to resolve the state’s challenges with the checkerboard land ownership pattern along the Union Pacific Railroad line, said Jess Johnson, government affairs director with the Wyoming Wildlife Federation.
“I want to figure out how we do this in a Wyoming way,” she said of the checkerboard conundrum. “This budget reconciliation is not it.”
Not sensitive lands?
Wyoming’s U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, Republicans who continue to support Trump’s agenda, did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment about the backlash. “It is clear that our congressional delegation isn’t in it for Wyoming,” the state’s Democratic Party chair, Lucas Fralick, said in a statement.
Lee, however, explained some of his thinking.
“I’m working closely with the Trump administration to ensure that any federal land sales serve the American people — not foreign governments, not the Chinese Communist Party, and not massive corporations looking to pad their portfolios,” he said in a post. “This land must go to American families. Period.”
In the radio interview, he said opposition was ginned up.
“The left is working overtime to dupe conservatives about my federal land sale bill,” he said. “This is just basically surplus land that’s suitable for housing because it’s right next to where people live.”
He characterized critics as having an agenda. “What I’ve heard is that people on the left generally want people moving from rural areas into urban areas, more suburban areas and from single-family housing into multi-family housing, higher density housing units,” he said. “They believe that that’s good for them, perhaps for Mother Earth, or whatever their reasons might be.
“These are not sensitive lands,” Lee said of the targeted BLM parcels. “They are not lands that are out there, that are part of an environment that’s appropriate for hunting, for hiking, for fishing, etc.”
Wyoming’s Johnson challenged that notion at the roundtable. She said she arrowed her first mule deer on public land near town.
“I was on this amazing parcel of public land — tiny,” she said. “It’s little. It’s one to three miles from Lander. It’s BLM. It’s really nothing special to look at, except it is everything to me.”

(Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Democratic leaders rallied Wednesday against the congressional budget and tax cut bill, fearing changes to the national food assistance program will blow holes in state budgets and leave Americans hungry.
Four Democratic governors and two U.S. senators slammed the proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which they referred to as “ugly” and a “big beautiful betrayal of a bill” during a press call.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota led the call. She and U.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, as well as Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Laura Kelly of Kansas and Matt Meyer of Delaware took turns lambasting the Republican legislation.
“I’m very concerned about not only the money that this is going to cost but also the chaos that it’s going to create for so many people who will just give up and end up going hungry,” Kelly said.
The Democrats told stories of seniors, children, veterans and families who they worry will suffer as a result of cuts.
“They’re going to have that pain in their stomachs and throughout their body when they’re trying to go to bed or when they’re waking up in the morning of not having enough to eat,” Beshear said.
The bill changes by the day. Recent modifications from the U.S. Senate would require states to contribute a combined $128 billion to the federal food assistance program, which historically has been fully funded by the federal government. States would be required to contribute more money, the higher their payment error rates. States currently contribute half of administrative costs, but another provision in the bill seeks to reduce the federal government’s share by $27 billion, or 25%, creating additional costs for states.
The changes to SNAP from the Senate are multifold, but many are driven by cost-cutting measures and restricting eligibility.
The current proposal would bolster work requirements for SNAP beneficiaries and restrict eligibility for people in the U.S. without permanent legal status. Both provisions are designed to save the government almost $100 billion by making benefits more difficult to access for low-income families. The proposal also could eliminate internet expenses from utility benefit calculations, reducing the amount of money beneficiaries receive each month. That change is expected to save the government $11 billion.
The Democrats criticized Republicans for touting the bill as cutting costs while it is projected to add $3 trillion to the country’s deficit in the next decade.
Two of the bill’s food-benefits provisions — the state contribution requirement and restricted eligibility for immigrants who aren’t lawful permanent residents of the U.S. — broke a Senate rule, according to the budget committee. Those provisions either need to be fixed or, if left in, will be subject to a 60-vote threshold.
“That has not deterred the Republican leadership from continuing to search for workarounds, and apparently have found one,” said Kelly.
Republicans recently adjusted the language of the state contribution provision, and the Senate parliamentarian took it under review
Klobuchar, who sits on the Senate rules and agriculture committees, anticipated word on whether the new language violates a Senate rule by Thursday. Regardless, she said, Democrats intend to oppose the bill.
Most of the bill’s funding is a result of shifting costs in the billions to states, she said.
The majority of states have balanced budget rules, Klobuchar said, “so they would be forced to choose: pay for food assistance or reduce law enforcement, reduce education or reduce health care.”
Klobuchar quoted a letter Democratic governors sent Tuesday to congressional leadership, explaining their qualms with states taking on SNAP costs.
“These cuts from Congress don’t just increase state costs,” the letter said, “they make it nearly impossible for states to effectively plan for these long-term budget impacts.”
Most states have already finalized budgets ahead of the June 30 end date of the 2025 fiscal year.
Klobuchar said 4 million Americans will lose SNAP benefits as a result of the bill, which includes 1 million seniors, 800,000 parents with school-age children and 1.4 million people who live in areas where finding a job is difficult.
SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6.20 per person per day. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to more than 42 million people across the country. Around 115,000 Delawareans, 186,000 Kansans, 700,000 Kentuckians, 1.1 million Massachusetts residents and 360,000 Minnesotans receive monthly SNAP benefits as of March, according to preliminary estimates from the USDA.
Healey, of Massachusetts, said that for every one meal that a food bank provides, SNAP provides nine.
States don’t have the resources to fill gaps left behind by the proposed cuts, she said.
Kelly estimated Kansas, in administrative costs alone, will have to find more than $15 million per year to operate SNAP, which she called a conservative estimate. She expected Kansans in need will lose their benefits, especially if bolstered work requirements pass. She said they sound “really good” in theory, but worried the requirements and reporting will create hurdles for people who are “legitimately qualified” for benefits.
“We’re going to see the same thing happen with SNAP that we saw with Medicaid in states that were forced to, or did, put in work requirements,” she said.
Beshear drew a connection between the bill’s SNAP provisions and similar cuts that would weaken funding to rural hospitals. Kentucky has the highest number in the nation of rural hospitals at risk, with 35 facing closure. Beshear said those hospitals are often major employers. If rural hospitals close as a result of the bill, he said, Kentuckians are more likely to fall on hard times and turn to assistance programs like SNAP for help. But the proposed cuts to SNAP will make that more difficult, he said. Beshear criticized the cuts through the lens of religion, reciting the biblical story of the loaves and fishes.
“In a country where we grow enough food so that no one has to go hungry,” he said, “no one should go hungry.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/klobuchar-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 19:08:34.847561

Kelly Armstrong praised the cleanup efforts of communities struck by last week’s storms while promising the state would provide resources to help them rebuild.
He toured the communities of Enderlin, Page and Hunter on Wednesday, hearing about recovery efforts from community leaders, first responders and victims.
“There’s a long road ahead,” Armstrong said. “But a lot of work has already been done. I’m amazed at how quickly North Dakotans help their neighbors. 


How to help
The North Dakota Community Foundation has set up a storm relief fund. Financial donations will be provided to impacted communities and homeowners to assist with disaster recovery and unmet needs.


Armstrong declared a statewide disaster Saturday and activated the State Emergency Operations Plan after multiple tornadoes, strong winds and hail caused widespread damage across the state Friday.
The storm also claimed four lives. The latest confirmed is a 76-year-old man in the Courtenay area who was found dead on Saturday, according to Stutsman County Emergency Manager Jessica Moser. The man used a breathing apparatus and his home was among those that lost power, Moser said. His name was not immediately released.
Three people died in the Enderlin tornado, Michael Dehn, 73, Katherine Pfaff-Dehn, 73, and Marcario Lucio, 89, according to the Cass County Sheriff’s Office.
After seeing the damage, Armstrong said it was miraculous there weren’t more deaths and injuries. 
One home he toured belonged to Tyler and Brooke Pfaff of rural Enderlin. Originally built into a hillside, all that remained were some rock walls and shattered windows. The couple huddled in an interior bathroom when the tornado struck.
“It’s a total loss, but thank God we’re alive,” Tyler Pfaff said as he looked over what used to be his living room, now filled with debris and shredded insulation. “I’m not sure where we go from here.”
Over the past few days, neighbors and other volunteers had cleaned up snapped trees on the property and recovered personal items. 
“I’m overwhelmed,” Pfaff said. “People were here right away.”
Armstrong said neighborly kindness is a tremendous resource in times of disaster. “Nothing replaces our capacity to care for each other,” he said.

Enderlin Sheldon Fire Department Chief Jon Anderson said around 10 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in the storm’s path.
Much of the damage caused by storms will be covered by private insurance, but it could take a while to assess the claims, Armstrong said. One way the state may help is by offering grants or loans so individuals and communities can begin to rebuild immediately instead of waiting, he said.
The Industrial Commission meets Thursday morning and resources for storm relief will be a dominant topic, Armstrong said. In addition, Armstrong said he will ask for federal assistance, though the timing for making that request is uncertain.
“Our job is to help these communities get back on their feet,” he said.
In Page, one home was destroyed, according to Mayor Jim Heidorn. Other homes sustained damage to roofs, windows and trees. 
Outside of the city limits, many farms also lost grain storage.
Stephen and Scott Thompson, twin brothers who farm near Page, were cleaning the farm site with their families when Armstrong arrived to survey the damage. They lost grain bins that hold 450,000 bushels of corn. In addition, they couldn’t access bins holding about 100,000 bushels of grain because of the damage.
Stephen Thompson and his family were home when a series of storms hit overnight Friday. The third wave of wind hit them hardest, Thompson said.
“We ran into our (walk-out) basement and saw a 40-foot tree fall on our patio,” he said. For 45 minutes, the house shook from the wind.

Scott Thompson said it would take at least five years to rebuild, but there was no question the family would. A 100-year-old barn sustained damage in the storms and was leaning.
“We’ve straightened that more than once,” said Stephen Thompson. “And we’ll straighten it again. We’ve already tried today.”
Luke Erickson is part owner of EEE, which designs and builds grain storage in the region. He accompanied Armstrong on part of the tour around Page. Many of the farms affected were his customers, friends or family.
“It’s tough to fathom the damage,” he said. Grain bins could be replaced before harvest, but orders would need to be put in immediately, he said. 
Jim Kaiser, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service of Grand Forks, said there were 13 confirmed tornadoes in North Dakota Friday and Saturday. Six of those are rated with the highest at an EF3; the others are still being investigated.
In addition to the tornadoes, the storms brought sustained winds and wind gusts of up to 100 mph, Kaiser said. “That’s why you see so much damage,” he said. “That’s why we call it a ‘generational storm.’”

Three people linked to a group known as the Zizians are facing new felony charges related to firearms and illegal drug trafficking, on top of the misdemeanors that have kept them jailed in Maryland since February.
Members of the Zizians have been tied to violence in several states, including the fatal January shooting of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont.
The charges were filed last week against the three suspects who are named in court documents as Jack Amadeus LaSota, Michelle Jacqueline Zajko and Daniel Arthur Blank and who had previously been charged in Maryland with several misdemeanors each. 
Those charges, including the unlawful possession of handguns, trespassing and obstructing arrest, stemmed from their arrest in Frostburg, Maryland, in February while allegedly camping on private property. 
Now, prosecutors in Maryland’s Allegany County have brought a new indictment against each of them.
The new charges include felony counts of narcotic possession with intent to distribute and drug trafficking with the use of a firearm, according to court records and an article Wednesday in the Cumberland Times-News in Maryland. 
The penalties for the latest felony charges, if they lead to convictions, carry up to 20 years in prison. 
Prosecutors and attorneys for the three defendants could not be reached Wednesday afternoon for comment.
LaSota, Zajko and Blank have been in custody in Maryland since their initial arrest in February while the cases against them have been pending. 
Zajko and LaSota have also been previously charged with federal offenses as has one other person linked to the Zizians in Vermont.
In the Vermont case, two people named in court records as Felix Bauckholt and Teresa Youngblut were pulled over by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent David Maland on Jan. 20 on Interstate 91 in Coventry.
Youngblut, according to court records, opened fire, leading to a shootout that left Maland and Bauckholt dead and Youngblut injured.
Youngblut, 21, of Washington state, faces federal firearms and assault charges but has not been charged directly with killing Maland. At a court hearing Tuesday in Youngblut’s case in Burlington, a defense attorney stated he expected federal prosecutors to file new charges against his client in “short order” that carry the possibility of the death penalty.
Authorities have alleged that the guns that Youngblut and Bauckholt had at the time of the traffic stop in Vermont had been purchased by Zajko, who had lived for a time in Coventry.
Zajko has since been charged with a federal offense related to the purchases of firearms in Vermont. Zajko has not appeared in court in Vermont to face that charge.
LaSota, the alleged leader of the Zizians who blogged under the name “Ziz,” was federally indicted last week in Maryland on a charge of being an armed fugitive.
VTDigger is using Youngblut, LaSota and Bauckholt’s names and pronouns as they appear in court documents. While they have appeared to use other names in some instances, VTDigger has not been able to confirm which name each person uses in their day-to-day lives or their gender identities.
Authorities have linked the Zizians to other killings, including the January death of a landlord in Vallejo, California, and the 2022 fatal shootings of Zajko’s parents in Pennsylvania. None of the three Maryland defendants have been charged with any of the killings.

Bernie Sanders clasp hands before the crowd in Concord, New Hampshire. (Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said her agency will look into whether the Caddo Parish Commission violated state law when it touted a visit from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders to Shreveport last weekend.
Nearly 2,000 people showed up Saturday at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium for Sanders’ appearance as part of his “Fighting Oligarcy” tour, KSLA-TV reported. The progressive senator from Vermont stopped in Northwest Louisiana to lay his criticism for the Trump administration at the doorstep of U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport, whose district includes the area. 
Ahead of Sanders’ visit, the Caddo Parish Commission approved a resolution welcoming the senator to the area. Murrill argues that because the commission’s agenda for the meeting did not include the resolution, it is potentially a violation of the state’s Open Meetings Law. The statute calls for all business to be conducted at a meeting to be placed on a publicly available agenda 24 hours before its members convene.
Agendas posted online for recent commission meetings do not list a resolution regarding Sanders.
“If members of the Caddo Commission want to act as a body (including issuing official documents in the name of the Commission welcoming socialist Bernie Sanders to Shreveport), they are legally required to put it in the agenda at a properly held public meeting,” Murrill wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday afternoon. 
Caddo Parish Commission Chairman J.P. Young did not respond to a message and email seeking comment. Krystle Beauchamp, communications director for Caddo Parish, confirmed the attorney general has notified the commission about its investigation. She referred additional questions to Murrill’s office.

Just five months after being sworn in as president, Donald Trump has embroiled the U.S. in a shooting war in the  Middle East, a trade war with our allies and neighbors, and a culture war with those who oppose his policies. 
Trump has deployed the National Guard and the U.S. Marines into the streets of a major American city over the objections of a mayor and a governor, and unleashed masked agents to snatch unsuspecting immigrants off the streets and ship them off to foreign prisons. 
This seemed like a good moment to check in with Rep. Becca Balint. Balint, D-Vt., was elected to Congress from Vermont in 2022 and is a member of the House Judiciary Committee and the Budget Committee. She serves on the Congressional Progressive Caucus as Vice Chair for New Members and as a Co-Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus. 
She spoke to me on Tuesday, June 24, from her congressional office in Washington D.C. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The unabridged audio version of this interview can be heard by clicking the audio bar above. 
David Goodman  
I checked the temperature in Washington, D.C., and it is 100 degrees outside. I’m wondering if it’s even hotter inside the building where you are.
Rep. Becca Balint  
It’s pretty hot. Members on my side of the aisle are furious. You had the Trump administration bomb Iran over the weekend, and we still have not received a members’ briefing on it. Members of the House were supposed to have a classified briefing this afternoon but that was just canceled by House Republican leadership. Not only did the President not come to us ahead of the attack, but he also iced out any Democratic members on the intelligence committees and the committees that deal with national security. He has surrounded himself with yes men and even his own people that he’s appointed to advise him on intelligence and national security, he did not listen to them ahead of this. So there is a lot of anger, but also generally fear about the future. 
When you have a president who is extremely emotional, seems to make decisions on a whim and does not ask for any kind of deep analysis ahead of the decision making – so yeah, things feel pretty hot and pretty tense right now. 
David Goodman  
What is your response to the US bombing of Iran?
Rep. Becca Balint  
I think it was the absolute wrong thing to do. We never should have walked away from the Iran nuclear deal. We have to continue with diplomacy. I feel like, in this moment, it seems pretty clear to me that our president is not only being played by Vladimir Putin, but he’s also being played by Benjamin Netanyahu. 
David Goodman  
Explain how this plays into Netanyahu’s interests.
Rep. Becca Balint  
This is what Netanyahu has wanted for years, to have an American president intervene in Israel’s longstanding conflict with Iran. And Americans have said repeatedly, they want no more wars. They want us to pursue a path of peace. And that was a campaign promise that the President made as well, right? He said if you elect Harris-Walz, you’re going to be involved in a war within six months of office, right? This is not only exactly what Benjamin Netanyahu wanted for his own political survival, but also to give him breathing room on Gaza, to enable him to take more power in Gaza and the West Bank. It is a way for (Netanyahu) to consolidate power and control. 
I don’t feel that this President plays chess. I feel like he makes decisions based on the whim at the moment and who is flattering him, and who is making promises to him or where he thinks he is going to get that feeling that he craves. This is a man who craves people praising him, and that is no way for us to be making foreign policy decisions.
David Goodman  
One commentator wrote that your feelings about the attack on Iran either fall into one of two categories: one, that you think this is the end of a war, or two, that you think this is the start of a war. Which do you think it is?
Rep. Becca Balint  
Interesting framing. I am highly skeptical of any information that we are getting from this administration, and so I have said in the last 36 hours that there’s a lot that’s happening right now that feels very similar to what happened in the lead up to the invasion of Iraq. You had in this situation of President (Bush) saying this was imminent, that the uranium that was being enriched was going to be used in a nuclear weapon against Israel. It was going to threaten the world. And then you had people within his own administration saying it wasn’t imminent, that actually the intelligence didn’t show that. It’s difficult, if we’re not getting any kind of information from this administration, for us to make an educated decision about what should happen here. Time will tell whether this is the end of the tensions. I have a hard time believing that that’s the case, and we’ll see if this ceasefire holds. 
You’ve got a president who, seemingly on a whim, tweets that we have a cease fire between Israel and and Iran and next thing you know, they’re bombing each other and they say that we never agreed to a cease fire. So what is actually happening here? We would like the opportunity to ask this administration directly, as that is our job as Congress to be serving in a position of oversight.
David Goodman  
You signed on to a resolution calling for the War Powers Act to be invoked. Explain what that is and what Congress’s role is in these situations, and why you think that’s warranted. 
Rep. Becca Balint  
Congress has the authority to declare war and to commit offensive force and troops. That is within our purview, that is not within the purview of the executive branch, which I know is confusing for some people, because you have the president as commander in chief. But it makes sense, too, if you’re committing resources, where do you go to commit resources? You have to come to Congress. Congress makes those decisions. And after Vietnam happened, and obviously years and years of the American people and Congress feeling like they had been quite rightly lied to by numerous administrations about how the war was going, there was a strengthening of congressional power through the War Powers Act in the 1970s. 
Thomas Massie, who’s a Republican from Kentucky, has put forward a bipartisan agreement to demand that the President comes to us to get that authority to declare or to engage in war with Iran. And obviously that hasn’t happened, but many of us were relieved that Thomas Massie has been a strong voice on these issues his entire career in Congress. We disagree on a lot of things, but as you know, politics makes strange bedfellows, and I was very happy to sign onto his bill.
David Goodman  
Let’s turn from violence abroad to violence at home. The murder of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and the shooting of another Minnesota lawmaker put a spotlight on rising political violence. And earlier this spring, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) stated publicly how afraid she was. She said “I am oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice because retaliation is real.” I wanted to get your thoughts on this and also ask, have you felt threatened in any way?
Rep. Becca Balint  
I think every single member of Congress feels threatened, feels in danger. We have all lost a sense that we can navigate this job without experiencing some kind of a dangerous situation, either for ourselves or our families, every time that we are asked to be at an event in Vermont and elsewhere too. In Vermont, my team, the first thing they need to do is they need to go over a safety plan with me. They need to call local law enforcement. I need to know exactly where the car is going to be. How are we going to get out of the building? Who is going to be my go-to? This is happening in every single district.
We do not have security details as member of Congress. I was in a huddle with members this morning as we talked about heading out for the Fourth of July parades that we’re all going to be doing, and that you can’t have a security plan for a parade. We were talking for the first time like, is this the year we all start wearing bulletproof vests? This is not what it’s supposed to be like to represent your constituents. You should not fear for your life. You should not feel fear for the safety of your family. 
David Goodman  
What do you attribute the rise in political violence too.
Rep. Becca Balint  
I think a lot of it, not all of it, can be traced back to the kind of rhetoric that this President has used in both of his campaigns. It has been dehumanizing. It’s been demonizing. It has been attacking viciously people that he doesn’t think belongs, whether it is immigrants or migrants, whether it is women, whether it is trans people. I mean, he is attacking viciously the LGBTQ community and it is picked up. He has broken the rules about what is acceptable discourse. Social media has always been a place where people felt that freedom. But it’s not just happening there. It’s happening in the halls of Congress. It’s happening in committees. It’s happening that constituents feel emboldened to say anything, do anything. This movement in which everything is acceptable isn’t going to go away when Trump is no longer president.
David Goodman  
A number of Democratic leaders have recently been arrested. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, New Jersey Representative Lamonica McIver, and of course Senator Alex Padilla of California, who was thrown to the ground and handcuffed for trying to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question. And then we saw New York City Comptroller Brad Lander manhandled and arrested. What is the through line that connects all of these instances of high profile arrests of these officials?
Rep. Becca Balint  
Silence and intimidation is the goal. It is to create a situation where if a member of Congress is being arrested, if a senator is being wrestled to the floor, if they will do that to a mayor, if they will do that to a comptroller, they will do that to anyone, and they are doing that to anyone. It is about intimidation and silence so that they will have no oversight over what they’re doing, and when we feel fear, when we feel intimidated, then we are not able to do our oversight, but also we won’t have collective action, right? People say to me, Is it safe for me to go out and protest? Is it safe for us to be seen together? I’ve especially gotten this question from people of color. Am I going to make myself a target? That’s what they want, and it’s going to take all of us to stand up to that, because they’re not going to stop until we say collectively No. And they can’t arrest all of us. They can’t.
David Goodman  
What should Democrats be doing right now to confront what’s going on? 
Rep. Becca Balint  
Well, a couple things. One, there’s a lot more happening than people see. Every single day in the house in every single committee, you have Democrats going toe to toe with Republicans who are trying to push the most outrageous legislation. And we need to be listening more than we’re talking. 
What’s happening is this administration is burning everything to the ground, and it is horrible. People are losing their jobs. There are resources that are not being invested in the NIH and research, there are attacks on Medicaid. These things are going to hurt people. And we also have to be thinking a few steps ahead, which is, where is the opportunity in that to not rebuild what we had before that didn’t feel like it was serving people. 
People want to see us fighting. They want us to see us showing up in difficult conversations and not backing down. I heard from Democrats across Vermont and across the country, they want to see us pushing the envelope more and using power when we have it and not being so timid.
David Goodman  
The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that states can restrict access to transgender care, and you delivered an impassioned speech in a House committee. You asked why, with all the problems that the country and the world are facing, there was this obsession among Republicans about trans kids. How do you answer that?
Rep. Becca Balint  
It was a strategic decision that was made by the Republican Party. This is no accident. They sat down with their strategists and they realized that they had sort of lost the battle on rights for gay Americans, and they were looking for a new enemy. And what they realized is that most Americans didn’t have a lot of knowledge about the lives of trans people, and it was a very easy target for them. This is a tiny percentage of the population. That is their answer to anything that we bring up in committee, trans people are to blame. Don’t focus on the fact that you can’t pay your bills, somehow the fact that trans people want health care, that’s to blame. Don’t focus on the fact that you’re being screwed over by tax policy, it’s the fact that you’ve got a 13-year-old trans girl who wants to play field hockey. It is a concerted effort to draw attention away to all the ways in which this administration is lawless, corrupt and not meeting the needs of individual people, and they’re preying on the this group because they’re trusting that most Americans don’t have a lot of experience talking about these issues, and it makes them uncomfortable, because they don’t feel like they know a lot about it. 
A reporter asked me, “Why do you think you have become sort of a champion in fighting for the rights of these individuals?” I said, for me, it comes down to every single individual having access to health care, period. And if nobody else is going to speak up, I’m going to speak up, because this is a basic core value for me. I don’t necessarily feel like I’m the best spokesperson for this. I am not a trans person. I haven’t had this experience. I don’t have a trans person in my family. But damn it, if someone’s coming for the rights of one of my constituents, are coming from their health care, I’m going to fight with everything I’ve got.
David Goodman  
One of the things that we’re supposed to be distracted from looking at is the budget reconciliation bill that is moving through Congress that includes some $800 billion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and health services. In Vermont, this may result in cutting or reducing food assistance for up to 13,000 Vermonters, and potentially result in hospital closures. Talk about this budget and its potential impact on Vermont. What aspects of it are you most concerned about? 
Rep. Becca Balint  
I was meeting with folks in healthcare from Vermont here in my office today and they’re deeply concerned that tens of thousands of Vermonters are going to lose their health care and that facilities will close. A lot of people don’t realize Medicaid is the margin that keeps open a lot of rural health care centers. This is the case that I made to my Republican colleagues on the Budget Committee. I said, it’s not just blue states. Your rural hospitals are going to close too. And many of them didn’t believe us, because I feel like their leadership was not honest with them about what was in there, and they were not curious enough to find out.
David Goodman  
President Trump’s mass deportation program has now come to Vermont. Farm workers are being rounded up. There have been high profile arrests in Vermont, such as the case of Mohsen Mahdawi. Now it appears that Trump is targeting states that do not support him or his deportation policies. What is your response to these developments and what can be done about it?
Rep. Becca Balint  
We always knew this wasn’t going to be about going after “criminals” or “the worst of the worst.” We knew that because you can’t implement a mass deportation program supposedly going after millions of criminals. He was going to have to go after people who were showing up at the Home Depot to buy tools to be able to go and do their jobs every day, or students — people here legally — swooping in on folks when they are just at their court appearances. These supposed criminals are showing up (in court) following the rules, and that’s when they’re being detained, arrested, in some cases, shipped off to other countries. 
(Podcaster) Joe Rogan, who was a huge Trump supporter, was questioning on his show, what are we doing here? We’re now going after people who are living here peacefully, they’re contributing to our communities — this doesn’t make sense. And so this is another situation where we have to be standing up together. We have an obligation as members of Congress to do oversight. And I think that those of us who saw this happening on the campaign trail, we knew exactly what was coming, because we know who Stephen Miller is. He is the mastermind of all of this. He would like to have a white country devoid of brown people. That’s what this is all about. This is about white supremacy.
David Goodman  
You ran in your last race centering your own personal story about your family being Holocaust survivors. I wonder if you could take the temperature on the state of our democracy right now. What is it? Where are we?
Rep. Becca Balint  
If you’re only looking at what this administration is doing, what you see is a very bleak story. You see a president who is exceeding his authority and his power. You see him testing the judicial branch and trying to run roughshod over Congress, and you see a dysfunctional House and Senate not able to do the work of the people. But that’s not all of it. Democracy is a structure that is based on founding documents. It’s an idea and it only works when we’re engaged in it. 
When I look at the kind of outpouring that we saw for the No Kings rallies — I did three rallies, one in Jamaica, Vermont, one in Burlington, one up in Saint Albans. There was great turnout in every single spot. The entire drive up through Vermont along Route 7, there were people out along the side of the road, massive turnout across the country. So when you look at the ways in which Americans are responding in this moment, I feel very hopeful. I have a lot of confidence in the resilience of Americans, of our creativity, of our perseverance, of our insatiable desire to want better for ourselves and our kids. So I actually feel like we’re going to prevail in this moment. We are going to prevail because broadly speaking, the American electorate does not want what this administration is offering right now. It’s slowly sinking in for some people and for a lot of us, we knew what was coming. And it’s even worse than perhaps we thought. But it is sinking in among people like Joe Rogan, it is sinking in. 
I met a woman in Saint Albans, an elderly woman. She pulled me aside and said, “I’ve never protested anything in my life. I’ve never been to a rally. But I’m here, and it feels terrific because I was feeling so alone, and now I’m out here.” 
So when I am outside of DC meeting with people and what they’re working on and what they’re working on locally and within the state, I know we’re going to get through this.

Steve Bullock, D-Montana, (left) and former Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Maryland, (right) said that current governors may be missing an opportunity to have a bigger role in national issues that seem relegated to Congress and the White House if they were able to come together. (Photos by Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters)In a country flooded by a never-ending wave of talking heads, pundits and fiery social media posts, two bipartisan former governors said the solution to America’s political gridlock may be more talking.
But former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, and former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, said that it’s not about talking on airwaves or to like-minded political party members. Instead, it’s about sitting and talking about common ground — together — face-to-face.
That was the message the two former state leaders and former chairmen of the National Governors Association said during an hour-long panel, “Federalism Tested: How States are Navigating in an Era of Uncertainty,” hosted by the Pew Charitable Trusts and States Newsroom on Tuesday morning.
Both Bullock and Hogan said that despite an apparent growing list of issues that divide the country, most Americans agree on one thing: They’re exhausted by the partisan rhetoric and political gridlock and want politicians to find common ground.
Minnesota assassination prompts many lawmakers to wonder: Is service worth the danger?
They said that organizations like the National Governors Association provide models for how to find common ground and advocate for solutions. And both governors know something about bipartisan work as Hogan, a member of the GOP, served two terms in Maryland, a state dominated by Democrats. Meanwhile, Bullock, a Democrat, served two terms, accomplishing Medicaid expansion and campaign spending reform, with a legislature of nearly two-thirds Republicans.
“There’s more that unites us than divides us,” Hogan said, adding it was a message that resonated with deeply liberal Maryland, because it stressed common solutions and bipartisanship.
“The politics that divide the nation need not divide the state,” Hogan said. “These days, people seem to want to win an argument rather than provide solutions to solve problems.”
Current governors may be missing an opportunity to have a bigger role in the national issues that seem relegated to Congress and the White House, they said. They agreed that if governors were able to come together, they may be better at checking the power of Congress or the president.
“You actually have to govern when you’re a governor,” Bullock said. “And that means you have to stay focused on what’s happening in your own state and to your people.”
That gives governors power to communicate concerns and stand together to influence federal leaders. One example they used was the way the governors’ association worked together during the COVID pandemic. Instead of meeting quarterly, they had weekly meetings via Zoom.
“We didn’t all agree, but we didn’t fight. We simply said: These are the things we need. It was productive,” Hogan said.
Hogan also touted the large infrastructure bill that was shaped by bipartisan input from governors of both parties.
“We don’t see enough of that,” Hogan said.
Both said governors are crucial in the feedback circle because they can pierce the federal bubble in Washington, D.C.
For example, Hogan said that Maryland, during his tenure, was able to eliminate 7,000 jobs through “a scalpel and attrition,” resulting in savings, efficiency and maintaining a high approval rating as governor, nearing 75% statewide.
“What happened with (the Department of Government Efficiency) is we took a meat ax instead of an instrument of precision,” Hogan said. “And every time you lay someone off, it will affect real people.”

Larry Hogan, R-Maryland, (right) says extreme gerrymandering and political primaries that select the more extreme sides of each political party contribute to a sense of gridlock and polarization. (Photos by Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters)
It’s those people whom governors are the closest to, and those stories can be shared by the state leaders.
In Montana, Bullock said, the impacts may be noticeable when visitors travel for “a trip of a lifetime” to places like Yellowstone and Glacier national parks, which may have fewer amenities, or have extraordinary lines.
“At the end of the day, state government isn’t going to be paying for those employees, so when someone has their lifelong dream vacation in Glacier National Park, and can’t get to where they want, states will have to work with federal services,” Bullock said. “Unfortunately, folks have to feel pain for it to be real.”
He also called for more accountability for elected leaders down to the local level who avoid answering constituent questions or press inquiries. He said the media must continue to hold officials accountable by telling the public when leaders won’t speak, and what questions were asked.
Moreover, he said that true bipartisanship begins with individuals who are willing to support leaders whom they don’t always agree with, but demonstrate a commitment to bipartisan solutions.
“Why is it that the most dangerous place in America today is around the Thanksgiving table?” Bullock asked.
Hogan said that extreme gerrymandering and political primaries that select the more extreme sides of each party contribute to a sense of gridlock and polarization.
“We have an exhausted majority,” Hogan said. “The public is sick of it, and that’s why people are fleeing from both parties, becoming political independents.”

(Photo by Ylleana Berryhill/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — University of Oklahoma athletic leaders said Wednesday they are adapting to a new normal in a rapidly changing college sports environment.
Joe Castiglione, University of Oklahoma vice president and director of athletics, said athletes “are bigger, faster, stronger than ever before” and have multiple options even as the university works to recruit the best athletes to compete for championships. 
Castiglione and other OU leaders spoke about the evolving college athletic landscape and what will be needed to stay competitive in the new NIL era at the Oklahoma State Chamber’s annual meeting.
The shift in operations follows the 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which opened the door for college athletes to monetize and have authority over how their name, image and likeness, or NIL, is used.
“The NIL space, as we’ve known it up to this point, has been largely unrestricted, unstructured, so they have, in this sense, the short-term memory of how NIL has been,” Castiglione said. “We’re going to have to help educate them, whether it’s how they can build their brand, how they will get monetized.”
He said OU has begun to focus on college athletics as a business.
“Every time I used to use that word or refer to business, I would get shushed, you know, because we’re part of higher education, college athletics isn’t supposed to sound like a business but we operate very much like one,” Castiglione said.
He said the university will have to pay attention to how it grows and manages expenses. Expenses are growing much more rapidly than the rate of new revenue. 
“We have to be a force multiplier in how we partner with people,” he said.
Castiglione said OU athletics will have a $225 million budget that is totally built on generating its own revenue. 
“We live by a scoreboard for many people in our world so that’s how they measure whether or not we’re successful,” he said. “Culture is going to be the catalyst as a force multiplier, partnerships are going to be a catalyst.” 
He said it is important for the university to compete for championships. That is how they will leverage support. As it grows, athletes and coaches will continue to want to come. 
Castiglione said OU is positioning their program strategically and tactically. 
“I think in this period of disruption, communicating and being proactive in the space can help align our coaches with the right strategy and tactics to navigate what is still an undefined environment,” he said.

Burlington’s City Council voted unanimously Monday to move forward with an ordinance banning public nudity following complaints from local businesses and residents.
The proposal now heads to the Ordinance Committee for review before going back to the council.
Vermont law generally allows public nudity in cases where the person leaves their house naked, though removing clothes once outside is prohibited. According to the proposed city ordinance, however, Burlington is looking to classify showing one’s “genitals or anal region” as public indecent exposure even if it’s not lewd in nature.  
The ordinance states that public exposure may interfere with people’s right to enjoy public areas without being unwillingly exposed to nudity and discourage community members from visiting spaces where these incidents occur. During the Monday meeting, councilor Becca Brown McKnight said the ordinance could help prevent incidents of indecent exposure that happened near schools and playgrounds. 
Ordinance violations could result in a $100 fine for the first offense and a $200 fine for the second offense if it occurs within six months of the first. A third violation would be considered a criminal offense and carry a $500 fine if it occurs within six months of the second. Partial waivers are available for the first two offenses.
“The intent of this ordinance to ban public nudity has nothing to do with suppressing anyone’s freedom of expression,” Brown McKnight said Tuesday. “We’re hoping the Ordinance Committee can have some kind of a flexibility in there for some of the historical events that might involve nudity in the city.” Brown McKnight said the Ordinance Committee will determine if the ordinance will be citywide or focus on specific areas.
One of the exceptions may be the naked bike ride by University of Vermont students, a longstanding tradition that takes place at the end of each semester near the campus.
“I think no matter if they have a law in place to protect it or disband it, I feel like the naked bike ride would somehow come up again,” said Claire Conklin, a recent University of Vermont graduate who participated in the event in the past. 
Conklin said the way the bike ride is currently organized allows people to express themselves and feel safe, and since it’s publicized in advance, people can decide not to join if they feel uncomfortable. 
“I feel like it kind of goes against the UVM spirit and Burlington as a whole of banning something that other people enjoy,” she added.
The proposal is the result of regular complaints from residents and business owners in downtown Burlington. Around 100 business owners sent a letter to Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak in May expressing concern over the conditions of the city center and requesting action on several items, including a plea for a public nudity ordinance.
“We have observed an increasing trend of individuals engaging in deliberately inappropriate behavior in public spaces, which is causing alarm among families and negatively impacting Burlington’s reputation as a welcoming environment,” they wrote.
“I don’t really think it’s a public safety issue,” councilor Melo Grant said. “These men who have done this have never hurt anyone. … But it is a situation where some people are concerned.”
The public will have the chance to weigh in on the proposal in the coming weeks. Brown McKnight said it might take up to two months before reaching a final resolution, but she doesn’t expect the ban will receive pushback from the community. 
Grant said she will pay attention to the final text of the ordinance before deciding how she will vote on it.
“I wanted to be really cautious about how we proceed. I just don’t want anything that’s going to be weaponized against people,” Grant said, expressing concern that the new ordinance could be used to discriminate against people experiencing homelessness or limit freedom of expression for the LGBTQ+ community.

Unions and environmental groups are opposed.","In summary
Lawmakers are weighing a provision that would allow developers to pay a lower wage for some construction projects, theoretically stimulating housing production in California. Unions and environmental groups are opposed. 



California lawmakers are on the cusp of striking a last-minute deal to tie one of the year’s most ambitious and controversial housing bills to a new set of minimum wages for housing construction workers — a proposal that has thrown a wrench into budget negotiations just days before the deadline. 
The new legislative language, buried in a sprawling budget bill put into print on Tuesday, represents a grand political bargain between pro-development advocates and the state’s carpenters union. Supporters say the new arrangement could reshape the way that future California housing legislation is written and negotiated. 
There is intense opposition from other building trades unions, which are among the most powerful interest groups at the state Capitol and whose leaders argue that the bill would undercut hard-fought pay standards. That’s made for a high-stakes showdown as Gov. Gavin Newsom demands major changes to streamline housing construction as part of the budget.
The new wage rates are a major pivot in a debate that has dominated the legislative politics of housing in California for at least a decade. Past bills aimed at making it easier to build new homes have offered a trade: Ease regulations on approvals, permits and environmental regulations in exchange for, among other things, higher guaranteed pay for construction workers. The standard wage rate in those debates have been the “prevailing wages” — state-determined wages that vary by occupation and location that generally work out to what unionized workers earn.
These new proposed rates are significantly lower and are designed to serve as a more development-friendly alternative. They would apply only in cases where developers opt to use a new proposed exception to California’s premier environmental impact law, the California Environmental Quality Act. The vast majority of those projects, small-scale residential construction projects, are not currently covered by prevailing wage.
That’s why supporters of the deal are arguing that the new standards represent a wage increase.
Residential construction is “a virtually non-union industry,” said Danny Curtin, who heads the California Conference of Carpenters. “You have the ability to give those people a substantial — a modest, but substantial and important — raise.”
Even so, the pushback from other construction labor groups has been fierce.
The State Building and Construction Trades Council, a construction union umbrella group that regularly clashes with the carpenters union on labor issues, excoriated the proposal in a letter to legislative leadership yesterday.
“This proposal is a wage grab of construction workers’ wages disguised in an ‘affordable housing bill,’” the letter by council president Chris Hannan said. “We urge you to abandon any pursuit of this harmful and unprecedented proposal, which would devastate construction workers.”
Lawmakers also appeared caught off guard by the proposal at an Assembly budget hearing on Wednesday packed with union advocates.
“I didn’t come to Sacramento to cut people’s wages,” said Assemblymember Chris Rogers, a Ukiah Democrat. “I didn’t sit through months of budget committee hearings talking about how to preserve our social safety net to then, at the 11th hour, potentially kick more people onto it.” 
Assemblymember Lashae Sharp Collins, a Democrat from La Mesa, called the fact that the building trades reportedly weren’t consulted “appalling.” 
The new wage proposal received a similarly icy reception from many Democrats in the Senate, which also held a budget hearing on Wednesday.
“You’re presenting something at the last minute, I don’t know who you consulted with, and you reached this conclusion to completely change the structure for the way that workers in the construction industry would be paid,” said Sen. Maria Elena Durazo, a Los Angeles Democrat and a reliable ally of the trades.
The bill was scheduled to be voted on Friday. In the face of furious pushback a budget committee hearing vote in the Senate was delayed on Wednesday, making the timing of its final vote uncertain.
Though the last-minute addition of contentious labor language threatens to divide legislative Democrats, the party holds two-thirds of the seats in both legislative chambers, giving the budget bill ample opportunities to pass even with significant defections.
A debate months in the making
This new proposal is the latest addition to a policy idea introduced in March by Oakland Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks. The bill would exempt most new apartment buildings in urban areas from CEQA, the environmental law.
The 55-year-old law is the frequent target of lawmakers and pro-housing advocates who argue that it can be weaponized to slow or impede desperately needed new housing and other projects. Many environmental advocacy groups and organized labor groups defend the law as an important check on unwanted or environmentally harmful development.
Wicks’ idea got a helpful boost last month when Newsom opted to fold it into his proposed budget for the coming year, putting it on a speedier and surer path to becoming law. He has since threatened to withhold his signature from the budget if legislators do not approve the sweeping housing measures, some of which are still being negotiated.
A key part of that budget package — what’s called a trailer bill — is before the Legislature now. The bill includes Wicks’ exemption tied to the new labor language, along with key components of other housing bills, including a proposed freeze on building code changes, limits on the fees that landlords can charge tenants and an expanded tax credits for renters.
Assemblymember Nick Schultz, the Burbank Democrat who authored the building code freeze bill, noted that he wasn’t informed by the governor’s office or Assembly leadership that his proposal was being tucked into the budget bill. He said he found out from an advocacy group.
By setting wages far below the “prevailing wage” rates required by law for publicly funded projects — and frequently demanded by construction unions for their support for housing bills — it is meant to offer a more financially feasible alternative, while still boosting the pay of workers at the lowest end of the labor market.

In Oakland, for example, a carpenter making the state-set “prevailing wage” for a residential project earns at least $99 per hour including benefits.
The new minimum wages would only require that the majority of construction workers across the Bay Area covered under the policy be paid at least $40 an hour. Less skilled or experienced workers would require at least $27 per hour. Smaller housing projects of 25 units or fewer would be exempt entirely.
The budget bill also includes language that would give unions the right to take contractors to court for workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax violations.
“Yes in my backyard” advocates that have historically looked askance at prevailing wage requirements are celebrating the new deal. 
“This is one of the biggest wins for housing in a generation,” California YIMBY president Brian Hanlon said in a statement. “Building infill housing is not a threat to the environment — it’s how we save it.”
Carpenters and YIMBYs collaborate again
Though new wage rates only apply to Wicks’ urban infill exemption, hammering out a deal with a major labor group allowing for pay significantly below prevailing wage would spell a significant shift in California labor policy.
This isn’t the first time the state’s carpenters union has cut a high-profile deal to push a major YIMBY-backed housing bill across the legislative finish line. 
In 2022, Wicks’ bill to fast-track apartment construction along stripmall corridors earned the endorsement of the carpenters after she added a prevailing wage requirement, along with some other benefits. 
At the time that was considered a political concession. For years the state’s other major construction worker union group, the Trades Council, had made the inclusion of so-called skilled-and-trained standards — essentially, a requirement to hire predominantly unionized workers — the price of their support for housing bills.

In breaking with the trades, the carpenters have long argued that clearing the way for the construction of more housing, even at the expense of higher mandatory wages, represents an “organizing opportunity” for the union.
After Wicks’ bill passed over the Trades Council’s strenuous objection, other pro-development lawmakers came to see that deal as something they could effectively copy and paste into their housing legislation, all but guaranteeing the support of an unlikely coalition of developers, union workers and YIMBY activists. 
Even so, many developers continue to argue that prevailing wage rates are still too costly to make construction pencil out beyond the state’s priciest metro areas, making those prior housing bills ineffective at actually producing more housing.
Supporters of this new deal say the lower wage standard could be the next go-to legislative language for future housing bills.
“This bill is a big step forward and an important test of whether the ‘YIMBY-Carpenter alliance’ can enact housing bills that generate housing production at scale,” UC Davis law professor Chris Elmendorf wrote on X.

Statewide progress monitoring scores, announced by Gov. Ron DeSantis Wednesday, detail how Florida’s students performed in reading, math, social studies, and science.
Math scores for all students from third grade to high school improved by 3% from 2024, with 58% of students demonstrating a level 3 or higher understanding. The county with the lowest score was Gadsden, with 35% testing at a level 3 or higher, and the highest, Nassau, with 78%.
Level 3, on the state’s scale of 1-5, is considered on grade level. Level 4 is considered proficient and level 5 is considered exemplary. Students who scored below level 3 are considered below or well below grade level.
Reading scores for students in grades 3-10 increased from 53% at level three or higher in 2024 to 57% in 2025. Gadsden County had the lowest performance at 36% at level 3 or higher and St. Johns was the highest at 72%.
“Florida insists that education be factual, student-focused, and parent empowered,” DeSantis said in a news release. “Florida has led the nation in instituting progress monitoring assessments that allow for teachers and parents to provide real-time interventions that support the long-term success of their students, and our approach has paid off.”
The progress monitoring tests are administered three times per year by the state. The periodic testing is designed to allow instructors to make interventions for struggling students sooner. This is the third year of progress monitoring in Florida.
During the Spring 2025 end-of-course assessment for the civics assessment, 71% of students tested at a level 3 or higher; 47% were proficient or higher.
“Today’s results affirm that our first-in-the-nation statewide progress monitoring system is making a difference for our students. Under Governor DeSantis’ leadership, Florida will continue to provide the best opportunities for our students,” Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. said in a news release.

This year Florida scores dropped on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Eighth grade math scores have dropped in the last three iterations of the test, and Florida students that age ranked in the bottom 10 states for math and reading scores. Fourth grade reading scores on the NAEP were the lowest in 2024 since 2003, while their math scores increased but remain below pre-pandemic numbers.
The data for the NAEP, collected in early 2024, were disputed by Diaz, who questioned the methodology of the exam. Diaz wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Education with “suggestions to help make NAEP great for educational progress once again.”
He took issue with the lack of inclusion of private school students and he believed urban students were included at a disproportionate rate.
Diaz will step down next month to become interim president of the University of West Florida. Earlier this month, the Florida Board of Education named DeSantis deputy chief of staff Anastasios Kamoutsas the next education commissioner.

“Florida is a national leader in education because we are not afraid to challenge the status quo,” Kamoutsas said in the news release. “Progress monitoring assessments are a prime example of how Florida has changed education for the better, and the scores are proof of our successful approach.”
According to department data, students who are African American improved reading scores, with 45% scoring a level 3 or above in 2025 compared to those 40% scoring at the same level in 2024. Hispanic students increased performance during the same time frame on math, with 55% scoring level 3 or higher compared to 51% the year before.

(Photo by Mladen Sladojevic/Getty Images) Hospitals and surgery centers made more errors in 2024 than in previous years, continuing an upward trend that began in 2020, according to a report released Tuesday by the Minnesota Department of Health. 
Overall, facilities reported 624 medical mistakes between October 2023 and October 2024, 14 more than in the previous year, though the total number of surgeries increased even more. There were 70% more errors in 2024 than in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Health officials have attributed the increase in so-called adverse health events — 29 often-preventable errors that could result in serious injury or death — to staffing shortages and an aging population. In 2024, there was a nearly 9% increase in surgeries compared to the previous year, but only a 2% increase in the number of mistakes.
“We are glad to see the rate of increase in the number of adverse health events beginning to slow,” Minnesota Commissioner of Health Brooke Cunningham said in a news release.
The mistakes resulted in 14 deaths, two fewer than in 2023, and 224 serious injuries. 
Severe bedsores were by far the most common incident reported to MDH, accounting for nearly half of the incidents. Patient falls; loss of a biological specimen, like a placenta; leaving a foreign object inside a patient’s body; and performing a surgery on the wrong part of the body were among the other most common errors.
The small increase in the number of bedsores is partially related to more patients refusing repositioning, and an increase in the number of patients with conditions that make them especially vulnerable to bedsores, according to the report.
There were four deaths and 90 serious injuries related to falls, nearly half of which occurred when patients were using the restroom.

Proposal to keep targeting 50% more cats in western mountains — a change brought about to appease outfitters upset about deer — aligns with a statewide trend of heavily hunting cougars. 
The post Wyoming keeps lion hunting pressure dialed high as mature cats become scarce appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s nearly two-decade-old mountain lion management plan lays out three primary strategies for the native felines. 
Areas where lions exist at healthy, natural densities that are managed for long-term hunting of the big cats are classified as “sources.” Regions with  densities deemed “relatively high” — where the goal is to maintain lion numbers — are labeled “stable.” And then there are “sink” management areas, where hunting seasons are set with the goal of reducing lion numbers. 
In 2006, when Wyoming embarked upon its source-stable-sink lion management regime, a dozen of the state’s 29 lion areas were managed as “sources,” and a 13th area was marked a blend of “source” and “stable.” A single area in the southern Bighorns was then branded as a “sink.” 
Times have changed. 
The Wyoming Game and Fish Department, which typically updates its lion regulations every three years, has retained only four areas as population “sources,” according to the latest statewide mortality report. “Sinks,” meanwhile, increased from one in 2006 to six hunting areas during the last cycle, from 2022 to 2024.
Over time, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has transitioned to a management regime that has decreased the age of mountain lions through heavy hunting. (WGFD)
The maximum number of lions permitted to be killed by hunters across Wyoming has steadily grown. And the number of cougars actually killed has risen in tandem, and is now approaching or exceeding 350 cats killed annually, according to the state’s data. Populations, of which there are no good estimates in the state, are now hunted so heavily that in many places there are very few remaining mature animals. It’d be the equivalent of an elk herd that’s almost exclusively calves, yearling cows and spike bulls.   

Mountain lion mortality has been on the upswing in Wyoming since the creation of the state’s modern management plan two decades ago. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Luke Worthington, president of the Wyoming Houndsman Association, has seen it firsthand. A houndsman who guides clients along the west slope of the Bighorn Mountains in areas 21 and 22 — both managed as a blend of “stable” and “sink” — he’s grown accustomed to seeing very few signs of lions overall, and then treeing only youngsters.

“There’s no age structure there at all, it’s all young cats,” Worthington said. “I drove almost 5,000 miles in 14 days and cut less than 10 tracks.” 
Over the two weeks of hunting there last winter, he found a single mature tom. 
Worthington tried to tilt the hunting regulations in the mountain lions’ favor. The houndsman lobbied to drop the mortality limits in areas 21 and 22 — and thought the idea had some traction. 
“We had all the game wardens and bios in those areas on board,” Worthington said. “They see the problem. And it was not even brought to the [Game and Fish] Commission.” 
When Game and Fish rolled out its draft lion hunting regulations this spring, the maximum number of cats that could be killed in the two western Bighorn hunt areas stayed the same, at 45 animals. 
Statewide, mortality limits either rose or stayed the same. One area, in Wyoming’s far southeast corner, is positioned to transition into an “unlimited” hunt, joining other “unlimited” hunt areas in the southern Bighorns, Powder River Basin and the Casper Mountain region.
Even in the Wyoming Range, Gros Ventres and western Winds, wildlife managers held onto 50% higher mountain lion hunting limits that were put into place due to big game outfitter pressure following an especially deadly winter for mule deer and pronghorn. The changes were made despite a lack of evidence that killing lions would help bring the ungulate herds back. 

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has proposed 50% increases in mountain lion quotas in four hunt areas, pictured here. Specifically, unit 14 would go from a 20-cat quota to 30; unit 17, from 5 to 8; unit 26, from 15 to 23; and unit 29, from 6 to 9 cats. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Two years later, Game and Fish proposed to retain 50% higher quotas in hunt areas 14, 17, 26 and 29, continuing with management that allows a maximum of 61 cats to be killed in the western hunt areas. 
Like in the western Bighorns, it’s an approach that’s working to drive down lion numbers.
“In areas such as Wyoming Range, where there was a great deal of public interest to kill as many lions as possible, we’re seeing that come forth,” Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson told WyoFile. “Once you start getting any adult female segment, then you start ramping into everything, and you get a younger age class and less lions overall.” 
While trapping lions for research along the Wyoming Range’s western front, state biologists saw indications of the reduced numbers. 
“It was harder to cut a track this last winter, for sure,” Thompson said. “It was pretty few and far between.”
Worthington, who lives in the Gillette area, heard the rumors from across the state. 
“For that Cokeville study, Game and Fish went up there and they found no lions,” the Wyoming Houndsmen Association president said. “That’s pretty freaking alarming.” 
Maps presented at the Game and Fish’s lion season-setting meetings illustrated the heavier hunting in western Wyoming, and its population effects. During the last three-year cycle, for example, virtually all the lions killed along the Salt River Range front in eastern Star Valley were immature animals. 
Red circles denote female mountain lions and blue circles are males killed in this map that depicts hunting success in Wyoming’s hunt area 26, which surrounds Star Valley, the Salt River Range and western reaches of the Wyoming Range. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
There was a discussion about returning to the lower quotas, Thompson said, but ultimately, in conjunction with Game and Fish’s regional offices, they opted to keep the pressure ratcheted up. 
“We want to maintain our ability to manage mountain lions as Game and Fish,” Thompson said. 
Last winter, Rep. Mike Schmid, a La Barge Republican who lives butted up against the badly winterkilled mule deer range, ran a bill that would have essentially stripped state wildlife managers of their authority over lions. The idea met overwhelming opposition and died.

If Wyoming wildlife managers do someday opt to allow for healthier mountain lion populations, they know from experience that the big cats can bounce back. Even where mountain lions were extirpated during the settlement era, like the Black Hills, cats eventually reoccupied and thrived due to the normally sturdy deer population. In a place like the Wyoming Range and western Bighorns, lions haven’t been hunted out of existence — just greatly reduced. 
“If there’s adequate immigration, it takes three years to get some of the densities back,” Thompson said. “Five years to get that social structure back.”
Game and Fish commissioners still must OK the draft mountain lion regulations, which will govern what the state’s hunting seasons — and, in turn, cougar populations — look like for the next three years. The governor-appointed body is set to review the proposal on July 16 in Casper. 
Commission meetings provide a stage for the public to weigh in on mountain lions, whether they want to urge killing more of them or advocate for taking it easier on Wyoming’s population. Houndsmen typically play the role of mountain lion advocates, but they largely didn’t appear, at least during the public meetings about the draft regulations. In Pinedale, for example, zero houndsmen turned out to hear about plans to retain 50% more mortality in a region where hunting pressure has been taking its toll.

(Courtesy of Getty Images)In the debate over how to fund Pennsylvania’s roads, bridges and transit systems, one counterproductive misconception persists: that mass transit, and specifically SEPTA, is a “Philadelphia problem.” Nothing could be further from the truth.
From Pike County to Erie County, Westmoreland County to Lehigh County, Pennsylvania’s businesses rely on a robust network of roads, bridges and transit systems to bring employees to work and attract customers. What every Pennsylvania county shares is public transportation that connects people and communities to work, school and essential services.
Here in Chester County, and the Greater Philadelphia region, our economic growth has been undergirded by this system, with SEPTA mass transit at its foundation. 
SEPTA is an essential cog in the economic engine of Southeastern Pennsylvania — an engine that generates billions in economic output and tax revenue for the entire state. A weakened SEPTA means a weakened regional economy, and that ripples out to the rest of Pennsylvania in real dollars. The income, business, and sales taxes generated here help fund state programs and services that benefit all 67 counties. When our region suffers due to impaired transit, the state’s ability to reinvest equitably across Pennsylvania suffers too.
Counties across Pennsylvania also benefit directly from SEPTA’s operations every day — not just through travel, but through jobs, procurement, and commerce. Over the past five years, SEPTA has awarded over $1.14 billion in contracts to Pennsylvania-based companies in 39 counties, with an average annual investment of $228 million. That’s not just rail cars and bus routes in the southeast — that’s steel, rubber, electronics, parts, safety equipment, and professional services supporting jobs across the Commonwealth.
If SEPTA is forced to cut service or delay infrastructure upgrades due to unstable state funding, it’s not just riders in the southeast who are directly impacted. It’s those employers and the Pennsylvanians they employ who will also feel the impact. SEPTA is one of the largest transit systems in the country and one of Pennsylvania’s largest purchasers of goods and services — and when funding cannot fully support operations, that economic activity across the entire Commonwealth is also reduced.
This is proof of a fundamental truth: mass transit is regional infrastructure with statewide economic impact.
We fully support statewide transit funding to address SEPTA’s shortfall this year to avoid devastating cuts. But we also recognize the need for a long-term, sustainable solution that ensures our public transit systems — not just in Philadelphia, but across the state — are viable for the future. We are not suggesting a blank check or permanent patchwork. We are advocating for a smart, stable, and transparent approach that recognizes the shared value of a functioning, modern transit system.
Now is not the time to retreat. With major global events like America 250, the FIFA World Cup, the MLB All-Star Game, the PGA Championship and the NFL Draft all coming to Pennsylvania in the next year, our transit infrastructure must be ready to move tens of millions of visitors efficiently and safely. Without it, the region — and the state — will miss out on untold economic opportunity and global visibility.
Pennsylvania must now rise to meet this moment — and not just to “save” transit, but to invest in what it already delivers: regional economic impact, workforce access, and job creation.
This isn’t about urban vs. rural or east vs. west. It’s about building a statewide economy that moves — powered by a mass transit system that serves millions of Pennsylvanians in all 67 counties. 
If you’re a business owner or policymaker outside of southeastern Pennsylvania, don’t think of SEPTA as someone else’s concern. Think of it as your next contract, your next job posting, your next opportunity. It’s time we fund transit operations across all of Pennsylvania like the statewide engine it is.

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past month, including offenses related to cockroach infestations, rodents, expired food and operating without a license.
In one instance, a restaurant was fined for serving food without first obtaining a license and approval from the state. In another, a restaurant’s kitchen was temporarily closed down after an inspector realized the business had no way to sanitize dishes and food preparation utensils.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between May 14 and June 17. (In March, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure, for eight days past the date of inspection, all food-safety inspection reports.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
Azteca 4, 3566 N. Brady St., Davenport – During a June 3 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number, and several good-practice violations.
Among the issues: Open containers of food product on the shelves near the walk-in cooler were visibly contaminated with mouse-like droppings; raw pork was stored above heads of lettuce, risking cross-contamination, and several staff members were observed failing to wash their hands and change gloves after handling raw steak and chicken.
Also, unrefrigerated shredded cheese was stored near the grill and was measured at 50 degrees; date-markings to ensure freshness and safety were inconsistent with some workers dating products for the day they were prepared and others dating products for the day they were to be discarded; carnitas inside the walk-in cooler had been held for more than the maximum of seven days, and several knives in the clean-knife rack were soiled with food debris.
In addition, the shelving in the walk-in cooler was soiled with food debris, as was the steel shelving below the steam table, and vacuum-sealed tilapia and steak were being thawed without first being removed their packaging to reduce to the risk of spoilage going undetected.
The inspector also noted that raw, whole fish was being thawed in standing water, and reported that “cockroach-like insects” had been found throughout the back kitchen area. Also, “mouse-like droppings were found throughout the back kitchen area and on shelving,” and there were “cockroach-like insect carcasses at various stages of life” were seen throughout the back kitchen area.
The inspector also reported there was hot water supplied to the handwashing sink in the back food-prep area, and tiles and baseboards throughout the kitchen were missing, loose or in disrepair. “Flooring throughout the back kitchen area has standing water,” the inspector reported.
The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint from a customer who alleged they dined at Azteca 4 June 2 and observed live roaches in the restaurant. The complaint was deemed verified. According to the county inspector, a pest-control technician who had recently visited the restaurant noted in a report that tiles and baseboards were missing and broken and there was “standing water throughout the facility” — issues that could be contributing to the proliferation of pests.
On June 4, the inspector returned and reported, “Progress has been made on additional cleaning throughout the kitchen. Dead cockroach-like insects still present throughout, as well as mouse droppings.”
On June 5, the inspector returned again and reported, “Facility has made even more progress, but additional re-inspections will need to be done as pests are still present.”
On June 10, the inspector was back and reported that “roaches and mouse-like droppings are being addressed by additional cleaning.”
On June 13, the inspector returned and reported, “Significant improvements have been made with pest control issues. No live activity during today’s visit.”
City Loafers, 215 N. Main St., Davenport – During a June 17 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the issues: Pork stored in the preparation cooler was measured at 69 to 70 degrees and had to be discarded; several food items were not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety; precooked chicken wings had a date-marking of May 6, five weeks prior to the inspection, and had to be discarded; and mold was found on black olives, sliced peppers and raw salmon stored in the main kitchen’s walk-in cooler.
Also, there was ham date-marked May 21 and roast beef date-marked June 4 inside the walk-in cooler, and excess food debris was found on the bakers’ racks and the interior of all the coolers in the kitchen.
The inspector also noted there was water pooling on the bottom of the food-preparation cooler in the main kitchen; the equipment in the main kitchen was marred by “excess food debris and grease,” and there was an excessive amount of dust and debris in several other areas.
McDonald’s, 3621 Lincoln Way, Ames – During a June 17 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for liquid eggs, ham, and rehydrated onions in the reach-in cooler that were measured at 47 to 54 degrees, and which had to be discarded. Also, the interior of the ice machine was noted to have a “buildup of organic matter” within it. The restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in July 2023, according to state records.
Pella Golf & Country Club, 600 Elm St., Pella – During a June 13 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector reported there were home-canned food items found on a shelf in the food-preparation area and which had to be discarded as coming from an unapproved source. Also, food items on the salad bar were not maintained at 41 degrees or colder, with the creamy pasta salad measured at 49 degrees, the potato salad at 54 degrees and the boiled eggs at 56 degrees. All of the items were discarded.
In addition, several house-made sauces were held past the maximum of seven days and had to be discarded, and the interior of the ice machine was soiled. The restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in July 2021, according to state records.
Tipton Family Restaurant, 101 4th St., Tipton — During a June 13 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and concluded the business lacked adequate controls for monitoring established systems and practices such as employee handwashing, monitoring food temperatures and preventing cross-contamination of food.
The inspector also noted that raw pork and beef were stored above ready-to-eat food inside the coolers, and rice cooked the previous day had yet to cool to 41 degrees and had to be discarded. Also, whole eggs were stored on a kitchen cart at room temperature, and grilled onions and cooked rice had been held longer than the maximum of seven days.
Szechuan House, 320 E. Burlington St., Iowa City – During a June 10 visit, a Johnson County inspector reported that “pieced-out chicken” was being stored “in a bucket of water that is at room temperature, 71 degrees,” and had to be discarded. Also, raw fish was being stored over ready-to-eat noodles inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination, and raw eggs were being stored on a table at 68 degrees. “Multiple knives hanging on the wall towards the rear of the kitchen near the walk-in (cooler) are visibly dirty,” the inspector added.
Simon’s, 5800 Franklin Ave., Des Moines – During a June 10 visit, a state inspector reported that pans of food, such as meatballs, were left uncovered in the walk-in cooler, risking contamination. Also, the pizza table was holding food at 48 to 55 degrees, resulting in all of the associated food items that had been prepared more than two hours earlier being discarded.  The inspector also noted that pasta inside the walk-cooler had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. In addition, the dishwashing machine was not properly sanitizing dishes, and a pan of shrimp was stored in the kitchen’s handwashing sink.
Burger Shed, 500 Bass Pro Drive, Altoona – During a May 14 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 15 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number, and concluded that the business lacked adequate controls for monitoring established systems and practices such as handwashing and maintaining proper food temperatures.
The inspector reported that smoked chicken wings placed in the walk-in cooler two days earlier had yet to cool to 41 degrees and were holding at 46 degrees. Also, pans of cooked cheeseburger soups placed in the cooler four hours earlier were measured at 82 to 86 degrees. The soup and the chicken wings were discarded.
The inspector also made note of numerous other cold food items that were being held at 44 to 59 degrees and which had to be discarded, including sliced tomatoes, house-made ranch dressing, cut lettuce, burger patties, smoked wings, macaroni and cheese balls, honey mustard, cheddar cheese and sour cream. The inspector also observed that racks of buns were being stored in a dry storage area on the ground.
Aunt Emmy’s, 114 N. Franklin St., Manchester – During a June 9 visit, a state inspector found that food products inside a retail-sales cooler were holding at temperatures above the maximum 41 degrees, resulting in homemade soup and other items being discarded. The inspector also reported that cooked meats, homemade soups and burritos that were stored in freezers had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety, and that homemade ranch dressing and roasted red pepper dressing had been held for more than the maximum of seven days. The restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in March 2022, according to state records.
Lili La Catrachita, 86th Street and Hickman Road, Clive – During a June 9 visit to this food truck, a state inspector reported that rotisserie chickens from Sam’s Club did not bear the required mark of inspection for a food-service establishment. The business agreed to discontinue serving the prepared Sam’s Club chickens in the future. The inspector also noted that hot rotisserie chickens were measured at 107 degrees and beans at 118 degrees, which resulted in both items being discarded, while cold rotisserie chickens were measured at 44 to 51 degrees and also had to be discarded.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1201 12th Ave. SW, Le Mars – During a June 6 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department noted there was raw, ground pork stored next to whole-muscle pork, without the required barrier to prevent cross-contamination, in the meat counter area. Also, various bags of shredded lettuce were measured at 48 to 49 degrees, too warm to ensure their safety, and had to be discarded.
In addition, cooked eggs and breakfast sandwiches in the convenience store had been held for more than the maximum of seven days and were discarded. The inspector also reported that meat crumbles in the kitchen cooler, used for pizzas, had been held for more than seven days, and that hot food items on the roller grill of the convenience store were not time stamped to indicate when the products must be thrown out.
Avion Express, 619 Buddy Holly Place, Clear Lake – During a June 6 visit, a Cerro Gordo County inspector reported there was “no running water to supply the handwashing sinks.” In addition, ground beef in the steam table was measured at only 124 degrees, and “many items” items in the food-preparation line were measured at 48 to 54 degrees.
Landmark, 128 W. Evans St., Williamsburg – During a June 4 visit, a state inspector found diced fruit with mold on it inside the walk-in cooler. Also, mushrooms, turkey and ribs were not properly labeled, and pasta, lemon waffle mix, apple waffle mix, and stroganoff sauce were all held past the maximum of seven days.
In addition, frozen fish that was stored in vacuum-sealed packaging was not removed from the packaging before thawing to reduce the risk of any spoilage going undetected. Also, the floors and walls were reported as “not clean.” The visit was prompted by a non-illness complaint alleging inadequate cooking. The complaint was deemed unverified.
Foundry Food & Tap, 3266 Crosspark Road, Coralville – During a June 3 visit, a Johnson County inspector reported observing an employee handling ready-to-eat lettuce with their bare hands. Also, chicken was being cooked to an internal temperature of only 115 degrees. An employee was instructed to return the chicken to the grill and cook it to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees. Also, mashed potatoes in a hot-holding unit were measured at only 119 degrees and had to be reheated on the grill to at least 165 degrees.
Bunkers, 1900 Country Club Drive, Coralville – During a May 30 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted that a worker handled raw hamburger then went to touch ready-to-eat bread without changing gloves or washing hands. In addition, an ice machine had a buildup of “debris,” multiple containers of sliced tomatoes were not date-marked, and multiple containers of commercial sauces were not marked with the date they were opened.
Also, chicken was being cooled in a metal pan stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler, there was a buildup of grease behind the wall on the grill line, and there were large amounts of dust buildup on the ceiling fans in the kitchen. “Multiple ceiling tiles are missing from ceiling,” the inspector reported. “Ceiling is no longer water resistant or cleanable.” The inspector also reported that the establishment had not posted its license of its most recent inspection report.
Tony’s Chicago Pizza and Breakfast, 2297 Falcon Ave., Bettendorf – During a May 30 visit, a Scott County inspector observed an employee cutting fresh strawberries without gloves and noted that packages of raw ground sausage were stored above ready-to-eat food products, risking cross-contamination. Also, meatballs and marinara sauce were measured at 68 degrees to 110 degrees while being held on the steam table and had to be reheated to 165 degrees before being returned to the steam table.
In addition, a large beef roast that was cooked the previous day had yet to cool to 41 degrees in the walk-in cooler and had to be discarded. The inspector reported that several prepared products had been held for more than the maximum of seven days, including sausage dated May 17, and several containers of au jus dated May 16 and May 22. In addition, the staff was not washing cantaloupe prior to cutting for use in fruit cups.
King’s Harvest, 824 W. 3rd St., Davenport – During a May 21 visit, a Scott County inspector reported the restaurant was not employing a certified food protection manager as required. Also, the inspector found packaged ground beef and breakfast sausage patties that were labeled “not for sale” and which had to be discarded, as well as an assortment of fruits and vegetables in dented cans. “Mouse-like droppings on shelving in back food-storage room and in flour bin,” the inspector reported, adding that was an excess of food debris in the drawer used to store clean utensils.
La Amiguita Fruteria, 428 NE 4th St., Hampton – During a May 19 visit, a state inspector cited this business of 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and noted that the person in charge was not a certified food protection manager and did not adequately demonstrate knowledge of food safety principles. The business was cited for being unable to verify that its ice cream was from a licensed, approved facility, and for having homemade fruit syrups that were prepared in a private residence. In addition, the business lacked the ability to properly sanitize dishes due to the absence of any food-safe chemical sanitizing solution. As a result, the kitchen was closed for food preparation until that issue could be addressed.
Tavern 61, 202 W. Mayne St., Blue Grass – During a May 16 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that employees were not properly maintaining the temperatures of food items. Taco meat that was left in a warmer for an hour was measured at only 51 degrees and had to be reheated to 165 degrees before being returned to the warmer. In addition, employees left their drink cups and cell phones on food-preparation surfaces and were seen handling hamburger buns and ready-to-eat foods with their bare hands.
Also, several homemade dressings had been held for more than the maximum of seven days, there was a buildup of a pink substance in the bulk ice chest, there was no hot water supplied to one handwashing sink, and frozen pizza crusts were being stored on the floor of the walk-in freezer.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIAL-INSPECTIONS.jpg,,,2025-06-25 18:07:36.108581
,DC,2025-06-25 21:11:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"$1,000 'Trump Accounts' for babies skewed toward the wealthy, critics say",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/1000-trump-accounts-babies-skewed-toward-wealthy-critics-say,,"WASHINGTON — Tucked in the “one big beautiful bill” is a proposal for tax-advantaged “Trump Accounts,” each seeded with $1,000 from the government for certain babies born in the United States over the next few years.But financial experts and advocates for low-income children are not overly impressed.The idea is not new and has been likened to other “baby bonds” programs aimed at reducing the growing wealth gap, like state-run trust funds in California and Connecticut. Democrats in Congress have introduced a bill to create a similar federal program. The White House has touted the proposal in the tax and spending cut measure as “pro-family” and one that “will afford a generation of children the chance to experience the miracle of compounded growth.”At a June 9 event to promote the “Trump Accounts” featuring CEOs of top American companies, President Donald Trump promised the pilot program will make it possible for “countless American children to have a strong start in life at no cost to the American taxpayer.”Speaking at the same event, top House Republican tax writer Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri said “every child born under this policy will have a better shot at a future. It does not matter if they live on a city block or on a county road, this will make a significant difference to their lives.”Critics say the accounts, as proposed, would mostly benefit children born to wealthier families.They also say the restricted-access accounts, and the one-time government contribution of $1,000, will not help in the face of cuts to food and health programs for low-income people written into the massive budget reconciliation bill, titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”How ‘Trump Accounts’ would workThe investment savings accounts would be available to U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028, and whose parent, or parents, if legally married, already have Social Security numbers.Each year, from a child’s birth to age 18, family and friends, parents’ employers, churches and other private foundations, could contribute up to a combined $5,000 annually to the investment account that will track a stock index and gain interest accordingly.Deposits into the account are taxed. Later on, withdrawals would be subject to the long-term capital gains tax — a tax on the profit made from selling an asset, or investment, that a person has held for longer than a year.After reaching 18, the account beneficiary could access half the account’s value only for qualified expenses that include higher education, vocational training, the purchase of a first home, and costs associated with an enterprise for which the beneficiary has received a small business loan or small farm loan.The beneficiary could access the remaining half of the account after age 25. At age 31, the account loses its status as a “Trump Account” and any remaining balance is taxed as income.Drawbacks seenThe Urban Institute warns that the proposed structure of the account will mostly benefit wealthy families who already have the resources to grow the funds.The bottom 80% of households, by income, only hold half as much cash on hand as the top 20% of households, according to the left-leaning think tank’s nationwide financial health data.Additionally, because of penalties for early withdrawals, lower-income families would be incentivized to save in less restrictive accounts, according to the think tank’s May 27 analysis.The institute recommends the government provide more contributions based on income level, beyond just the one-time $1,000, and lessen the penalties for accessing cash for catastrophic events.A 2023 Democratic legislative proposal put forth by Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Ayana Pressley of Massachusetts aimed to create an account that would target the benefit to children from lower-income households.Their plan suggests accounts be initially seeded with $1,000, and then children would receive up to an additional $2,000 annually based on their family’s income level.According to Booker’s and Pressley’s plan, a child from a family of four that brings in less than $25,100 in annual income would have an estimated $46,200 in investment savings by the time they turn 18.Under the Trump Account proposal, a child’s one-time $1,000 deposit from the government would grow to roughly $5,000 by age 18 if no other contributions were ever made, according to the Urban Institute.Child tax creditsBrendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the GOP proposal “wasn’t particularly well thought through.”“It's this question of whether it makes more sense to give every family $1,000 that they can’t access in those really important years, or whether you should have expanded the child tax credit,” Duke said.Duke criticized lawmakers’ proposals that do not expand the child tax credit to the lowest-income families in the massive GOP budget reconciliation package.While the House version temporarily expands the credit to $2,500 per child, up from $2,000, and the Senate version permanently expands the credit by a more modest amount of $2,200, neither version expands income or refundability parameters that would benefit the poorest families.The CBPP estimates that 17 million children are left out of the credit because of the restrictions.Existing savings vehiclesAnother criticism of the Trump Accounts is that they provide a redundant option among the several existing tax-preferred savings vehicles for Americans, including 529 education investment savings accounts, Roth and Traditional IRAs and Health Savings Accounts.The Tax Foundation’s Alex Muresianu said the account is “a move toward complexity rather than simplification.”“We already have plenty of savings accounts with specific purposes, and a lot of different strings attached,” said Muresianu, senior policy analyst with the right-leaning foundation.“We don't really need another targeted account for a specific purpose, rather than a more easily accessible account with fewer conditions.”",,,,2025-06-25 18:07:36.108581

Tony Evers overstepped his partial veto power by exercising it on a bill to implement new literacy programs in the state. Evers scolded the decision, while lawmakers said it upheld the balance of power and that they plan to release the funds now. 
The decision reverses a lower court, which ruled Evers hadn’t overstepped his power but held that the court did not have the power to compel the Legislature to release the funds. 
The case, Wisconsin State Legislature v. Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, involves 2023 Wisconsin Act 100 — one part of a series of measures meant to support the creation of new literacy programs in Wisconsin. 
In the 2023-25 budget, lawmakers and Evers approved $50 million for new literacy programs but the funding went into a supplemental fund, meaning it required the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee to approve its release to the Department of Public Instruction before it could be used.
2023 Wisconsin Act 20  created an Office of Literacy within the Department of Public Instruction, which would be responsible for establishing an early literacy coaching program and awarding grants to schools. Act 100  was a separate law to create a way for the agency to expend the money transferred by the Joint Committee on Finance.
Evers exercised a partial veto when signing Act 100 into law to expand it from covering a “literacy coaching program” to covering a “literacy program.” The action led to lawmakers withholding the funding, saying he didn’t have the authority to change the law’s purpose, the argument at the center of their subsequent lawsuit. Evers’ administration had argued the bill was an appropriation, and therefore it was within the governor’s powers to partially veto it, and that the Legislature was not within its right to withhold the money.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the Legislature had not been improperly withholding the funding from DPI and that Act 100 was not an appropriation, so Evers overstepped the boundaries of the veto power given to him in the Wisconsin State Constitution. The decision overturns part of the ruling of a Dane County judge.
The state constitution gives the governor the power to sign or veto bills in full, and a 1930 amendment gave the governor the power to partially veto “appropriation bills.” Wisconsin’s executive partial veto power is one of the strongest in the country, though it has been limited over the last several decades by constitutional amendments and through Court rulings.
The state Supreme Court’s 7-0 ruling Wednesday reigns in Evers’ partial veto power.
Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in the majority opinion that the bills “did not set aside public funds for a public purpose” but rather “created accounts into which money could be transferred to fund the programs established under Act 19 [the state budget] and Act 20, and it changed other aspects of the ‘literacy coaching program.’”
“The bill, however, does not set aside any public funds; in fact, it expressly states that “$0” was appropriated,” Bradley wrote.  
Bradley said it was within the Legislature’s authority to pass the bills in the way that it did, and the Constitution only gives the governor power to “veto in part only appropriation bills — not bills that are closely related to appropriation bills.”
“Although the executive branch may be frustrated by constitutional limits on the governor’s power to veto non-appropriation bills, the judiciary must respect the People’s choice to impose them,” Bradley wrote. “This court has no authority to interfere with the Legislature’s choices to structure legislation in a manner designed to insulate non-appropriation bills from the governor’s exercise of the partial veto power.” 
Under the ruling, the law will revert to what it was when the Legislature passed it.
Another recent state Supreme Court ruling upheld another of Evers’ partial vetoes that extended school revenue increases for 400 years, though that decision was split. In that ruling, the Supreme Court said lawmakers could avoid the partial veto power by drafting bills separate from appropriation bills. Republican lawmakers have been considering for years ways to limit Evers’ veto power, and it remains an issue of controversy in the current budget process as lawmakers pass bills without funding attached. 
Evers called the Supreme Court decision “unconscionable” and urged lawmakers to release the nearly $50 million.
“Twelve lawmakers should not be able to obstruct resources that were already approved by the full Legislature and the governor to help get our kids up to speed and ensure they have the skills they need to be successful,” Evers said in a statement. “It is unconscionable that the Wisconsin Supreme Court is allowing the Legislature’s indefinite obstruction to go unchecked.” 
Evers said he would accept the Court’s decision.
“A basic but fundamental responsibility of governors and executives is to dutifully comply with decisions of a court and the judiciary, even if — and, perhaps most importantly, when — we disagree,” Evers said. 
Evers said lawmakers failing to release the funds would be “reckless” and “irresponsible.” 
“Stop messing around with our kids and their futures and get it done,” Evers said. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said in a joint statement that the ruling is a “rebuke of the Governor’s attempt to break apart a bipartisan literacy-funding bill and JFC’s constitutional authority to give supplemental funding to agencies.”
“While the Governor wanted to play politics with money earmarked for kids’ reading programs, it is encouraging to see the Court put an end to this game,” Vos and LeMahieu said. “Wisconsin families are the real winners here.”
The end of the state’s fiscal year and deadline for getting the next state budget done is June 30, and if the money isn’t released, it will lapse back into the general fund going back to the state’s $4 billion budget surplus.
Co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) and Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a joint statement they plan to release the funds now that the Supreme Court has ruled on the issue
“The Supreme Court’s unanimous decision confirmed what we already knew: the Governor’s partial veto of Act 100 was unconstitutional. We are happy to see that the court ruled in favor of the Legislature as a co-equal branch of government and provided us much needed guidance,” the lawmakers said. “Now that there is clarity, we look forward to releasing the $50 million set aside to support kids struggling to read and help implement these important, bipartisan reforms. It is unfortunate that the Governor’s unconstitutional veto has delayed this funding needed by kids and families across the state.”
At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee called for lawmakers to meet before Monday to release the funds. 
“Unless the Joint Finance Committee acts before Monday, those kids and those school districts will not see another dime. Wisconsinites are tired of Republicans playing politics with our public schools,” Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said. She noted that Evers had requested an additional $80 million for literacy in his budget proposal, but lawmakers have so far not included that.

Republican lawmakers have approved the K-12 portion of the state budget, which includes an increase for the state’s special education reimbursement rate from about 32% to 37.5% and a 90% rate for high cost special education in the second year of the budget, along with funding for other priorities. Democrats and education advocates have been critical, saying that the budgeted amounts are not enough to ease the financial burdens public schools are facing.
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said Democrats haven’t heard from Republican lawmakers about working on the budget.
“We are ready to work,” Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said. “We would like to see immediately some action on the funding that is going to disappear if it’s not spent by June 30th, particularly the literacy funding. The Joint Finance Committee has also refused to release other funds, including $125 million to combat PFAS and $15 million to support Chippewa Valley hospitals.
Roys said it was “great to hear” that the co-chairs said they would release the funds and that she hopes he “stands by his word.” 
State Superintendent Jill Underly also urged the release of the funds, saying part of the compromise struck by Evers and lawmakers was “to provide districts with funding to implement new strategies and change practices” and districts have been working to implement the literacy changes but have yet to see funding.
“It is devastating that despite bipartisan agreement on how to proceed, we have been stuck in neutral,” Underly said. 
Peggy Wirtz-Olsen, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC), the state’s largest teachers’ union, said in a statement that Republican lawmakers are “bent on using schools as pawns for political payback” and are giving “lip service to literacy, while leaving educators without funding to do our job.” 
“On the cusp of another state budget, these same politicians again threaten to underfund public schools instead of working across the aisle for the good of students,” Wirtz-Olsen said, adding that WEAC will continue to advocate for funding from the state.

(Stock photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Cherokee County is the latest county to announce a deal for a new data center, adding to the growing fleet of the energy gobblers across the Palmetto State.
Texas-based Cielo Digital Infrastructure has pledged to invest $2.1 billion in a data center campus with four 400,000-square-foot buildings near Gaffney in South Carolina’s Upstate. The center is expected to open by the end of 2028 and employ 30 people.
“This project not only brings cutting-edge technology to our region but also creates high-quality jobs and long-term economic growth,” Cherokee County Council Chairman Tim Spencer said in a statement.
The center joins previously announced centers including a $2.8 billion investment by NorthMark Strategies in Spartanburg County, an $800 million center in Aiken being developed by Facebook parent company Meta, a $1 billion QTS data center under development in York County, a pair of Google data centers in the Lowcountry, and four DC Blox data centers — two operating and two under development — around the state.
These centers house rows of computer servers needed to keep ever-advancing artificial intelligence and other technology humming. But they also use vast amounts of energy, with larger centers requiring upwards of 200 megawatts each.
SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

Cielo, on its website, advertises the Gaffney property as having a capacity of up to 300 megawatts.
The company, which bills itself more as an expert in data center development than a center operator, did not respond to questions from the SC Daily Gazette about whether it will retain ownership of the site or build it on behalf of other users.
“We identify and negotiate sites ready for data center development,” the company website reads. Our site selection process includes comprehensive understanding of power flows and fiber access across the U.S.”
Cherokee County Council finalized the deal with Cielo this week, offering tax incentives to entice the company to the area.
But Ken Moon, executive director of the county’s development board, would not provide any details on the size or length of those tax breaks, saying “the paperwork has not been finalized.” He told the Gazette that would not be made public for a few weeks.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

John Hoffman and his wife, who were wounded.The resolution, sponsored by Rep. Kelly Morrison, who represents the suburban Minneapolis district where the Hortmans lived, also condemned political violence. Each of the seven other members of Minnesota’s bipartisan U.S. House delegation cosponsored the legislation and spoke in support on the House floor this week.No House member spoke against the resolution during brief floor debate Tuesday. It passed 424-0 Wednesday, with eight members not voting.Morrison, a Democrat, urged her colleagues to view the attacks as a “wake-up call” to tone down violent political rhetoric.“The escalation and normalization of violent rhetoric and political violence have gone way too far, and we as elected representatives have to take the lead and be the first to speak out and to start to model a better path forward,” Morrison said. “Let's make this the moment where we unequivocally condemn and commit to ending violent rhetoric, full stop. We have to make this horrific act of targeted political violence a watershed moment for our country.”Rep. Pete Stauber, a Republican, said by targeting elected officials, the gunman attacked democracy.“Make no mistake: This was not just an attack on the Hortman, Hoffman families,” Stauber said Tuesday. “This was an attack on the state of Minnesota and our shared ideals as Americans. Political violence such as this threatens the very fabric of our constitutional republic and can never be ignored or met without condemnation.”June 14 shootingsMelissa and Mark Hortman were killed in the early morning of June 14 by a man impersonating a police officer.The suspected killer, 57-year-old Vance Boelter, arrived at the Hortman home after shooting John and Yvette Hoffman in their home and visiting the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers, according to police, who also said they found a list of other elected officials in Boelter's car.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz described the attack as “a politically motivated assassination.”Police captured Boelter on June 15 after a nearly two-day search.

(Photo by Washington State Standard)Washington is facing a housing emergency. On that point, leaders from across the political spectrum can agree. 
During my time as a state lawmaker, I was proud to co-sponsor legislation to raise the minimum wage, bringing Washington wages closer to a true living wage. But even the highest minimum wage possible isn’t enough to keep up with today’s runaway housing costs. 
Today, a household with two full-time workers each earning the minimum of $16.66 an hour would be unable to comfortably afford a typical modest one-bedroom rental, an analysis by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found. The cost of shelter has outpaced wages for years, forcing families to make impossible choices. 

According to a 2024 Washington State Housing Finance Commission and Washington State Department of Commerce report, nearly half of Washington renters are rent-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income just to keep a roof over their heads. 
There’s no question that Washington needs bold action. But to solve this crisis, we have to address the real causes and resist the urge to focus on convenient scapegoats. 
At the heart of the problem is a long-term shortage of housing. That is why, just weeks ago, Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a slew of new bills to make it easier to build in this state — because more housing supply is what ultimately reduces housing costs. Still, much more needs to be done. 
For decades, zoning laws and permitting delays have made it difficult to build enough homes to keep pace with our population. Washington has made some important strides recently, including new legislation to allow more multi-unit housing in single-family zones. That law was a meaningful step toward reversing exclusionary zoning and opening the door for “missing middle” housing options like duplexes and fourplexes. 
But zoning reform is just the beginning. We also need to speed up permitting timelines and reduce unnecessary red tape, especially for affordable and workforce housing. When it takes years to get a project approved, costs go up and fewer homes get built. Nonprofit developers and public-private partnerships in particular need faster paths to bring affordable housing online. 
Washington also needs to invest more consistently in long-term affordability. Our state Housing Trust Fund is a powerful tool, but it can’t meet current demand without increased funding and better coordination across regions. We should also provide support to community land trusts, nonprofit housing providers, and cooperative housing. This will keep homes permanently affordable and these types of organizations are rooted in the communities they serve. 
Unfortunately, some recent policy proposals risk distracting from these urgent priorities. For example, there has been a growing push in the Legislature to restrict or even ban rent-pricing software, a type of technological tool that landlords sometimes use to analyze local market conditions and estimate their rental rates.
But as Colorado’s Democratic Governor Jared Polis made clear when he vetoed similar legislation in May, these systems don’t create the state’s housing shortages or the nation’s economic inflation; they only report on how those issues are affecting the marketplace. When there’s more housing demand than supply, prices go up with or without software.
Blaming a software algorithm for housing unaffordability is like blaming a thermometer for a heatwave. In fact, these tools can sometimes help landlords respond more quickly to changing market conditions, lowering rents when demand softens and giving developers more confidence to build where homes are needed most. Banning the use of these digital tools won’t make rent cheaper — it will just make the housing market less efficient and less predictable.
Solving Washington’s housing crisis will require all of us — local officials, state lawmakers, developers, advocates, and neighbors — to focus on what works. That means building more homes, protecting renters, modernizing outdated policies, and using data and innovation to guide smart growth. The stakes are too high for distraction or delay. Let’s keep our eyes on the real problem — and the real solutions Washington families need.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/housing-apartment-construction-olympia-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

(Photo by Shelby Wyatt for Source NM)Even though state lawmakers have allocated billions of dollars in the last few years to improve access to health care, New Mexicans’ physical and mental health outcomes have remained the same or worsened, health officials and legislative analysts say.
A higher proportion of New Mexicans of all ages had substance use disorders in 2024 compared to the prior year, and more young people had major depressive episodes, according to data cited in a presentation by Legislative Finance Committee Analyst Eric Chenier and New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo.
While fewer women in New Mexico are dying during or shortly after pregnancy, more children are being born with low birth weights and withdrawal symptoms from being exposed to drugs while in the womb, according to data cited in the presentation.
As for access, fewer people are actually going to doctors’ offices than before the COVID-19 pandemic, but more people are seeing mental health practitioners, the data show. The report notes that it relies on utilization data that only shows if providers billed for more services, not necessarily if more Medicaid patients are receiving care.
New Mexico ranks 16th in access to behavioral health care overall, Armijo told the Legislative Finance Committee at its meeting in Taos on Wednesday.
“We’re not at the top, but it shows the interventions are working,” she said. “The state has really done a lot of work to rebuild the behavioral health system. We’re struggling with a new set of issues, in many ways, that weren’t present a decade ago.”
Medicaid
The New Mexico Medicaid program operates as the largest payer of health insurance in the state, covering approximately a third of the state’s population, Armijo said.
According to the presentation, Medicaid is “the greatest lever available to the state to reduce the prevalence of mental illness and substance use disorders and improve physical health for women and children.”
Approximately 4,000 new health care providers have joined the Medicaid network in the last 11 months, Armijo said. Of those, 57% work as behavioral health providers and 29% are in primary care, she said.
Lawmakers most recently increased provider reimbursement rates to 137% of the rate paid by Medicaid, Armijo said.
New Mexico has paid out $2.2 billion in reimbursements to health care providers, Chenier said, including $1.3 billion to hospitals and $90 million to behavioral health providers.
New Mexico has put approximately $550 million in one-time funding for behavioral health services, LFC Analyst Eric Chenier said.
Armijo said the Medicaid unwinding at the end of the public health emergency for COVID-19 resulted in the number of people enrolled in the program to drop from more than 1 million to approximately 839,000. She said the rolls are “leveling off” and are not growing.
Less than 5% of New Mexicans who lost Medicaid during ‘unwinding’ switched to private insurance

Primary care
Primary care is an entry point for behavioral health because it is the most likely setting where someone will actually receive behavioral health services, Armijo said. Primary care providers can prescribe medication-assisted treatment for substance use disorder, for example.
Among all U.S. states, New Mexico ranks 29th in access for primary care services, according to data in the presentation.
“It’s not where we want to be, but [it’s] not the worst,” Armijo said.
The network of primary care providers has grown every year, Armijo said, and nearly every provider in the state received a raise because of lawmakers’ reimbursement rate increase that went into effect in January.
For future discussions, Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) asked about a way to gather data on how long it takes for new patients to see a primary care provider versus existing patients, and how that breaks down between urban and rural parts of New Mexico.
How the ‘one big beautiful bill’ could play out
Because of Medicaid’s outsized influence in New Mexico’s health insurance market, the federal tax and spending legislation under consideration by Congress would impact not only Medicaid recipients but all New Mexicans, Armijo said.
New Mexico would lose $2.8 billion in federal medicaid funding under the reconciliation bill, she said.
The legislation would result in 111 health care providers losing funding, Armijo said, and the potential closure of between six and eight rural hospitals.
Almost 90,000 people would lose Medicaid because of work requirements and other requirements proposed in the bill, she said.
People on Medicaid are often working a minimum wage job, she said, while others are elderly or disabled who can’t just go out and find work.
“When you have people who are working, and new work requirements, you have to be very careful about how you’re administering that: You don’t want people losing it because of administrative hassle,” Armijo said. “Work requirements can be confusing to comply with.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-25 20:53:24+00:00,CT Mirror,UConn trustees debate enrollment as a solution to budget shortfall,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/uconn-budget-deficit-student-enrollment/,"To help close UConn’s deficit, leaders are looking to enroll more students from outside CT — but that could create new problems.","Facing a budget deficit and decreasing number of high schoolers graduating in Connecticut, leaders at the University of Connecticut are questioning how far the school can expand its enrollment without compromising its ability to serve students. 
Administrators have laid out plans to trim the system’s budget, but they also need to raise revenue. Neither will be simple.
In a message to colleagues on Monday, President Radenka Maric said the university and the UConn Health system were facing a $134 million budget deficit over the next two years, driven mainly by a shortage in funding from the state. She warned that the university would need to take steps to reduce costs, including hiring freezes and potential layoffs or non-renewals of temporary employees. 
The university had faced a $72 million shortfall for the coming year, but higher revenues from tuition and dining have pared that back to $38 million, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Geoghegan said at a meeting of the Board of Trustees on Wednesday. That’s still a significant gap to be mitigated.
University leaders said they see enrollment expansion as a potential way to close the gap. About 57% of UConn’s revenue comes from tuition.
Nathan Fuerst, Vice President for Student Life & Enrollment at UConn, told Board of Trustees that the university had increased its student body by 2,000 students over the last decade. In order to continue and boost that growth, he said, the school would need to enroll more out-of-state and international students, in part because the number of high school graduates in Connecticut hasn’t been growing. 
Out-of-state and international students also bring in more revenue because they pay more in tuition. The university has a goal of increasing enrollment from about 25,300 students as of fall 2024 to 28,000 students by 2027.
Out-of-state enrollment at UConn has already been trending up. According to data from the university, the percentage of students at UConn from outside the state has increased from 16% in 2021-22 to 26% this coming year 2025-26. Maric said that 2025-26 will be the first time that the percentage of students from Connecticut will fall below 70% — to 68%. 
The percentage of international students, however has remained relatively stable over the past five years — around 6% or 7%. And Maric raised concerns at a Tuesday meeting of the financial affairs committee that actions by the federal government could lead fewer international students to enroll. She referenced the federal government’s recent pause in scheduling visa interviews, which was lifted last week. 
Fuerst told the board Wednesday that the university received 64,000 applications for its freshman class last year. The incoming class numbered about 6,500 students across the campuses.
He added that the university is developing a plan for enrollment that focuses on more than just bringing in first-year students. For one, he said, the university wants to increase its retention rate for first-year students from 92% to 94%.
He said while students continued applying to UConn because of the positive experiences they had, the experience wasn’t uniform across the university. “[Students] come here, they have a good experience and they graduate on time and they’re successful in finding good jobs — high-paying jobs. But that’s not a universal experience. Our Pell [Grant] students don’t experience that same rate of success. Our underrepresented minority students don’t experience the same rate of success. Our regional campus students don’t experience the same rate of success, and so we need to acknowledge that,” Fuerst said. 
Provost Anne D’Alleva said the university was also looking at expanding its offerings to meet demands of graduate and nontraditional students, with programs offering online graduate certificates, microcredentials and specific professional development skills training. 
Maric said the university had managed to retain 600 students this past spring who were planning to drop out, either because of academic struggles or the inability to afford tuition. But to do so cost the university $1 million. 
More enrollment, more challenges
At Wednesday’s meeting, the trustees cautioned against increasing enrollment without ensuring that the increase aligned with the university’s goals and its ability to serve those students. 
“[Increasing enrollment] is extraordinarily important because of the budget situation. But it’s not so clear how we’re going to achieve that without decreasing student quality,” said Timothy Folta, a professor in UConn’s School of Business. “We’ve got increased competitors. We’ve got increasing alternatives to education, declining population of the high school graduates. So it’s not particularly conducive to the strategy of increasing.”  
Board of Trustees Chair Dan Toscano agreed, saying that growth needed to depend on capacity in the classrooms, housing and student support services. 
“I, for one, keep thinking about what is the purpose of growth,” said Toscano. “Growth is frequently a sign of a healthy organization. But you can also manufacture growth that’s actually quite damaging …  I think the further you get from this campus, the easier you think, ‘We’ll just take another thousand students,’ or ‘Take more out of state students, and that brings you more revenue,’ ‘Take more international students.’ And I just think we have to be a lot more thoughtful of those topics.” 
Chris Vials, a professor of English at UConn and president of UConn’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, expressed skepticism about the university’s strategy of increasing enrollment as a way to raise revenue. He said that if the university did not plan on hiring additional professors, the increased class sizes would diminish the quality of classes, making it difficult to hold discussions and discouraging students from speaking. 
“I don’t really see a plus to just bigger class sizes, and most students don’t either,” he said.  
Housing shortages have also been a sore point recently at UConn, with the university announcing to students this spring that it would no longer guarantee housing for upperclassmen. The university has been attempting to expand its housing options for students across its campuses. 
Fuerst said during his presentation that the university needed to ensure that enrollment growth was matched by the capacity for the university’s programs to serve students. 
Maric said in order to mitigate the budget for 2025-26, the university had elected to close the deficit using one-time payments out of the university’s fund balances. Governor Ned Lamont has urged the state’s higher education institutions — particularly the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities System — to use their reserves to shore up any holes in their budgets.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Governor Ned Lamont, said in an email that the legislature had increased the block grant amount for UConn and UConn Health by 20% in 2026. He said the university was warned that federal Covid-19 relief funds and one-time state surpluses would not continue. He also said that UConn and UConn Health had $468 million combined in reserves.
“These funds now enable UConn to be on a strong glide path, by using such reserves, to make any changes to deal with structural financial challenges,” Blanchard said. 
But Maric warned in her message to colleagues Monday that much of that funding had already been earmarked for specific things and was scattered in accounts across the university. 
“Using these funds to close short-term deficits will create new financial problems that didn’t exist previously and new unmet needs throughout the institution. And if these one-time funds become exhausted, they do not automatically replenish, and structural deficits will remain,” Maric wrote in her message. 
Maric said that budget reduction strategies in the future could include things like freezes in hiring, layoff or non-renewal of temporary workers, restrictions in travel or events spending and changes to service contracts. 
The University has also been hit by the federal government’s cuts to research grants. Geoghegan warned that the amount the university receives in new grant funding in 2026 could drop as much as $200 million below 2024 levels. Maric said the university already had 48 of its research grants cancelled, at a cost of $32.5 million. She said they had been successful in getting 21 of those grants reinstated through an appeals process.

The land at stake ranges from dense, remote coastal forests in the far north, to alpine conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, to Southern California’s great expanses of brush. Experts dispute whether revoking the two-decade-old rule would help prevent wildfires.



The Trump administration’s plan to repeal a rule prohibiting logging and road construction in undeveloped parts of national forests would strip protection from more than 4 million acres within California’s borders. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced on Monday that she will act to rescind the “roadless rule,” developed during the Clinton administration, to allow “for fire prevention and responsible timber production” on more than 58 million acres of national forests. 
But experts are divided about whether allowing road development and timber harvest in national forests will help prevent wildfires. Though roads can aid in firefighting and fuel reduction and serve as fire breaks, roads can also mean more people — and people mean more sparks that can ignite wildfires. And some experts say timber harvests may not reduce fire severity because they can promote growth of more flammable fuels in forests.
California has more national forest acreage than any state other than Alaska. At stake are the roadless reaches of wild areas throughout the state: From dense coastal forests in the far north, to alpine conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, to Southern California’s great expanses of brush in the Cleveland, San Bernardino and Angeles national forests.
The Department of Agriculture has not said how it plans to rescind the rule, and how long the effort is expected to take. Reversing federal rules usually is a long process, requiring publication in the Federal Register and a long public comment period. The agriculture department did not respond to an inquiry from CalMatters. 
California has more national forest acreage than any other state on the mainland. This map shows the roadless areas within those forests. Map via US Forest Service.
Most U.S. Forest Service land — about 69% or more than 135 million acres nationwide — isn’t covered by the rule’s protections against roads and timber cutting. In California, about 21% of its 21 million acres of national forest — 4.4 million acres — are considered roadless, ranking behind Alaska, Idaho and Montana. 
These roadless areas are considered important for providing habitat for more than 200 threatened or endangered species of wildlife, including owls, salmon and frogs, and for protecting vital watersheds.
The Trump administration says revoking the rule is a “common-sense” way to help local officials protect communities from wildfires.
“Of the 58.5 million acres of inventoried roadless areas covered under the 2001 Roadless Rule, 28 million acres are in areas at high or very high risk of wildfire. Rescinding this rule will allow this land to be managed at the local forest level, with more flexibility to take swift action to reduce wildfire risk and help protect surrounding communities and infrastructure,” according to the agriculture department’s statement.
Conservationists call this a ploy to further unfetter logging by an administration that called for an “immediate expansion of American timber production” and ordered drastic cuts to the very agencies that study and fight fires. 
“This move is the most irresponsible, because opening up these forests to logging roads and logging is going to degrade them. It’ll actually increase wildfire risks. It’ll harm numerous species and harm watersheds,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s just a big handout to timber companies.”
Sharon Friedman, a U.S. Forest Service retiree who was a planning director in the Rocky Mountain region and worked on Colorado’s state-specific roadless rule, said she could see why the announcement caused consternation, but she expects that any outcomes that survive in court will likely be long-delayed and less severe than feared. Roadways for fuel management are often temporary and, if done correctly, should bar entry to the public, she said. 
She also said she doesn’t expect that it would lead to a boom on logging in roadless areas. “It’s not like people are going to suddenly discover that, in these areas without roads, there’s a lot of desirable timber —  because if it had been there, people would have gotten to it in the first place,” she said. 
California officials aren’t ready to say what it means for the state.
David Acuña, a Cal Fire battalion chief and public information officer, said “we are simply going to respond if we’re called. Other than that, it is how they choose to handle their roads and/or fire management.”“Picture somebody attempting to redo your personal living room in your home. It would be inappropriate. In the same way, we are not going to attempt to navigate what a partner agency, a neighboring agency, does,” Acuña said.Tony Andersen, a spokesperson for the California Natural Resources Agency, said the agency is reviewing what rescinding the rule would mean for California. He would not provide further comment.

Dusty LaChapelle, an engineer with the Lake Valley Fire Protection District, which protects unincorporated communities near Lake Tahoe surrounded by national forestland, said his  department already can access remote areas in the South Tahoe basin, including with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.“We can get a hold of a lot of the fires already without having to build more roads,” LaChapelle said. “Personally, that’d be hard for me to justify going in there to punch in more roads for the possibility of a fire happening there.” Many of the fires his department fights are caused by people — often, a campfire.Multiple studies have found that roads actually seem to concentrate the risk of wildfires — increasing it up to four-fold in forest areas with roads compared to those without, according to an analysis by the Wilderness Society.  And the fires that people spark tend to spread faster and kill more trees. 
“We can get a hold of a lot of the fires already without having to build more roads. Personally, that’d be hard for me to justify going in there to punch in more roads for the possibility of a fire happening there.” DUSTY LACHAPELLE, LAKE VALLEY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT 
LaChapelle said he could see the benefit of removing dead and diseased trees, including those damaged by bark beetle infestations. But, he said, “there’s fuels reduction, and there’s logging. If you get in there and thin out some of the forest, then that’s certainly beneficial. But clear cutting — yeah, it will reduce fire risk, because there’s not going to be any trees to burn.” Matt Dias, president and CEO of the California Forestry Association, said the timber industry supports the repeal. Dias has previously called for more funding for fuel breaks to combat wildfires, and said that the roadless rule is part of a landscape of environmental rules and regulations that limit forest management. Still, Dias said, “the roadless rules in California, as far as I know, were not a significant impediment.” He said “most of the areas” where the timber industry is working with the Forest Service on fire management  “are not in areas that would be considered roadless.” The roadless rule already allows for roads to be constructed or reconstructed to protect health and safety when threatened by wildfire. And it allows for smaller diameter timber to be removed to improve habitat and reduce the risk of severe wildfires.
“There’s a sustainable economy out there — and those logs need to go somewhere. We believe that rescinding the roadless rule will be a good thing, but it needs to have tribal input.” RUSSELL “BUSTER” ATTEBERY, KARUK TRIBE CHAIRMAN 
The Karuk Tribe, which has ancestral lands in Klamath and Six Rivers national forests, also supports rescinding the rule. Tribe Chairman Russell “Buster” Attebery said burned, downed and hazardous trees should be removed. “There’s a sustainable economy out there — and those logs need to go somewhere,” Attebery said. “We believe that rescinding the roadless rule will be a good thing, but it needs to have tribal input.” Attebery and his father worked in the timber industry for decades. It was an economic driver for the region, but also a source of environmental damage. “They had one thing on their mind. They didn’t care whether they covered over the creeks and streams that fed the rivers. They didn’t care if they blocked them or muddied them,” Attebery said. “You have to put ecology first, and then the economy will follow.”
U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a Democrat representing Northern California coastal communities and parts of Trinity and Six Rivers national forests, said the revision would threaten watersheds that provide clean drinking water, the rights of tribes and local communities, and the power of forests to hold onto climate-warming carbon. 
It “puts millions of acres of forests on the chopping block to serve (President Donald Trump’s) billionaire cronies in the mining and logging industries.” 
But U.S. Rep Doug LaMalfa, a Republican whose district includes Modoc and Klamath national forests, said in a statement that the roadless rule has “done more harm than good in the West” and repealing it is “a major step toward restoring common-sense forest management.”
Even as the Trump administration pushes for more logging, its tariff policy has “created anxiety and uncertainty” for the timber and forest products industry, according to one financial analysis. In California, wildfires, high costs, low income and reduced use of wood products are destabilizing the industry, which saw a 25% drop in softwood sawmill capacity in recent years.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/092624_Lake-Tahoe-Fire_MG_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

Similar modules will be placed at Camille Graham women's prison later this year. (Provided/AmplifiedAg)COLUMBIA — Beginning next month, inmates at South Carolina’s women’s prison will be able to receive agricultural training and a stipend upon release with the help of a statewide grant program.
The South Carolina philanthropy Power:Ed announced a $97,000 grant this month to the nonprofit Impact Justice, which is working with the state Department of Corrections to run the agricultural program at the state’s prison for women.
Beyond growing an expected 48,000 pounds of lettuce each year for the prison’s kitchens, the program is meant to train women in the fast-growing field of hydroponics, which means growing plants in water instead of soil, to help them get jobs soon after leaving prison.
Starting July 7, between 15 and 20 women incarcerated at Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution will begin a five-month course on food safety, agricultural technology and hydroponics, both in a classroom and through hands-on work, said Kelly Danner, who leads the program for California-based Impact Justice.
The first group of women will start work at an existing prison greenhouse while construction continues on the eight containers that will house the prison’s vertical farms. With $350,000 in state money and $850,000 from a private donation, the prison system got the initial go-ahead on the project in 2023.
The 9-foot-tall, 8-foot-wide containers should be ready for use this fall, Danner said.
Once a woman who has completed the program leaves prison, she will receive a $1,450 stipend for the training she’s already completed. That will equate to receiving the federal minimum wage of $7.25 for an estimated 200 hours of work she did while in prison.
That “should hopefully be a meaningful amount to help get them on their feet when they’re released,” Danner said.

A job using the skills each woman learned while incarcerated will hopefully be soon to follow, as a program manager coordinates with local agricultural businesses to help find the women steady employment, Danner said.
The grant, which was part of the $1 million Power:Ed distributes annually, will help cover the stipends, the program manager’s pay and food safety certifications for women in the program, said Claire Gibbons, executive director of Power:Ed, which is based in Columbia.
Impact Justice, through its Growing Justice program, will also help coordinate transportation, child care and housing for women in the program to ensure they’re able to get to work, Danner said.
“It’s not enough for us to offer robust training and place them in jobs if then they can’t sustain those jobs,” Danner said.
The ultimate goal is to keep the women from reoffending and going back to prison, as can often be the case when a person with no safety net leaves prison and finds themselves right back where they were before, if not worse off, Danner said.
That was a key reason Power:Ed decided to help fund the program. As the philanthropy arm of SC Student Loan Corp., Power:Ed looks for programs that bolster access to education and pathways to employment, which this program does, Gibbons said.
“Savings that meet basic needs, like housing, food, and support for children is the key to reentry success for women and enables a successful job placement and retention,” Gibbons said in a news release. “We hope it will become a workforce development model that can be replicated across South Carolina.”
The one-year grant from Power:Ed will help cover the costs for Impact Justice, which currently has enough money to fund the program for at least three years.
South Carolina already touts a low re-incarceration rate for recently released prisoners. Fewer than 1 in 5 inmates return to prison within three years of release, which is the lowest among states that report three-year recidivism rates, according to an annual report from Virginia’s prisons agency.
‘They change each other’: For 20 years, SC inmates have helped train racehorses

State prison officials have credited the state’s job training and work programs with playing a large part in helping reduce its re-incarceration rates. Among those are other agricultural programs that teach inmates to train horses, milk dairy cows, tend row crops and harvest honey.
California-based Impact Justice is working to establish a similar program at a prison in Chowchilla, California, by the end of the year. Also in the works is a growing program to train people who have recently been released from prison in vertical farming, according to its website.
South Carolina’s program will be the first vertical farm on a prison’s campus in the country, state officials have said.
While the state offers other job training and reentry programs for inmates, Impact Justice’s goal is to create a more comprehensive service that could potentially expand to other prisons across both the state and the country, Danner said.
“Growing Justice is really a triple win,” said Alex Busansky, founder and president of Impact Justice, in a news release. “We’re equipping incarcerated women with the skills they need to thrive in a high-tech environment, seeding the South Carolina job market with new, qualified talent and delivering fresh produce to prison kitchens that typically lack access to locally grown fruits and vegetables.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AmplifiedAg-Container-Farm_Butter-Lettuce_Interior-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 17:06:34.781018

(Photo by Austin Fisher/Source NM)The Trump administration is planning to make it easier for employers to hire temporary migrant workers, U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told attendees Tuesday afternoon at the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in Santa Fe.
Chavez-DeRemer said due to the backlog of temporary work visa applications, she is establishing “an emergency agency” within her office to process the work permits “on the spot.”
The move comes as the administration resumes immigration raids at farms, restaurants and hotels, despite having previously said those would decrease due to concerns about worker shortages.
Chavez-DeRemer said she will be working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the Department of Agriculture “to understand the exact needs,” because as it stands, a work visa application must go through all three agencies.

“That’s where the hangup happened,” she said. “We’re going to do one dedicated, one-stop shop as I call it … and have a live dashboard to see exactly when those permits will be done.”
Chavez-DeRemer said she is often asked if visa applications can be done more quickly and cost less.
“Labor costs are always the highest in any business, and our farmers and ranchers know that food security is national security,” Chavez-DeRemer said.
Chavez-DeRemer told the governors the work visas for specialty occupations; temporary agricultural workers and temporary workers in industries like hospitality, landscaping or construction “are very important to a lot of your respective states and our rural communities.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat and the association’s outgoing chair, said the temporary work visas are critical to the agriculture sector. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said most western U.S. states have significant agriculture industries that rely on migrant workers.
“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” Cox said. “None of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Cox expressed approval of Trump’s immigration agenda so far and asked Chavez-DeRemer for more information about changes to the visa system.
“I think we’ve all agreed that we need to stop illegal immigration and fix legal immigration, and get that piece right, and this sounds like a huge step forward in fixing that second piece,” Cox said. “I appreciate that the president is fixing the first piece — and we feel much better about where we are there — but that second piece of streamlining those visas, getting workers in here and doing that could be very key.”
The Department of Labor on Friday stopped enforcing a Biden-era rule that protected union organizing activities among temporary farmworkers. Chavez-DeRemer said the rule harmed farm employers and made it harder for them to hire people.
Chavez-DeRemer said the work visa changes will “come across fairly rapidly.”
“They want a solution, and they wanted it yesterday, and now we’re finally going to lean in,” she said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican elected at the end of 2024, said the law around H2A visas, which permit people to do temporary or seasonal agricultural work, hasn’t changed since he was elected to Congress in 2018.
“There’s not been a single law passed but it’s a lot harder to get an H2A worker in 2024 than it was in 2018,” Armstrong said.
Later, Chavez-DeRemer said her department will work with Congress “on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

SPRINGFIELD – Attorney General Kwame Raoul announced this week he has joined another multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s decision to withhold billions of dollars in federal funds that had previously been approved for states and other grantees.

The complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges several actions the administration has taken since Trump returned to office Jan. 20 that involved terminating federal grants that had previously been approved by various agencies.

Each of those actions, the lawsuit argues, were based on a misuse of a single clause in one regulation under the federal Office of Management and Budget. That clause allows agencies to terminate a grant if the agency determines the award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”

“The Trump Administration has claimed that five words in this Clause — 'no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities’ — provide federal agencies with virtually unfettered authority to withhold federal funding any time they no longer wish to support the programs for which Congress has appropriated funding,” the lawsuit alleges.

The suit is one of more than a dozen Raoul has joined as part of a coalition of Democratic attorneys general who have been battling the administration since Trump’s second inauguration in January.

Speaking Monday to a congressional panel made up of Democratic members of the U.S. House and Senate judiciary committees, Raoul joined three other members of that coalition to explain their litigation campaign.

“Whether or not I disagree with President Trump on his policy agenda, he must act in a lawful way that is consistent with the Constitution and the laws that Congress has enacted,” Raoul said. “Unfortunately, the president and his administration have chosen, with many of their actions, to ignore the Constitution and federal law. And when constitutional guarantees are ignored, all Americans are at risk.”

Grants affected by cuts

The lawsuit challenges three specific funding cuts that have directly affected the state of Illinois. Those include:


The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision in March to halt reimbursements under the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program, which provided funding for nonprofit organizations to buy locally grown food products from farmers for free distribution to vulnerable communities.
A decision by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to terminate two Shelter and Services Program Grant awards to the Illinois Department of Human Services totaling $29 million. The money was intended to reimburse Illinois for the cost of providing food, shelter and medical care to migrants whom the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had released to relieve overcrowding at federal detention facilities.
And a decision in May by the U.S. Department of Labor to terminate grants totaling $28.8 million to the Illinois Department of Employment Security for modernization of the state’s unemployment insurance system.


According to the lawsuit, OMB first adopted the regulation in 2020, near the end of the first Trump administration. At the time, according to the Federal Register, the agency said the clause was intended to allow agencies to end a grant program under specific conditions, but that it was not intended to let them terminate grants “arbitrarily.”

The clause was later updated to include its current wording in 2024, near the end of Joe Biden’s administration. However, according to the complaint, “OMB never suggested, in either the 2020 or 2024 rulemaking, that a grant could be terminated even though the grant was continuing to serve the very goals for which the monies had initially been awarded, merely because the agency’s priorities shifted midway during the use of the grant—let alone with no advance notice.”

As of Wednesday, the case had not yet been scheduled for a hearing.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A bill restricting when Montanans can register to vote — including eliminating most of Election Day — would disproportionately affect Indigenous peoples living in rural parts of the state, according to new court documents filed on Tuesday. 
The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Blackfeet Nation, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, as well as tribal advocacy nonprofit Western Native Voice, filed to join the lawsuit brought last month by the Montana Federation of Public Employees before Lewis and Clark County District Court, which challenged the constitutionality of Senate Bill 490 and another bill that strengthened voter ID laws. 
The new law, sponsored by state Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka, tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on Election Day and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it on the prior Saturday, which previously was not a day voters could register. 
In the motion to intervene, the Native American coalition said the suit marks the third time in six years that Western Native Voice and some of Montana’s sovereign tribal nations have gone to the courts to challenge the “Legislature’s continued insistence on making it more difficult for Native Americans in Montana to vote. ” 
“Each time we’ve stood up in court for our right to vote, we do so not for ourselves, but for the generations who came before us and those who will come after,” Fort Belknap President Jeffrey Stiffarm said in a statement.  “Our ancestors fought for recognition, sovereignty, and dignity. It’s racism to try and enact the same laws over again. We will not let the state drag us backwards or silence our people. Not now. Not ever.”  
Under previous Montana law, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations. 
Last November, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot. 
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill. 
“The intent is to smooth out the process and avoid votes being cast many hours beyond the intended closing of the polls at 8 p.m.,” Cuffe wrote. 
But a 2024 decision from the Montana Supreme Court struck down a 2021 law that had sought to eliminate Election Day voter registration, which the initial legal complaint from MFPE cited and the motion to intervene focused on as well. 
“Past efforts to limit Election Day voter registration impermissibly interfered with the right to vote,” according to court documents filed by the tribal advocates. “On notice from its own legal analysis that the planned legislation likely did not conform with the Montana Constitution, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 490, which does away with eight critical hours of voter registration on Election Day.”
The Native American groups joined the lawsuit because restricting Election Day voter registration disproportionately affects Native American Voters. Citing the Supreme Court opinion, their filing states that Native voters “‘rely on Election Day registration because of numerous issues they face in voting, including lack of access to mail, transportation, and the long distances to county seats where they can register.’”
Indigenous people in rural tribal communities “rely heavily on Election Day registration, but also overwhelmingly register to vote after noon— precisely the window SB 490 cuts out,” according to the press release. 
“We are not asking for special treatment—we’re demanding equal treatment,” Northern Cheyenne President Gene Small said. “When you live miles and miles from the nearest polling place, and the roads are snowed in all morning, taking away eight hours of Election Day registration creates real-life problems for everyday voters. It’s anti-democratic.”

Darryl Rouson in Tampa on June 25, 2026. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Tampa Bay area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson was surprised to learn Wednesday that a substance abuse center located at the University of South Florida (USF) is going to be named for him, after all.
The state Senate passed a bill on mental health and substance use disorders this year that included a provision naming the center after Rouson, but the House stripped that section from the bill before passing its version of the legislation.
“It was a well-kept secret, and I was absolutely elated and surprised,” Rouson told the Phoenix after learning during a bill-signing ceremony that the center would bear his name after all.
The bill (SB 1620) was one of two measures signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis at the USF Health building in downtown Tampa. The legislation strengthens Florida’s Mental Health Act by codifying recommendations made by Florida’s Commission on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder in January, a panel that Rouson served on.
The bill also establishes the Center for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Research at USF’s Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute to conduct statewide behavioral health research, promote evidence-based practices, and improve workforce development.

‘A travesty’

When his colleagues in the Senate passed the measure in April, they included an amendment sponsored by Pinellas County Republican Ed Hooper to rename the center after Rouson, who has battled drug and alcohol addiction in his past and had sponsored the measure in the Senate.
However, the House took that amendment out of the bill, with Speaker Daniel Perez later saying calling it “a means of emotionally blackmailing the House into doing what they want,” which he labelled “unconscionable.”
Rouson’s colleagues from both sides of the aisle condemned the House’s move at the time, with two Republicans calling it “a travesty.”
DeSantis said Wednesday that his office had worked with the Senate and USF officials to get Rouson’s name back on the center.
“We’re proud that Darryl has become an example of overcoming substance abuse but also has been very passionate about helping others who may be in similar predicaments,” DeSantis said. “I know that they were trying to get this into statute, and there was a little bit of a hiccup on that, but you know, it was a period of a lot of hiccups. That’s just the way it is.”
Among the changes to Florida’s Mental Health Act included in the new law are:

Defining person-first language to mean that language used in a professional medical setting must emphasize the patient as a person rather than his or her disability or illness, and requiring use and promotion of person-first language as the standard in professional behavioral health settings.
Requires that individualized treatment plans for adults and juveniles be reevaluated at least every six months.
Requires the Department of Children and Families to conduct biennial reviews and the Agency for Health Care Administration to prioritize licensing for short-term residential treatment facilities in underserved counties and high-need areas.

‘A pathway to peace’
Rouson, who turns 70 next month, has served in the Florida Legislature since 2008. He has one more year in his state Senate seat before being term-limited in 2026.
“I’m absolutely honored,” he said about having the center named after him. “The work is hard work and it must continue, and I’m just elated that they saw fit to honor my body of legislative work and the passion that I’ve had in this process for those who suffer from addictions and mental health challenges. It’s all about creating a pathway towards peace.”
DeSantis also signed the “Tristin Murphy Act” (SB 168). The measure creates model processes for diverting defendants to mental health treatment. Senate President Ben Albritton and Northeast Republican Jennifer Bradley, the bill’s sponsor in the Senate, also spoke at the press conference celebrating the signing of the legislation.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Matunuck Oyster Bar will welcome diners to slurp oysters and sample seafood in a makeshift, outdoor space across the street from its acclaimed restaurant starting July 1, Perry Raso, restaurant owner, announced Wednesday.
The reopening of the acclaimed South County dining destination on its 16th anniversary  comes less than two months after a fire forced the restaurant to close. Ahead of a permanent rebuild, Raso cooked up a temporary solution relying upon the marina parking lot across the street from his restaurant.
The tented dining space required sign-off from state and local officials to ease restrictions governing outdoor eateries. The Rhode Island General Assembly unanimously approved changes to state regulations on June 12, clarifying that pandemic-era allowances for al fresco dining also extend to restaurants closed due to floods, fires or other disasters.
Separately, the South Kingstown Town Council OK’d details including operating hours, parking plans and capacity caps for “Matunuck Marina,” Raso said in an emailed statement.
He thanked state and local officials for helping revive the famed seafood restaurant overlooking Potter Pond, allowing 50 of his 300-person staff to keep working over the summer.
The revival includes tableside dining and grab-and-go options, preserving the existing reservation and takeout system via the restaurant website. 
The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal. A preliminary investigation suggested it was accidental, and not caused by commercial cooking equipment.

Ted Nugent was in the house on Wednesday – the Michigan House of Representatives, that is – to rail against state Department of Natural Resources conservation and hunting regulations he deemed “immoral” and “insane.”
Meanwhile, several Democrats who were present for Wednesday’s joint meeting of the three separate House committees that hosted Nugent, said it was shameful that other important work was cast aside to give Nugent a podium to rail against officials of a state agency, whom he at one point referred to as “jackbooted thugs” and the enemies of conservatism.
Nugent, a hard rock guitarist and avid sportsman who became a conservative firebrand in the latter part of his career, was invited by state Rep. Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) to testify before the members of the House Natural Resources & Tourism Committee, the House Rural Development and Natural Resources Committee and the House Oversight Subcommittee on Weaponization of State Government.
Rep. David Martin (R-Davison), one of three chairs for the meeting, said it was his intention to use the hearing to shine a light on alleged recent abuses by DNR officials. The meeting followed the Oversight subcommittee’s recent hearing on a decade-old invasive species order issued by the DNR surrounding feral pigs and allegations that the department was running covert enforcement against pig farmers and game ranch owners.
Nugent’s visit to the Capitol and ensuing commentary focused on various instances where he ran into trouble with the DNR, its conservation officers and game wardens throughout his time of owning a 340-acre, fenced-in hunting area near Jackson.
To that, Nugent told the cadre of legislators and onlookers that he hopes what they heard “pisses you off, because everybody that comes up to me is just livid that the DNR and the [Michigan Natural Resources Commission] have chased families out of the sport over absolutely insane anti-nature, anti-science regulations.”

Nugent also ran afoul of the DNR regarding alleged feral pigs when the department sued him and others in Ingham Circuit Court, to which he countersued in the Court of Claims and lost there. Nugent’s main argument was that the order on feral pigs – specifically related to so-called Russian boar – was invalid and unlawful. The case in Ingham Circuit Court was closed in May.
Still, Nugent had plenty to say about the DNR and how they allegedly treat hunters in Michigan, which the guitarist said was a reason why hunters were leaving the state in droves. His comments stretched over 10 minutes, during which he stood the entire time, but with his mesh sheriff’s star ballcap removed while speaking.
“We were the number one conservation state in the nation,” Nugent said, adorning a short-sleeved button-up shirt, cargo pants and camouflage Crocs. “More family hours of recreation, more revenues generated and more opportunities to optimize the wildlife biodiversity battles. … And now, Michigan is the laughing stock of the nation. There’s no place I go where families don’t come up to me with horror stories of being given a ticket because [they] have a salt block on [their] farm.”
Nugent said it was important to “set the table” because there were “people in this room that were stupid enough to listen to the lying, anti-hunting media,” who he claims have falsely accused him of being in violation of DNR regulations. He went on to defend himself and other hunters accused of the same.
“I abide by the law before I go deer hunting, I buy a deer license. I examine where I can deer hunt with what weapon,” Nugent said. “My dad raised me in the discipline of conservation, marksmanship, safe gun handling and the perfection of venison as the healthiest diet in the world.”
He went on to claim that chronic wasting disease regulations were based on a “lie,” claiming that the disease affecting deer can’t jump to humans. Nugent previously testified in 2019 against a ban on deer and elk baiting that had been issued to prevent further spread of chronic wasting disease, a fatal neurological illness that affects members of the deer family, namely the white-tailed deer in Michigan.
While there have been no reported cases of the infection in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the disease “may pose a risk to people” and recommends that infected animals not be consumed as food by either humans or domestic animals.

Nugent also claimed that the DNR and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission have abdicated their “moral duty” by violating hunters’ rights on wasting disease regulations.
He also called the people in the department and on the commission “insane,” claiming the regulations have run good hunters out of the state.
“There were 11 counties that were forbidden to hunt on Sunday,” Nugent claimed in a particularly loud portion of his commentary. “Who is the man that can intervene between God’s nature and my recreational sporting spirit, [my] connection to the good Earth, that can tell me that, somehow, mysteriously, the hunting season ends when the sun goes down on Saturday. That’s insane.”
Nugent went on to call for legislators to do away with game laws that he and others testifying before the committees on Wednesday said were based on junk science for the sake of regulation and not for protection of people and wildlife.
Borton has had his own seemingly negative interactions with the DNR. Borton said that the DNR cited him in 2010 for a birdfeeder with a livestream he operated near his home, dubbed by Borton and his wife as a “snowman cam.”
It was alleged that the department falsely claimed the birdfeeder was an illegal bait pile for hunting deer. Borton said he contested the alleged government overreach and eventually won. He has since been calling for decreasing the scope of the DNR’s regulatory authority.
Borton controls the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the department’s budget, and Wednesday’s hearing seemed like a precursor to a potential scaling back of the department’s enforcement funding.
The Oversight subcommittee’s chair, state Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), also called on residents to testify following Nugent on allegations that DNR agents used fake names to hunt privately owned pigs on northern hunting grounds. The aim, they claimed, was to kill and seize them without compensating their owners.
Dems and others call foul on Nugent free-for-all hearing
At one point during the meeting, state Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) was given an opportunity to speak and chided House Republicans for hosting Nugent and the hearing when they had a budget to pass.
The GOP-led House has passed its public and higher education budgets but has yet to pass a budget funding the rest of the state government and its agencies. The Democratic-led Senate, however, has passed its total budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year and is eager to start negotiations.
“I appreciate the passion of the testimony and concern around law and order,” Weiss said. “I’ve got to say, I feel really emotional, really upset, because I’m a mother and a teacher and the fact that we’re sitting here talking about salt licks and feral pigs when we are a month away from a deadline to get a budget passed. … I think it’s shameful.”
Weiss was almost immediately cut off, with several of her Republican colleagues jeering, grumbling and saying, “oh shut up,” as Weiss continued to call the proceedings shameful.
Following the meeting, state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) agreed with Weiss’ assessment and questioned Nugent’s use of the word immoral to describe hunting regulations given the content of some of his music and lyrics.
“We have submitted school aid budget that we could be negotiating on, and just frankly, I’m not interested in being lectured about morality by somebody who sang about raping 13 year olds,” Pohutsky said, referring to the lyrics of Nugent’s song titled Jailbait. “It’s absurd.”
That point was echoed by Sam Inglot, Progress Michigan executive director, who issued a statement noting the controversies in Nugent’s past.
“Ted Nugent has a long, documented history of promoting racism, misogyny, violent political rhetoric and election denial. Nugent’s past also includes deeply disturbing allegations of grooming and abuse that should disqualify him from being legitimized by Michigan Republicans. His presence at today’s Natural Resources hearings is not only offensive, it’s dangerous,” Inglot said.

According to annual crime data collected by the FBI, Waterbury’s violent crime rate tends to be lower in areas like robbery, rape and aggravated assaults. 
But Waterbury has trended slightly lower or the same as Bridgeport in the number of homicides, like in 2023 — the last year in which FBI data is available — when they both reported 18. 
In other years, the cities’ numbers can vary widely. In 2021, Waterbury recorded 9 homicides, while Bridgeport recorded 20.
New Haven, meanwhile, often records more homicides than both Waterbury and Bridgeport. In 2021 for example, it reported 26. In 2023, it reported 22.
But another city tops New Haven, and all other Connecticut cities, in the number of homicides — the capital city of Hartford. It had 37 homicides in 2023, 40 in 2022 and 41 in 2021.

Spencer Cox sit for a panel discussion on post-fire flooding, an issue affecting many Western states. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Several governors of Western states on Tuesday endorsed formalizing a partnership to help each other deal with the aftermath of increasingly devastating wildfires, citing the long-term effects of post-fire flooding and also uncertainty about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s future.
Governors from New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado attended a panel discussion on the topic of post-fire flooding at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe. The governors questioned experts — including state emergency response officials and a government landslide scientist — at a discussion called “Flood After Fire – Enhancing Safety in Post-Fire Landscapes.”
The governors described the phenomenon as increasingly urgent due to wildfires burning hotter and larger across the West. High-severity wildfires can change soil composition, converting even modest rainstorms that fall on burn scars into potential floods or debris flows.
In New Mexico, for example, post-fire flooding has impeded the recovery from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, both for the City of Las Vegas as it tries to rebuild its water treatment facility and for smaller communities in and around the 534-square-mile burn scar. Other Western governors, including Spencer Cox of Utah, said they’re increasingly concerned about flooding after fires. That was the case when Cox came across the aftermath of a fire that burned this week.
Las Vegas to get $98 million to replace water treatment facilities after 2022 wildfire damage

“The first thing I thought when I drove into that community had nothing to do with the fire or the homes burned,” he said. “What I realized was, for the next five or six years, things are going to be pretty awful for those people because of the mudslides and the runoff, the sediment that comes down.”
The conversation occurred as at least six wildfires burn across New Mexico, and as burn scar areas in northern and southern New Mexico experience severe flooding or are warned to be on high-alert for it.
While no FEMA official sat on the panel, the agency’s past performance with post-fire flooding and its future loomed over the meeting. Participants mentioned the agency’s name more than 10 times, and speakers noted the challenges they’d face if the agency is dismantled, as called for briefly by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
While New Mexico’s United States Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján say the agency should still exist, they recently called on FEMA to change the way it deals with post-fire flooding. The agency has “repeatedly struggled to respond effectively” to second-order effects from wildfires, including “cascading disasters such as landslides, flooding and water system failures that compound damage and slow recovery,” the senators wrote.
NM’s U.S. senators to Noem: Reform FEMA. Don’t scrap it entirely.

Collin Haffey, a Washington post-fire recovery leader who worked for New Mexico Forestry Division during the 2022 wildfires here, spoke on the panel and said there’s a “tremendous amount of uncertainty” about the federal government’s role in wildfire recovery going forward.
“If I’m trying to build my portion of the railroad track to meet them, I don’t know how far to go,” he said. “And I think that that lack of communication down to the local level is putting lives and recovery at risk.”
So he called on the WGA to create a formal agreement between Western states, one that could help states help each other deal with the aftermath of devastating wildfires amid uncertainty about what type of aid could come from the federal government.
“We have these peer-to-peer networks because I have their cell phone numbers,” Haffey said. “But that’s not necessarily the best.”
In response, Cox, who on Tuesday was named the new WGA chair, said he would spearhead an effort to create a regional partnership.
“Even if we weren’t, you know, seeing FEMA reform and changes happening there, we should have been doing this anyway,” he said. “And so let’s do it anyway.”

Regent Dennis Casey and Chancellor Sean Burrage listen from their desk. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over half of Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities on Wednesday asked a state governing board to approve increases in what students must pay in tuition and fees for the upcoming school year. 
Mark Tygret, vice chancellor for budget and finance for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, said the average tuition and fee increase request across institutions was 1.9% which equates to just over $121 for undergraduate resident students enrolled in 30 credit hours. 
In all, 15 institutions are seeking increases while 10 did not request any boosts in tuition or fees, including Oklahoma State University, which will be its sixth year without an increase.
The state regents are expected to vote Thursday to approve or deny the requests.
Many presidents attributed the need for increases to inflation, rising health insurance costs and a desire to provide cost of living raises for faculty and staff. 
University leaders also highlighted the ways they’ve tried to cut costs in other places before requesting increases in tuition or fees. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a press conference earlier this month that he didn’t think tuition increases were necessary as Oklahoma hasn’t seen “all of the efficiency out of our universities.” 
Tuition or fee increases were requested from University of Oklahoma, East Central University, Northeastern State University, Northwestern Oklahoma State University, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, University of Central Oklahoma, Langston University, Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College, Connors State College, Western Oklahoma State College, Oklahoma City Community College, Rose State College, Seminole State College, and Murray State College. 
The Oklahoma Legislature appropriated $1.1 billion to the state Regents for next fiscal year, which is about $80 million more than the current budget year. 
OU President Joseph Harroz said he’s requesting an increase to keep up with inflation and universities in Texas and Florida that receive more legislative performance-based funding.
He requested a 3% increase, which raises costs about $294 for a full-time student.
“You’ve seen me up here the last three years, and under our strategic plan … that request will be coming again next year and the following year, with the same goals,” Harroz said of requesting an increase again. 
While OU’s “sticker price” for tuition has risen 12% since the 2019 fiscal year, the average amount actually paid by students is down 27% in the same time period when factoring in financial assistance, Harroz said. 
A 2.6% increase, totaling a $225.90 change, was requested by UCO President Todd Lamb.  
The university is continuing to recover from a budget deficit, and if approved this increase could bring the school close to closing the gap completely, he said. 
The Edmond school is the third-largest university in the state, but third to last in funding, Lamb said. 
Oklahoma’s only historically Black university, Langston University, requested a 3% increase. 
Langston President Ruth Ray Jackson said the revenue generated will provide funding for capital projects spurred by weather-related damage, deferred maintenance and help with inflation. 
The increase to tuition and fees would cost the average student just over $207. 
Oklahoma City Community College President Mautra Jones asked the state regents to approve an 8% increase, the highest boost sought by any institution. 
While Jones said the request may seem steep, the community college kept tuition flat for seven years. Even if the increase were approved, the college would remain “within pennies” of being the lowest cost institution in the state, she said. 
The increase equates to $323.10 for the average student.

(Photo: Angela Dennis)A grand jury in Knox County has indicted University of Tennessee protesters who participated in on-campus demonstrations more than a year ago, protesting Israeli actions in Gaza.
At a hearing in June 2024, Judge Judson Kyle Davis acknowledged the courage of the demonstrators but stated that his role was not to make a decision driven by emotions. 
“All I have to consider is the statute of criminal trespassing. There have been some good arguments that were obviously very well studied, and some of those arguments are hard for me to disagree with, but it’s not something for me to consider,” Davis said. I think it’s more of a jury question.“ The Knox County District Attorney’s office sent the case to a grand jury in June 2024, and indictments were issued on June 18, according to attorney Dillon Zinser, who is representing one of the plaintiffs.
According to records from the Knox County Sheriff’s office, seven of the 12 protestors indicted are scheduled for arraignment on July 16 and July 22 in Knox County Criminal Court and are charged with criminal trespassing, a class C misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $50 fine. The others are still awaiting court dates, according to Zinser.
Zinser said District Attorney Charme Allen’s office showed a significant delay in waiting a year before bringing the cases before a grand jury and could have chosen to dismiss each of the cases. 
“We believed and hoped that perhaps they would do the right thing,” Zinser said. “But now that they’ve chosen to indict, that’s a signal to all of us that they are deciding to prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law.”
He also said that they plan to fight the charges. 
“None of our clients want to plead guilty because they don’t believe they broke the law, and we don’t believe they broke the law,” said Zinser. “So we will be seeking a jury trial. It looks to me that this was content-based discrimination, and these demonstrators were targeted for their political views, which are unpopular with the government.” 
Attorney Mike Whalen, who is representing five of the protesters indicted, said he was stunned by the decision to move forward with charges nearly a year after the arrests.
 “The idea that they would just let these things sit in the grand jury for a year before they bring it out it’s ridiculous. It just makes no sense.”
He also questioned the motivations behind the delay, suggesting outside influence may have played a role. 
“I guess, like everything else in the era of Trump, the message they’re trying to send is that the First Amendment is dead,” Whalen said.
What led to campus arrests
On May 15, 2024, the group of protesters, including university students and community members, were arrested during a pro-Palestinian rally at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, held in observance of Nakba Day.
Nakba is the Palestinian commemoration of the date the Israeli Declaration of Independence was signed and displaced Palestinians before and after Israel’s establishment in 1948. The word “Nakba” means “catastrophe” in Arabic and refers to the loss of Palestinian homes, land and livelihoods as a result of the war.
Demonstrators urged the University of Tennessee to take action, including cutting ties with Israeli weapons manufacturers, halting study abroad programs in Israel, publicly disclosing its financial investments and divesting from companies connected to Israel. They outlined their demands on a sign displayed during the campus demonstrations.
A Tennessee law enacted in 2022 that bans unauthorized camping on public property has had a chilling effect on demonstrations across the state, including those at college campuses like the University of Tennessee.
Before the May 15 arrests, nine pro-Palestinian protestors were arrested on May 2, 2024, for violating the university’s policy on the use of outdoor facilities for authorized events. In response, UT later permitted the group to reserve the Student Union lawn for future demonstrations, provided they adhered to the university’s established guidelines on time, place, and manner. Under those rules, the group was allowed to occupy the space daily between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.
However, according to university statements, some protestors were taken into custody more than an hour before the May 15, 2024 designated end time, following repeated instructions from campus officials to leave the premises.
Pro-Palestinian activists file federal lawsuits against UT, sheriff’s office over First Amendment violations
Two of the protesters who were arrested last year also filed a federal lawsuit against UT in May 2025, claiming the school violated their First Amendment rights during the campus demonstration last year. 
Plaintiffs Layla Soliz and Hasan Husain said the university used its policies to unfairly target and silence pro-Palestinian speech.
The lawsuit argues that the university enforced its outdoor event rules in a way that was not content-neutral, and that disciplinary actions and trespass warnings issued to demonstrators, some of whom were community members unaffiliated with UT, were retaliatory. The plaintiffs are seeking a court injunction to prevent future restrictions on similar protests, a formal acknowledgment that their rights were violated, and monetary damages.
Soliz also filed a lawsuit against the Knox County Sheriff’s Department for violating her religious rights when deputies removed her hijab during the booking process after the campus arrests in May, and later releasing her mugshot publicly. She was awarded $71,500 as a settlement in the suit in March.

Janet Mills so far this session, including a measure that would have prohibited the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use.
Before taking up LD 958, House lawmakers debated whether the bill was “a solution in search of a problem,” as the governor contended, or whether it is a “fundamental matter regarding sovereign governments,” as Rep. Adam Lee (D-Augusta) put it. 
House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), who sponsored the bill, said he put in the bill “so the state could not use eminent domain to take other people’s property.” He added, “The needs of society never make it okay to take other people’s property.”
Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana said that the concern expressed by some of his colleagues that the tribes would block the construction of power lines and highways was unfounded. 
“The tribes are still going to allow that, because we need access to those same infrastructures,” he said. “We just would like to protect and have a stronghold on what 1% of lands we have remaining here in what we call the state of Maine, which was traditionally all Wabanaki Nations’ lands at one point.”
Ultimately, the House voted 77-63, falling short of the two-thirds of support needed to override a veto. 
Vetoed legislation only needs to return to the chamber in which it originated, so members of the House also took up LD 1328, which sought to create culturally appropriate and trauma-informed housing recovery residences for underserved or underrepresented individuals. Without discussion, they voted 40-100 against overriding the veto of that bill.
The Senate voted 18-14 to sustain Mills’ veto of legislation (LD 588) that would have protected the right of farmworkers to discuss working conditions. 
Mills’ veto of LD 1802, which would have created a statutory right to counsel at state expense for indigent defendants because there is a risk upon conviction that the accused may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, was also sustained in the Senate by a vote of 3-28.
The Senate then voted 16-16 to override the governor’s veto of legislation (LD 1731) that would require the state ferry service to consult with an advisory board on matters related to the service, budget, strategic planning and major operational decisions.

Shelley Moore Capito’s office in Charleston, West Virginia, as they attempted to protest proposed federal cuts to food assistance and health care programs. 
Seven people came to Capito’s office in the United Bank building in downtown Charleston to urge Capito to vote no on the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” — legislation being debated by the Senate that analysts say would make historic cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provide health care and food assistance to thousands of West Virginia residents.  
The group found that the office was closed to the public, they said in a news release. When they called the office, they were denied a chance to arrange a meeting, they said. One person apparently left before the other six were arrested.  
According to a news release, the Charleston Police Department charged the six with trespassing. They included Charleston City Council members Beth Kerns and Joe Solomon along with activist and a long-time episcopal priest Jim Lewis. Community members Lyn May, Paul Dalzell and Morgan Fowler were also arrested. The news release said police responded to a trespassing complaint and that the people were asked to leave but refused. 
“My little girl depends on Medicaid,” Fowler said in a statement Wednesday. “My aunt survived a stroke, but if these Medicaid cuts go through, she won’t have a pathway to survive at all. Senator Capito claims to care about West Virginia, but this bill would cut health care for our babies so billionaires can buy bigger boats.”
Outside the building, about a dozen more people gathered holding signs with messages against the proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. 
John Doyle, a retired Charleston resident, held a sign that warned said “SNAP saves Lives. Hands Off.” Doyle said the bill would do tremendous harm to West Virginia in particular.
“I’m particularly concerned about Medicaid, SNAP and other human services that are going to be slashed,” Doyle said. “This is a state where that whole economy —  health care, is the major employer in West Virginia. If they don’t think this is going to affect the whole state, they’re wrong.”
Charleston Councilwoman Chelsea Steelhammer was also among the people protesting outside the building. Steelhammer said she’s motivated to protest by her work as a teacher. 
“My students — a lot of them depend on Medicaid and SNAP,” Steelhammer said. “If they don’t have health care, they’re sick and they don’t learn. If they don’t have food, they’re hungry and they don’t learn. And if you don’t learn, you don’t succeed.”
Steelhammer said if she could talk to Capito, she would tell her to listen to her constituents. 
“Just think about what’s going to happen to these kids,” she said. 
Capito and Sen. Jim Justice, both Republicans, have expressed support for adding work requirements to Medicaid. 
In a statement Wednesday afternoon, Capito said that everyone should have the right to make their voices heard in a respectful and peaceful way. She defended the proposals to cut SNAP and Medicaid. 
“The Medicaid and SNAP provisions included in the reconciliation bill that the Senate is currently considering focus on managing and maintaining the programs for those who are eligible and intended to be in them,” she said. “Our goal in the bill is to root the waste, fraud and abuse out of the programs, to ensure that it is sustainable for the long term.”

Scott and legislative Republicans have long pushed for exempting military pensions from income taxes. This year, lawmakers in all parties signed on to a significant exemption.

Phil Scott does the honors during a ceremonial bill signing. The new law creates tax exemptions and tax credits starting this tax year for veterans, families, low-income workers and retirees.

Gov. Phil Scott signed a tax credit package on Wednesday that is projected to provide $13.5 million in breaks for low-income workers, families, veterans and retirees.
“This exemption isn’t just about tax breaks, and as you can see by who’s here today, it’s not a partisan issue,” Scott said at the bill signing, surrounded by Republican, Democratic and independent lawmakers. “It’s an important recruitment tool.”
Supporters of S.51 argue the credits will keep more people in Vermont, particularly military retirees, who often begin a civilian career after leaving the uniformed services. 
For years, Scott has pushed for a complete exemption of military pensions from state taxation. But skeptical Democratic leaders argued the tax break would unnecessarily benefit some high-income households and unfairly single out one deserving group over all others. 
This legislative session, however, the concept drew bipartisan support among rank-and-file lawmakers in both chambers. And after a first version of the tax credit bill moved through the House without the military pension-focused measure, lawmakers later struck a compromise that significantly expanded veteran tax credits. 
Wednesday, Scott was joined by military retirees and survivors to celebrate the law. 
“This exemption will give a little lift to those who need it most,” said June Heston, the surviving spouse of Brig. Gen. Michael Heston, who served in the Vermont National Guard. 
Effective retroactively, S.51 will expand tax breaks for all of 2025.
Breaking down the tax breaks 
The law will exempt military pensions and military survivor benefits for households with adjusted gross incomes under $125,000, and create a partial exemption for those making less than $175,000. 
Vermont remains among a minority of states that doesn’t fully exempt military pensions from income taxes. 
S.51 also creates a $250 refundable tax credit for low-income veterans — not just those with military pensions — making less than $25,000, with a partial credit available for those making less than $30,000. According to the Joint Legislative Fiscal Office, 5,200 veterans are expected to be eligible. 
While the veteran-related credits have drawn the most political attention, they make up less than a third of the cost of the overall package. 
The largest change proposed is raising by one year the age threshold for Vermont’s child tax credit, to include families with 6-year-olds — a $4.5 million loss of revenue, according to the Joint Legislative Fiscal Office. Households making under $125,000 will receive $1,000 per eligible child. 
Vermont’s earned income tax credit — linked to the federal initiative of the same name — would also expand under the law to include workers without children. The credit benefits lower-income working individuals and households. 
Some retirees can expect new benefits as well. S.51 will raise the income thresholds at which Social Security is fully or partially tax exempt by $5,000 — up to $55,000 for single filers and $70,000 for married filers. Vermont is one of just nine states that tax Social Security, according to the joint fiscal office.

DemasThe Michigan state Senate passed a handful of gun regulation bills on Wednesday including a ban on bump stocks and ghost guns, as well as legislation that would put Capitol rules banning firearms into state law.
All the bills passed without Republican support in the tightly partisan state Senate, except for the ban on bump stocks, which enhance the speed of semi-automatic firearms, making them effectively fully automatic. Three Republican state Senators joined Democrats in supporting the ban on bump stocks under Senate Bill 224, which had previously been federally banned after the 2017 concert mass shooting in Las Vegas which resulted in the deaths of 60 people, injuring hundreds of others.
“Whether they shoot for sport or self-defense, civilians have no need for a device that allows them to shoot hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes,” bill sponsor Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) said in a news release Wednesday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Bump stocks are designed for one purpose only — to inflict maximum carnage in the shortest amount of time. By prohibiting this deadly device, we’re sending a clear message: Michigan will not stand by while tools of mass violence threaten our communities and our sense of safety,” said Polehanki.
The Michigan Senate also voted through a ban on firearms that can be constructed with a kit or other parts without valid serial numbers, also known as “ghost guns”, which pose difficulties for law enforcement tracing weapons to perpetrators.
The ban outlined under Senate Bills 331 and 332 would prohibit the sale, possession and distribution of ghost guns, with maximum criminal penalties of up to 5 years in prison.
Denise Wieck, a volunteer lead with Moms Demand Action and a gun violence survivor, said her son was badly injured with a ghost gun when he was 17 and suffers the consequences to this day. 
“Today, Michigan Senators sent a clear message that they are committed to acting in the best interest of Michigan families and saving lives. We hope the House will follow suit and explicitly ban ghost guns. Our gun violence crisis is real and it is already here – immediate action is needed,” Wieck said in a release issued by Everytown For Gun Safety.
Senators also approved legislation Wednesday to enshrine into law rules set by the Michigan State Capitol Commission in 2023, banning all firearms from being carried inside the Capitol, unless they’re carried by members of Capitol security or current state lawmakers in possession of a concealed carry permit.
Some Democrats in the state Legislature have sought to ban firearms from the Michigan State Capitol Building and legislative offices since 2020 when armed protestors in opposition of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s COVID-19 lockdown orders came into the building demanding to go onto the floor of the legislative chamber. In 2021 the Michigan State Capitol Commission banned open carry in the Capitol Building, before placing the ban on concealed carry later on.
Senate Bills 225 and 226 would put the ban on firearms in the Michigan State Capitol except for security and lawmakers into law, as well as a ban on carrying in the Anderson House Office Building, and the Binsfeld Senate Office Building.
All of the legislation now moves to the GOP-controlled state House, where it was referred to the House Government Operations Committee, where legislation traditionally goes to die.

Holds on deportations have slowed the administration’s aggressive plans for mass deportation of people without permanent legal status, on the grounds of due process.“Every unlawful order entered by the district courts robs the Executive Branch of its most scarce resource: time to put its policies into effect,” according to the complaint. “In the process, such orders diminish the votes of the citizens who elected the head of the Executive Branch.”The complaint by DOJ argued that a standing order from Chief Judge George Russell of the District Court of Maryland is “nothing more than a particularly egregious example of judicial overreach interfering with Executive Branch prerogatives—and thus undermining the democratic process.”In late May, Russell signed a standing order to halt deportations for two days in an effort to accommodate the sudden high volume of habeas corpus claims filed outside of normal court business hours. A habeas corpus claim allows immigrants to challenge their detention.The Trump administration argues that the order stymies federal immigration enforcement and acts as a preliminary injunction or temporary retraining order without meeting the threshold and is therefore unlawful.“Inconvenience to the Court is not a basis to enter an injunction, and filings outside normal business hours, scheduling difficulties, and the possibility of hurried and frustrating hearings are not irreparable harms,” according to the complaint.The Department of Justice has also asked that the judges recuse themselves from the case, and that either the 4th Circuit hear the case or a judge randomly selected from another district.Abrego Garcia caseThe Maryland court in Greenbelt has halted several immigration-related moves by the Trump administration, with the most high-profile case handled by Judge Paula Xinis, who ordered the return of the wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was sent to a prison in El Salvador.The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. The Maryland man was brought back earlier this month, but to face federal charges on human smuggling that were filed after he was wrongfully deported and courts ordered his return.The Maryland case is still ongoing, as Xinis is allowing discovery to determine if the Trump administration refused to comply with her order to return Abrego Garcia.Another judge, Theodore David Chuang, in February partly granted a request from Quakers and other religious groups to limit the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s authority to conduct immigration enforcement in houses of worship.",,,,2025-06-25 16:08:49.101877

SPRINGFIELD —– Three main factors contribute to the formation of Midwest dust storms: strong winds, dry soil in farm fields and large amounts of loose soil.

That’s according to Andy Taylor, the Science and Operations officer at the National Weather Service’s office in Lincoln. He said these are key ingredients that meteorologists, farmers and experts in the agricultural community have found cause dust storms when they converge.

On May 16, Chicago saw its first major dust storm since the Dust Bowl, which stretched from Texas to New York in the early 1930s and deposited 300 million tons of soil across the nation – 12 million tons of which settled in the Chicago region, according to the Bill of Rights Institute. The storm in May dropped visibility in the city to near zero as wind gusts blew over 60 mph at times, according to the National Weather Service.

Taylor said the atmospheric environment that day was more characteristic of the dry environments in the High Plains or Southwest U.S., not the Midwest. As rain began to fall near Bloomington, it quickly evaporated and cooled the atmosphere, creating strong pockets of wind that began to move North. And as winds sped up, the storm began to pick up and move dry and loose soil from fields it passed over, which created the dust storm.

“The type of dust storm event that we had that affected the Chicago area, I wouldn’t necessarily take that occurrence as saying we’re going to see an increase in those type of events from this point on,” he said. “Although, anytime you see all those ingredients come together, we certainly could see that again.”

Soil conservation funding ‘deprioritized’

While there were no deaths due to the storm in Chicago, a major dust storm that occurred in central Illinois on a portion of I-55 resulted in a multi-car pileup that took the lives of eight people and injured dozens more in May 2023.

That dust storm also dropped visibility to zero on the stretch of the interstate between Farmersville and Divernon, and was again caused by dry, loose soil being picked up and moved by winds.

Although Taylor said dust storms are not new to Illinois – as his office has documented events back to the 80s – most of the storms don’t move across vast expanses of the state. Instead, he said they often occur in more localized areas, like the storm near Divernon in 2023.

“When we’re seeing the right weather-related factors coming together and the ground is fairly dry, which matches up with loose soil so we know we’re going to be more prone to blowing dust, we coordinate with partners in the agricultural community to determine when we might anticipate those blowing dusts events,” Taylor said.

The Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts has been lobbying for increased funding for additional district employees. This year’s state budget allows for each district to staff one full-time employee, which AISWCD Executive Director Eliot Clay called “wildly inadequate” as he said each district needs at least two.

“I really, honestly think conservation funding has been deprioritized,” he said.

What do soil and water conservation districts do?

Soil and water conservation districts began to crop up across the U.S. in the late 1930s as a response to the Dust Bowl and Congress’ subsequent declaration of soil and water conservation as a national priority. According to the Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts, that declaration prompted then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt to recommend legislation to state lawmakers that would enact districts in every state.

Illinois has 97 districts, or nearly one district for every county in the state. Employees of the districts are responsible for a variety of tasks – including assessing farmland, educating farmers about conservation practices and connecting farmers with grants from the state and federal government. These all play a key role in the association’s mission of protecting Illinois’ natural resources.

“Unlike a group like the Department of Natural Resources or the EPA or even the Department of Agriculture, SWCDs are not a regulatory body,” Clay said. “We are not going out there and enforcing rules and laws on people, we’re just trying to help farmers do better. And that’s the reason why a lot of farmers rely on SWCDs, is because they do not see us as like, the ‘government’ coming in and telling them, ‘this is how you’re going to do your operation.’”

Soil conservation funding stagnates

The fiscal year 2026 budget signed by Gov. JB Pritzker last week allots $7.5 million to the state’s SWCDs – which Clay said is the same amount the association received in the previous fiscal year. However, he said that number was a $1 million cut from the FY24 budget allocation.

Of that $7.5 million, $3 million will go to cost-share grants, which act as reimbursements to farmers for the costs of implementing both state and federal conservation policies, such as cover crops. The remaining $4.5 million will go to administrative costs.

Clay said the breakdown of that $4.5 million provides $40,000 to each Soil and Water Conservation district – meaning that every district will have enough funds to pay one full-time employee. He called the salary “wildly inadequate” for the district employees, most of whom have college degrees.

“$40,000 – and that’s supposed to include benefits, so their take-home is less than that – is barely enough, I mean I would say it’s not enough even for one person” Clay said. “And it’s hard to keep people and incentivize people to come to work when there’s not the kind of money there that there should be.”

In addition, Clay said each district needs two full-time employees to be fully-staffed – one to make on-site visits to farms and one to coordinate schedules, receive phone calls and emails, and staff the office.

He said in recent years, the association was told by both the Department of Agriculture and the governor’s office that if they wanted more funding, they would have to advocate for the money to individual lawmakers outside of budget negotiations.

“I don’t know of any other agency or subsect of an agency that has to, on their own, go to the Capitol and get money,” he said. “That’s very peculiar to me and is something I’ve been trying to wrap my head around, and I have not gotten a good explanation from anybody.”

The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

Over the past two years, Clay said the association unsuccessfully lobbied for $10.5 million in annual funding.

“The bigger question I’m left with after being the executive director over the past six months and witnessing it from this angle is, what does the legislature and the administration value?” Clay said. “It really gets to bigger questions about how the state has dealt with conservation funding in general for the last 20-plus years.”

Soil conservation efforts and farming practices

Kevin Brooks, a commercial agriculture educator at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the agriculture community has identified practices farmers can use to reduce the amount of dry, loose topsoil in their fields.

“Measuring the humidity level as a cause is not the issue,” Brooks said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois. “I won’t say it's not 100% not about the weather, but this is primarily about tillage.”

One suggestion he made was for farmers to till their fields less frequently and instead resort to strip-tilling or using no-till strategies whenever possible to reduce the amount of loose topsoil in fields.

Strip-till is a tilling practice where only narrow rows of a field where seeds will be planted are tilled, leaving the rest of the field untouched. While there are many short- and long-term benefits to strip-tilling, no-till practices often don’t seem to benefit farmers right away but do often have long-term advantages, Brooks said.

Rep. Charles Meier, R-Okawville, farms 1,500 acres in southern Illinois with his family, including corn, wheat, beans, hay, and beef cattle. He said most crops are already minimally tilled by farmers.

“I’m 66 years old and we never no-tilled when I was a kid,” he told Capitol News Illinois. “All of our conventional soybeans are no-tilled now, all of our wheat is done by minimal-till, and our corn is all by minimal-till now.”

He said he’s in frequent contact with his SWCD, including a call on Monday with his district’s employee, and criticized Democratic leadership’s funding priorities, such as subsidies for renewable energy.

“They're not funding the nuts and bolts of Illinois conservation,” Meier said. “I'm not against wind and solar but they don't pay for themselves and they're making us taxpayers pay for them.”

Another main practice Brooks recommended farmers employ was planting cover crops, which are crops planted after harvest not for their produce, but for their benefits to the soil. Cover crops can be planted after a fall harvest for a variety of benefits, including to preserve topsoil through the winter, increase organic matter in the soil and dry the field earlier in the spring.

Brooks also attributed recent dust storms to the invention of high-speed discs – a tillage attachment with many more disks than normal tillage attachments, which tills at faster rates. He said these disks have taken tillage speeds from around 4 mph to over 10, and that farmers in Illinois quickly amassed these machines during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the pandemic relief funds they received.

“In theory, they’re supposed to be a kind of conservation because they don’t go into the ground very deep,” Brooks said. “But they literally turn the top several inches of a farm field into powder.”


Dust storm driving tips
Andy Taylor, from the National Weather Service, recommended safety tips for drivers who find themselves caught in a dust storm.

“If you’re caught in dust with extremely low visibility, the advice is to pull completely off the road, turn off your heads and take your foot off the brake,” he said. “Which may sound kind of counterintuitive in a way, but the reason for doing that is because if you have your lights on, people coming into the dust may think you’re moving. They may see your taillights and think ‘Oh look, someone I can follow’ and that may exacerbate accidents and pileups.”

He also advised drivers who know there is risk of a potential dust storm to travel ahead of the storm or to delay travel until later in the day, if possible.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The Trump administration is planning to make it easier for employers to hire temporary migrant workers, U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told attendees Tuesday afternoon at the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in New Mexico.
Chavez-DeRemer said due to the backlog of temporary work visa applications, she is establishing “an emergency agency” within her office to process the work permits “on the spot.”
The move comes as the administration resumes immigration raids at farms, restaurants and hotels, despite having previously said those would decrease due to concerns about worker shortages.
Chavez-DeRemer said she will be working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the Department of Agriculture “to understand the exact needs,” because as it stands, a work visa application must go through all three agencies.
“That’s where the hangup happened,” she said. “We’re going to do one dedicated, one-stop shop as I call it … and have a live dashboard to see exactly when those permits will be done.”
Chavez-DeRemer said she is often asked if visa applications can be done more quickly and cost less.
“Labor costs are always the highest in any business, and our farmers and ranchers know that food security is national security,” Chavez-DeRemer said.
Chavez-DeRemer told the governors the work visas for specialty occupations; temporary agricultural workers and temporary workers in industries like hospitality, landscaping or construction “are very important to a lot of your respective states and our rural communities.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat and the association’s outgoing chair, said the temporary work visas are critical to the agriculture sector. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said most western U.S. states have significant agriculture industries that rely on migrant workers.
“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” Cox said. “None of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”
Cox expressed approval of Trump’s immigration agenda so far and asked Chavez-DeRemer for more information about changes to the visa system.
“I think we’ve all agreed that we need to stop illegal immigration and fix legal immigration, and get that piece right, and this sounds like a huge step forward in fixing that second piece,” Cox said. “I appreciate that the president is fixing the first piece — and we feel much better about where we are there — but that second piece of streamlining those visas, getting workers in here and doing that could be very key.”
The Department of Labor on Friday stopped enforcing a Biden-era rule that protected union organizing activities among temporary farmworkers. Chavez-DeRemer said the rule harmed farm employers and made it harder for them to hire people.
Chavez-DeRemer said the work visa changes will “come across fairly rapidly.”
“They want a solution, and they wanted it yesterday, and now we’re finally going to lean in,” she said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican and former member of the U.S. House, said the law around H2A visas, which permit people to do temporary or seasonal agricultural work, hasn’t changed since he was elected to Congress in 2018.
“There’s not been a single law passed but it’s a lot harder to get an H2A worker in 2024 than it was in 2018,” Armstrong said.
Later, Chavez-DeRemer said her department will work with Congress “on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

(Kyle Sullivan, Bureau of Land Management/Flickr)An executive order signed earlier this month by President Donald Trump would look to “consolidate” five federal wildland fire agencies into one.
The U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and National Park Service all have departments that fight fires on their land.
Two federal departments oversee the effort — the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. Trump directed them to consolidate their efforts within 90 days of the June 12 order. The Federal Wildland Fire Service would be under control of the U.S. Department of the Interior, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfire season is already underway across North America, with large fires burning in Canada and Alaska. Washington and Oregon have also begun to see fire seasons pick up, too. In Montana, several fires have flared, but only one has reached 2,000 acres in size this year so far.
U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, a Montana Republican, introduced legislation in February to combine wildland fire agencies in a bipartisan effort with U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.
“For too long, layers of senseless bureaucracy and red tape have splintered our wildfire management system, failed our brave firefighters on the ground, and let entire communities be wiped off the map by wildfire,” Sheehy said in a statement on Feb. 6. “The time is now to reshape our approach to American wildfire management and start fighting fires better, stronger, and faster.”
Sheehy, who helped found an aerial firefighting company, has been a force on legislation surrounding wildland firefighting as a freshman senator. He’s been a sponsor or cosponsor on 15 firefighting bills, including one that was recently signed by Trump that reauthorizes the sale of Department of Defense parts to repair the nation’s firefighting fleet.
Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment. However, Sheehy’s office did issue a statement thanking the president for taking action on wildfires as his repair bill was signed.
Trump’s order also cast some blame on local fire agencies, saying they “continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures.” It added that many firefighters across the country were relying on outdated equipment and were slow to respond because of “unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy.”
A fact-sheet for the order also identified how the federal government wants to modernize firefighting. It also seeks to declassify historical satellite data to help improve wildfire prediction.
“The order directs the use of available technology, including AI, data sharing, innovative mapping, and weather forecasting, to enhance state and local wildfire identification and response capabilities,” the fact-sheet said.
According to the U.S. Forest Service, about 98% of wildfires are suppressed before they reach 100 acres. The other 2% are large and often dangerous, which Andy Stahl, the director of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, describes as acts of nature in line with a hurricane or earthquake.
Large fires weren’t ever going to be stopped, and wildland fire agencies have little room to improve, according to Stahl, who also took issue with Trump’s usage of the 2025 Los Angeles fires as the “purpose” of the order.
Those fires were driven by structures burning, adding to the intensity and scope of the inferno. A total of 16,251 homes, commercial properties, and other structures burned during those fires, according to research by UCLA.
Furthermore, Stahl noted, wildfires can’t really be fought effectively in high winds — fire breaks can quickly be jumped by embers and spot fires can turn into larger blazes. Extreme fire behavior is driven by low relative humidity, strong surface wind, unstable air, and drought, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, a government agency. None of those things can be changed by firefighters.
“The executive order is mostly political posturing for the MAGA crowd, for the firefighters, you know, and, it’s just bizarre, and it won’t change anything,” Stahl told the Daily Montanan. “Nothing in this executive order is going to move that 98% needle.”
There were 64,897 wildfires reported in 2024 according to the National Interagency Fire Center and they burned almost 9 million acres. Additionally, nearly 4,500 structures were lost to wildfires last year. In 2023, the country spent more than $3.1 billion on wildfires, which is the most recent cost estimate available.
The five-year annual average suppression cost is nearly $3 billion. As a source of comparison, the country spent more than a billion dollars on suppression just once between 1985 and 2001, though those numbers are not adjusted for inflation.
The Forest Service, which did not respond to a request for comment, covers 193 million acres of land, while the Bureau of Land Management manages 245 million acres. The Department of Interior did not provide answers to questions before publication.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned a controversial earlier decision that had sent alarm through the ski industry in Idaho and nationwide, holding instead that a lower court was right to dismiss a lawsuit from the widow of a skier who died after crashing into a snowmaking tower gun at Sun Valley.
Supreme Court case shakes Idaho ski areas by overturning decades of liability precedent

However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”

Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed. 
“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.” 
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.

 Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident

Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions. 
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
 Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say

The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments to reconsider ruling on ski area liability law

Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails. 
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas. 
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling: 

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others. 
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.

In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas. 
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-25 19:46:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson Police Department called ICE on Mississippi father. He now faces deportation for illegal dumping,Lili Euzet and Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/25/jpd-called-ice-on-miss-father-who-faces-deportation-for-illegal-dumping/,"ICE is seeking to deport an immigrant with work authorization for alleged ""illegal dumping"" in Jackson.","Kerlin Moreno-Orellana is facing deportation over a misdemeanor charge that usually results in a fine. He was picked up by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents on Thursday morning and transferred from the Raymond Detention Center to an ICE detention center in Louisiana.
On June 16, Jackson police arrested Moreno-Orellana, a contractor, in south Jackson along with his employer Christy Parker, who was showing him one of the old properties she worked on. Both were charged with illegal dumping, but Parker claims they did not dump anything. 
After detaining them, Jackson police called a local TV outlet, 16 WAPT News, to come shoot the scene of the arrest. Parker said they were kept in the police car for over an hour, waiting for the news crew. The WAPT newsroom explained that the Jackson police routinely asks them to  cover arrests related to illegal dumping or other high profile cases, in order to “dissuade people.”
Once at the station, the Jackson Police Department called ICE on the 35-year-old father of four, who had worker authorization documents. He was kept in jail overnight, while Parker was released hours after their arrest.
“He didn’t do anything I didn’t do,” Parker said in an interview with Mississippi Today. “But because I’m white, I’m here?”
A municipal court ordered Moreno-Orellana’s release the day after, but ICE placed a detainer on him – a formal request to keep a non-citizen in custody for 48 hours, while the agency investigates. It is not an arrest warrant. However, a state law passed in 2016 mandates that all local law enforcement comply with ICE detainers placed on undocumented immigrants. 
“What we are doing today is no different than what we’ve always operated when the detainer is sent by ICE to the jail,” said Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones. “Nothing has changed.”
While the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department has historically worked with ICE, Jackson police actively seeking out ICE to detain people is a fairly recent occurrence, said Mississippi-based immigration attorney Jeremy Litton. Jackson police did not respond to a request for comment.
ICE picked up Moreno-Orellana with hours left on his detainer, and now faces deportation. ICE spokesperson Lindsay Williams said that Moreno-Orellana violated the conditions of a past bond agreement by being arrested for a new charge. He had already spent over a month in ICE custody in 2019, after getting arrested by park rangers for speeding and driving without a license.
Still, a minor misdemeanor charge – like illegal dumping – is normally insufficient for ICE to threaten to deport someone with worker authorization paperwork. Removal of a person with documentation is usually justified if the person is deemed a threat to public safety or national security.
“This does feel like a result of the elevated focus on deporting people from the Trump administration,” said Matt Steffey, professor at the Mississippi College School of Law.
Moreno-Orellana, who is from Honduras, has three boys and a girl, the youngest of whom is less than a year old. He has lived in Mississippi for over 16 years. Colleagues describe him as a valuable worker and a good friend.
“All he ever did was work and go home,” Parker said. “He was always willing to give somebody help.”
The possibility of his deportation is leaving his family in a precarious situation. Moreno-Orellana was the sole breadwinner of the family, and his wife worries about sustaining herself and their children without him.
“I’ve always dedicated myself to taking care of my kids at home, and he’s the one who brings food to the table,” his wife said in Spanish. “I’m afraid of staying, being without my children’s father. Not so much for me, but because they need him.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/25131417/unnamed-9.jpg,,,2025-06-25 16:08:49.101877

LaMonica McIver grabbed officers during a scuffle outside an ICE jail in Newark on May 9.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver speaks outside the federal courthouse in Newark on June 25, 2025, after she pleaded not guilty to charges related to a scuffle outside a Newark ICE jail. (Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — Rep. LaMonica McIver pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday morning to a three-count indictment alleging she assaulted federal officers during a scuffle outside a Newark migrant detention center in May. 
McIver, a Democrat who faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted of the charges, told a crowd of supporters gathered outside the courthouse in the blistering heat that the charges do not intimidate her. And she warned colleagues who push back against President Donald Trump’s policies that they could find themselves in her shoes. 
“We’ve seen different cases of this administration bullying and intimidating elected leaders, from judges to anyone that gets in their way,” she said. “This is what they do, and we will not stand for it. I will not stand for it.”
U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper set a tentative trial date of Nov. 10. 
McIver is accused of “forcibly” grabbing a federal agent while authorities arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka May 9 outside Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed immigrant detention center that reopened earlier this year. McIver was there that day with two other Democratic members of Congress to conduct an unannounced oversight visit to the facility.
Federal authorities initially charged McIver on May 19 after they dropped Baraka’s trespassing charge. She was indicted earlier this month on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding, and interfering with officers. Two of those counts carry a maximum of eight years in prison, and a third misdemeanor charge carries a one-year maximum prison sentence, prosecutors said in court. 
Paul Fishman, a former U.S. attorney for New Jersey who represents McIver, said he is eager to challenge the charges and is “confident that when we are done, the legal system will vindicate the congresswoman.”
McIver spoke in court only to plead not guilty in front of a room filled with reporters and her supporters, including Baraka, a Democrat who is now suing acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba for malicious prosecution. 
“Everything that happened as a result of that is wrong from the start. It’s absolutely incorrect,” Baraka said before Wednesday’s court hearing. “The congresswoman had a right to be there.”
Habba did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Habba previously said she’s investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over a state directive banning local law enforcement from assisting in civil immigration enforcement. She has said she wants to use her office to help “turn New Jersey red.”
Under new guidance released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, members of Congress are now asked to give immigration officials at least 72 hours notice for a visit to its facilities.
McIver first joined Congress in September to represent the 10th District, which includes parts of Hudson, Union, and Essex counties, including Newark.

Meanwhile, several Democrats who were present for Wednesday’s joint meeting of the three separate House committees that hosted Nugent, said it was shameful that other important work was cast aside to give Nugent a podium to rail against officials of a state agency, whom he at one point referred to as “jackbooted thugs” and the enemies of conservatism.
Nugent, a hard rock guitarist and avid sportsman who became a conservative firebrand in the latter part of his career, was invited by state Rep. Ken Borton (R-Gaylord) to testify before the members of the House Natural Resources & Tourism Committee, the House Rural Development and Natural Resources Committee and the House Oversight Subcommittee on Weaponization of State Government.
Rep. David Martin (R-Davison), one of three chairs for the meeting, said it was his intention to use the hearing to shine a light on alleged recent abuses by DNR officials. The meeting followed the Oversight subcommittee’s recent hearing on a decade-old invasive species order issued by the DNR surrounding feral pigs and allegations that the department was running covert enforcement against pig farmers and game ranch owners.
Nugent’s visit to the Capitol and ensuing commentary focused on various instances where he ran into trouble with the DNR, its conservation officers and game wardens throughout his time of owning a 340-acre, fenced-in hunting area near Jackson. 
To that, Nugent told the cadre of legislators and onlookers that he hopes what they heard “pisses you off, because everybody that comes up to me is just livid that the DNR and the [Michigan Natural Resources Commission] have chased families out of the sport over absolutely insane anti-nature, anti-science regulations.”

Nugent also ran afoul of the DNR regarding alleged feral pigs when the department sued him and others in Ingham Circuit Court, to which he countersued in the Court of Claims and lost there. Nugent’s main argument was that the order on feral pigs – specifically related to so-called Russian boar – was invalid and unlawful. The case in Ingham Circuit Court was closed in May.
Still, Nugent had plenty to say about the DNR and how they allegedly treat hunters in Michigan, which the guitarist said was a reason why hunters were leaving the state in droves. His comments stretched over 10 minutes, during which he stood the entire time, but with his mesh sheriff’s star ballcap removed while speaking.
“We were the number one conservation state in the nation,” Nugent said, adorning a short-sleeved button-up shirt, cargo pants and camouflage Crocs. “More family hours of recreation, more revenues generated and more opportunities to optimize the wildlife biodiversity battles. … And now, Michigan is the laughing stock of the nation. There’s no place I go where families don’t come up to me with horror stories of being given a ticket because [they] have a salt block on [their] farm.”
Nugent said it was important to “set the table” because there were “people in this room that were stupid enough to listen to the lying, anti-hunting media,” who he claims have falsely accused him of being in violation of DNR regulations. He went on to defend himself and other hunters accused of the same.
“I abide by the law before I go deer hunting, I buy a deer license. I examine where I can deer hunt with what weapon,” Nugent said. “My dad raised me in the discipline of conservation, marksmanship, safe gun handling and the perfection of venison as the healthiest diet in the world.”
He went on to claim that chronic wasting disease regulations were based on a “lie,” claiming that the disease affecting deer can’t jump to humans. Nugent previously testified in 2019 against a ban on deer and elk baiting that had been issued to prevent further spread of chronic wasting disease, a fatal neurological illness that affects members of the deer family, namely the white-tailed deer in Michigan. 
While there have been no reported cases of the infection in people, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the disease “may pose a risk to people” and recommends that infected animals not be consumed as food by either humans or domestic animals.
Whitmer kills Nugent-backed deer baiting bill

Nugent also claimed that the DNR and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission have abdicated their “moral duty” by violating hunters’ rights on wasting disease regulations.
He also called the people in the department and on the commission “insane,” claiming the regulations have run good hunters out of the state.
“There were 11 counties that were forbidden to hunt on Sunday,” Nugent claimed in a particularly loud portion of his commentary. “Who is the man that can intervene between God’s nature and my recreational sporting spirit, [my] connection to the good Earth, that can tell me that, somehow, mysteriously, the hunting season ends when the sun goes down on Saturday. That’s insane.”
Nugent went on to call for legislators to do away with game laws that he and others testifying before the committees on Wednesday said were based on junk science for the sake of regulation and not for protection of people and wildlife.
Borton has had his own seemingly negative interactions with the DNR. Borton said that the DNR cited him in 2010 for a birdfeeder with a livestream he operated near his home, dubbed by Borton and his wife as a “snowman cam.” 
It was alleged that the department falsely claimed the birdfeeder was an illegal bait pile for hunting deer. Borton said he contested the alleged government overreach and eventually won. He has since been calling for decreasing the scope of the DNR’s regulatory authority.
Borton controls the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the department’s budget, and Wednesday’s hearing seemed like a precursor to a potential scaling back of the department’s enforcement funding.
The Oversight subcommittee’s chair, state Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), also called on residents to testify following Nugent on allegations that DNR agents used fake names to hunt privately owned pigs on northern hunting grounds. The aim, they claimed, was to kill and seize them without compensating their owners.
Dems and others call foul on Nugent free-for-all hearing
At one point during the meeting, state Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park) was given an opportunity to speak and chided House Republicans for hosting Nugent and the hearing when they had a budget to pass.
The GOP-led House has passed its public and higher education budgets but has yet to pass a budget funding the rest of the state government and its agencies. The Democratic-led Senate, however, has passed its total budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year and is eager to start negotiations.
“I appreciate the passion of the testimony and concern around law and order,” Weiss said. “I’ve got to say, I feel really emotional, really upset, because I’m a mother and a teacher and the fact that we’re sitting here talking about salt licks and feral pigs when we are a month away from a deadline to get a budget passed. … I think it’s shameful.”
Weiss was almost immediately cut off, with several of her Republican colleagues jeering, grumbling and saying, “oh shut up,” as Weiss continued to call the proceedings shameful.
Following the meeting, state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) agreed with Weiss’ assessment and questioned Nugent’s use of the word immoral to describe hunting regulations given the content of some of his music and lyrics.
“We have submitted school aid budget that we could be negotiating on, and just frankly, I’m not interested in being lectured about morality by somebody who sang about raping 13 year olds,” Pohutsky said, referring to the lyrics of Nugent’s song titled Jailbait. “It’s absurd.”
That point was echoed by Sam Inglot, Progress Michigan executive director, who issued a statement noting the controversies in Nugent’s past.
“Ted Nugent has a long, documented history of promoting racism, misogyny, violent political rhetoric and election denial. Nugent’s past also includes deeply disturbing allegations of grooming and abuse that should disqualify him from being legitimized by Michigan Republicans. His presence at today’s Natural Resources hearings is not only offensive, it’s dangerous,” Inglot said.

Without a single finger fumble I forwarded the call to our then-legal director, William Sharp, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Within hours of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Obergefell case, which enshrined the freedom to marry into law, Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis announced she would stop issuing marriage licenses to any couples, straight or gay, because of her religious objections to marriage for same-sex couples. The ACLU of Kentucky was honored to represent four couples — two gay and two straight in suing Davis. Our argument was simple: Kim Davis’s personal religious beliefs did not excuse her from doing her job: to certify that couples were qualified to marry under Kentucky law.
The case drew intense media scrutiny. Our brave clients were put under international scrutiny. While the case was being litigated all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and back down to the district court level, Rowan County residents, known as the Rowan County Rights Coalition, organized protests in front of the clerk’s office. Every single day, they demanded that Davis do her job. A couple of governors, the band Survivor, and even the Pope were swept up in the firestorm in the months that followed.
Ultimately, love won. Our clients, April Miller and Karen Roberts, Jody Fernandez and Kevin Holloway, Aaron Skaggs and Barry W. Spartman, were able to receive their marriage licenses. Their bravery and perseverance to secure legal protection for their families, and all Kentuckians, are exemplary in the ACLU of Kentucky’s 70-year history of protecting and advancing civil rights and civil liberties in the commonwealth.

A decade after this victory, anti-LGBTQ activists and politicians are spearheading attacks against the rights of LGBTQ people to participate in public life. Many of these attacks, from statehouses to the White House, target the rights and lives of transgender people. Just this month, the Supreme Court handed down a devastating and cruel ruling, allowing bans on the lifesaving medical care transgender youth need to stay in place in half of the states in the country, including Kentucky. 
In this critical moment for LGBTQ rights, we must unite against discrimination and division. We envision a future where LGBTQ individuals thrive in safe schools, empowered communities and loving families.  
We reject the politics of cynicism that demands we silence our voices, shrink our needs, and simply give up in the face of an unrelenting assault on our rights. Inspired by our Rowan County clients, the Rowan County Rights Coalition, and in loving memory of Barry Spartman who passed away in 2022, we stand committed to a world where all people deserve safe schools, strong communities, loving families and self-determination over their bodies and future.

AI is a great tool, likely to strengthen top economic sectors in Michigan like agriculture and manufacturing, Daniel Kroth, senior researcher at the Center for AI Risk Management and Alignment told members of the state House Judiciary Committee Wednesday. But without mandates for risk management protocols, AI’s ability to problem solve and come up with solutions could lead to cyber attacks that endanger human life and the environment.
Given the mandate to win a game of chess, some advanced AI models resort to exploiting cyber vulnerabilities to hack their opponent, Kroth said. From deleting chess pieces to forfeiting the game on behalf of their opponent, AI will complete its task of “winning” a game of chess.
“Hacking to win at chess is almost funny, but it’s much less funny when our healthcare or industrial control systems are on the other side of the board,” Kroth said.
Whether bad actors use AI for nefarious purposes or AI itself makes an ultimately detrimental decision, Kroth argued there’s need for guardrails on this technology so Michiganders can experience the best it has to offer while managing the worst.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Bill 4668, being considered by the committee, would create the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Transparency Act, mandating large developers of foundation models to create and implement protocols for safety and security to prevent ‘critical risk’. This means any risk that would result in the serious harm or death of more than 100 people or cause more than $100 million in damages.
The bill would require companies that spend more than $100 million a year to develop foundational models and those that have spent $5 million on an individual model to test them for dangerous capabilities and enact safeguards to mitigate reasonable risks.
As a native Michigander, Kroth said he’s proud to see Michigan engaging with AI, both in using it to improve residents’ lives and for the legislature’s interest in creating legislation to regulate it.
“Getting this right for our state will require an understanding of the unique nature of the risks posed by AI,” Kroth said. “AI isn’t just ChaGPT. It’s a family of technologies designed to perform tasks that normally require human thinking, like understanding speech, recognizing images, making decisions or solving problems. It’s this problem solving and autonomy that make AI incredibly promising, and like many powerful tools, potentially dangerous as well.”
One scenario Kroth presented is an AI system charged with increasing the efficiency of a factory that reasons to save on waste management, it should discharge toxic waste into a nearby river, without human direction to make that decision.
ChatGPT just a few years ago couldn’t perform simple math equations with precision, but now AI is winning math competitions, outpacing human capability, Andrew Doris, a senior policy analyst at the Secure AI Project, told members of the committee Wednesday.
AI can help humans solve complex problems, Doris said, it can also be used to perpetuate major cyber attacks or give instructions on how to create a bio weapon and then how to cause the most harm to the public.
“By this time next year, a lot of experts worry that we’re going to be in a much scarier place, and that the window to get out ahead of that is closing pretty quickly,” Doris said. “We think that the way to get out ahead of that is to require the companies building these models to develop what’s called safety and security protocols describing how they will test their models for these dangerous capabilities and what safeguards that they will put in to mitigate those risks.”
The largest AI companies currently implement these protocols voluntarily already, Doris said, but as the field becomes more competitive, it’s important to mandate that companies don’t cut corners on safety.
Federal regulations on AI are slow moving and time is of the essence, Doris added, so Michigan ought not to wait for federal action or a domestic tragedy to occur before it takes preventative action.
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), who is the sponsor for House Bill 4668, briefly outlined on Wednesday another bill being considered by the committee concerning AI.
House Bill 4667 would create specific criminal penalties for intentional development or usage of AI to commit a crime.
Lightner used the example of a grandmother getting a scam call using an AI-generated audio recording of her granddaughter in order to scam the grandmother out of thousands of dollars. If the scammer is caught, they can be charged with fraud, but there isn’t an area of state criminal law that fully encapsulates the weaponization of AI, Lightner said.
Under the bill, it would be a mandatory 8-year felony for a person who develops, possesses, or uses an AI system with the intent to use the system to commit a crime. This is similar to Michigan’s felony firearm law, which adds an additional criminal penalty to a felony if the perpetrator had a firearm while committing the felony.
Creating or distributing an AI system with the intent that another person uses the system to commit a crime would be a felony under the bill, carrying a mandatory 4-year prison sentence.
“This bill gives prosecutors a new way to capture the full story of what happened and to hold the perpetrator fully accountable, because if we don’t name this kind of exploitation in our law, we leave our most vulnerable residents, like a grandma, in legal limbo,” Lightner said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1477933017-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 16:08:49.101877

The City Council had axed tax funding for health care services because clinic’s website had once contained abortion-related links.
The post Gillette Reproductive Health funding restored with restrictions appeared first on WyoFile .","GILLETTE—After a tense Gillette City Council meeting, $30,000 in funding for Gillette Reproductive Health was returned to the city’s 2025-2026 budget during a third and final reading with a 5-2 vote.
Gillette Mayor Shay Lundvall, Ward One Representative Jim West, Ward Two’s Tim Carsrud and Ward Three’s Heidi Gross and Nathan McLeland voted last week to reintroduce the funding.
Voting against the measure was Ward One’s Chris Smith and Ward Two’s Jack Clary, the latter having proposed the initial removal of the funding during the first reading earlier this month, which had passed with a 4-3 vote.
Ahead of the proposed amendment, the council heard dozens of pleas from citizens of the city and wider Campbell County area during the budget’s public forum, with the majority asking them to restore the funding.
“It is easy to stand at a podium or pulpit and oppose access to Plan B, birth control, and essential women’s healthcare,” said Laurin Jensen, reading a statement on behalf of her friend Savannah Maddocks. “It is far more difficult — and far less visible — to walk alongside a woman who is trying to raise a child alone, underpaid, under-resourced, and overwhelmed.”
According to the amendment, proposed by Carsrud, the $30,000 in 1% sales tax funding for Gillette Reproductive Health would be restored with certain restrictions.
“Your decision reflects not only the facts but the voices of more than 1,200 community members who have signed a petition and many others making their voice heard online. “Julie Price Carroll, Gillette Reproductive Health 
In addition to not being able to use the funds for the promotion of abortion, directly or indirectly, the amendment required the monies to be kept separate from GRH’s general fund, provide an itemized account of the funds used and keep any links to websites or materials promoting abortion off its own website. 
Finally, the clinic would be unable to make medical referrals for abortion services.
“If we’re able to come to a reasonable compromise, we can at least have the assurance that steps are being taken to prevent abortion referrals,” Lundvall said. “If we walk away from this opportunity, the city forfeits its seat at the table, and with it, our ability to influence this matter in a meaningful, values driven way, and I’ll leave you with this, if, through all this effort, we can come together as a city and save even just one life, then every bit of work, debate and compromise will have been worth it.”
Following the reintroduction of the funding, the council quickly voted 6-1 to approve the third and final reading of the budget, with Clary casting the only vote against.
Following the vote, Gillette Reproductive Health Executive Director Julie Price Carroll returned to the podium during the meeting’s general public comment, expressing her thanks for the change in course by the council.
“On behalf of the board, the staff, the community and our patients, I want to thank you and the council for voting to continue funding for GRH,” she said. “Your decision reflects not only the facts but the voices of more than 1,200 community members who have signed a petition and many others making their voice heard online. We are grateful for your support and remain committed to providing compassionate compliance and essential health care to people in this community.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that the temporary detention center being constructed at an isolated Everglades airfield will have “zero impact” on Everglades restoration, rebuking concerns by environmental advocates and local officials who say the project threatens drinking water and protected land.
Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said this week in a written statement that her office has “significant concerns about the scope and scale of the state’s efforts, particularly regarding the environmental safeguards in place given the potentially devastating impact to the Everglades.”
DeSantis scoffed at those remarks while appearing at a bill-signing event in Tampa on Wednesday, contending the opposition from critics stems from their antipathy to the crackdown on undocumented immigrants by the Trump administration.
“I think people are just — they’re trying to use the Everglades as a pretext, just for the fact that they oppose immigration enforcement,” he said.
“I mean, let’s be clear. That’s where you are from the far left now. They don’t want the laws enforced at all, and you’re seeing that with some of the demonstrations and some of the other things. You have a right to have that view, but that is not the policy of the United States of America. That is not the policy of the state of Florida.”
The Sierra Club and Friends of the Everglades are among the organizations that have come out in opposition to the project.
“This proposal is not only deeply inhumane, it is profoundly irresponsible from an environmental, ethical, and fiscal standpoint,” said Javier Estevez, political and legislative director with Sierra Club Florida.
”The Everglades is a unique and fragile ecosystem — a UNESCO World Heritage Site, home to countless endangered species, and a vital source of drinking water for more than nine million Floridians. To pave over a portion of this irreplaceable landscape for a high‑security prison is nothing short of ecological vandalism.”
On Sunday, Friends of the Everglades held a protest against the plan at the abandoned Everglades Jetport in the Big Cypress National Preserve. They are directing their members to urge the governor and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to back off the plan.
DeSantis confirmed on Wednesday that the federal government will pay all of the costs of constructing and maintaining the facility, which is expected to provide as many as 1,000 beds to hold undocumented migrants once it is completed, according to a video posted last week on social media by Uthmeier.
DeSantis added that the state will soon begin work on “something similar” at Camp Blanding Joint Training Center near Starke, which serves as the primary military reservation and training base for the Florida National Guard.
Everglades money
The governor expressed incredulity that anyone could claim that in backing this plan he was somehow working to set back Everglades restoration.
“You’re talking about the guy who’s plowed how much money into Everglades restoration?” DeSantis said rhetorically when asked about concerns that the detention facility could harm Everglades restoration.
“In fact, [Senate President] Ben Albritton and I had to fight to get Everglades fully funded [this year]. The original House budget print in the Florida House cut half a billion dollars out of Everglades restoration.”
The budget passed by the Legislature last week includes $810 million for Everglades restoration, the largest single-year commitment in the state’s history. DeSantis had offered $805 million in his original proposed budget, but the House proposed allocating just $357 million. Going into this year, the DeSantis administration announced that it had devoted $6.5 billion for Everglades restoration since he entered office in January 2019.
DeSantis is using emergency powers to gain control of the land, after his administration offered to buy it from the county. The Florida Department of Emergency Management offered to purchase the land for $20 million, but Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava gave a counteroffer of $190 million, leading DeSantis’ office to describe the request as “unreasonable.”
The Phoenix asked DeSantis whether it is possible for the two parties to negotiate an agreed upon price.
“They’ve been working on it,” he said. “I think that response is more posturing for the stuff, but this is actually a Collier-Dade Airport that’s there. We use it for emergencies. It ain’t like we’re creating something new. It’s a way to do this in conjunction with the federal government, who’s funding it in a way that’s not going to have impacts on our broader community.”

Martin Heinrich (center) hosted a roundtable discussion with other western Democratic senators and advocates in wildlife, hunting and fishing and lands rallying against proposed sales of public lands. (Screenshot by Danielle Prokop) Republican-backed proposals to sell swaths of public lands represent an assault to tribal sovereignty, outdoor recreation, critical wildlife habitat and “our children’s birthrights,” U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said Wednesday.
“In one fell swoop, these proposals threaten every form of outdoor recreation, every form of natural and cultural heritage and habitat for wildlife — all to pay for a tax handout,” Heinrich said during a discussion he hosted in Washington, D.C. that included other Democratic US senators, alongside hunters, wildlife advocates and legal experts. “That doesn’t sound very American to me, and it clearly doesn’t sound very American to the hundreds of thousands of people across the political spectrum in the West raising their voices right now.”
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

Heinrich’s event comes as uncertainty prevails regarding a controversial proposal to sell off public lands to build housing spearheaded by Republican Sen. Mike Lee from Utah.
After the U.S. Senate Parliamentarian determined earlier this week that the language in Lee’s proposal did not comply with the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, Lee said he would revise the proposal and that he would exclude U.S. Forest Service land and limit the Bureau of Land Management land to areas near “population centers.”
Heinrich, the ranking member of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, applauded the parliamentarian’s decision, but warned “the fight is not over.”
He pointed out the finality of selling off public lands, saying: “Once these lands go into private hands, we will not get them back. From the date of sale, the land must be used for what it is sold for: development. It can never be used for conservation, recreation, hunting, fishing — all the things that these lands provide today.”
  Hilary Tompkins, a former solicitor in the U.S. Department of the Interior in the Obama administration, said Wednesday that Lee’s proposed sales of public lands are overlooking local or tribal input. (Screenshot by Danielle Prokop)
Hilary Tompkins, a former solicitor in the U.S. Department of the Interior in the Obama administration, said Lee’s proposal bypassed tribal consultation, even though much of the land in question lies in Indian Country.
“There’s also no clear protection for sacred sites and cultural resources of tribes and the public lands that would be sold to the highest bidder,” Tompkins said.
GOP bill makes 14 million acres of public land in NM ‘eligible’ for sale, according to new analysis

She noted the original proposal identified U.S. Forest Service lands on Mount Taylor in Grants, New Mexico, one of four mountains sacred to the Navajo nation.
“This is a very precious place for me and my family, and we have conducted important ceremonial life journey milestones involving that mountain. We cannot put these precious places on the auction block,” said Tompkins, who is originally from Ramah, New Mexico.
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada) urged Lee to listen to people with concerns about sales of public lands.
“If he wants to do something in his own state of Utah, more power to you, go do it, work with all the stakeholders, let’s do it,” she said. “But don’t come into our states and dictate what should be done.”
Heinrich pointed to his recent experiences fishing on Pecos River, and said while the lands are some of his favorite places in New Mexico, it’s crucial that they remain open for future generations.
“Public lands are an essential democratic part of American culture and identity, and they belong to us,” he said. “They define us.”

Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) asks to read her unrecorded votes into the record.On the final day of the Maine Legislature, Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives held one final argument over the rights of censured lawmaker Rep. Laurel Libby, debating over her request to read unrecorded votes into the record.
The Auburn Republican had been barred from voting or speaking on the chamber floor in late February for posting a transgender student’s personal information on her legislative Facebook page. She petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for relief after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure, which she argued disenfranchised her constituents. In May, the court granted an injunction restoring her right to vote and speak on the House floor.
Citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, Libby sought unanimous consent from her colleagues to read into the record those that she would have taken during the term of her censure. Some Democratic representatives objected, sparking a heated debate about civility, legislative process, and constitutional rights. Despite initial objections, she was ultimately allowed to speak after a 106-34 vote.
The debate over letting her speak highlighted some of the ongoing tensions within the chamber, with Republicans representatives blaming the Democratic majority for silencing Libby. 
“This is an example of raw political power, one party exerting control over another … and not letting one of one of the minority members speak,” said Rep. Joseph Underwood (R-Presque Isle).
Rep. Richard Campbell, a Republican from Orrington, said in his 32 years serving in and out of the state legislature, “what I’ve observed in this first regular session of 132nd is the worst I’ve ever seen.”
However, Rep. Christina Mitchell (D-Cumberland) pushed back, pointing out that Libby always had the opportunity to apologize for her action, which would have ended the censure.
“A precedent was set before in this house when a choice was made not to apologize,” she said.
Others questioned whether there was any difference in speaking votes out loud or more formally having them documented on the record. House Speaker Ryan Fecteau replied that there wasn’t, because everything that now happens in the chamber is documented via video and archived.
“The request is more so a formality than anything else at this point,” he said.
After the vote, Libby proceeded to read hundreds of votes on bills into the record, speaking for more than 20 minutes.
 When she started speaking, some Democrats left the chamber. Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) who co-chairs the Llabor Committee on which Libby serves, said the representative has had the ability to vote on bills in committee meetings while censured, but has rarely shown up, even in instances where her vote could have changed the outcome of bills. 
“She was too busy telling the media how she was being silenced to actually use her voice and her vote on the work her constituents elected her to do,” Roeder told Maine Morning Star.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)FRANKFORT — Celebrating the passage of a swath of GOP policies this year, Senate Republican leaders, joined by constitutional officers, on Wednesday highlighted laws that will go into effect Friday. 
The senators also unveiled the temporary quarters where lawmakers will convene while the Capitol undergoes renovations over the next few years. The new building stands next to the Capitol Annex in Frankfort. 
It is unclear at this point if the Republican-controlled General Assembly will need to reconvene before January for a special session to allocate more dollars toward Kentucky communities recovering from storm damage in recent months, the Republican senators said. In 2026, the General Assembly will deliberate the next two-year state budget. 
Most laws the General Assembly passed earlier this year are set to take effect Friday, as per the Kentucky Constitution. Bills that aren’t general appropriates or have emergency causes go into effect 90 days after the legislature adjourns.  
The new laws include:

Senate Bill 2, which ends hormone treatments for transgender inmates in Kentucky prisons. 
Senate Bill 19, which requires public schools to observe a daily moment of silence and permits off-campus “moral instruction.” 
Senate Bill 84 says that Kentucky courts should interpret laws without referring to a state agency’s interpretation of them, much like the U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down the precedent of the Chevron deference at the federal level. 
House Bill 45 aims to limit foreign influence in Kentucky elections for ballot measures, like a constitutional amendment. 
House Bill 342 requires high school students to take a financial literacy course before graduating. 

Senate Republican Floor Leader Max Wise, of Campbellsville, said that the more than 100 new laws are “each a product of thoughtful policy making” through the legislative process. 
“Together, they reflect the core concern priorities embraced by the Kentucky General Assembly, the supermajorities, and those priorities — lowering taxes, better schools, safer communities and a government that serves the people,” he said. 
Legislators are in the midst of the interim session, where committees with House and Senate members meet to discuss policies and review reports ahead of the next legislative session. Some of those groups also include special task forces, like the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Kentucky Task Force. Senate President Robert Stivers pointed to the group as a way to study how to make health care more accessible at a time when Medicaid funding is in the national spotlight. A U.S. House bill approved last month included a $793 billion cut to Medicaid funding over the next decade and is now in the U.S. Senate. 
Stivers said that focusing on supporting farm-to-table agriculture programs could be a way to promote “healthier lifestyles” naturally with fresh produce on Kentucky tables. 
“This will help with the A1C, the blood pressure, all the other health care indices that we have that are poor in this state,” Stivers said. 
Weeks ago, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said he would likely call a special session of the legislature to allocate more funding to communities affected by storms earlier this year, including tornadoes. However, the Senate leaders were not sure if a session would be needed at this point. 
“We’re waiting to see what the governor’s numbers are and the money that has been allocated for these specific events and see how the executive branch has been addressing them,” said Senate Republican Caucus Chair Robby Mills, of Henderson. “There was quite a substantial amount of storm damage. It does take time to recover. And we’ve got a few months until we’re back in session.” 
The General Assembly approved a bill to set up a state aid fund for response to floods before it adjourned this year. That included raising a cap the legislature had placed on emergency spending by the Beshear administration without lawmakers’ approval. 
Stivers said if Beshear needs more money, lawmakers can do a one-day session to approve funds. The Senate pPresident had previously vowed that lawmakers were ready to provide any necessary funding for recovery. 
After this year’s session adjourned, legislative furniture and items were moved into the temporary chamber, and Stivers added that the space would be functional if a special session is called before January.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Israel and Iran are engaged in a tenuous truce after U.S. forces bombed key Iranian nuclear facilities Saturday. War broke out between the long-time enemy nations earlier this month when Israel launched a surprise attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, which retaliated with missile strikes against Israel.
As the sun set Tuesday, organizers handed out electric tea candles to members of the crowd. Activists at the rear of the group brought a large illuminated sign reading “Trump must go now,” shining a dim light on the proceedings.
Shabnam Bashiri, an Iranian-American and organizer with the American Friends Service Committee, dismissed arguments from supporters of the U.S. strikes that the attacks will spur Iranians to rise up against their government.
“At the end of the day, liberation never comes from the outside,” she said. “So it’s up to the Iranian people to determine that for themselves. I think the idea that folks would be greeted as liberators with bombs is just a ridiculous thing to think, and it has been proven over and over again that that’s not the case, and I hope that people’s memories aren’t so short-term.”
Many of those at the vigil said they are concerned about the U.S. being dragged into a broader war that could be costly in money and lives.

“This is the same pattern that we have seen used before, the same pattern of we have to stop them from getting this weapon that we do not have evidence that these strikes will stop, we have to act now” said Marisa Pyle, an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace Atlanta. “This is what we’re told time and time again, without evidence, from people who want to escalate aggression for their own goals and to consolidate their own power.”
President Donald Trump and allies have said the strikes were intended to thwart Iran’s ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon. The U.S. intelligence community as recently as March reported that Iran was not seeking to create such a weapon.
“Our president is ignoring our intelligence agencies, ignoring the entire world’s intelligence, saying that Iran does not have nuclear bombs, and we are going purely off of what Israel is asking us to do, and that is not OK,” said attendee Shanda Williams.
Among Georgia leaders, reaction to the strikes fell mostly along party lines, with Republicans generally but not universally backing them and Democrats mostly in opposition, arguing that they were not necessary and that Trump should have sought approval from Congress.

As the vigil went on, attendees waved signs to passing traffic, eliciting honks and cheers as well as some less supportive noises from motorists, including cries of “Trump!”
Atlanta Civil rights attorney Mawuli Davis compared the protests with those organized by Georgia civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke out against the Vietnam War – a stance that earned him criticism at the time.
“There are going to be people who will point at us and criticize us and use all kinds of scapegoating and all kinds of tactics to try to diminish our voice, but we can’t allow that to dissuade us from knowing that we’re standing on the right side of this,” he said. “You can’t say you love Dr. King if you don’t love non-violence and you don’t love the call to stop the war, no wars. The connection is clear, it’s not about being popular, it’s about justice and being on the right side of history.”

,DC,2025-06-25 18:41:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate panel grills Trump CDC nominee on vaccines,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-panel-grills-trump-cdc-nominee-vaccines,,"WASHINGTON — Members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions pressed President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccine recommendations Wednesday after the Health and Human Services secretary fired members of a critical vaccine panel this month.Trump’s pick, former acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, said that she trusted vaccines while defending HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision this month — widely seen as part of a vaccine-skeptical agenda — to fire all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and recommend eight new members.“Part of the secretary's vision in restoring public trust is making sure that the American people can be confident in the way the evidence and science is driving decision-making,” she told senators.The panel’s seven members — one dropped out this week — will meet Wednesday and Thursday to review data and vote on new vaccine recommendations. The recommendations carry significant weight as insurance providers and federal health programs like Medicaid use them to determine if shots are covered and schools rely on them for immunization mandates.Cassidy questionsLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who chairs the committee, said he was concerned about ACIP, especially as a non-CDC staff member is scheduled to give a presentation to the committee about thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. The panel is expected to vote on approving flu shots that contain the compound.Lyn Redwood, the former head of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, is giving the presentation arguing that thimerosal causes autism.Cassidy said that while Monarez had no part in this week's ACIP meeting, or the agenda, he said that “if the ACIP hearing today is being used to sow distrust, I would ask that going forward, that you would make sure that there really was a balanced perspective.”“Yes, someone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who is reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,” Cassidy, who is a physician, said.Monarez, who was the agency’s acting director from January to March, said that she trusted vaccines and that immunization was important to save lives.If Monarez is confirmed by the Senate, she would be the first director of the CDC without a medical degree in nearly 70 years. She has a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology.More concerns about vaccine panelCassidy was not the only Republican on the panel concerned about the firing of all the members of ACIP.Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was concerned about the backgrounds of the seven new panelists.“I would hope that one of the things that you would all be looking into is to make sure that these individuals are going to be looking at the science in front of them, (and) leave their political bias at home,” Murkowski said.Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland also pressed Monarez about Kennedy’s actions to fire everyone on the panel.Murray asked Monarez if the new members of the panel voted to not recommend vaccines, if she would listen to that recommendation.Monarez sidestepped the question and said the roles at ACIP were difficult to fill and that members needed to pass an ethics process.“If they have not gone through an ethics approval process they shouldn’t be participating in the meetings,” she said.Alsobrooks asked Monarez if she believed the 17 members fired from ACIP lacked qualifications.Monarez did not answer the question, but said Kennedy’s reasoning for “resetting the ACIP to a new cohort was going to be on the path of restoring public trust.”Grant funding and layoffsSenators also raised concerns about grants that had been canceled, even though Congress already approved the funds.Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins, who is the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, said that her state is suffering from a high level of Lyme disease and as a result a vaccine was in the works at a research institute in Maine.“This vaccine is very promising and I want to make sure that it is allowed to continue to its conclusion,” Collins said.Monarez agreed and said if she is confirmed, she will specifically work to make sure funding for that vaccine continues.“It's ironic that our dogs can get a vaccine to protect them against tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease but we humans can’t and I hope we can remedy that,” Collins said.Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, pressed Monarez about the elimination of the Office on Smoking and Health at the CDC. He asked if she was involved in laying off all the staff in April, the month after her brief stint as acting director ended.“I had no participation in (the layoffs) after I left,” she said.Fluoride in waterAlsobrooks pressed Monarez about Kennedy’s push to have the CDC stop recommending that low levels of fluoride be placed in public drinking water.Fluoride is added in drinking water to help prevent cavities, tooth decay and other dental health issues.Alsobrooks asked Monarez, who is her constituent, if the public water supply that contains fluoride in Potomac, Maryland, where Monarez lives, was safe to drink.“I believe the water in Potomac, Maryland, is safe,” Monarez said.",,,,2025-06-25 15:10:56.389388

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Criticizing the “unnecessary” taxes and fees in lawmakers’ approved fiscal 2026 budget, Gov. Dan McKee announced Wednesday that he will not sign the $14.3 billion tax-and-spend plan.
Instead, the budget will take effect without McKee’s signature — the first time a state budget has passed sans the gubernatorial stamp of approval since 2010 under then-Gov. Don Carcieri.
McKee blasted the Rhode Island General Assembly for the changes made to his original, proposed fiscal 2026 budget — revisions that, as McKee tells it, he was unaware of until after the House Committee on Finance unveiled the amended spending plan on June 10.
“The issues I am talking about today were not privy to me until it was privy to you,” McKee told reporters at a press conference at the William E. Powers Department of Administration building Wednesday morning.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson were equally in the dark on McKee’s intent not to sign the budget until Wednesday. They received a two-page letter from McKee at the same time it was distributed to reporters, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, said in an email. 
Shekarchi and Lawson stood by their approved spending plan despite McKee’s critique.
“We were proud to again pass a balanced and responsible budget with bipartisan support that was delivered for Rhode Islanders by addressing our state’s health care crisis and continuing to improve access to housing that families can afford,” they said in a joint statement Wednesday afternoon.
McKees’s biggest sources of concern are a 2-cent-per-gallon increase in the state gas tax, meant to help plug the deficit facing the Rhode Island Public Transit Agency, an increase in real estate conveyance taxes and a new, $4 per-person monthly health insurance fee to pay for a state assessment on health care needs.
“This is not a time to be putting fees and additional taxes on the working families in the state of Rhode Island,” McKee said. “I am drawing a line in the sand. We need to have a great deal more fiscal responsibility.”
Yet, McKee stopped short of vetoing the budget, noting that because the state’s executive does not have line-item veto power, the “best message” was to omit his signature.
“I deal in the world that is reality,” McKee said. “The best message I can send is what I am doing now, which is letting people know they are being taxed unnecessarily.”










This is not a time to be putting fees and additional taxes on the working families in the state of Rhode Island. I am drawing a line in the sand. 


– Gov. Dan McKee on why he won't sign the state's fiscal 2026 budget


McKee made clear he wants the move to put pressure on lawmakers by raising public attention to the slew of tax and fee raises that, in his mind, have slipped under the radar till now.
He urged residents to call their state senators and representatives, noting that public pressure could, hypothetically, force the Rhode Island General Assembly to reconvene and change its spending plan.
Had McKee vetoed the budget, lawmakers would have been forced to return to the State House to make adjustments, or override his veto by a three-fifths majority of both chambers. McKee acknowledged the overwhelming support for the fiscal 2026 budget in both chambers meant a legislative override would be likely.

A State House divided 
McKee’s thinly veiled attack on lawmakers comes as he prepares for a 2026 reelection campaign which could include a primary challenge from Shekarchi. Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, has repeatedly denied any interest in running for governor next year. But the two state leaders no longer appear in lock step, evidenced by a series of cracks in their previously united front.
In May, Shekarchi attempted to block McKee’s proposed raises for a dozen of his cabinet members. The pay bumps ultimately went through, after Senate President Valarie Lawson declined to give the necessary sign-on from her chamber to stop the raises.
In unveiling the lawmakers’ revised fiscal 2026 spending plan earlier this month, Shekarchi also expressed frustration with the many miscalculations and unexpected holes McKee left for the Rhode Island General Assembly to clean up. 
McKee insisted Wednesday that his initial fiscal 2026 spending plan was a “good solid budget,” while the version approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly as a “bad budget.”
Shekarchi and Lawson refuted McKee’s framing.
“Months of public testimony highlighted the ways in which the budget submitted in January did not address these priorities and included items that were simply unworkable or broke promises we made to retirees,” they said. 
Lawmakers restored a required $21.6 million allocation to the state pension fund in the final fiscal 2026 budget. McKee had proposed to skip the mandatory return of half of the state’s unspent surplus to its pension system.
House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican, voted against the state’s fiscal 2026 budget. Yet Chippendale also criticized McKee for what he said was a “transparently political” decision to let the spending plan go into effect without his signature.
“If he truly felt this budget was unacceptable and was acting on principle, he would have vetoed it, not staged a PR move,” Chippendale said in a statement Wednesday.  “It takes genuine leadership to make the hard decisions to right-size our budget.”
It’s not unusual for lawmakers to take red ink to the executive’s spending plan based on their own policy priorities as well as updated state revenue numbers, which are not available until May of each year. Executive and legislative leaders hammer out their differences in closed-door negotiations, a practice which McKee confirmed also took place this year.
Yet, McKee also said he was completely unaware that the revised budget would raise the state gas tax — set to hit 41 cents per gallon starting July 1 — despite having “open and frank” conversations with lawmakers about RIPTA throughout the session. 
“Rhode Islanders already pay more at the pump than drivers in Massachusetts (27 cents) and Connecticut (25 cents) and this change would further worsen our regional competitive disadvantage,” McKee wrote in his letter to Shekarchi. 
Massachusetts and Connecticut residents also pay state or local car taxes, while Rhode Island phased out its motor vehicle excise tax completely in 2023.
The state’s gas tax increase, along with a larger share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, provides nearly half of the money needed to close RIPTA’s estimated $32.6 million deficit. But McKee’s administration presented an alternative plan to legislative leaders that could have given the same amount of money to RIPTA without raising taxes — instead redirecting 2 cents from the existing gas tax along with carryforward revenue from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and state bonds money.
McKee’s proposed fiscal 2026 spending plan did not offer any extra money for RIPTA, despite its well-documented cash woes. McKee said he was waiting for results of an agency efficiency study, which was supposed to be completed this spring but remains unfinished.

Powers Department of Administration building on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)
State surplus ‘more than enough’
McKee also dismissed questions about why he opted not to present his own, revised fiscal 2026 spending plan after the updated state revenue estimates came out in May. The biannual Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference revealed an extra $67 million in state revenue for the current fiscal year, which McKee said was sufficient to cover expenses without raising taxes and fees.
Even after backfilling the funds to cover an undercount of students in poverty and new contracts with state troopers and corrections officers, the fiscal 2025 surplus still left $23 million to share across priority measures like increasing primary care reimbursement rates, according to napkin math presented by Brian Daniels, director of Rhode Island’s Office of Management and Budget.
Still, that balance would not cover everything lawmakers included in their spending plan: aid to hospitals, nursing homes, cities and towns, and college graduates who stay and work in in-demand fields in the state.
“These are all things we generally support but we did not include them because we had to make difficult choices,” Daniels said.
McKee’s tirade against higher taxes was coupled with many mentions of uncertainty over federal funding, which, if cut, could upend critical state Medicaid and food assistance programs. He acknowledged that what comes out of Washington may merit future tax hikes or other new revenue sources — but until Congress finalizes its own spending plan, any state tax and fee increases are unnecessary.
The fiscal 2026 budget also applies the state’s 7% sales tax to short-term public parking, while raising fees on traffic violations and vehicle registrations. And, it sets the stage for a new tax on second homes worth over $1 million starting July 1, 2026. McKee did not directly answer multiple questions regarding his stance on the “Taylor Swift tax,” a reference to the pop star’s $28.3 million vacation home in Westerly.  
“We didn’t have to raise taxes on anyone in this budget,” he said. “We could have balanced the budget and met the most important issues still on the table.”
The fiscal 2026 budget approved by lawmakers is set to take effect Friday.

Spencer Cox has a new leadership position among his Western counterparts, and also, a new platform to advance an item sitting on top of his priorities agenda — energy abundance.
On Tuesday, during the annual meeting of the Western Governors’ Association, an organization that aims to join bipartisan policy among governors of 22 Western states and territories, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham passed the gavel to Cox as the association’s new chair.
Along with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green as vice chair, Cox is set to serve in this role for the next year. Cox is planning to use his tenure to implement a year-long initiative focusing on tools to meet the West’s growing energy demand, according to a news release.

“Governor Lujan Grisham has been a tremendous Chair, showing real leadership in uniting us around addressing the housing crisis,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “Our new focus on energy is bold — and urgently needed. It’s been nearly 50 years since we’ve had this kind of moment: rising demand, available capital, and the political will to build. And that’s exactly what we intend to do.”
With his “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West,” Cox is hoping to examine challenges and opportunities to expand energy production, modernize transmission and storage options.
“The West is rich in energy — but outdated infrastructure, permitting delays, and rising demand threaten America’s energy edge,” a website for Cox’s initiative says. With this year-long platform, it states, “the West is building the backbone of a more reliable, affordable, and secure grid.”
Cox’s plans for the Western Governors’ Association is in line with what he has in mind for Utah. Last year, Cox unveiled “Operation Gigawatt,” a strategy to double the state’s energy production over the next 10 years, boosting new resources like geothermal and nuclear. This year already Cox has been busy signing agreements with nuclear technology companies and other states, as well as heavily advocating to ease federal nuclear regulations.
Currently, Cox is working on gathering data through a survey aimed toward interested individuals or organizations to manage the scope of the initiative, identifying priority issues for governors, best practices for developing resources and infrastructure, and federal policy issues.

Utilizing $500 antenna kits designed by U of M, students at 18 schools across eight states and Puerto Rico have been working to monitor solar radio bursts, an earlier indicator of geomagnetic storms, as part of the SunRISE Ground Radio Lab.
Launched in August 2023, the collaboration has already yielded results, with a study published in Earth and Space Science Wednesday analyzing the project’s early findings. 
Mojtaba Akhavan-Tafti, an associate research scientist at U of M who leads the lab, told Michigan Advance that the project began as a program for both undergraduate and graduate students who were tasked with designing and building their own antenna and taking measurements, which they used for scientific analysis. 
Since the class started in 2021, it’s seen a strong turnout of students, Akhavan-Tafti said, starting with five or six students and growing to 21 to 22 students a semester. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Later on, NASA came back to us and said, ‘Hey, we know that this program has been very productive. A lot of students speak very highly of it. Is there any chance that you could involve high school students in your project, because, you know, they’re at the start of their careers, they’re trying to figure out what to do with their lives, and maybe they would be very interested in getting involved?’” Akhavan-Tafti said. 
However, the antennas students were building cost around $25,000 a unit, with shipping and assembly also presenting concerns. So they put the challenge to the college students, who developed an antenna that is simpler to install with a much smaller $500 price tag. 
With NASA covering the cost of the antenna kits, and another one of its programs, Radio JOVE, supplying them, the university began reaching out to high schools to see if they would be interested in participating in the lab program, later working with NASA’s educational programs to partner with schools across the country. 
“When we reached out to high schools originally to start the program, we had two requirements: One is that the school needs to be okay with installing the antenna on campus, and two that they need to be…collecting and uploading data on a regular basis, on a weekly basis, to our data repository,” Akhavan-Tafti said. 
After receiving the antenna, students work through an online training module introducing students to the field of radio astronomy, explaining what the antennas do and how to assemble them and breaking down what the data collected looks like and how it can be used scientifically.

Afterwards, an entire class would often work to install the antenna on campus, with the university offering guidance on how to collect and upload data, Akhavan-Tafti said.
The goal of the program is to engage students in science, technology, engineering, arts and math, or STEAM activities, with hopes of helping students realize that it’s not rocket science to get involved in the space industry, Akhavan-Tafti explained.
 “It’s a rapidly growing industry that needs people who are inspired and are ready for the challenge. And why not the next generation?” he said. 
Alongside tracking low-frequency radio bursts from the sun, the program also held two observation campaigns, capturing data during the previous October 2023 annular solar eclipse and the total solar eclipse in April 2024. 
While many of the high schools have completely automated their data collection process, the students have also been very helpful in characterizing the data, Akhavan-Tafti said. In addition to sifting through data to separate radio signals from other noise, the students have also been slowly working towards automating the categorization of different types of signals, he said.

As students monitor these signals from the ground, NASA has also been working to launch a set of six toaster-sized satellites to observe solar radio emissions from orbit. 
Akhavan-Tafti explained that these bursts of radio signals are tied to phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections, large bubbles of plasma which carry a magnetic field. When these ejections occur, they often take eight days to reach the earth where they can create geomagnetic storms. 
However, the radio signals associated with these events travel at the speed of light and arrive at the earth much earlier, Akhavan-Tafti explained, acting as a warning system for geomagnetic storms. 
While these storms are responsible for auroras, they can also disrupt signals, Akhavan-Tafti noted, pointing to $500 million in lost agricultural harvests in the U.S. last year due to automated tractors that rely on GPS going off track.
Additionally, geomagnetic storms can accelerate charged particles to very high speeds, potentially harming satellites and creating health and safety concerns for astronauts, Akahavan-Tafti said. 
Geomagnetic storms can also create radio blackouts and power outages, according to NASA. 
For students participating at the college level, they gain experience listening to a customer, designing a system to meet their needs, testing it in multiple environments to ensure it is functional and shipping out their prototype, Akhavan-Tafti explained. 
For high school students, the online training introduces them to radio astronomy, and exposes them to a number of concepts, including the various types of engineering and resources for getting involved in other science, technology, engineering and math based fields, he said. 
Students also learn how to work together to assemble their antenna and after completing the project, they receive a certificate from NASA which they can show while applying for university, Akhavan-Tafti said. 
“Beyond all of that, the data collection and analysis enables them to apply some of the science and math and engineering that they’ve learned in the classroom to real world problems to contribute to furthering our understanding of our universe,” Akhavan-Tafti said. 
Additionally as the space industry grows, this field will be where many students find themselves working, Akhavan-Tafti said, noting his focus is to teach students early on in their careers about the opportunities that are out there. 
“They could be the next scientists, they could be the next engineers, they could be the next policy makers, or even entrepreneurs who start their own businesses doing space-related activities. … we want the hardest working and smartest kids to start thinking about space and this space needs them,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SunRISE-GRL_Ann-Arbor-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 15:10:56.389388

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo: U.S. Department of Education)Nevada could see up to 12 new charter schools open in Fall 2026, including a Hebrew-language school in Henderson and a sports-focused school in North Las Vegas with plans to partner with the Vegas Golden Knights and Las Vegas Raiders.
This year’s application cycle is the first in which the cities of Henderson and North Las Vegas are considering approving and overseeing charter schools. Previously, cities and counties were not permitted to be charter school authorizers. That changed in 2023 through legislation sponsored by Gov. Joe Lombardo.
North Las Vegas City Council last week denied two charter school applications. Purpose Leadership Academy and Nevada Early College and Career Academy (NECCA) failed to meet multiple standards set in the city’s application rubric, according to city staff, giving the council little choice but to reject.
Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown and Councilman Isaac Barron, both career educators, emphasized before the unanimous votes to deny the applications that they are supportive of authorizing charter schools and providing more schooling options for residents.
Barron added that Clark County School District, where he worked for decades before retiring last year and whose board of trustees he serves on, has a track record of leaving North Las Vegas behind.
“Right now we have a decision in front of us,” he said. “If it’s just with our hearts, our hearts reach out to NECCA, they reach out to PLA, because we most definitely can identify with that. But we are also charged with being good financial stewards of our cities.”
Representatives for both proposed charter schools indicated they plan to work with city staff to address concerns. The schools have the option to resubmit their applications in the next few weeks for reconsideration in late August.
Both NECCA and Purpose Leadership last year applied to open charter schools under the Nevada State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) but were denied. This year, Purpose Leadership submitted its application to both North Las Vegas and the SPCSA.
 City of Henderson

The City of Henderson received four applications for the 2026-27 school year. The applications are currently under review by city staff and expected to be approved or denied in early August.
Kesher Academy is a proposed Hebrew-language charter school that uses the Hebrew language as “a means of fostering cultural connection, academic engagement, and global citizenship.” It is asking to open with 125 students in kindergarten through second grade, then scale up to 375 students, in kindergarten through seventh grade, over a six-year period.
According to its application, Kesher will be located at Congregation Ner Tamid, a Jewish synagogue in Henderson. The campus currently houses a private school and a preschool, both religiously affiliated. The campus is also listed as the physical location of a “full-time enrichment program for homeschool families,” which is not affiliated with any religious organization.
It is not uncommon for charter schools to operate out of churches, which often have space available and offer cheaper leases than commercial spaces.
Numerous Hebrew-language charter schools exist across the United States. While they have received some pushback because of Hebrew’s close ties to Jewish identity and tradition, they are not considered religious charter schools. Religious charter schools are considered unconstitutional, though there has been a push to change that.
Two of the applications are essentially for new campuses of existing charter schools authorized by the SPCSA. Founders Classical Academy currently operates a campus in Las Vegas and wants to open a campus in Henderson. Signature Preparatory currently operates a K-8 charter school in Henderson near Boulder Highway and Lake Mead Boulevard, and wants to open a K-12 campus in West Henderson.
The third applicant, Pioneer Technology & Arts Academy (PTAA) has twice applied with the SPCSA and been denied. The proposed school then sued the state. That case was dismissed. Last year, PTAA was approved by the SPCSA for a charter school license. That school, located in North Las Vegas, is expected to open in August for the upcoming academic year.
 SPCSA

The Nevada State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) is by far the largest authorizer of charter schools in the state. As of this year, the quasi-district enrolls more students than Washoe County School District.
SPCSA received seven applications from schools hoping to open for the 2026-27 academic year, according to materials posted to its website. Those applications are under review by staff and will ultimately be recommended for approval or denial by the state Charter School Board in late August.
Among the SPCSA applications is a proposal for Game Changer Sports Academy, to be located at Hylo Park, a mixed-used “sports and entertainment” district in North Las Vegas on the former site of the Fiesta Rancho and Texas Station casinos. According to its application, the charter school plans to integrate “academic excellence with athletic development” and will involve a partnership with the Vegas Golden Knights, who already operate an ice rink on the property, and the Al Davis-Eddie Robinson Leadership Academy, a partnership between the Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV designed to develop minority coaches and general managers.
While not a fully virtual or remote school, the proposed charter school plans on using an online curriculum complemented by in-person instruction and oversight. It will also operate an “athletic development program” involving strength and agility training 4 to 5 days a week. It hopes to open with 230 middle school students and expand over six years to grades 6-12 and 560 students.
Game Changer Sports Academy currently has a partnership with Delta Academy, an existing charter school authorized by the SPCSA.
The SPCSA is also considering an application for what would be the first charter school in Nye County.
Pahrump Valley Academy previously applied with the SPCSA but was denied. One representative for the proposed school told a town hall in April that the prior denial was “political”in nature and blamed then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat.
The other applicants listed by the SPCSA:

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia judge assigned to hear a mother’s vaccination lawsuit against the state school board has recused himself from the case, saying he wanted to avoid any conflict or impropriety.
Raleigh County Circuit Court Judge Todd Kirby previously served in the House of Delegates as a Republican, where he co-sponsored a bill loosening of the state’s strict school vaccination rules and another measure known as the “Equal Protection for Religion Act.”
The religious freedom bill, passed in 2023, is the basis for Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order mandating that the state permit families to use religious exemptions to school immunization rules. Morrisey announced on Tuesday his support for a Raleigh County mother who is suing the state school board for not accepting religious exemptions despite the governor’s executive order. The school board has said they won’t recognize religious exemptions to vaccine requirements this upcoming school year since West Virginia’s immunization law remains unchanged. 
On Wednesday, Kirby submitted a voluntary recall order, saying, “Avoiding even the appearance of a conflict or impropriety is essential to the maintenance of the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.”
He deemed himself disqualified to hear the case and directed the circuit clerk to randomly assign the case to a different judge within the circuit. 
The state Democratic Party had called on Kirby to recuse himself due to his support for the religious freedom bill and a piece of legislation in 2024 that would have eliminated childhood immunization requirements for private and parochial schools.
Kirby left the House of Delegates in 2024 to serve as a judge in the 10th Judicial Circuit. 
The vaccine issue has become a key political point for Morrisey so far in his first months as governor. He says the school board is stripping “religious liberty protections” from families. 
West Virginia had been one of only a handful of states that didn’t permit religious exemptions, and the governor issued his executive order permitting religious exemptions on his first full day in office.
In March, the GOP-led House of Delegates voted down a bill that would have codified executive order and changed state vaccine laws. In response, Morrisey said his executive order would stand and ordered the state health department to accept parent’s requests to bypass school immunization rules for religious reasons. More than 100 families have requested to use religious exemption for the upcoming school year, according to the state health department. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice have filed a writ of mandamus in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised students. That lawsuit seeks to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order.

Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, spoke about his potential gubernatorial run during a Westside Conservative Club meeting at the Machine Shed in Urbandale June 25, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)While Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, is still in the exploratory phase for his gubernatorial run, he spent much of his time at the Westside Conservative Club meeting Wednesday morning focused on a potential opponent in the race: Democrat Rob Sand.
Bousselot told the conservative group gathered at the Machine Shed in Urbandale that Sand, the state auditor and frontrunner to become the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial candidate was a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and “rich Des Moines liberal” who would hurt the state’s economy and pull back GOP policies passed by the Republican trifecta in recent years.
The Ankeny Republican pointed to Sand’s answer on a May interview on the WHO AM Simon Conway show, when he was asked if “biological boys or men should play women’s sports” answered simply, “no.” Bousselot said that when Republican state lawmakers had passed bills banning transgender girls from competing on women’s teams in Iowa schools and colleges and banning transgender students from using bathrooms and locker rooms conflicting with their assigned sex at birth, Sand said these measures were “hateful.”

Bousselot also said Sand has not served well as state auditor, saying that he “did nothing” in investigating and auditing the misallocation of $27.5 million in court debt funds caused by coding errors brought to the auditor’s office attention in 2022. He criticized Sand’s office for being late in delivering state audits in multiple years, as well as for his efforts to audit Iowa’s Education Savings Account (ESA) program providing taxpayer funds for private school tuition and associated costs while denying public school requests for auditing assistance.
“He has been running for governor since the day he was elected auditor, and not doing the job,” Bousselot said. “He just announced that he’s going to go on 100 town halls in the next four months — taxpayer-funded campaigning. Late on audits, refused to audit schools, ignored a whistleblower — if you don’t want to do the job, Rob, resign.”
Sand’s 100 town hall tour begins Wednesday with evening events in Waukee and Ankeny. Sand, the sole Democrat to currently hold statewide elected office in Iowa, has previously argued against criticisms of his office’s work by Republican lawmakers, including during a House Government Oversight Committee hearing when he said the court debt misallocation issue was a coding error, which is not a subject his office performs audits on.
He has also regularly pushed back against Bousselot and other GOP lawmakers for having passed legislation limiting the auditor’s office ability to access personal information in investigations and preventing the auditor from going to court for subpoena enforcement against state agencies, departments, boards, commissions and statewide elected officials.
Bousselot said Tuesday the focus on Sand is needed because Republicans need to be prepared for a tough gubernatorial race in 2026.
“It’s the first open seat for governor in a long, long time,” Bousselot said. “It’s going to be the toughest race for governor, arguably, in decades — maybe since Gov. Terry Branstad came back to take on an incumbent Chet Culver. We’ve got a opponent who’s a rich Des Moines liberal, $7 million already from his family … He wants to portray himself as one thing. But we know, who he really is, right. What he really stands for and the job he’s really done. (We) need to talk about it and not stop talking about it until Election Day.”
The race for Iowa governor next year has become a focus for many in the state following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek reelection after finishing her current term. As Sand and a handful of others are running for the Democratic nomination, the race to succeed Reynolds as the GOP gubernatorial candidate is also expected to draw many top candidates.
So far, former state Rep. Brad Sherman is the only Republican officially in the race, entering in February before Reynolds’ announcement. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and House Speaker Pat Grassley have expressed interest in running for the seat, though they have not made any official announcements, and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra launched what he called an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial campaign in May.
Bousselot also announced his “exploratory” committee in April, citing support from former Gov. Terry Branstad. Though he has not made an official campaign launch and has not made a filing committee for a gubernatorial run, Bousselot told Republicans at the WCC meeting he supports lowering property taxes, incentivizing Iowa’s manufacturing and agriculture sectors and continuing to advance conservative policies.
Many of these goals are being worked on by leadership at the Iowa Statehouse now, Bousselot said — but said that if Sand and Democrats gain power in the next election, these efforts will stall.
“Think about what we’ve accomplished with the trifecta right? Lower taxes, more freedom,” Bousselot said. “At the end of the day, that’s what we’ve done, lower taxes, more freedom. Our opponent has very different vision: higher taxes, bigger government, less safe, less free. So you want to see dysfunction, lose one set of the trifecta and it will be gridlocked. … That’s why I say it’s a generational election.”
Democrats have called for Iowans to reject Bousselot, saying he would continue policies advanced by Branstad and Reynolds that hurt the state’s economy.
“Iowans are expressing their unhappiness with Reynolds’ unpopular agenda, so they must reject Mike Bousselot — who has spent his life drafting legislation that has left our state 49th in the nation in economic growth and 48th in personal income growth,” Iowa Democratic Party spokesperson Paige Godden said in a statement following Bousselot’s exploratory committee launch. “Mike Bousselot is a career politician who has helped create some of Iowa’s most disastrous laws including Medicaid privatization that cost Iowans their healthcare plans and made life more difficult and more expensive.”
Bousselot says discussions on eminent domain, pipelines will continue
While Bousselot largely focused on issues uniting Republicans at the event, he also answered a question on an issue that has caused intra-party divides in the Iowa GOP — the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines. The Iowa Senate sent House File 639 to the governor this year, a bill dealing with multiple related issues that included a change to the the definition of a common carrier for hazardous liquid pipeline, new requirements for the Iowa Utilities Commission and increased insurance requirements.
Reynolds ultimately vetoed the legislation, saying it addressed real concerns but contained “vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.” Her decision came following the bill’s contentious path to the Senate floor, as many Senate GOP leaders also opposed the bill — including Bousselot.
Bousselot proposed an amendment to the legislation that was not approved during debate in the Senate which he said made improvements to the bill and provided more landowner protections against eminent domain in different projects, and that would have allowed companies to pursue voluntary easements outside of the approved project corridor to avoid using eminent domain.
He said his amendment, which was passed unanimously out of committee, was rejected in part because Democrats opposed the measure after he announced his exploratory committee for governor.
While he called the bill sent to Reynolds a “Trojan horse” that would allow environmental activists to interfere with building energy production infrastructure, Bousselot said he was committed to working on a solution to the issue.
“We have to solve this problem,” Bousselot said. “We have to put real protections in place for landowners that avoid eminent domain, that respect what we want to have eminent domain to be and not be used for, but also understand the importance of our agricultural economy and the importance of American infrastructure to the freedom and, frankly, the national security of our state and finding that balance. And I believe we can do that. I want to tackle hard problems in the legislature. I’ve never shied away from that. I didn’t shy away from this one, and I’m going to keep working.”

Butler, a Democrat, defeated Republican Ken Hilton by a vote of 964-774. Butler will now represent Strafford County District 12, which includes Somersworth and Rollinsford. Butler carried the vote in both communities. The district has reliably gone to Democrats in recent elections.
Prior to Tuesday’s election, Republicans had a 218-177 majority (there are two independents) in the 400-seat House, including resignations. Butler’s victory brings Democrats’ number back to 178, where it was before Evans, a Democrat, resigned. Two Republicans have also resigned this legislative session.
Butler is a transgender woman active in the Seacoast theater community. She told Foster’s Daily Democrat during the campaign that she plans to advocate strongly for the arts and that she “would like to see more people run who do not have divisive agendas, but who really love New Hampshire. I don’t look at this like national politics, because it isn’t. Our legislators are our neighbors, our friends.” During the campaign, she saw attacks from the Committee to Elect House Republicans, which is led by House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, including a website targeting her for her transgender identity and arguing she has radical views on LGBTQ issues.

Tuesday’s forum, held at the Macomb Intermediate School District in Clinton Township, was organized by the Protect MI Care Coalition, a statewide organization of healthcare providers, advocates, and community groups seeking to protect and expand Medicaid access across Michigan. It was held as Congress considers a bill backed by President Donald Trump that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid over the next decade.
In May, the coalition sent a letter to Michigan’s congressional delegation outlining how the proposed cuts would impact the lives and livelihoods of their constituents.
Deidra Wilson, senior vice president of government relations and public policy for McLaren Health Care, outlined the risks of simply dismantling Medicaid.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In the latter half of the 20th century, Medicaid emerged as a replacement for state-run institutions, psychiatric hospitals, and asylums. As those facilities were shuttered, Medicaid became the cornerstone of community-based support. As Wilson argued, dismantling that system would leave thousands of Americans isolated and unsupported. 
Many speakers elaborated on the misconceptions surrounding Medicaid– namely what it is, who benefits from it, and what those benefits entail. 
Director of Health and Community Services Andrew Cox pointed out that there’s a lot of confusion between Medicare and Medicaid. The forum and organizations like Protect MI Care Coalition seek to educate the public on the difference.
While Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 and older, Medicaid is slightly more expansive. The program is a joint effort between the state and federal governments, and helps cover healthcare costs for low-income families, seniors, children, and people with disabilities.
As Cox pointed out, most people don’t realize the total number of individuals who benefit from Medicaid. In Macomb County, one in four residents is covered by Medicaid. On the state level, 2.6 million Michigan residents are enrolled in Medicaid, including one-third of Michigan’s rural population.  
Wilson noted that rural communities would be drastically impacted by proposed cuts. McLaren Caro Region Hospital– located in Michigan’s Thumb region– serves nine Michigan counties. More babies are born in the rural Caro hospital than in the more densely populated Genesee County. 
Hospitals like Caro are already strained, and, as the letter to the congressional delegation explained, the proposed Medicaid rollbacks could potentially “overwhelm hospitals, increase uncompensated care costs for providers, and shift the financial burden to communities that can least afford it.”
“I don’t think they have a good understanding of who’s on Medicaid,” Wilson added, referring to proponents of Medicaid rollbacks. “It’s your grocery store clerk, it’s your neighbor, it’s your kids.”

Jennifer VanderMark’s twelve-year-old son is one of the over one million Michigan children who receive Medicaid. VanderMark voiced the universal worry of every parent of a child with a disability: “What is going to happen to them when I am no longer able or no longer alive to care for them? What happens when I’m gone?”
The answer, VanderMark told the forum, is Medicaid. 
“Medicaid will be the foundation upon which he can build a full and happy adult life, even if I’m no longer there to witness it,” she said. 
VanderMark said Medicaid will provide her son with necessary skill-building and supported employment while also ensuring that he’s cared for and comfortable.
She also highlighted the financial and physical struggles that come with caring for a child with disabilities. Some parents are forced to choose between their career and their child’s well-being. The loss of income when one parent is required to be a full-time caregiver can have catastrophic financial consequences. As a result, VanderMark said, retirements are cashed out, credit cards are maxed, and homes go into foreclosure. 
Kim Varga discussed how Medicaid covered her fifteen-year-old daughter’s cancer treatments. 
“She had the opportunity to remain on Medicaid, and it saved her life for a little bit,” Varga explained. “But without that, I would have been paying out of pocket.”
Varga herself is now celebrating over a decade of sobriety, a feat that would have been impossible without Medicaid. 
“I know what it’s like to have bills piled up, going to mental hospitals or regular hospitals with no insurance at all. I know what it’s like to have high-cost medicines. I know what it’s like to be without medicines… They have saved my life,” Varga said.
Megan Callaha, also a Macomb County resident, spoke with Michigan Advance about what the proposed cuts would mean for her mother’s dementia care.
Callahan explained that, while her parents did a lot of financial planning and preparation for retirement, those plans did not include dementia. In the wake of her mother’s diagnosis, Callahan and her family feared they’d have to resort to selling the house or going into debt. They never anticipated enrolling in Medicaid.
She said these services have provided stability and peace of mind for Callahan and her family, and she spoke highly of the memory care community where her mother lives. 
“Brain change could happen to anyone, and these programs have been so vital for my parents’ basic needs. It really helped my father feel assured that my mom can get the best care,” Callahan said
Callahan also noted the stigma surrounding Medicaid, saying her father initially struggled with accepting help for his wife’s care. Now, Callahan said, he’s come to recognize and appreciate that network of support.
“He still worries in different ways,” Callahan added, “At the end of the day, he’ll ask us, ‘Is Mom going to be okay?’ And we can tell him, ‘Yes, Dad — and you’re going to be okay, too.’”

Rokita’s office filed two lawsuits in 2022, accusing TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, of violating Indiana’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act with its age rating for those 12 and older — claiming that it contained more sexual content, profanity and drug references than advertised.
That made TikTok unsafe for children, he continued. Additionally, he claimed in a separate lawsuit that the company failed to protect user data from the Chinese Communist Party.
An Allen County trial judge initially dismissed the cases before the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed and said the state had jurisdiction to bring the action.
TikTok appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court to dismiss the case, but the justices declined the case by a vote of 3-2. That leaves in place the appellate decision allowing the matter to move forward.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush and Justices Mark Massa and Derek Molter voted to deny, while Justices Christopher Goff and Geoffrey Slaughter would have allowed the appeal.
Attorney Brian Paul, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that the Indiana Supreme Court wasn’t the appropriate venue for the case, which is the first issue before the justices.
“Indiana is seeking to punish TikTok for statements that were not made in Indiana, that are not about Indiana, that were not targeted at Indiana and were not tailored to Indiana,” Paul said in his opening remarks.
The state previously argued that justices could intervene because Hoosiers enter into user contracts with TikTok when they download the app.
“TikTok seeks to escape the rules that apply to everyone else, from print magazines to burger franchises,” said Solicitor General James Barta, arguing on behalf of the state.
Barta said that these “daily exchange(s) of data” are used by the plaintiffs to craft “addictive content” based on user locations to earn millions.

Health care costs can quickly add up as a result of a routine check-up or something more serious, like a trip to the emergency room. However, healthcare information shared seamlessly between care team members can help slow costs individually and across Vermont. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  The surprising way you can help slow the growth of health care[...]","Health care costs can quickly add up as a result of a routine check-up or something more serious, like a trip to the emergency room. But what if we told you that there is a way to help control costs individually and across Vermont, just by having your health information shared seamlessly between the members of your care team?
98.9% of Vermonters share health data with their providers through VITL, the state’s independent nonprofit health data network. VITL gives doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, care coordinators, and other qualified health care providers a centralized place to access a more complete, up-to-date patient record, including information from most of the places Vermonters receive care all across the state. This supports your provider in delivering informed, safe, and cost-effective care when and where you need it.
Slowing the growth of health care costs while continuing to provide great care for patients is a shared goal across Vermont, and health data exchange plays a key role in achieving it. How exactly will this sharing help slow the growth in health care costs in the state, and what does health information sharing mean? Let’s take a deeper look.
What is health information sharing?
Health information sharing means that your personal health record, which includes things like medications, allergies, immunizations, test results, diagnoses, and provider notes, is securely shared among the health care professionals who treat you.
Hospitals and providers’ offices keep records of the care they give you; VITL brings these records together. This way, your care team can get a full picture of your health, no matter where in Vermont you’ve received or will receive care. And you don’t have to worry about remembering every past immunization or test result; your record travels with you.
How does health information sharing reduce costs?
When your providers can access a more complete picture of your health, they can avoid unnecessary and costly steps, like ordering duplicate lab tests, prescribing medication that won’t interact well with others you’re taking, or repeating X-rays you’ve already had at another clinic.
For example, if you visit the emergency room, having instant access to your recent lab work and imaging reports means the ER staff won’t need to run those tests again. That can lead to better outcomes for patients and slower growth in health care costs across the state over time.
When essential health data is right at hand, right away, providers and health care staff spend less time making and responding to records requests, freeing up time for care and saving administrative costs. 
Studies conducted across the United States have demonstrated the impact of health data sharing, ranging from reduced hospital readmissions and associated cost savings, to overall reductions in health care spending. In short, health information sharing helps cut down on waste and improve care, benefiting you as well as Vermont’s health care system. 
Is sharing health information safe?
Privacy and security are a priority for VITL and built into every step of the health data exchange process. Only authorized providers and staff of participating health care provider organizations can access your information — and only for specific, approved purposes. Records are also available to public health professionals for their work to keep Vermonters healthy and well. And care managers and other staff at public and private health insurance providers can use VITL data for limited purposes that support timely, high-quality, cost-effective care. Everyone using VITL is required to follow strict state and federal privacy laws, including HIPAA, and access is tracked and monitored.
Health care should be affordable for everyone. There is no single solution to slowing the growth of health care costs, but we know that safe, efficient health data sharing is one of the many tools needed to build a more sustainable health care system.
Learn more about your options, including the ability to opt out of your record being viewed, at vitl.net/sharing. The VITL team is available to talk with you and answer questions about health information sharing. VITL’s toll-free number is 1-888-980-1243.  If you have opted out in the past and have changed your mind, you can also contact VITL to opt back in.

LA-UR-12-21150Raised in Taos, Mariah Blake is a Washington, D.C.-based investigative reporter and the author of an important new book called “They Poisoned the World: Life and Death in the Age of Forever Chemicals.” Her project is the culmination of eight years of research and reporting on forever chemicals, or PFAS — a large class of toxic man-made substances that have been used in a host of consumer products, and that are now in the bloodstream of virtually every living being.

Much of the book focuses on the village of Hoosick Falls, New York, and residents’ decade-long struggle for clean drinking water. But it also exposes the secret history of forever chemicals, some of which is deeply relevant to New Mexico. As Blake explains, PFAS were developed during the Manhattan Project, and serious contamination has occurred at a number of locations in the state, most notably Holloman Air Force Base, ten miles west of Alamogordo. According to researchers at the University of New Mexico, who have been studying the area around Holloman for the past couple of years, wildlife near the base is contaminated with higher levels of PFAS than have been recorded anywhere else in the world.
The source of the contamination is a firefighting foam that has been used since the 1970s at military sites around the world, including Holloman, Cannon Air Force Base, Kirtland Air Force Base, the White Sands Missile Range and Fort Wingate. Scientists say they don’t know where the contamination zone around Holloman ends, and that the PFAS are likely traveling: through the soil, air and water, and also in the bodies of migratory birds, which hunters around the country shoot and eat. The New Mexico Department of Health is advising anyone who consumed birds from the area between 2010 and 2024 to seek medical guidance.
PFAS — or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, as they are formally known — take hundreds or thousands of years to break down in nature. Studies have linked even low levels of PFAS exposure with fertility issues, various cancers, developmental delays, hormone disruption and reduced immune system function. Blake’s book makes clear just how ubiquitous PFAS are in our lives and how dangerous they are, how difficult the remediation will be and how hard ordinary citizens are fighting to repair the damage.



				Mariah Blake will be in conversation with Global Santa Fe Program Chair Jim Falk at 6 p.m. Thursday, June 26 at Collected Works Bookstore in Santa Fe and online via Zoom.

Searchlight: Where did PFAS come from?
Mariah Blake: The U.S. government developed this class of chemicals as part of the Manhattan Project. Most people know the project’s main goal: designing and building the first atomic bomb, with top physicists and engineers working at secret locations around the country, foremost among them, Los Alamos.

But there was another aspect of the program that never registered in history books. It involved some of the leading chemists from all over the country, working with the chemical giant DuPont to develop PFAS, which were then known as fluorocarbons. They were needed for uranium enrichment. They ended up being absolutely essential to the bomb project.
Pretty quickly, chemists were able to develop a variety of methods to manufacture these chemicals on a commercial scale. But it was clear from very early on that they were dangerous. At the plants where they were manufactured, in southwest New Jersey, fires and explosions were common. Workers were constantly being hospitalized with breathing problems or chemical burns. Farmers downwind of the plants started to complain that their peach crops were burning up, that their cows were so crippled they couldn’t stand, that they had to graze by crawling on their bellies. Farm workers who ate the produce they picked fell ill, too.
The farmers’ complaints really alarmed Manhattan Project officials, because they feared that the farmers would sue, and that these lawsuits would compromise the secrecy of the project and open the government up to liability.
At the time, there was already a secret medical research program that looked at Manhattan Project special materials — one study involved injecting unknowing cancer patients with plutonium. As part of that program, the U.S. government started intensely studying the health effects of PFAS. By 1947, they discovered that these substances were highly toxic and that they were accumulating in human blood.
One of the things that makes these chemicals so troubling is that they stay in the human body for many years. This was information that the U.S. government knew before PFAS even went into commercial production.

Searchlight: What happened with PFAS after the war?
Blake: Post-war, the Minnesota-based company 3M acquired patents for technology to produce PFAS, and they hired a team of Manhattan Project chemists to turn them into products that could either be used in manufacturing or sold to the general public. This led to all kinds of innovations, including Scotchgard fabric protector, Gore-Tex and Teflon. These chemicals quickly found their way into thousands of household items, everything from dental floss and kitty litter to contact lenses, children’s clothing, cleaning supplies and beauty products.
In the 1960s, the Navy worked with 3M to develop a specialized firefighting foam. The existing fire retardants just weren’t that effective on fires caused by fuel. The fluorinated foam they developed, which was made with PFAS, was extremely effective. As a result, by the 1970s, the foam was being used at military bases, airports and firehouses all over the world.
Firefighters and service members who handled this material were told that it was safe as soap. Fire houses would throw parties for the community, and they would spray the children with foam. It was used routinely in training and sprayed in areas where there are private wells or public drinking-water wells. It wasn’t only sprayed. It was dumped and spilled in huge quantities. It was discharged into sewer systems. Then the sludge from those systems was spread over millions of acres of agricultural land. The foam was dumped without much thought, because people were told there really was no reason for concern. But as early as 1973, Navy scientists had determined that it was toxic.
This points to an interesting part of New Mexico history: during the 1970s, a team of researchers at Kirtland Air Force Base, in Albuquerque, began testing different methods to filter PFAS out of foam before it was dumped or discharged into sewage systems. They found one that worked. It’s the same technology that’s used to filter PFAS out of drinking water today. But it was never deployed by the U.S. military to prevent pollution around its bases.
Searchlight: How did medical research on PFAS evolve alongside the commercialization of them?
Blake: After the war, Manhattan Project medical research continued under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission. In the 1970s, a scientist working in that program discovered that PFAS were accumulating in the blood of people all across the country. He alerted 3M. 3M then began conducting its own blood studies, looking at thousands of blood samples from around the world, including remote, rural parts of China. It also looked at archived blood samples from past medical studies. The only blood 3M could find that didn’t contain these chemicals was in archived samples from Korean war veterans that was collected before the 1950s, the decade when PFAS went into wide-scale production. This information caused some alarm inside 3M, and the company began intensively studying these chemicals. They quickly discovered that they didn’t break down in the environment, that they had a devastating effect on lab animals and that they were linked to serious diseases in workers. But rather than inform the public or regulators, they buried their findings. This is a pattern that played out over and over and over again for many years.
The Navy did its own research, compiling more data about the toxicity of these substances, but it didn’t disclose this information, either.
Searchlight: What implications does the pollution caused by firefighting foam have for human health and the environment?

Blake: Fluorinated firefighting foam is one of the leading sources of PFAS contamination, not just in the U.S. but worldwide. Some of the most severe pollution is around military bases, where this material was routinely used for training. Groundwater around many bases contains levels of PFAS that are thousands, even millions of times higher than the EPA safety limit. This level of pollution is seen almost nowhere else.
A kangaroo rat that was captured at Holloman Lake, which adjoins the Air Force Base, showed PFAS levels that were 30 million times the EPA safety standard. That blows away every other number I’ve seen in my decade of reporting on PFAS. It’s worth noting that, at Holloman, scientists are only testing for 17 of the 9,000 PFAS in circulation in the U.S. Other studies have shown that there are several hundred different PFAS in groundwater and drinking water near military bases. The study of these chemicals near Holloman probably underestimated the level of contamination by a large margin.
Because PFAS don’t break down in the environment, and they’re highly mobile, sites like this are more akin to Fukushima, the site of major nuclear meltdown, than a regular toxic waste site. They radiate contamination. PFAS move through the environment quickly: through the air, through water in the underground aquifers. Animal species are absorbing enormous quantities, and that moves up the food chain.

Searchlight: What tools do we have to clean up heavily contaminated sites like Holloman?
Blake: They are really limited. There are technologies that can filter some of these chemicals out of drinking water, but not all, and what you end up with is a concentrated stew of PFAS that you then either put in a landfill — but all landfills eventually leak — or incinerate. However, if these chemicals aren’t incinerated at a high enough heat, they just break down into smaller PFAS and spread all over. There are only three incinerators in the entire country that are capable of destroying PFAS.
Scientists are now using Holloman as a laboratory to study how PFAS from firefighting foam moves through the environment. That is probably the best possible use of that land, because it will be contaminated for generations.
Searchlight: What is the Pentagon’s stance on remediating PFAS contamination around military bases?
Blake: The expense of cleaning up these sites — if it’s even possible — is going to be mammoth. The Pentagon has fought in various ways to avoid having to do it.
It’s fought to kill PFAS regulation on the federal level. It has also refused to comply with all kinds of state regulations, as well as EPA mandates, on PFAS. PFAS contamination first really registered on the radar in New Mexico around 2018 when a dairy farmer named Art Schaap, whose farm is right next to Cannon Air Force Base, discovered that the water on his farm was highly contaminated. He ended up having to slaughter 3,500 head of cattle. His operation, Highland Dairy, supplied milk for the public schools in Albuquerque. Schaap was very vocal, and state officials responded by setting cleanup standards around Cannon. The Pentagon actually sued New Mexico for trying to enforce cleanup standards, claiming that it didn’t have the authority.
The Pentagon eventually backed down. But now the Department of Defense has asked a federal judge to dismiss dozens of lawsuits that have been brought against it, for its role in contaminating drinking water and soil around military bases. One was brought by the state of New Mexico. These are just a few examples of various ways that DOD has tried to evade responsibility for the contamination around its sites.
Searchlight: What lessons can people in New Mexico learn from the people in Hoosick Falls, New York, and their successful fight for clean drinking water?
Blake: I focused at length on Hoosick Falls, where the water is polluted with PFAS from a local Teflon coating factory. But I could just as easily have focused on any number of communities around the country, because variations of the same story are playing out all over. People in Georgia, in Maine, in Arizona, in Alaska — people from all over the country whose lives have been devastated by PFAS — are channeling their anguish into advocacy. They’re accomplishing things that I wouldn’t have considered possible when I started researching my book.
I mentioned earlier that it was largely a dairy farmer named Art Schaap who put PFAS on the radar in New Mexico. He has also advocated for change on a national level. He was part of a contingent of unlikely activists from all over the country who traveled to Washington, D.C., in 2019 to lobby lawmakers to pass a host of bills related to PFAS. As a result of citizen pressure, that year Congress passed a law requiring that fluorinated firefighting foams be phased out on U.S. military bases. In addition, 30 states have passed more than 155 bills, including 16 full or partial bans on the entire class of chemicals in consumer goods. Thirty-three states have passed or are weighing bans on all PFAS in firefighting foam. This is a paradigm shift. This is not how we usually regulate chemicals in this country: normally, we regulate them one by one.

There’s also a huge amount of litigation happening. Currently, more than 15,000 lawsuits are pending against manufacturers, and there are a growing number of lawsuits against consumer brands. This is all causing major shifts in the market as large swaths of the economy voluntarily migrate away from forever chemicals. 3M, the world’s largest manufacturer of PFAS, has announced that it will quit producing them this year.
By the way, I was there in 2019 when Schaap went to Washington. The people I followed from Hoosick Falls were also there. There was a farmer from Maine. There were factory workers. It was amazing to see how lawmakers responded to people telling their stories. It goes beyond politics and partisan divides, hearing the stories of people whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by these chemicals.
Searchlight: How did your history in New Mexico shape the way you approached your book?
Blake: I grew up in Taos. Both sides of my family have been there since the 1950s. My grandfather on my father’s side, Ernie Blake, moved there to build Taos Ski Valley. What most people don’t realize is that he was a German Jew who fled Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. That was not something he spoke about publicly. But he was obsessed with history, particularly military history, and I think some of that obsession rubbed off on me, which is why I felt compelled to delve so deeply into some historical aspects of the forever chemical saga, including the Manhattan Project story.

Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska auditor on Wednesday flagged “widespread misuse” of state-owned vehicles — including allegations of an employee taking multiple trips to his family’s vineyard and winery and another in which a worker used a state car to “gallivant” around Lincoln for his side business.
In a 38-page report, the State Auditor’s Office focused on 2024 and on a slice of the vehicles handled by the Department of Administrative Services’ Transportation Services Bureau, which controls about 1,200 of the state’s 4,000 vehicles. The TSB leases vehicles to state agency personnel for official government use on an as-needed basis, racking up about 15 million miles a year.
  State Auditor Mike Foley. (Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)
A test sample of 45 fleet vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking devices revealed, according to the report, that nearly a third, 14 vehicles, were allegedly used for personal purposes such as trips to retail outlets, restaurants, medical facilities, residences of relatives, commuting home without permission and other private errands that the auditor team determined had nothing to do with official duties.
State Auditor Mike Foley pointed out that Nebraska law prohibits a state officer or employee from using a state-owned vehicle for personal use. He said violators face a potential criminal misdemeanor charge and removal from office or employment.
“Joy-riding in state-owned vehicles — on the taxpayer’s dime, no less — is obviously a common occurrence and, despite my office’s previous reporting on it, appears to be continuing unabated,” Foley said in a statement. “Installing GPS trackers in the state’s cars is a very good idea, but those devices are practically worthless if agencies fail to review the resulting data.”
 Menards rebates

Foley spotlighted, for example, a Nebraska Department of Natural Resources worker from Scottsbluff who allegedly took multiple trips in a state vehicle to his family’s vineyard and who also allegedly redeemed Menards work purchase rebates for his own use.
The review noted that two different employees appeared to have used rebates on state purchases for personal gain.
“Personal use of a state-owned vehicle sometimes coincides with other improper activities,” Foley said, noting that such rebates belong to the government agency purchasing the items and are “tantamount to theft.” 
Foley alleged that an investigator with the Department of Correctional Services used an assigned state vehicle to make trips for his side business to a Scheels store and to see a customer. 











Joy-riding in state-owned vehicles — on the taxpayer’s dime, no less — is obviously a common occurrence and, despite my office’s previous reporting on it, appears to be continuing unabated,. 


– Mike Foley, Nebraska State Auditor of Public Accounts



He said investigating misuse of state cars was, at times, like “peeling an onion — stripping back that underlying criminal offense can expose even more wrongdoing, such as using a TSB fleet vehicle to further a private business venture.”
In another instance, the audit team claimed that a medical services specialist with the Department of Health and Human Services drove a state-owned car more than 1,000 miles for personal use, including to his home, wife’s workplace and restaurants.
Foley said he found particularly disturbing the”ongoing nature” of a problem he said his team has reported on before. A year ago, Foley’s office issued findings of alleged misuse of state vehicles assigned to the Board of Parole. 
Also in an audit last year, Foley’s office reviewed vehicle use by the Nebraska Department of Transportation, uncovering what he said were “implausible” trips and thousands of revisions on travel reports.
On Wednesday, he urged “aggressive action” including analyzing GPS data on a regular basis, and noted that his latest report had examined only a “fraction” of state cars. 
“Extrapolate those findings to the entire population of state-owned vehicles and there can be no doubt that these continuous improprieties are costing taxpayers an obscene amount of money, not to mention constituting a particularly brazen flouting of the law,” Foley said.
The auditor report included responses from some state employees to accusations. One worker said stops to a Hy-Vee, Dollar General and Walmart were taken during her break while working. The auditor noted that each instance was more than 15 minutes, one more than an hour.
About stopping at restaurants on the way home from work, the auditor said employees should have returned home with the state vehicle and then used a personal vehicle to go to the restaurant.
 Some agencies push back

The State Department of Education noted that the additional mileage in a case involving its staff was four miles that resulted in an additional cost of $1.40. The Education Department said using a state vehicle compared to the employee’s personal vehicle saved the state roughly $165 in mileage expenses for the trip. To that, the auditor said the potential cost of the action is “not a valid justification” for violating a law.

Foley said DAS, the overseer of state-owned vehicles, “promised to double-down on its oversight.”
Several individual agencies, regarding situations flagged with its employees, said in the report they were offering additional training and education, refining procedures and taking other action based on the auditor’s recommendations.
The Department of Natural Resources said, for example, it would discipline identified team members and seek reimbursement for store rebates. 
Other departments pushed back on certain findings. 
The Department of Revenue, for example, said that while it emphasizes taking meal breaks toward the middle of the workday, it wanted to avoid scenarios where inspectors “are entirely deprived of a meal period because work commitments have made a late lunch the only reasonable alternative.”
While the State Fire Marshal said it would continue internal monitoring of timesheets and vehicle data to determine if policy changes are needed, it noted that managers were unable to substantiate the auditor’s finding of using a vehicle for personal purposes.
Among highlights of the auditor’s report:

On travel logs, the report alleged that 13 of the 45 vehicles tested were incomplete, missing information such as days traveled, destination, signatures and proof the trip was for state business.


On vehicles assigned for a 24-hour period, six of 16 cases examined showed the employees did not have written approval from TSB and that they drove the state vehicle home.

They need to act soon to prioritize our nation’s financial stability and reassure global markets that we take this responsibility seriously.”Both the House and Senate are scheduled to be in recess Aug. 4 through Sept. 2.Global crisis loomsIf Congress does not act, the U.S. would default on its debt for the first time, likely leading to a global financial crisis.As of June 18, the federal treasury had $384 billion in cash on hand and could save another $89 billion through “extraordinary measures,” the term for accounting tricks the government can use to save cash in an emergency.The exact date will depend on how much the government spends in July and August — months that typically see large deficits, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.If the government can avoid the debt limit until quarterly taxes are due on Sept. 15, those receipts would likely give more breathing room until early October, the center said.Other factors that could influence the X-date include fluctuating tariff revenue and the potential for costly hurricanes this summer.Big beautiful debt limit increaseThe reconciliation package Republicans in Congress are racing to send to President Donald Trump’s desk by July Fourth includes a raise in the debt limit. The version that passed the House would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, while the Senate version would increase it by $5 trillion.Republican senators are scrambling this week to revamp several pieces of the legislative package as the chamber’s parliamentarian rules that some do not meet the strict rules for what can be considered under the fast-track procedure known as budget reconciliation.The process allows the Senate to pass the bill with a simple majority, meaning Republicans could pass it without Democratic votes. But Republicans are still haggling among themselves over provisions to aid rural hospitals amid changes to Medicaid, sell off public lands and others.Once passed in the Senate, either the House would have to approve that version or both chambers would have to vote on some kind of compromise language before Trump could sign the bill.",,,,2025-06-25 14:08:28.938232

Natalie Murdock joined advocates from the group Protect Our Care North Carolina on Wednesday to discuss the impacts on rural health care that they say will result from the massive Republican budget reconciliation bill pending in Congress — aka the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Speakers, highlighting what bill opponents have termed “Save Our Hospitals Week,” condemned congressional Republicans for slashing funding for health care in favor of tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations.
The spending bill would cut more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, according to Congressional Budget Office.
The spending cuts would leave 16 million Americans without health coverage, force rural hospitals to close, and raise premiums for more than 24 million Americans. A release from Protect Our Care said the cuts would put 338 rural hospitals, including five in North Carolina, at risk of closure

Davis, a Democrat representing North Carolina’s first congressional district since 2023, described how he was born and raised in downtown Snow Hill.
Over the years, he’s seen the evolution of healthcare near his town of about 2,000 people. When he got elected to the North Carolina Senate, he wanted to make a difference.
“I realized I had to work in health care space… I put health care up there, education, agriculture,” Davis.
He went in thinking his work on the Senate Health Care Committee would be easy, that everybody would agree. Instead, it was “one of the most contentious committees” on which he’s ever worked.
Davis mentioned fighting to expand Medicaid and keep the East Carolina high risk pregnancy center open.
“There’s the greatest health care disparities, we tend to see all of this in eastern North Carolina,” he said.

Murdock, a Democrat, represents Durham and Chatham counties in the state Senate. The former has an urban city center while the latter is more rural.
In some of the more rural areas of her district, she said, people need to drive an hour or more to reach a hospital.
“When you’re talking about being in the midst of snow and ice storms and all the weather issues they have, when we already do not have a lot of health care providers in western North Carolina, you can have entire counties where you may have a pediatrician and a family medicine doctor, and that’s about it,” Murdock said.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)The 19-year-old counter-protester arrested at Nashville’s No Kings Rally on June 14 was flagged two months earlier by a federal terrorism task force after posting an image on social media of a shotgun inscribed with “names of mass shooters and Neo-Nazi symbology,” according to Murfreesboro police.
Elijah Millar, of Murfreesboro, was arrested by Nashville police at the rally and charged with disorderly conduct after witnesses reported he brandished a handgun. Police seized a pistol from Millar at the scene.
Murfreesboro police arrested Millar three days later and charged him with three counts of unlawful possession of a weapon, a misdemeanor. Millar also faces a federal charge for unlawful possession of a firearm.
Millar, who has been treated for mental health conditions for several years, has been under conservatorship since 2023 after Rutherford County Chancery Court judges found him to be a “disabled person needing care” and “at risk of substantial harm to his health, safety and welfare.” The conservatorship restricts his access to firearms, according to court documents.

A detective with the Murfreesboro Police Department received a tip from the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force on April 3, reporting that Millar made a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, of the inscribed shotgun along with a small revolver, according to court documents obtained by Tennessee Lookout.
When police visited Millar’s home, Millar’s mother — his conservator — voluntarily gave police both firearms, telling them that “he purchased the firearms from a gun show without her consent,” the affidavit states.
Millar’s conservatorship requires him to be accompanied by his mother or step-father to purchase weapons and he cannot purchase or store weapons of any kind without his mother’s consent, according to federal court documents.
Millar’s federal public defender could not be immediately reached. Attempts to contact Millar’s mother were unsuccessful.
On June 16, two days after Millar was arrested at the Nashville protest, police received a call alleging that Millar made suicidal statements. Police met Millar outside his home and confiscated a loaded handgun from his waistband and a loaded magazine from his pocket. When police contacted Millar’s mother via phone, she told them she “was unaware of Mr. Millar having the Walther handgun, again violating the conservatorship.”
Millar was taken to the hospital for mental health treatment and police arrested him when he was released on June 17 for possessing the three weapons in violation of his conservatorship.
Federal prosecutors argued for Millar’s detention in a June 22 filing, citing “social media posts and online activity (that) have raised concerns amongst law enforcement that the Defendant has a desire to commit an act of mass violence.”
Miller is set to remain in custody at Rutherford County Adult Detention Center. If he is released from state custody, he will be transferred to federal custody, where he will remain until his federal trial, according to a federal court order.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s political leaders are known for boasting that they have the best state in the nation. Some studies have even awarded it with that title. U.S. News & World Report has awarded it best in the nation three years in a row (2023, 2024, and 2025). WalletHub awarded it 4th happiest and overall 4th best state in 2024.
One ranking authority took the novel approach of listing what each state is the worst at among all 50 states, in an apparent attempt to show states are not always what they are cracked up to be. Utah was found to be the “nerdiest” state in the union, in part because of the heavy participation of its residents in “gaming.” While other states got hit hard with real deficiencies, the researchers seem not to have been able to find too much wrong with Utah.
However, in reality Utah seems to be challenging a number of the named worst performing states with clear indications of its own very poor performance. For example, New Jersey is dinged for raking in excessive amounts of money by giving out the most speeding tickets. However, a Utah TV station recently featured a story about Utah’s own notorious problem of “super speeders.”
Oregon has the prize for highest rate of prescription pain killer abuse, but Utah has long been at or near the bottom in this indicator of despair and unhappiness as well. Utah had the 7th highest drug overdose rate in the U.S. between 2013 and 2015. Prescription overdose deaths in Utah have increased 400% since 2000. Fentanyl deaths per year increased from 23 in 2014 to 290 in 2023, an 1160% increase.
North Carolina is named the worse state for education. However, Utah has long had near the lowest or the lowest per-pupil spending in public schools. Also, Salt Lake City’s own University of Utah was recently ranked second from the bottom among hundreds of universities in “political awareness” of its student body, surely an indicator of the poor quality of civics education in the state.
Utah has long been relatively bereft of direct air travel routes to international destinations east and west. Recently, Salt Lake City opened up its first direct-to-Asia link in over 15 years, to Inchon, South Korea. Aside from increasing passenger travel, Mayor Mendenhall says this will also facilitate cargo transport bringing familiar electronic products to Utah and also open up new trade opportunities. However, the mayor did not mention the obvious huge negative factor in the equation stemming from our current tariff battles with Asian countries.
Utah has other negative distinctions that the “worst state” study was not able to focus on. For example, Utah recently had the second highest short-term consumer loan rates in the nation, thus breaking with the Biblical Christian tradition of not exploiting the “widow,” the “fatherless,” and the “poor.”
Utah also has a severe problem with teen suicide. Some 25 teens a day attempt suicide in Utah, according to The Hope Hero Foundation, which reports suicide rates have risen over 71% over the past decade for youth ages 10-24.
While Utah is often cited for lower-than-average crime rates, Utah has long been a hub for featuring outrageous murderers, boasting a long-string of famous killers like Mark Hoffman, Ronnie Lee Gardner, Gary Gilmore, Barton Kay Kirkham, and the notorious serial murderer Ted Bundy. In addition, college students at the state’s main public university, University of Utah, have proved to be all-too-easy marks for preventable murders, as was the case with Lauren McCluskey.
Utah also seems to have sidelined its long-time civic spiritual pride in favor of Tower of Babel-style materialism and sports entertainment above all other priorities. It first added major league basketball, then major league hockey, and soon a major league baseball team to its long-term major-league snow skiing capacity. Utah also has downtown building plans aplenty, including luxury housing, office space for medium-size corporations, a major new hospital, a sports entertainment complex, a university extension facility, and a global religious headquarters with seismic upgrades. Utah also has plans for a plethora of nuclear energy facilities, an interconnected urban trails system, and an expensive plan for ferrying skiers up the canyon.
Utah is also known for its monopoly political party which regularly participates in illegal gerrymandering efforts and easily discoverable efforts to skew voter sentiment, such as failing to adhere to proper voter notification requirements for a constitutional amendment.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012624_Senate_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 13:13:03.549915

After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.

After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.

Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”

New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

The helicopter was flying low above a remote snow-covered mountain ridge outside Hinton, Alberta, Canada, when pilot Clay Wilson jumped the wolves and gave chase.

Carter Niemeyer picked the tranquilizer gun off his lap and sighted through the opening where the helicopter’s passenger side door had been removed especially for the mission.
Less than 50 feet below, a 9-month-old wolf pup broke into a run, bounding through the December snowpack.
His coat was the color of coal.

This is the first installment of Howl, a five-part written series and podcast season produced in partnership between the Idaho Capital Sun, States Newsroom and Boise State Public Radio.

Even though the pup wasn’t yet a year old, he weighed 83 pounds and had developed a thick coat that would help him endure his first winter in the mountains.
The chopper made a pass at the wolf and doubled back, but Niemeyer wasn’t close enough to fire a dart loaded with tranquilizer drugs.
After essentially killing off all wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains by the 1930s, the United States government sent Niemeyer and a small team to Canada just over 30 years ago to sedate, catch, study and reintroduce wolves to the American West, where wolves were a native species.



Wilson and Niemeyer had never flown together before this flight took off in December 1994.
Niemeyer was an experienced government trapper and wildlife biologist with a United States government agency called Animal Damage Control (which later changed its name to USDA Wildlife Services), but he had never been to Hinton and didn’t know his way around Alberta’s Northern Rockies.
To make matters worse, the local tranquilizer gunners the government hired for the mission hadn’t shown up yet.
Niemeyer was supposed to be on the ground, carrying wolves out of the snow to a safe spot to land the helicopter after the wolves were darted from the air.
“I was mostly mugging,” Niemeyer said. “The mugger is the guy who you dump out in snow 20 feet deep. And you roll and crawl and drag yourself through this ungodly deep snow, sometimes where just the little tops of the pine trees were sticking out, because the wolves get darted in there and you can’t land (a helicopter). It’s too dangerous, between snags and deep snow that could collapse. So the mugger, you’ve got to get that wolf out of that deep snow situation, down the slope and try and drag them to river ice, somewhere where you’ve got a footing, where the helicopter can land securely.”
An average adult male wolf weighs about 100 pounds.
The largest wolf caught for wolf reintroduction in 1995 and 1996 weighed 135 pounds, Niemeyer said.
“And, yeah, talk about a workout,” Niemeyer said. “Sometimes it was something else.”
 Capturing wolves in Canada to release them into Yellowstone, Frank Church wilderness

The reason Niemeyer was in Hinton is because the U.S. government decided to bring back wolves after a decades-long extermination campaign.
The controversial plan called for Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to capture gray wolves from Canada and release them in Yellowstone National Park and the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho.
And the only way to do so was by hand.
But when Niemeyer showed up to Canada searching for wolves to bring back to the Lower 48, he found the local trappers who were supposed to be capturing live wolves for collaring and medical exams had grown distrustful of the American government.
Instead of caring for live wolves, the local trappers were killing them.
“The guys were killing them, skinning them and putting them on stretching boards and then I got up there and met them, and we had a confrontation, me and them, and they told me (to) take my truck and get the hell out of town,” Niemeyer said.
An already tense situation in Canada came to a head when a local trapper hauled in two dead wolves and threw them at Niemeyer’s feet.
Standing 6 feet, 6 inches tall and fond of wearing a mustache and a fur trappers hat, Niemeyer wasn’t one to back down from a challenge.
Since he was a boy following in his father’s footsteps, Niemeyer had trapped, skinned or taxidermied just about every predator and varmint in the West.
It started with pocket gophers – 10 cents a head.
That night he ended up squaring off with a local trapper in a drunken wolf skinning competition inside the man’s cabin.
It had been about 60 years since the wolves’ howl fell silent across the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
If wolves were going to make a comeback, things were off to a bad start.
 Wolves driven out of the Rocky Mountains

Wolves are a keystone species of apex predators that ranged from the Arctic, down through the Rocky Mountains and plains of the United States and into Mexico for thousands of years.
There used to be tens of thousands of wolves in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.

But thanks to government bounties meant to encourage westward expansion, settlers used trapping and widespread poisoning to kill off virtually every wolf in the American West by the 1930s.
Between 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in Yellowstone, including two wolf pups killed in 1926 near a geologic feature named Soda Butte.
Yellowstone National Park reports that the last wolf pack in the park was killed in 1926.
It wasn’t hunters or poachers who killed off the last Yellowstone wolves.
It was park rangers.
Congress had put up $125,000 to remove wolves and other predators from public lands, and it worked.
The Idaho Department of Fish and Game says the last wolf in Idaho was believed to have been killed in the 1930s.
Wolves survived in Alaska, Canada and Minnesota but they were functionally extinct in the Western U.S.
Then things began to change for wolves in 1974, slowly at first.
Four subspecies of gray wolves, including the gray wolf of the Northern Rocky Mountains, were listed under the Endangered Species Act, which had just been signed into law the year before by President Richard Nixon.
Dozens of conservation groups, nonprofit organizations, biologists, veterinarians and members of the public pushed to save and restore wolves.
Meanwhile ranchers, hunters, politicians across Idaho, Montana and Wyoming and countless residents of small rural communities pushed just as hard in the opposite direction.
By 1980, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery plan recommended reintroducing wolves to Central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.
As the federal government set wolf reintroduction in motion, hunters and ranchers vehemently opposed the plan. They warned of conflicts between humans, wolves and livestock.
 ‘Wolf ground zero’: How wolves and livestock can collide in the West

Ranchers said the loss of livestock like sheep and cattle would threaten to wipe out generations-old family businesses.
They were already struggling with the thinnest of margins and facing uncertainties like drought.
They didn’t need wolves eating their livestock.
“We have family stories from my grandfather and great grandfather about the first generation of wolves and how they warned us about keeping them away from our livestock, and how important it was to not have livestock interactions with wolves,” said Jay Smith, owner of J Lazy S Angus Ranch in Carmen, Idaho. “So we have that long, long family history of knowledge on top of our own.”
Smith is a fourth-generation rancher. His ancestors first bought a ranch on Carmen Creek in 1924.

His own ranch is located a few ridges over from Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness – the original site of wolf reintroduction in Idaho in 1995.
Smith calls the area “wolf ground zero.”
From the ranch, Smith can gaze across the valley and see the Diamond Moose grazing allotment. It was one of the first – and remains one of the most consistent – sites of conflict between wolves and livestock, Smith said.
“There’s no rhyme or reason,” Smith said. “You know, in 30 years, we never know what to expect. One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero. And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk.”
 Tense public meetings showed just how controversial wolf reintroduction was, not just to the West, but to the world

Ranchers weren’t the only ones worried about wolf reintroduction.
Hunters warned the return of wolves would lead to the decimation of elk herds, which would threaten a way of life for generations of passionate hunters.
A series of heated wolf reintroduction public meetings played out in cities and small towns across Idaho, Wyoming and Montana in the 1990s.
Yellowstone National Park staff reported that over about 2.5 years, the team developing the environmental impact state conducted more than 130 meetings and considered more than 160,000 public comments, which came in from all 50 states and 40 foreign countries.
Several people in the room during those meetings described increasingly tense hearings, where emotion and fear trumped science and reason.
“Working with wolves all the years I did before coming here, you can’t underestimate human hatred of wolves,” said Doug Smith, a biologist who led wolf reintroduction and monitoring in Yellowstone for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022. “I mean reason, compromise, facts, science doesn’t even dent people’s attitudes about (wolves).”
“Prior to wolves being listed as an endangered species, they weren’t just killed, they were tortured,” Smith continued. “People cut their lower jaws off and set them free, and they died that way. They would wire their jaws shut. They would take nails or razor blades and put it in hunks of meat… So they’d swallow the razor blades and nails. This is human hatred.”
Some wolf meetings ended in screaming matches.
But in 1994, former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt authorized the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho.
“It was a long slog,” Smith said. “Wolves were listed in 1974, so it was a 20 year process to get wolves back.”
After it became clear wolf reintroduction was going to happen, Doug Smith landed his dream job in 1994 – becoming a wolf project biologist at Yellowstone National Park. There were no wolves there yet, but he was there to lay the groundwork for reintroduction.
Within two years, Smith was named leader of the Yellowstone Wolf Project.
“If you’d studied wolves at all, or carnivores at all, it was the biggest opportunity in decades to come along,” Smith said. “I mean, wolves are eradicated from Yellowstone by the government. The government decides to restore them. It’s the largest intact temperate zone ecosystem in the world, and the government’s going to undertake wolf reintroduction – as controversial a thing as you can get.”
 Howling for wolves – and a wake up call

Babbitt’s authorization to reintroduce wolves didn’t ease the tension.
Shortly before wolf reintroduction, Suzanne Asha Stone and a team of researchers were surveying the land where the wolves would be reintroduced in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
Stone is the co-founder of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network. At the time, she was an intern working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a member of the wolf reintroduction team.
After landing a small plane on a wilderness airstrip, the researchers received a report of a wolf sighting in an area called Bear Valley, just outside of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
“Dr. (Steven) Fritz was teaching me how to howl for wolves,” Stone said. “That’s how we used to look for wolves before there were more of the digital type recordings that you would play for them. You just go out and do some howling. And so he was teaching me how to do that. And it was my first time to go solo.”
“We were on a Forest Service road out in the backcountry on the national forest and I got to my second howl, and we had rifle bullets just zing right over the top of our heads,” Stone said.
Nobody was hurt, and Stone still doesn’t know if the shooters knew people were in the area.
But the episode served as a wakeup call, a visceral reminder of how deep wolf hatred ran for some.
By the time Stone and the reintroduction team arrived in Salmon to prepare to reintroduce wolves in Idaho, Stone was concerned for the team’s safety and worried about the potential for violence.
Members of the reintroduction team began to travel with an armed guard.
“We’d already received death threats in town from people’s signs,” Stone said. “They were handwritten. And it said, ‘kill all the wolves and all the people who brought them here.’”
 ‘Carter’s Hope’: How one man and one wolf made the West a little more wild

Babbitt’s signature cleared the way for Carter Niemeyer and the reintroduction team to head to Hinton in November 1994.
And that brings us back to that alcohol-fueled wolf-skinning competition.
Niemeyer, refusing to blink, won the competition with the local trappers and earned their respect. That’s when the capture and reintroduction mission finally got off the ground.
With his credibility firmly established, Niemeyer got in touch with Clay Wilson, a helicopter pilot out of Cranbrook, British Columbia.
Niemeyer and Wilson hoped to search for wolves by air, dart them with tranquilizers fired from the helicopter and then fit the wolves with radio collars.
Once the captured wolves were temporarily released again, the radio collars would help the reintroduction team track the wolves to the location of the larger pack.
But the gunners hired for the operation hadn’t arrived yet.
Wilson decided to take a test flight and invited Niemeyer.
Niemeyer was a seasoned hunter and government trapper who had experience using sedative drugs like telazol and ketamine.
But he did not know the area or have any leads on local wolves.
“When the pilots got there they go, ‘So do we have anybody who knows how to gun that could go ride with us to go dart a wolf?’” Niemeyer said. “And I was the only one.”
The team took two helicopters up.
Wilson and Niemeyer eventually spotted a group of three or four wolves, including that 9-month-old male pup with the thick black winter coat.
After several passes, Wilson flew in low and Niemeyer finally fired at the running pup.
The dart struck the wolf on one its front paws – just barely.
Wilson landed the helicopter, and Niemeyer sprang after the young wolf.
The wolf was only partially sedated, still staggering and thrashing through the snow.
After a mad dash, Niemeyer got close enough to slip a catchpole over the wolf and administer another round of drugs to sedate it.

It was a moment he will never forget: Niemeyer had just darted and captured the first wolf for reintroduction in America.
“I named it Carter’s Hope, because it was the first wolf we caught up in Canada by darting,” Niemeyer said. “And I was just being silly and called it Carter’s Hope. Hoping that this was the beginning of a successful project, which it turned out to be.”
Once the wolves were darted and captured, they were sent to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park, where they underwent medical examinations, were given vaccinations and tested for disease.
During exams, the wolves were given numbered radio collars that allowed biologists or park rangers to track the wolf’s location.
Idaho elementary school students decorated collars for each of the wolves bound for Central Idaho.
Each collar has a different number and Carter’s Hope, who was bound for Yellowstone, received collar number 15. (Niemeyer said the collars don’t have any negative effects on the wolves who wear them.)
After his capture, Carter’s Hope was flown to Montana and then driven to Yellowstone National Park in January 1995.

As the horse trailers carrying Carter’s Hope and the other wolves entered Yellowstone’s North Entrance at Gardiner, Montana, and passed under the iconic Roosevelt Arch, crowds of people lining the side of the road cheered and waved.
 A soft release into Yellowstone country

Carter’s Hope became one of the original members of the Soda Butte Pack, one of the first three packs of wild wolves to live in Yellowstone in nearly 70 years.
Initially, the Yellowstone wolves were kept in one-acre acclimation pens, set back from the park’s roads, as part of a so-called soft release.
“We were on the receiving team, so our job was to take care of the wolves in the pens for 10 weeks. That meant visiting them twice a week, every week, to feed them, check on them, and then release them,” Smith said.
Yellowstone staffers used horse-drawn sleds to haul animal carcasses to the pens to feed the wolves.
  After they were captured in Canada, the wolves released in Yellowstone National Park initially stayed in acclimation pens, like this wolf pictured in Crystal Creek on Jan. 26, 1996. (Photo courtesy of Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)
But outside of the temporary acclimation pens where the new wolves were first held upon reintroduction, Yellowstone National Park is wild landscape with no fences – the park boundary is an invisible line.
After the wolves were released from Yellowstone’s acclimation pens in March 1995, Carter’s Hope didn’t stay within the boundaries of Yellowstone, where rangers patrolled and poaching was almost unheard of. Wolves were still listed as an endangered species in 1995, but protecting them in the vast tracts of national forest and ranchland outside of the park would be a challenge.
After Carter’s Hope and the Soda Butte Pack left the park in April 1995, Niemeyer and Smith worried the wolves could be at risk of poaching anytime they strayed beyond Yellowstone’s invisible boundaries.
“We’ve learned through decades of wolf research that making it illegal to kill wolves doesn’t stop people from killing them,” Smith said in an interview in the Yellowstone backcountry. “Wolves are one of those cultural lightning rods that a ton of society doesn’t care about what the rules are. They hate wolves so much they’re going to shoot them. And you know, a country like this that I’m looking out upon is broken country. It’s forested. The wolves have got a chance to get away from human killing. (But) ringing the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a sea of humanity, and it’s open country. And what I mean by open county is no place to hide. People jump on four wheelers. People jump in pickup trucks, and they’ll run them down… Yeah, they run them down with snowmobiles, or four wheelers. Or they get close enough where they can take a rifle shot on them when there’s no place to hide. And there’s no place to hide all around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.”
Aside from poaching, Smith and Niemeyer worried about wildlife control officers killing wolves if the wolves killed livestock outside of the park.
It turns out, it was only a matter of time.
The first report came in December 1995 – wolves killed a dog in Fishtail, Montana.
By spring and early summer 1996, wolves had killed sheep on a ranch about 30 miles north of Yellowstone’s border.
This time, Niemeyer was able to capture Carter’s Hope and bring the wolf back to a Yellowstone acclimation pen for two more months.
While Carter’s Hope was in the pen, a young visitor took notice.

Wolf 26, a female wolf pup from the Nez Perce Pack, began hanging around the pen.
Wolf 26 was one of the wolves brought to Yellowstone from Canada during the second year of reintroduction, in 1996, Yellowstone National Park records show.
After inching closer and closer, Wolf 26 and Carter’s Hope touched noses through the fence in the pen, Niemeyer wrote in his memoir, “Wolfer.”
No longer a part of the Soda Butte Pack, Carter’s Hope paired off with Wolf 26 after he was re-released from the pen on Sept. 27, 1996.
Along with humans, wolves are among the few mammals that form long-term pair bonds – often remaining together for life, raising pups jointly and sharing food.
Carter’s Hope and Wolf 26 stayed together and traveled throughout the southern portions of Yellowstone National Park through the end of 1996, Yellowstone records show.
Eventually the two wolves left Yellowstone, heading south to Wyoming, where Wolf 26 had five pups.
The new pack was named the Washakie Pack.
Carter’s Hope had become an alpha wolf and made history.
“He did successfully acclimate to being a wild wolf and got away from livestock, and he became the first breeding male wolf to establish a pack in the state of Wyoming,” Niemeyer said.
 A long line of descendants – and fear for the future

But two years after Carter’s Hope arrived in Yellowstone, ranchers reported more calves were killed near the Washakie Pack’s territory.
This time, Niemeyer couldn’t save the wolf.
Carter’s Hope was shot and killed by a USDA Wildlife Services officer in October 1997 for killing livestock outside of Yellowstone National Park, according to the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 1998 annual report.
Although wolves were still an endangered species, animal control officers tracked and killed Carter’s Hope under rules established to reduce conflict with ranchers.
Niemeyer still thinks killing Carter’s Hope was unnecessary.

“I was upset, and I was saddened,” Niemeyer said. “I was disappointed.”
But he also realized the place Carter’s Hope holds in history.
Carter’s Hope was one of the 66 wolves captured in Canada released in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in 1995 and 1996.
“He made it a couple, three years, but he did have pups, and that’s a nice thing with wolves – they’re prolific animals, and some of his progeny lived to see another day,” Niemeyer said.
Today, just over 30 years later, there are an estimated 2,800 wolves in the Western United States.
Almost all of them descended from Carter’s Hope and the other 65 other wolves that a small team of biologists, veterinarians, trappers, pilots and conservationists reintroduced to America.
Today, 30 years removed from reintroduction, Niemeyer, Stone and Smith say wolves are in danger once more. Wolves were removed from the Endangered Species List in 2011.
Now, Niemeyer, Smith and Stone worry about increased hunting and trapping and new government programs enacted in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming that are intended to reduce the wolf population.
“I am worried about the future, because the most important thing for wolf restoration is human attitudes, and human attitudes have not changed about wolves,” Smith said. “One of my favorite sound bites when I started working in Yellowstone 30 years ago was, ‘I hope in 30 years, some of the controversy has died down, and people have gotten used to the ideas that wolves aren’t that bad.’ And that hasn’t happened at all. They are still hated as much as they were 30 years ago. They’re still a political football. They’re still controversial.”
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

Mike Braun appears at the Mid-America Regulatory Conference in downtown Indianapolis on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on Wednesday announced the creation of a task force to plan for how the state will meet growing demand for energy.
It was part of an executive order he signed last week and uploaded Wednesday.
“Indiana’s economy is growing, and we need new solutions to meet this accelerating energy demand reliably and affordably,” he said in a news release. “My new Strategic Energy Growth Task Force will take an all-of-the-above approach to meet the electricity demands of our growing economy in the short-run, and plan for Indiana to become an energy export state and national leader in nuclear energy for the long-run.”
Braun said that’ll be done “all with a focus on reliability and affordability for Hoosiers.”
The “state energy growth” plan — which will include 5-year and 20-year outlooks — is supposed to focus on a range of priorities and objectives:

Maintaining the “all-of-the-above” take on energy sources and maintaining existing coal-powered plants.
Developing the energy sector to meet current and future power needs, and to make Indiana an energy-exporting state.
Fostering technological “collaboration and innovation” between the state and private sector. Braun hopes to go nuclear.
Ensuring energy is affordable and reliable.

Braun’s order gives the task force a to-do list.
It must engage utility companies and others to align their strategic plans toward meeting the state’s energy growth targets. And it has to work with grid operators to focus on grid connection, transmission, dispatchable energy sources and more.
It will also work with the Indiana Economic Development Corporation to identify prospective big industrial power users and build support for “strategic clean energy industrial hubs.” It’ll consider ways to “encourage” those big grid additions to help pay for new electricity generation and transmission.
The task force was directed to analyze what’s driven electricity prices higher over the last 20 years and “propose actionable recommendations.” Additionally, it must “streamline” agency permitting procedures — “while safeguarding the (state’s) abundant natural resources.”
An initial task force report is due to Braun by the end of the year, and a state energy growth plan is due May 29, 2026.
The group’s membership includes Energy and Natural Resources Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski, Commerce Secretary David Adams, Office of Energy Development Executive Director Jon Ford, Department of Environmental Management Commissioner Clint Woods, Department of Natural Resources Director Alan Morrison, Utility Regulatory Commission Chair Jim Huston, Finance Authority Public Finance Director Dan Huge, or their representatives. Other executive branch experts may join.
The order also invited participation from legislative branch utility leaders, grid and transmission representatives, and other industry stakeholders.

(Photo Scott Eisen/Getty Images)As the cost of living crisis continues to plague Americans all over the country, residents and businesses alike are facing energy affordability challenges in Maine. A report from December found that roughly 100,000 Maine households struggle to pay energy bills. Maine residents deserve energy solutions that will drive costs down. Unless our leaders take action, it doesn’t seem like the threat of higher and higher energy prices is changing anytime soon. 
Older consumers are particularly vulnerable to the burden of high utility bills. Too often, seniors are forced to choose between energy expenditures and other necessities, putting their health and comfort at risk. We tend to rely more on assistance programs, spend more money on energy, and have a limited ability to reduce our home electricity bills.
This is a critical moment to tackle our energy cost, reliability, and demand challenges. Costs are climbing, and a recent analysis shows that Maine’s electricity prices grew at the third fastest rate in the country from 2014-2024. Electric bills are expected to reach a 12 year high, with customers across the state likely to see a 20% increase in their electricity bill during summer months.
Not only are consumers strained by high costs due to the lack of diverse energy sources, but our national security is also at stake. Relying on imported, expensive fuel exposes the United States to volatile energy markets overseas and gives our adversaries a leg up. Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont together spend $8.2 billion annually on imported energy. What Mainers need are sources that strengthen our grid resiliency and add more American energy to the mix.
The answer lies right in front of us: we can lower electricity costs for seniors and protect our national security by diversifying our energy sources. Here in New England, offshore wind is a powerful domestic energy solution that is already transforming local economies with good-paying jobs for workers and great opportunities for small businesses. Reliability-enhancing energy projects in Maine, including wind, solar, and geothermal, are made possible by federal investments that are now threatened by Congress’ budget bill, which currently phases out tax credits for wind and solar projects.
Alarmingly, these attacks on clean energy will only serve to make energy costs worse. Without federal tax incentives, Mainers could see a 16.7% increase in monthly energy prices by 2040. What’s more — the Trump administration has cut funding for and wants to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a lifesaving program that helps  households reduce their heating and cooling costs. In Maine, the 2023-24 program provided $19.06 million in benefits to more than 35,000 homes. 
As a senior and retired U.S. Army veteran, I know all about the impact of rising energy costs and understand the formidable connection between our energy security and national security. The budget bill — one that cuts Medicaid, food assistance, and tax credits — is now facing a vote in the U.S. Senate. I’m counting on my members of Congress to step up for Maine’s seniors and our energy future. Senator Collins knows about the energy crisis facing Mainers. I thank her for acting to preserve LIHEAP to help low-income Mainers pay their bills. Now is the opportunity for her to once again step up by protecting energy credits. By restoring federal energy tax credits, she can ensure Mainers, especially our elders, aren’t subject to price hikes and a less reliable grid.

,Source New Mexico,2025-06-25 16:29:05+00:00,Source New Mexico,More states are tracking rape kits. But key support for survivors may be slipping away.,"Amanda Hernández, Stateline",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/06/25/more-states-are-tracking-rape-kits-but-key-support-for-survivors-may-be-slipping-away/,"A growing number of states are adopting systems to track rape kits, but the backlog, including in New Mexico, keeps growing.","After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
Prosecutors warn New Mexico lawmakers about ‘new backlog’ in rape kits

That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
Uber, Lyft oppose some bills that aim to prevent assaults during rides

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.












We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault. 


–  Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University




But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
Thousands are suing states over sexual abuse in juvenile detention facilities

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sexual assault survivors can now track their rape kits in most states

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

For months, billions of dollars from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, or NEVI, has been frozen as the Trump administration assesses guidelines established under former President Joe Biden.
U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin’s preliminary injunction Tuesday reopens the funding in Washington and 13 other states that sued the administration. 
Washington was set to get $71 million from the program, which Congress included in the bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed in 2021.
Minnesota, Vermont and the District of Columbia were not covered under Lin’s ruling Tuesday, despite being involved in the lawsuit, because they didn’t provide enough evidence of how the funding freeze impacted them.
The judge’s decision won’t go into effect until July 1, to allow the U.S. Department of Justice time to appeal. The case would next go to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Lin, a Biden appointee, found the Trump administration had “overstepped their Constitutional and statutory authority” and had “attempted to override the express will of Congress.”
“When the Executive Branch treads upon the will of the Legislative Branch, and when an administrative agency acts contrary to law, it is the Court’s responsibility to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power,” Lin wrote.
The decision comes a week after attorneys for the states and the Justice Department argued the case in a Seattle courtroom. Pending appeals, the injunction will remain in effect while the court case proceeds. 
“Congress invested in forward-looking, clean electric vehicle infrastructure – exactly the future that Washington wants,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. “The court confirmed that Donald Trump can’t just wish that future away because he likes fossil fuels.”
Spokespeople from the White House and Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Overall, the plaintiff states were in line for about $1 billion to improve the nation’s fledgling electric vehicle charging network. The overall program involves about $5 billion.
The Federal Highway Administration had previously approved states’ plans for using the money, which was divvied up based on a formula that guides the distribution of federal highway funding. 
But in February, the agency rescinded approval of all those plans. In a notice to states, federal officials said they would “review the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program.” Until that review is over, the funding would be withheld. 
The Trump administration maintains it will still disburse funding eventually.
Washington’s Department of Transportation was accepting grant applications for pieces of its $71 million pie early this year, but hadn’t awarded any of it. Other states had spent some of their portions.
The preliminary injunction also blocks the administration from revoking approval of state funding plans.
The money was meant to help address the lack of chargers, which has stopped many drivers from transitioning to electric vehicles. To exemplify this issue, Lin opens her written ruling with a reference to a 1995 episode of “The Simpsons.”
“Homer must cut short a tearful goodbye with his long-lost mother after her traveling companions protest that their ‘electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left!’” Lin writes. 
“Some 26 years later, Congress sought to address the phenomenon that has come to be known as ‘range anxiety’: the unease experienced by electric vehicle (‘EV’) drivers when they are unsure where the next charging station might be, and whether their car’s battery has sufficient charge to get them there,” she continues.
While Washington has been ahead of other states in EV adoption, its construction of public charging infrastructure has lagged.

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13 before Abrego Garcia’s arraignment on federal charges. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia is due to appear in a downtown Nashville courtroom Wednesday for a hearing scheduled to set conditions for his release pending trial on human smuggling charges.
Federal prosecutors, however, continue to fight for him to be detained. On Sunday a federal magistrate judge issued an order dismissing claims that Abrego posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to challenge the order.
Should he be released on bond, Abrego will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and could be deported, prosecutors said.
If Abrego is deported, the United States would “lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case. This would be irreparable harm to the public,” they argued in legal filings submitted Tuesday.
Prosecutors are seeking a temporary 30-day pause on proceedings to litigate their legal claims that Abrego be detained pending trial.
Family members of Abrego Garcia are also expected to make an appearance in Nashville, joining community leaders “to address concerns over due process, advocate for vulnerable communities and demand justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia” a news release by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition said.
Abrego, an Salvadoran national living in Maryland, has served as a symbol of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
A father of three and a union metal sheet apprentice with no criminal history, Abrego was sent to a Salvadoran prison in March, despite a 2019 order that allowed him to reside in the country while his immigration case was considered. The 2019 immigration order specifically barred his deportation to El Salvador, where, Abrego said, he feared gang violence.
A federal prosecutor in Maryland conceded he had been deported in error during a hearing about Abrego’s deportation. On Tuesday, the New York Times was among the news organizations that reported the prosecutor, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint that alleged he was questioned by his bosses over why he had not also argued instead that Abrego was a terrorist, despite a lack of evidence. Reuveni was then placed on administrative leave when he refused to sign onto a legal brief making the same claims against Abrego. Reuveni was subsequently fired.
The Supreme Court in April ordered federal officials to facilitate Abrego’s return. It wasn’t until June 6 that he was flown to Nashville to face criminal human charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Prosecutors now allege the 2022 Tennessee traffic stop was part of a national smuggling scheme in which Abrego was paid to drive immigrants illegally in the country from Texas to other states.
An agent with the Department of Homeland Security testified he began his investigation into the three-year-old traffic stop in April, while Abrego remained in the El Salvador CECOT prison and after the Supreme Court had ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
In her order denying the prosecutors’ motion to detain Abrego, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes expressed skepticism for some of the government’s claims.
Federal prosecutors argued that a teen boy was present with a number of Hispanic men when Abrego was pulled over for speeding in Tennessee in 2022. The presence of a minor during a crime can be legal grounds for keeping an individual detained pending trial. They also argued that Abrego was a gang member who could intimidate potential witnesses. Abrego has not been charged with crimes related to minors or gang activity.
Holmes questioned the reliability of witnesses and evidence prosecutors cited, noting that some of the individuals made deals for their own criminal and immigration cases in exchange for their testimony. She also concluded that some of the government’s claims relied on “multiple layers of hearsay.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — An $18,000 annual pay increase for legislators will go on pause while the state Supreme Court decides whether its approval was constitutional, the high court ordered Wednesday.
The state budget that takes effect Tuesday includes a $1,500 per-month raise in legislators’ “in-district compensation,” which is ostensibly to help cover expenses for constituent work back home, though it can be used for anything.
Sen. Wes Climer, along with a retired teacher in Rock Hill, challenged the increase June 9, arguing that the raises are unconstitutional because of a provision that bans legislators from raising their own per diems.
Under the schedule the state’s highest court set Wednesday, it could be months before the pay increase — if justices ultimately uphold it — hits legislators’ bank accounts.
Senator sues over his own raise, arguing it violates SC constitution

Climer’s attorney, former senator and Columbia attorney Dick Harpootlian, must file his arguments next month. The House, Senate and treasurer’s office, the case’s defendants, will have until mid-August to reply. The deadline for the final filing will be Sept. 4.
The raise was set to first hit 126 legislators’ bank accounts July 16, the first pay date of the new fiscal year.
Of the Legislature’s 170 members, 44 Republicans have opted out of the raise, according to clerks of the House and Senate.
In deciding to suspend the raises, the court said Climer, a Rock Hill Republican, had shown that letting them start amid the challenge would cause “immediate, irreparable harm” and that the case is sufficiently likely to succeed, according to the order signed by all five justices.
That doesn’t necessarily mean it will succeed — rather, there’s sufficient merit that it could.
“This is why the constitutional separation of powers is so important,” Harpootlian said in a statement Wednesday. “An independent judiciary stands ready to restrain the excessive impulses of the legislative branch.”
Thousands of taxpayer dollars could have gone to legislators before the court made its final decision, and that money would be difficult to recoup, especially if legislators spent it before a ruling, Harpootlian told reporters earlier this month.
Whether the raise from $1,000 to $2,500 a month qualifies as a per diem is the question at hand.
Harpootlian has argued the “per diem” referenced in the state constitution is a reference to any payment legislators receive for their position. The 1890 constitution pre-dated annual salaries and other compensation, Harpootlian told reporters.
But in the decades since, legislators’ pay comes in several main forms: a $10,400 annual salary, unchanged since 1990; the $1,000 for in-district expenses, unchanged since 1995; and a per diem for each day they’re in session, which is meant to cover meals and lodging.
Tied to local hotel rates, the subsistence can change annually. It’s currently $240 daily. It’s the same rate for every legislator, no matter where they live, and can be spent on anything.
Unlike those daily per diems, the in-district compensation should be reported on legislators’ income taxes as personal income, according to the state comptroller’s office.
Attorneys for the Senate argue it qualifies as a reimbursement, even though legislators don’t have to report how they spend the money, so the constitution’s rule that legislators can’t raise their own per diems doesn’t apply.
The Senate’s filing also contends the raises don’t cost taxpayers extra, since the money is set to come from money already designated for the chambers’ operational expenses.
Legislators who proposed the raise said it needed because costs have risen dramatically in the 30 years since the in-district compensation was set at $1,000.
The increase would also mean a boost in many legislators’ pensions, according to the Public Employee Benefit Authority, which oversees the state pension system.
The 43 legislators who were first elected before 2012 won’t see any difference, since the budget clause that established the raise didn’t define it as “earnable compensation,” which is what affects the formula under the former pension system, according to PEBA.
Other legislators, however, could see an increase in their pension.
The 2012 law that made changes to the pension system to rein in the state’s escalating liability ended the separate retirement system for legislators. Starting with the November 2012 elections, legislators could either join the state’s main pension system for public employees, join the optional 401K program, or decline to participate entirely.
It’s unclear how many legislators are in the main South Carolina Retirement System. But for those who are, their retirement benefits are based on a formula involving their highest years of compensation as a public employee. And the raise is considered compensation for pension purposes.

That’s the basis on which 20 Democratic attorneys general and one state governor are contesting sweeping cuts to federal grants and aid in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration.
The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday, centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities, and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.
But the Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert — for the first time — that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.
The defendants include:

U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick
U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth
U.S. Secretary ofHomeland Security Kristi Noem
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi
U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin
Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Richardson
Acting National Endowment for Humanities Chairman Michael McDonald
Acting National Science Foundation Director Brian Stone

‘Unlawful actions’

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha said in a statement.
“Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers, and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
No ‘unfettered power’
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the federal agencies, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an email Tuesday.
In addition to Neronha, the other AGs who filed the complaint represent Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is also representing his state in the case.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid. The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from Bob Jones University, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, because the institution was in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws by excluding Black applicants as students unless they were married.
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”

The grants were awarded early, in January instead of June, to allow organizations to begin work sooner in the year, officials said. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)In the wake of the resignation of the executive director of the Nebraska Environmental Trust and a search for a successor, the Friends of the Nebraska Environmental Trust highlighted issues the next director should pursue after being appointed.
This group of Trust supporters includes individuals with a long history of involvement with the Trust: former Trust board members, legislators, architects of the 1992 legislation creating the Trust; and backers of the constitutional amendment that created the Nebraska Lottery, the funding source of the Trust.
The Trust has awarded funding to more than 2,400 projects totaling approximately $350 million that have touched all 93 Nebraska counties since the 1990s. We are proud of the Trust’s successes and care deeply about its future. It has performed admirably but has some issues to resolve.
Part of the Nebraska Constitution
Forty-four and one-half percent of the proceeds of the Nebraska Lottery after the payment of prizes and operating expenses and after a $500,000 transfer to the Compulsive Gamblers Assistance Fund are allocated in Nebraska’s Constitution (III-24) to the Nebraska Environmental Trust Fund. The money must be used as provided in the Nebraska Environmental Trust Act.
Testimony introducing the legislation was clear. The Trust was created to provide incentives for local and regional groups across the state to recognize area needs, build partnerships and leverage funds to use the Trust to address important issues the state government lacks the capacity to meet or fund.
The Trust has been effective at engaging local groups in solving local problems and raising local money to match. In keeping with the original legislative intent, funds from the Trust should only be awarded to projects originated by a local or regional group or other organizations that have a record of promoting environmental quality in Nebraska.
Eligibility questions
State agencies may be awarded grants, but the projects should be ineligible unless they result in significant matched funds from the federal government or private sources. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment have both successfully employed that strategy in the past and brought important federal dollars to Nebraska.
Importantly, all projects should be reviewed by the Trust board’s grants committee and awarded on a competitive basis through an established ranking process. The current process of transferring money to state agencies that receive dollars from the general fund to supplement their budgets defeats the purpose of the Trust and creates ill-will with some in the public who see this as unfair competition.
The past two years have seen a decline in the number of grant applications and grants awarded. Consider the number of grant applicants in 2024 was 80 with 50 being funded; 2023 had 81 applications with only 47 deemed eligible for scoring but only 23 were funded by the Trust board. Both years showed drops in applications compared with 2022, which had 118 applications, 82 deemed eligible and 71 projects funded.
Funding available
Proceeds of approximately $20 million a year from the lottery are sufficient to fund more applications if the projects are held to evaluation standards. It has been past practice to fund as many qualified proposals as available dollars would allow.
Some organizations that previously submitted grant applications have not competed in recent years due to vague changes to the criteria for grants, erratic scoring of grant applications and overly bureaucratic administration of the grants.
Concerns expressed by Friends of the Trust when the Trust rewrote its rules and regulations have been shown to be valid. Some of the criteria are difficult to understand and even harder to follow. Requirements mandated by the Trust board sometimes exceed federal requirements for similar grants, which has no justification in state law.
Scoring questions
The scoring of grant applications seems to occur in a black box. What was once a public process is now an opaque one. In the past, scoring could be analyzed for inconsistencies. Public review is no longer possible, and confidence in project scoring has been lost.
Grant applicants have complained of mixed messages and finding the goal posts moved after grants are awarded. Applicants have spent money expecting reimbursement under grant contracts and found reimbursement denied because of new interpretations. Applicants fear retribution if they discuss concerns about the process.
The current rules and regulations do not provide enough guidance for them to comply with Trust criteria or protect them from arbitrary decisions.
Nebraskans understand and support accountability and effectiveness. Those are legitimate goals, and changes to reach those goals must be made periodically. But reality also must be recognized.
Seek more applications
A maximum number of quality grant applications should be sought from private organizations and non-state agencies by continuing and expanding training sessions for potential applicants. And communication is key.
The Trust must reopen its processes to public scrutiny to promote confidence in its operations. Public disclosure would help — of the availability of funds, the criteria for applying and being successful and clarity and consistency about eligibility.
Long-time Trust supporters believe public confidence can be restored and more applications encouraged with proper leadership by the executive director and the board. This can be done by recognizing the commitment to the history and purpose of the Trust to “conserve, enhance and restore” the natural environments of Nebraska.
Rebuild trust
The governor, the Nebraska Legislature, the new executive director and the Trust board should want to ensure Trust funds are used in accordance with the intent expressed in Section 81–15.168 of state law: “The Trust shall complement existing governmental and private efforts by encouraging and leveraging the use of private resources on environmental needs with the greatest potential impact on future environmental quality in Nebraska. The Trust shall develop a long-range environmental focus … and shall join public and private efforts in achieving the collective environmental goals of Nebraska’s citizens.”
Nowhere does the law or its design indicate that funds should be removed from the Trust to help balance the state’s general fund budget.

Scott Brown and wife, Gail Huff Brown, talk to attendees at their Sept. 13, 2023, ""No BS Backyard BBQ"" in Rye, featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (File photo by Hadley Barndollar/New Hampshire Bulletin)Scott Brown, a former U.S. senator for Massachusetts and ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa during the first Trump administration, announced Wednesday he is running for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire.
Brown, a Republican, joins an early race to replace Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who announced in March that she would retire at the end of her term. U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, a Democrat, entered the race in April. No other Republicans have announced campaigns thus far.
“We need people in the United States Senate who can get the job done,” Brown said in his announcement video. “And I have a proven record of doing just that.”
Brown was one of the most common names floated by spectators as a potential candidate, and his path to the Republican nomination grew clearer after former Gov. Chris Sununu publicly ruled out a run.
Brown targeted Pappas Wednesday, saying in the video, “For four years, Chris Pappas has stood with Joe Biden as he opened the border, drove up the cost of everything, and made life just simply unaffordable.”
“Chris Pappas wants a better title,” he continued. “I want a better America.”
Pappas, who has represented New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District since 2018, responded to Brown’s announcement with a statement: “I got into this race because Granite Staters made it clear they want a Senator grounded in their values. … While Scott Brown looks for yet another opportunity to do Wall Street’s bidding and blindly support President Trump and his agenda, I’ll always put New Hampshire first.”
Brown was born at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and moved to Massachusetts in his youth before starting a career in the state legislature there. In 2010, he won a special election to replace U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy and represent Massachusetts. He was defeated by Elizabeth Warren in his 2012 re-election bid and subsequently moved back to New Hampshire, where he ran for this same U.S. Senate seat in 2014. He won the GOP nomination but lost that election to Shaheen.
Brown praised President Donald Trump in his announcement and signaled his allegiance to the president.
“President Trump is fighting every day to right the ship,” he said. “He sealed the border. He stood up to China. And he restored our standing in the world.”
In his Massachusetts political career, Brown was known for his work on veterans’ issues and was ranked “the most popular officeholder in Massachusetts” in a Boston Globe poll. He once described himself as a “pro-choice moderate Republican,” according to Real Clear Politics. GovTrack named him the third most moderate Republican in the U.S. Senate in 2013.
“Scott Brown is right that Democrats like Chris Pappas are out-of-touch with Granite Staters,” Nick Puglia, regional press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “New Hampshire is in play for Republicans in 2026, and we play to win.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13, 2025, before Abrego Garcia’s arraignment on federal charges. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia is due to appear in a downtown Nashville courtroom today for a hearing scheduled to set conditions for his release pending trial on human smuggling charges.
Federal prosecutors, however, continue to fight for him to be detained. On Sunday a federal magistrate judge issued an order dismissing claims that Abrego posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to challenge the order.
Should he be released on bond, Abrego will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and could be deported, prosecutors said.
If Abrego is deported, the United States would “lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case. This would be irreparable harm to the public,” they argued in legal filings submitted Tuesday.
Prosecutors are seeking a temporary 30-day pause on proceedings to litigate their legal claims that Abrego be detained pending trial.
Family members of Abrego Garcia are also expected to make an appearance in Nashville, joining community leaders “to address concerns over due process, advocate for vulnerable communities and demand justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia” a news release by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition said.
Abrego, an Salvadoran national living in Maryland, has served as a symbol of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
A father of three and a union metal sheet apprentice with no criminal history, Abrego was sent to a Salvadoran prison in March, despite a 2019 order that allowed him to reside in the country while his immigration case was considered. The 2019 immigration order specifically barred his deportation to El Salvador, where, Abrego said, he feared gang violence.
A federal prosecutor in Maryland conceded he had been deported in error during a hearing about Abrego’s deportation. On Tuesday, The New York Times was among the news organizations that reported the prosecutor, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint that alleged he was questioned by his bosses over why he had not also argued instead that Abrego was a terrorist, despite a lack of evidence. Reuveni was then placed on administrative leave when he refused to sign a legal brief making the same claims against Abrego. Reuveni was subsequently fired.
The Supreme Court in April ordered federal officials to facilitate Abrego’s return. It wasn’t until June 6 that he was flown to Nashville to face criminal human charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Traffic stop
Prosecutors now allege the 2022 Tennessee traffic stop was part of a national smuggling scheme in which Abrego was paid to drive immigrants illegally in the country from Texas to other states.
An agent with the Department of Homeland Security testified he began his investigation into the three-year-old traffic stop in April, while Abrego remained in the El Salvador CECOT prison and after the Supreme Court had ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
In her order denying the prosecutors’ motion to detain Abrego, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes expressed skepticism for some of the government’s claims.
Federal prosecutors argued that a teen boy was present with a number of Hispanic men when Abrego was pulled over for speeding in Tennessee in 2022. The presence of a minor during a crime can be legal grounds for keeping an individual detained pending trial. They also argued that Abrego was a gang member who could intimidate potential witnesses. Abrego has not been charged with crimes related to minors or gang activity.
Holmes questioned the reliability of witnesses and evidence prosecutors cited, noting that some of the individuals made deals for their own criminal and immigration cases in exchange for their testimony. She also concluded that some of the government’s claims relied on “multiple layers of hearsay.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Owners of the Bowersock Mills & Power Co. relied on federal renewable energy tax incentives to expand production at the Lawrence hydroelectric plant that’s been drawing power from the Kansas River for more than a century.
Sarah Hill-Nelson, CEO of the facility, said tax benefits designed to encourage growth of alternative energy production projects — now threatened by Congress — were essential to upgrading one of the oldest hydroelectric plants west of the Mississippi River nearly 15 years ago.
“We issued $25 million in debt to expand,” she said. “We were able to triple the amount of energy we produce on an annual basis. Do we have aspirations to expand? Absolutely.”
Hill-Nelson said incentives that made a difference at Bowersock were comparable to investment and production tax policies targeted in U.S. House and U.S. Senate legislation drafted by Republicans to conform with President Donald Trump’s political agenda. In May, the House passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on a vote of 215-214. The Senate is preparing to vote on its bill.
Both would undermine U.S. alternative energy companies, threaten jobs and make it difficult to meet growing domestic demand for electricity, Hill-Nelson said.
Her opinion stood in contrast to Trump’s recent post to social media: “None of it (green energy) works without massive government subsidy.”
She said the president didn’t have a clear understanding or was misled about the extent to which U.S. fossil fuel companies benefitted from federal energy incentives, including tax breaks, lease and royalty agreements or funding of research. The International Monetary Fund reported fossil fuel subsidies in the United States reached $757 billion in 2022.
 
The hit on Kansas
Hill-Nelson took part in a media briefing Tuesday hosted by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and its subsidiary, the Clean Energy Business Network, to highlight how the House-passed budget bill would raise household energy spending in Kansas by an average of $210 per year in 2030 and by $670 per year in 2035.
The industry associations said the House budget bill supported by Kansas’ U.S. Reps. Derek Schmidt, Ron Estes and Tracey Mann, would result in loss of an estimated 9,700 jobs in Kansas within five years and nearly 10,000 jobs in a decade. The package would shrink annual gross domestic product in Kansas by $1.9 billion by 2035, the associations said.
“Companies rely on long-term business certainty in the tax code to plan projects and allocate capital,” said Lisa Jacobson, president of Business Council for Sustainable Energy in Washington, D.C. “As we face an era of unprecedented energy demand growth, now is not the time to disrupt the market by making unnecessary changes to the tax structure.”
Lynn Abramson, president of Clean Energy Business Network, said deliberations in Congress about withdrawal of tax credits for alternative energy development had already damaged small businesses nationwide.
Businesses in Kansas and elsewhere built on federal laws making energy tax credits available into the 2030s should be given a smooth transition away from those incentives, she said.
 
Shift in current
Mark Horst, owner of the residential and commercial solar installer King Solar in Hutchinson, said Congress appeared willing to quickly phase out a 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar projects. If the plug were pulled on the tax credit at the end of 2025, he said, the change would break consistent growth his company had experienced over the past 20 years.
“We would probably have to cut at least 60% of our workforce in about a year,” Horst said.
Residential customers were certain to change buying decisions if the tax credit for installing solar on their homes goes away, said Malcolm Proudfit, CEO of Good Energy Solutions of Lawrence. 
The majority of Good Energy’s customers were contemplating deployment of solar from a cost-savings perspective, he said. 
“The tax credit plays a key role in either reducing their overall net cost for the system if they’re paying for it outright or for those that finance their systems,” he said. “Then you apply the tax credit to your personal taxes for the year and that ought to get some kind of a return or tax refund.”
In the Senate proposal, the tax credit for solar panels on rooftops would end 180 days after the bill passed, Proudfit said. 
 
Details matter
Justin Grady, utilities director for the Kansas Corporation Commission, said elimination or change to federal clean energy tax credits could affect the Kansas Sky solar facility proposed by Evergy that would be located in Douglas County.
Evergy’s solar complex would have the potential to meet criteria for the full tax credit, Grady said, noting that Evergy had contracts lined up and fixed-price agreements for buying solar panels.
“But if those tax credits go away, it will obviously meaningfully affect the price of the power purchase agreements that utilities might otherwise take advantage of for any renewable energy facility that utilities in Kansas decide to build,” he said.
He said the Senate bill, which is still under development, allowed projects beginning construction in 2025 to receive 100% of a federal tax credit, but projects launching in 2026 would receive 60%. It’s unclear what “beginning construction” means, he said, as it could define the simple movement of dirt or incurring no more than 5% of qualified costs.
Joseph Astrab, consumer counsel for the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, which advocates for residential and small business ratepayers before the KCC and Legislature, said utilities must determine the best way to meet energy needs in the context of affordability and reliability.
He said cuts to federal incentives transforming the energy-generation mix, such as whether electricity was supplied by natural gas, wind or solar, would force utilities to overhaul those plans.
“It’s always been thought, well, solar and other renewable resources will have this tax credit available at all times, so it’s been built into the analyses,” Astrab said. “So, if there’s a shift where a lot of that goes away for new projects, then that may impact how the utilities review that and what they bring to the commission.”
 
Business slowdown
Laura Thompson, president of Overland Park-based FlowEnergy, said discussion in Washington about phasing out energy tax credits led to a slowdown in the company’s business of supplying schools, universities and commercial property owners with hardware and software to better manage energy usage.
She said tax credits were an important opportunity for property owners to speed the payback from energy-saving investments.
“Right now,” she said, “the projects in our pipeline are on hold or have significantly slowed. This isn’t good because our projects not only provide jobs for our own technical and services staff, but also for the construction and engineering firms that we’re subcontracted to to execute these projects.”
Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the nonpartisan Climate and Energy Project, offered a personal example of how loss of federal tax credits for adoption of energy efficient building methods meant.
She said her daughter needed a new roof on her home because of storms in the Kansas City area. If she installed an Energy Star roof, Barnett said, she could receive a $1,200 tax credit under existing federal law. The U.S. Senate bill would end that tax credit.
“We have spent the last three years really building up a pipeline and an opportunity to work with Kansans on energy efficiency upgrades and retrofits to help people affect their utilities. In a pen swoop, all of a sudden, we’re not getting our grant money for those programs,” Barnett said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bowersock-dam-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 12:14:17.284414

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota nonprofit focused on transgender rights will curate and maintain what’s been a volunteer-run, searchable database of businesses friendly to LGBTQ+ patrons.
The Transformation Project and the database, known as Dorothy’s List, announced the merger this week in a press release meant to dovetail with the end of Pride Month.
Adam Jorgensen founded Dorothy’s List in 2023, using a $1,000 grant from the Sutton Leadership Institute, a nonprofit that trains aspiring young professionals in business, nonprofit and political spheres. 
State apologizes, pays transgender advocacy group $300,000 for discrimination

Jorgensen applied for and received the grant from the institute after graduating from its yearlong development program. The Sioux Falls man pulled information from a few different – but largely dormant – regional lists of businesses to launch the statewide list.
Similar lists exist nationwide, such as The Pink Pages, and others focus on medical providers. Jorgensen’s goal was to offer a state-specific list for South Dakota.
The grant money allowed Jorgensen to pay for a logo design and produce stickers and other promotional merchandise, as well as to set up the website, which launched in 2023.
The site lists around 150 businesses, and Jorgensen told South Dakota Searchlight that about 80 of them have taken its inclusion pledge. That pledge asks businesses to take steps like placing rainbow flags in business windows, using provided materials for employee training and committing to speak against legislative proposals that might harm LGBTQ+ people.
With a full-time job and other commitments, Jorgensen said he’d grown concerned that he couldn’t offer enough attention to the project to properly maintain the list, named for Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz.” It’s a nod to the question “are you a friend of Dorothy,” asked in decades past by people looking for safe spaces in the era of criminalized homosexuality.
Jorgensen said he was thrilled when the Transformation Project agreed to fold the curation of Dorothy’s List into its project list.
“It’s fantastic to see the Transformation Project take over as lead of this project,” Jorgensen said in the announcement. “Dorothy’s List addresses a real need for South Dakotans, LGBTQ+ and Two Spirit or otherwise, that want to spend their time and dollars wisely.”
“Two Spirit” is a word used by Indigenous people to refer to those who do not identify as male or female.
The Transformation Project’s status a nonprofit with a full-time staff should allow Dorothy’s List to “expand its reach,” the press release says, and to serve as a tool for “communities to unite over a common cause.”
“We must continue to hold the corporations and individuals accountable that actively harm our community by rallying behind those that don’t,” Susan Williams, executive director of the Transformation Project, said in the release.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition that includes North Dakota filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid. The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from Bob Jones University, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, because the institution was in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws by excluding Black applicants as students if they were in an interracial relationship or marriage beginning in 1975.
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”

Kristine S. Gerson
1957 – 2025
Wife, Mother, Teacher, Friend

Kristine Sheathelm Gerson passed away peacefully in her home on June 23, 2025. Her death followed a long period of enduring a brutal lymphoma. She remains a beautiful young woman in the eyes of her loving family and wonderful friends.
Kristine was born in Colorado Springs, CO, on January 26, 1957. She spent her early years in Lansing, MI, alongside her brother Kurt before moving to Storrs, CT, during elementary school. Her father taught at the University of Connecticut, and her mother taught in the Mansfield Public Schools. It was in Storrs that she met and fell in love with her husband, Bill. She initially attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, but after deciding that teaching was her future, she transferred to Wheelock College in Boston, MA. After graduation, she and Bill married, and she moved to Baltimore, MD, to be with him during his medical school years. They lived at the Garrison Forrest School as dorm parents. Teaching was her professional passion. She taught first in Rockville, MD, where she taught both art and special education. She then taught in the Baltimore Public Schools in a self-contained special education classroom in south Baltimore until she had her first child, Zachary, and the new family moved to Boston. She spent six years in Boston while Bill was at the Children’s Hospital, and the family added two more sons, Jacob and Elijah, while also running a home daycare. The family moved to Charlotte, VT, in the summer of 1988 when Bill joined Pediatric Medicine in South Burlington. Their fourth son, Abraham, was born soon after the move. Kristine continued to provide home daycare in Charlotte, taught at the religious school at Temple Sinai in South Burlington, and gave back to her local community by founding, along with her friend Marty Ditchey, the Charlotte Food Shelf, for which she was later honored as Volunteer of the Year by the town.
Kristine went on to teach first and second grade at Charlotte Central School for twenty years until her illness and the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated her early retirement. She made true friends among her colleagues and wishes to thank them, especially Peggy Coutu, Kathy Lara, and Rookie Manning, for the love they showed her as her disease progressed. At Charlotte Central School, she treasured her work as the school union representative and was especially thankful for the love and support she received during her illness from her district union colleagues.

Kristine and Bill also want to express thanks for the excellent care, both compassionate and wise, provided by Dr. Paul Unger and Stephanie Pevear in Burlington, VT, and Dr Jeremy Abramson at MGH and to the nurses on Lunder 10 at MGH where she underwent two cellular transplants and multiple treatment protocols. She was excited about contributing to medical science and enjoyed meeting the dedicated research and care teams. The care Kristine received at end-of-life from UVM Home Health and Hospice was truly caring. Abby Foulk and her husband Mort Wasserman, longtime friends and colleagues, were essential supports as she navigated her last years.
While she excelled as a teacher, her family and community of friends defined her – the love, travel, and just the fun of it all. Married for almost 50 years, her loving family – husband, four sons, four daughters-in-law, and six grandchildren was a constant joy. They are all heartbroken by their loss. Her father, Herb, and his wife, Beverly, were extraordinary hosts to the entire family for weeks at a time for many decades at their homes in Maine and Arizona. Lifelong friends Jack and Sue Rome are special, and as they vacationed together as a family for forty years, they are indeed family. Alan Guttmacher enticed Bill and Kristine to move to Vermont after they had spent years together at Boston Children’s Hospital, and he and his wife, Bridgid, have also been a part of the family since. The now-retired partners at Pediatric Medicine are also family, and they loved and nurtured both Kristine and Bill. She was so thankful to have been a part of that family – Tom and Lorna Bates, Buzz and Donna Land, Delight and Jack Long, and Deb and Thom Hartswick. Kristine was also very grateful to the current partners and staff at Pediatric Medicine for their accommodations necessitated by her prolonged illness.
Kristine was an individual of great beauty, humor, strength, compassion, and a deep commitment to caring. She loved her series of family dogs: Pugs, Shumba and Nyabo, Mazel, and her last – Tootsie and Ollie. She was an avid knitter and reader, particularly as her illness became more limiting when she would produce treasure troves of knitting creations and read hundreds of books each year. She was dedicated to nature and will be missed by the wide variety of birds that daily visited her yard at home, bringing Kristine and whoever was visiting happiness at the most difficult of times. Her family and friends will profoundly feel her enduring legacy. Instead of flowers, her family asks that contributions be made in her name to the Charlotte Library and the National Audubon Society.
She is survived by her sons Zachary Gerson and his wife Kristin (Ducrest) and their three children, Eloise, Samuel, and Lilly of Wynnewood, PA; Jacob Gerson and his wife Maria Gabriela Morgade Yllera of Valladolid, Spain and their son Manuel Gerson Morgade; Elijah and his wife Sara Johnson-Cardona and their children Louis and Santiago, of St. Louis, MO; and Abraham Gerson and his wife Alicia (Lorre) of Avignon, France;  her parents, Herbert Sheathelm and his wife Beverly Kelton of Tucson, AZ, and her mother Shirlee Sheathelm of Newington, CT; her brother Kurt Sheathelm and his wife Marjie of Rocky Hill, CT; her brother-in-law Elliot Gerson and his wife Jessica Herzstein of Washington D.C. and Aspen, CO; and her sister-in-law Annie Swanson and her husband Russ of Sherman, CT; many nieces and nephews as well as close extended family – Ellen and John O’Shaughnessy of Ellington, CT and Steve and Beth Gerson of Hampton Bays, NY.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I gave birth to my daughter Marleigh under frightening circumstances. What should have been the happiest moment of my life became the scariest. I was healthy before my pregnancy, and things seemed to be going smoothly. Until they weren’t.
In my final weeks of pregnancy, I developed symptoms I now know were due to preeclampsia, a dangerous and potentially life-threatening condition. I kept going to the hospital, sure something wasn’t right. But without a diagnosis, I was sent home again and again. It wasn’t until I insisted on more testing that I was finally admitted and diagnosed. By then, my condition had worsened. I lost a lot of blood during delivery and needed a transfusion. In those first few days, when I should have been soaking up the time and bonding with my newborn, I was exhausted and overwhelmed.
I’m here, and Marleigh is here, because NC Medicaid, North Carolina’s Medicaid program, made it possible for me to keep seeking care. Without it, I might not have gone back to the hospital. Without it, I may have tried to wait things out at home instead of advocating for myself. Medicaid meant I didn’t have to choose between the hospital bill and getting help for myself and my baby. It meant I could focus on surviving and caring for my daughter.
Today, Marleigh is thriving. I cherish every milestone, from her first laugh to trying her first foods and the first time she crawled. I know there will be so many more firsts to come. But I also know how close we came to missing them.
That’s why it’s so alarming to see Congress rushing forward on deep and harmful cuts to Medicaid. Last month, the House passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which will slash funding for Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars. And now, the Senate is poised to pass the bill, after somehow making the proposed cuts even more extreme. Here in North Carolina, more than 260,000 people could lose coverage through NC Medicaid. This is almost half the number of people who gained access to care through the state’s recent expansion of the program.
These aren’t just numbers. They’re moms, babies, grandparents and neighbors. These are people like me who simply needed help during a critical moment.
The bill would also impose harmful new work requirements on adults receiving Medicaid, raise out-of-pocket costs, and make families prove and reprove their eligibility over and over again. But these changes don’t make anyone healthier. They just create a bureaucracy that will just mean that more babies, parents, godparents, and other caregivers won’t get the care they need to survive, much less thrive.
Earlier this year, I traveled to Capitol Hill with my daughter as part of ZERO TO THREE’s Strolling Thunder event to advocate for programs like Medicaid, SNAP and Early Head Start that help families like mine. I joined 50 other families from across the country to make our voices heard. We’re not asking for special treatment. We’re asking Congress to protect the basics.
Families should not have to fight this hard to survive childbirth, recover or care for a newborn. Families need a system that supports us, not one that forces us to choose between our health and groceries and a roof over our babies’ heads.
Congress must reject Medicaid cuts and invest in the programs that give families a strong foundation. We deserve a country where every baby has the chance to grow up healthy and every parent has the support they need to care for them.
Medicaid saved my life and gave Marleigh the chance to live hers. It’s time for Congress to protect that promise for every family.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 11:13:05.930114
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-25 14:29:10+00:00,CT Mirror,NYC used ranked choice voting in its Dem mayoral primary. Here’s how it works,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/nyc-mayor-race-ranked-choice-voting/,"NYC is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that takes some explaining. Here’s how it works.","NEW YORK (AP) — New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.
Progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani declared victory in Tuesday’s primary, after former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo conceded the race in a stunning upset. Also in the race were several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander.
[RELATED: CT begins exploring ranked-choice voting merits, logistics]
Mamdani took a commanding position just hours after the polls closed. Unofficial results from the New York City’s Board of Elections showed Mamdani was ranked on more ballots than Cuomo. Mamdani was listed as the second choice by tens of thousands of more voters than Cuomo.
Ranked choice voting is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren’t forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.
Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter’s top choice doesn’t have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.
[RELATED: Yale students lobby lawmakers for ranked-choice voting in CT]
The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.
How does it work?
In New York City’s version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.
If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters — more than 50% — that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.
If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.
Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place — the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people — is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people’s votes are then redistributed to their second choices.
That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters’ third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.
Eleven candidates were on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams wasn’t one of them. He’s a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.
How long will this take?
The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn’t start right away.
Polls closed at 9 p.m. Tuesday. The ranked choice tabulations, however, won’t start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.
The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won’t be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.
This was the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.
Why do people like ranked choice?
One benefit is that nobody “wastes” their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.
Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn’t stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.
Another benefit is that it’s tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it’s possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.
That’s theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.
What are the negatives?
The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.
Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.
Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.
That’s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.
There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25176069210999-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 11:13:05.930114

Muller, a former Topeka City Council member, criticized the council's decision to repeal and amend DEI policies. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)When Tiffany Muller saw the Topeka City Council roll back parts of the city’s antidiscrimination protections, she felt a familiar weight settle in.
In 2004, Muller became the city’s first openly gay council member and faced relentless harassment from the Westboro Baptist Church, the notorious anti-LGBTQ+ group based in Topeka. Muller cast the deciding vote when the council passed an antidiscrimination ordinance — a measure that had repeatedly fallen short by just one vote for years.
“It’s still one of the proudest moments of my life — to have led that effort in 2004 and gotten it passed,” Muller said. “So to see the council so cavalierly throw that away two decades later is really frustrating.”
Muller, now president of the national advocacy group End Citizens United, is among several LGBTQ+ leaders who criticized the council’s decision last week to repeal and amend portions of the city’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
They said the move not only undermines hard-fought civil rights protections but sends a discouraging message to the community at a time when state and federal safeguards remain uncertain.
The council’s 5-1 vote eliminated the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and repealed city code requiring affirmative action plans for contractors. It also stripped language that once required hiring goals, diversity training programs and compliance reporting related to protected classes.
While nondiscrimination language remains in parts of the code, critics said the removal of specific protections put LGBTQ+ residents at risk — especially since the U.S. Supreme Court has not explicitly affirmed protections for gender identity or sexual orientation under federal law.
Kansas Rep. Susan Ruiz — one of the two first openly LGBTQ+ legislators — called the decision a setback for a city that had once been a leader in local civil rights efforts.
“It hits you at your core because you might already be rejected by your community, maybe even by your family — and now you’re getting it from your city, you’re getting it from your state,” Ruiz said. “It’s a horrible feeling to know that your civil rights are always on the chopping block.”
Ruiz said the concern goes beyond symbolism.
“I worry about younger people,” she said. “Why would they want to live in our state? Why would they want to live in Topeka?”
The vote comes in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump regarding federal funding. As a result, grant recipients are now required to avoid programs related to affirmative action or DEI.
  Topeka city attorney Amanda Stanley, seen at the July 11, 2023, city council meeting, said the city could lose federal funding unless it repealed DEI ordinances. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Topeka city attorney Amanda Stanley told council members if they didn’t recertify Housing and Urban Development funds for shelter programs by June 30, they could lose funding as early as July 1.
Stanley did not respond to an inquiry seeking clarification about the timeline for the funds.
Several council members expressed frustration about the decision but pointed to the potential loss of at-risk program funding as a driving factor.
“One thing that I know for sure is that the governing body — or the city of Topeka — is not out here looking to discriminate against anyone,” said council member Marcus Miller. “(We are) making sure that our language is clear, but something susceptible to do what we need to do as a city.”
Some residents, however, disagreed with the council’s interpretation and urged them to find alternative solutions.
“There are other cities that are not simply taking the bait. They are not focusing on the money. They are looking at the right thing to do,” said Topeka resident Glenda Overstreet Vaughn. “We can’t afford to be pawns, manipulated by the federal government’s funding chess game.”
Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, called the decision unnecessary and “deeply harmful.” She said the organization reached out to council members last month with alternative solutions that would maintain federal compliance while protecting local civil rights, but never received a response.
“They needlessly put LGBTQIA protections at risk with no explanation,” Stiehler said. “This vote was deeply harmful to the people of our community. We hope to work with them to bring back the local protections that were stripped away.”
Not all council members viewed the vote as final. Council member Spencer Duncan reminded residents that the code is a “living document” and said the council plans to revisit the ordinance at its July 8 meeting after hearing feedback from the community.
Both Ruiz and Muller said pursuing legal action against the federal grant restrictions would have sent a stronger message.
“We’ve seen other cities, states and institutions push back against these threats — and win in court,” Muller said. “So I don’t think repealing these critically important protections was their only option. The worst thing we can do is to just comply, because that doesn’t protect anyone — and it’s certainly not going to protect the Topeka community.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PA141022-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-25 11:13:05.930114

  Mayor Christopher Franklin, Helena-West Helena, Arkansas
First Judicial District Prosecutor Todd Murray asked ASP in June 2024 to investigate Franklin. A Special Investigations Unit (SIU) probe revealed the Helena-West Helena mayor had not filed taxes four of the past five years. 
Franklin was charged with four counts of Failure to Pay or File a Tax Return, a Class D felony. The investigation is ongoing and more information will be released as it becomes available, the release states. 
In late May, Franklin refused to resign as mayor after the City Council voted 6-0 that he step down. The resolution was a response to a profanity-laden video call between the mayor, his adult daughter and his adult niece that went viral online.
Council member Maxine Miller introduced the resolution to censure Franklin and call for his resignation “for conduct unbecoming of the office of mayor during a recent Facebook Live broadcast,” The Helena World reported.
Franklin told council members he was not leaving, and abruptly adjourned the meeting after the resolution vote despite a lengthy agenda. The World reported at the time that petitions were being circulated in Helena-West Helena seeking a recall election to remove the mayor.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Senate voted unanimously on June 18 to resume the federal Secure Rural Schools program, which sent millions of dollars to small Alaska schools each year until Congress failed to reauthorize it in 2023. 
Congress passed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act in 2000, which launched the program as a way to help logging towns cope with the loss of revenue caused by a slowdown in logging on nearby federal land.
In 2023, it directed more than $250 million to communities nationwide and over $12.6 million to Alaska towns. 
But in 2024, a reauthorization bill stalled in the House of Representatives, and the program ended. In the wake of that failure, some rural schools in Alaska, particularly in Southeast Alaska, have suffered significant budget cuts.
This spring, the Alaska Legislature voted by a 56-4 margin to approve a resolution that calls on Congress to renew the program.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, cosponsored a reauthorization bill, and the Senate approved it last week.
“If you’re a city manager building a budget or a school administrator looking at new hires, you need financial certainty. That’s why renewing the Secure Rural Schools program before funding lapses has been one of my top priorities in this Congress, and today was a crucial step in that process,” Murkowski said in a written statement. “I hope my colleagues in the House will quickly pass this legislation to provide stability for Alaska’s schools and local governments.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/uscapitoldarkskies-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 10:02:02.768263

That’s the basis on which 20 Democratic attorneys general, including Maine’s Aaron Frey, and one state governor, are contesting sweeping cuts to federal grants and aid in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration. The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.
But Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert—for the first time— that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the federal agencies, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an email Tuesday.
In addition to Frey, the other AGs who filed the complaint represent Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is also representing his state in the case.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general including South Carolina’s Alan Wilson, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision also came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid.
The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from private Bob Jones University. In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed 8-1 the IRS ruling that the private college in Greenville, South Carolina, was violating federal antidiscrimination laws by denying admission to applicants in interracial marriages and banning interracial dating among students. (Bob Jones didn’t regain its nonprofit status until 2017.)
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio active and retired educators will have less of a voice on the state’s retired teachers’ pension fund board under the proposed final budget. Amid legislators’ concerns of an alleged corruption scheme threatening the fund, they have decided to reduce the number of elected positions and add more political appointments.
In the nearly 600 amendments to the 5,500-page operating budget bill, the conference committee led by House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, and Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, included changes to the State Teachers Retirement System. The amendment was included and announced at about 1 a.m.
A provision in the bill would change the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected after seats are phased out over several years. Two of the educator seats will be for actives and only one retiree seat.
Each elected member will be able to finish their term, but once they term out, four of the seven seats will not be refilled. This means that once
Retiree Rudy Fichtenbaum and actives Michael Harkness and Chad Smith — the most recently elected members — would be the remaining seats as members term off.
Those four removed educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members. Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
Under this legislation, the treasurer would get two appointees, the legislative leaders get one each and one combined — equalling three, the chancellor of the Department of Higher Education gets one, and the governor and DEW get one each.
This provision was proposed by state Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, the chair of the Ohio Retirement Study Council. For months now, he has been evaluating the board makeup due to the controversy inside the fund.
“The state legislature established these pension systems and has an ongoing responsibility to ensure the long-term health of the fund for retired and active teachers,” Bird exclusively said. “The ongoing turmoil has clarified the need for the General Assembly to rebalance the Board composition.”
How we got here
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
A 14-page whistleblower memo given to Gov. Mike DeWine in May alleged a massive public corruption scandal brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
Attorney General Dave Yost soon after filed a lawsuit to remove former member Wade Steen and current Chair Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them.
The lawsuit accuses the pair of “colluding” with investment startup QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel, to secure a contract giving them 70% of the STRS assets — about $65 billion at the time. The memo accuses QED of helping to elect board members who may be more sympathetic to their proposal.
We have continued investigating the alleged scheme throughout the past year, resulting in an exclusive one-on-one interview with DeWine. He expressed his deep concerns following our April 2025 report, in which we revealed hundreds of text messages of the relationship between Steen and members of QED.
Steen and Fichtenbaum have continued to defend their innocence, arguing that Yost and DeWine are part of a “political scheme” to prevent educators who want more transparency and to change the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.” This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money, through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund. Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Steen and Metcalf, the men with the relationship at the center of the conversation, also spoke with me in response to the governor’s comments in their own Q&A that can be found here.
Removal
The removal of the board members has been debated for months now.
“The Ohio Retirement Study Council has a duty to inform and advise the state legislature, and we have done that regarding our view of the STRS Board composition,” Bird continued. “Many of my fellow colleagues in the legislature are supportive of this change, which we believe will bring stability to STRS. I believe that the Governor will support this update to the STRS Board composition, as it provides greater accountability to the appointing authorities on the Board — preventing conflicts of interest and ensuring the future health of the fund.”
Educators we have spoken to have argued that the removal of elected members of the board is anti-democratic.
Retired educator Mary Binegar, who doesn’t trust the “reform” faction of the board, still says that removing the teachers’ voices is a bad move.
“Whether we like the board members are there or not, we do have the opportunity to vote for them,” Binegar said in March. “I think it’s important for educators to have that sense that there are other educators watching out for them.”
Each of the dozens of educators we spoke to said that removing their perspective from the board will hurt the fund and cause teachers to feel isolated and unheard.
Teachers have brought up the fact that when Democrats took control of the Ohio Board of Education three years ago, the GOP lawmakers swiftly took away the vast majority of their power.
However, the Republican leaders had been debating taking away their power for years, even when the GOP controlled them, since the board either took too long to implement new laws or just ignored lawmakers, according to then-Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. The board also, instead of looking for a superintendent, debated culture war issues that they had no jurisdiction over.
Next steps
The legislation heads to each chamber for a vote. The budget deadline is at the end of June.
We will continue breaking down the massive budget bill in the coming days.

The MBTA has sued a union representing inspectors who work for the public transit agency, arguing it should be able to fire a supervisor who it says engaged in sexual and racial harassment.
The post MBTA sues union in effort to fire supervisor in misconduct case appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE MBTA HAS sued a union representing inspectors who work for the transit agency, arguing the T should be able to fire a supervisor who the agency says engaged in sexual and racial harassment. 
The complaint, filed in Suffolk Superior Court on June 9, details allegations of misconduct and the MBTA’s firing of the supervisor, Patrick Goggin, a former chief inspector. 
The OPEIU MBTA Inspector’s Union Local 600, of which Goggin is a member, fought the firing and took the transit agency to arbitration, a dispute resolution procedure allowed under the collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the union. The union won reinstatement for Goggin, leading to the MBTA’s lawsuit. 
After a hearing held over several days last year, an arbitrator declared in May that the T had “sufficiently proven” Goggin committed the misconduct in violation of the agency’s rules and zero-tolerance policies, and the T had “just cause” to discipline him, according to the MBTA’s complaint. 
But the arbitrator nonetheless ordered the T to reinstate the supervisor to his former position, or an equivalent one, without back pay, ruling that firing him was too severe a penalty. In doing so, the arbitrator “exceeded his authority” and the decision “violates public policy and is otherwise contrary to law and therefore unenforceable,” the MBTA’s attorneys argued in the complaint. 
An MBTA spokesman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. A lawyer for the union, Daniel Fogarty, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a union official. Goggin was unreachable for comment. 
The case is an example of the sort of outcome of the arbitration process, particularly in the public sector, that has drawn criticism from those who say it makes it too difficult to fire employees who have engaged in what appears to be egregious misconduct or poor performance. In a prominent recent example, a Boston police officer who was fired twice based on separate incidents still got his job back after taking the matter to arbitration. 
“It’s a real problem, a cost of union representation,” said Samuel Estreicher, director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at New York University. “If the union mounts a vigorous defense, the arbitrator will be reluctant to sustain the discharge unless the culprit is a serious repeat offender.” 
The T’s complaint attached the arbitrator’s summary of the two sides’ arguments in laying out his decision. The union argued the T “failed to prove” that Goggin made a sexual comment to a subordinate, and her version of what was said was “inconsistent and undermines her credibility,” according to the summary. Meanwhile, others who complained about Goggin, the summary of the union argument said, had “motive to advance false allegations” against him. 
The MBTA also didn’t produce sufficient evidence to establish that Goggin treated women of color differently, the union added. 
Goggin served as chief inspector on the T’s Red Line since 2018, a position of “significant responsibility,” according to the T. Chief inspectors manage crews, handle schedules, and respond to incidents and emergencies. 
A subordinate employee lodged a complaint in July 2022, alleging “she and other Black co-workers had been subjected to discriminatory and inappropriate behavior and harassment by Mr. Goggin on the basis of gender and race,” the T’s lawsuit said. 
T officials investigated the complaint and found that Goggin “made an inappropriate comment of a sexual nature about a female subordinate’s breasts … and that he treated female employees of color differently than others, holding them to stricter standards of conduct,” according to the complaint, which also cited “prior disciplinary history.” 
As part of the arbitration process, an arbitrator, John Marra, was hired after the T moved to fire Goggin. The arbitrator found Goggin’s denials “not credible,” and credited testimony from witnesses that Goggin would “make obscene gestures at work,” refer to his penis size, and call women “bitches,” according to the T’s lawsuit. 
But the arbitrator added that the T’s move to fire him was “too severe and not appropriate,” and ordered the agency to reinstate him. The arbitrator said there was “no evidence” that Goggin had been informed by management that his behavior was inappropriate and offensive, and that his job was in jeopardy.  
In its complaint, the T claimed that in a separate incident Goggin received a written warning in October 2020 after allegedly telling a Black female subordinate to get “[her] ass back on” on a train, and when she said she needed to use to restroom first, he allegedly said, “[d]o you need me to wipe it for you?” 
“By concluding that even though there was just cause to discipline Mr. Goggin for his proven and unremorseful violations of the MBTA’s anti-discrimination policies and other rules of behavioral conduct, Mr. Goggin should be reinstated to his supervisory position, the Arbitrator has fashioned a remedy that is inconsistent with the MBTA’s legal obligations to take prompt and effective measures to effectively correct and address discriminator harassment,” the T’s complaint said. 
Marra, the arbitrator, concluded that the T “properly conducted” an investigation, seeking statements from other T employees. “The Union makes a compelling case that the arbitrator should not rely on hearsay evidence,” Marra wrote. “However, in the interest of a fair result, arbitrators may consider hearsay evidence in order to obtain the most complete view of the facts.” 
The hearsay was corroborated by testimony and witness accounts, Marra added.  
Goggin’s “actions fell short of the high standards” expected of a chief inspector and showed no remorse, Marra said. But firing him is “too severe,” given his work history, and nine years of employment, during which Goggin earned several promotions.

Ohio legislative leaders say a compromise has been reached on the state’s operating budget — sharing early details that the wealthy will get a tax cut and the Cleveland Browns get hundreds of millions for their new stadium. Despite efforts, there has been no word on education funding as of Tuesday evening.
The lawmakers have been writing like they’re running out of time. Because they are. The legislation must be passed by the end of June.
“I think all big remaining issues are resolved,” Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said.
Stewart gave some details before the legislation is officially announced.
The Senate leaders had non-negotiables that Stewart had to deal with.
One of those Senate non-negotiables is its 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. That money was made up by cutting funding for Ohio House lawmakers’ community projects. Stewart said last week that those provisions were priorities to him. He got them back in.
“We found a way to give that important tax relief to Ohioans while also doing a lot of the priorities that we had here in the house,” he said.
He said that the House is agreeing with the Senate to rescind an awful lot of small income and sales tax exemptions.
“Individually, they’re it’s not that much money at issue, but when you put them all cumulatively together — it’s a sizeable amount of money that we are going to return to the state,” he said.
Other than that, the lawmakers would be shifting a pool of money from interest earned on state funds and different accounts to the general revenue fund, he added.
The lawmakers also agreed on a plan for the Cleveland Browns’ new stadium.
They ultimately opted to draw millions from the unclaimed property fund, providing a cash grant for the Browns using other people’s money. The state is holding $4.8 billion in unclaimed funds from old bank accounts, uncashed checks, utility deposits, life insurance payouts, retirement savings accounts and stocks and bonds.
Stewart said the final budget proposal calls for the state to take ownership of $1.7 billion of that money. Lawmakers are earmarking $600 million for the Browns and putting $400 million into a special sports and culture fund, which could pay for other projects.
Democrats had not seen the budget as of Tuesday evening. New House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, said that the inclusion of the flat tax will disproportionately hurt lower-income and middle-class families.
“Because of the choices that the Majority has made, they are choosing to serve a sliver of the state, and it’s the sliver that needs the least support,” Isaacsohn said.
Stewart said the House is making sure that social programs will be included.
“We’re still going to take care of all the major programs I think Ohioans expect us to do,” the chair said.
One of the main differences between the House and the Senate was how much they allocated to public schools. Both cut hundreds of millions from the expected budget, but the Senate restored the current funding formula and gave $100 million back. Democrats aren’t optimistic that additional education support will be given.
“We are also working to fix as many bad things as we can,” House Finance Committee Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, said.
The final budget should be voted out by the end of the week.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator. Aerial support provided by SouthWings.)Bayou Sauvage Urban National Wildlife Refuge, an area of marshland at the eastern edge of New Orleans, is — in biological terms — considered an area full of wetlands.
One of the last remaining marshes around lakes Ponchartrain and Borgne, the wildlife refuge contains estuaries and freshwater lagoons, where young fish, crabs and hundreds of species of birds find safe haven and food. Visitors and locals kayak in the bayous and hike through the marsh, while the city itself enjoys an added layer of flood protection provided by the presence of nearby wetlands.
But Bayou Sauvage no longer fits the legal definition of protected wetland under a new Louisiana law. The new definition excludes areas surrounded by levees, now called “fastlands.”  Also excluded are wetlands that are naturally separated from what’s known as Waters of the United States (WOTUS), the navigable rivers and lakes protected under the federal Clean Water Act.
Much of Bayou Sauvage was sealed behind levees in the 1950s, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for environmental advocacy group Healthy Gulf.
“A reading of this law … could say that all of Bayou Sauvage, thousands of acres of wetlands, are now not protected,” Rota said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Act 105 became law when Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed it June 8, making Louisiana the latest state to roll back protections from development in isolated wetlands. The new policy is inspired by the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. Justices ruled, in a 5-4 vote, the EPA does not have the authority under the Clean Water Act to require a federal permit to dredge and fill wetlands isolated from WOTUS.
While Bayou Sauvage is still protected as a national wildlife refuge, other wetland areas with strong environmental value may now see openings to unfettered development under Louisiana law.
Tennessee and North Carolina have also redefined wetlands in their state laws following Sackett. Though the three states differ in how they now regulate building in wetland areas, all have the same goal: allowing more wetland development.
Jumping the gun
William Sutton, a wildlife ecologist and assistant professor at Tennessee State University, said isolated wetlands in his state play a vital role in preserving biodiversity and habitat for species such as the mole salamander, acting as “islands” of habitat spread across the region. It’s evolved in conjunction with isolated wetlands like those in Tennessee, said Sutton, and can’t just pack up and leave when development moves in.
“It’s not like these animals all of a sudden shift their life history to live in these different types of wetlands once you remove these isolated wetlands,” he said. “Once you remove that wetland, these animals can’t adapt to other wetlands that have things like high fish abundance or also things like high heavy metals or high nutrient loads.”
Rota said isolated wetlands areas are “still vital to the environment.” They can soak up millions of gallons of stormwater and runoff that would otherwise flood homes, he said.
The Environmental Protection Agency had previously considered isolated wetlands to be under their jurisdiction, requiring permits to fill or otherwise develop them. But the Sackett decision held that only wetlands with a continuous surface connection to WOTUS fall under Clean Water Act protections from draining and filling.
Proponents of Mid-Barataria diversion warn against abandoning wetlands   

Clear guidance as to what “continuous” surface water connection means is something the Sackett decision didn’t provide. The EPA, now tasked with rewriting the definition of WOTUS, recently held a series of listening sessions across the country to gather guidance from stakeholders.
But Louisiana and other states are not waiting for a new federal definition.
Wetland advocates and law experts are concerned that approving state legislation that redefines wetlands before the EPA comes up with a national definition is hasty, with the potential to introduce flooding risks and water quality issues in newly developed areas.
“We would prefer that they wait until the EPA makes a clear definition,” said Angelle Bradford with the Sierra Club’s Louisiana-based Delta chapter.
“We are constantly fighting and worrying about flooding in coastal Louisiana,” Rota said. “Wetlands that are cut off by levees that are filled in, that’s going to reduce our flood protection and our storm resilience, not to mention reducing vital habitat.”
Basin battles
Throughout the Mississippi River Basin, states are taking different approaches to governing wetlands post-Sackett.
What might be biologically considered a wetland, using indicators such as the type of soil and plants in the area as well as water saturation on and below the surface, is now different from what is legally defined as a protected wetland area in Louisiana.
The state’s new law attempts to restrict the legal definition of wetlands to only cover areas with a “continuous” connection to rivers, lakes or other navigable bodies of water. Areas isolated from navigable waters or cut off by levees are now considered “fastlands” under the law, and don’t require a government permit to build on them — even if they have the biological features of a wetland.
But just like the Sackett decision, Louisiana’s law doesn’t clearly define what “continuous” means. Environmentalists say this sows confusion.
“It just doesn’t provide people with a clear understanding of what is going to be protected and what is not,” said Brennan Spoor, staff attorney with the environmental advocacy group Atchafalaya Basinkeeper in Louisiana. The new law “gives too many outlets” for “lack of consistency” in enforcing which areas need permits and which don’t, he added.
The new measure also tries to restrict the definition of wetlands under what critics say is the wrong part of Louisiana law. The new definition falls under the Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, but in question is a developer’s ability to fill a wetland, not pollute it. The state relies on the federal Clean Water Act’s rules to regulate wetland fill and for now the federal rules are up in the air.
“If this is meant to narrow Louisiana law, it can’t without federal approval,” said Mark Davis, a Tulane University environmental law professor.
Louisiana’s new law also tries to erase the need for permits to build in wetlands cut off by existing or future legal levee construction. Even if that levee is built illegally, there’s a possibility that after-the-fact permitting will disqualify more wetlands from protections, Spoor said.
“It’s just going to be whatever a judge thinks, and a judge in some parish that supports wetlands might feel differently than a judge who thinks all industry should get to do whatever they want,” Spoor said.
Rota also worries the law could spur illegal construction or pollution by infusing “misguided” attempts to narrow the state’s definition of wetlands.
“If it’s not clear what a fastland is, I think that’ll give people a lot more impetus to just [decide] ‘if in doubt, dump, and then ask for forgiveness later,’” said Rota.
States start to update regulations
In Tennessee, relatively robust state wetland protections were repealed earlier this year. The state used to require developers to mitigate new development on wetlands as a tradeoff for building in swampy, water-saturated areas. Instead, it now uses a scoring system for isolated wetlands, classifying them into one of four categories: low-quality, moderate-quality, high-quality or artificial wetlands.
‘Low-quality’ isolated wetlands under one acre don’t need a permit to drain or fill, while ‘moderate-quality’ wetlands need to be under a quarter-acre. ‘Artificial wetlands’— created by either humans or animals — aren’t subject to any regulatory oversight for draining or filling.
About 80% of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands are smaller than one acre, said Grace Stranch, CEO of Tennessee environmental group Harpeth River Conservancy.
While regulations for building in low or moderate quality wetlands increase with their size – and “high quality” wetlands are subject to stricter standards – Sutton said magnitude doesn’t really correlate directly with a wetland’s value to the ecosystem.
“Isolated wetlands can be very small but can have really, really rich biodiversity,” he said.
Smaller, isolated wetlands are also harder to create artificially than larger systems, so it’s difficult to restore them after they are damaged, Sutton said.
“There’s really no way to guarantee it because the hydrology is just so hard to control in these wetlands, once you actually have to come back and reconstruct.”
‘A living laboratory’: An accidental delta taught Louisiana scientists how to rebuild wetlands

The law now also gives Tennessee’s conservation commissioner a lot of power to independently expand acreage requirements for low- to moderate-quality wetlands. If the commissioner decides to broaden the law to larger parcels, it could leave the final fate of even more wetland areas uncertain.
Developers also no longer have to consider the cumulative impact of altering these wetlands on surrounding areas or water quality before dredging or filling them.
“Wetlands are directly connected to our river sources,” said Stranch, adding that many wetlands geographically isolated from one another can be connected in other ways, such as hydrologically or ecologically.
“They’re just not connected on the surface, and so that’s one of our biggest issues,” she said.
Water also flows across state boundaries; one state with stronger wetland protections may be impacted by things like nutrient runoff or increased floodwaters as a result of a different state’s’ wetland protection policy.
“It opens the floodgates,” said Jon D. Bumpus, spokesman for the environmental advocacy group TennGreen Land Conservancy.
“Going from a state that very staunchly protects wetlands to sending the message to developers … that this land is no longer off limits just sets a really, really dangerous immediate precedent that’s going to change a whole lot of things very quickly,” Bumpus said.
While there are ways to promote responsible development with tools like land easements and buffer zones built between houses and wetland areas, Bumpus said the new law doesn’t promote these types of adaptive strategies.
North Carolina, where rivers in its western region feed into the Mississippi River Basin, rolled back wetland protections so that only wetlands with WOTUS connection qualify for protection from being dredged or filled.
Lawmakers in the North Carolina General Assembly overrode a veto from Gov. Roy Cooper in order to update their law, which specifies the new EPA definition of wetlands, once established, will replace the state definition.
Other states in the Mississippi Basin, such as Indiana, have also passed laws to narrow the definition of wetlands and strip protections.
Some states, including Minnesota and Illinois, have extended wetlands protections.
‘The Light Switch,” Episode 5: Wading through the politics of wetlands restoration

Wisconsin has extended protection for non-federal, isolated wetlands, but the state’s authority doesn’t extend to federal wetland areas. That means the Prairie Pothole Region, comprising thousands of small wetlands in the state, and other isolated marshes are left without Clean Water Act protection after Sackett.
Given its history of flood control issues and valuable wetland habitat, Davis suggested Louisiana would be better off among the states expanding protections rather than rolling them back.
Louisiana Sen. Michael Fesi, who introduced Louisiana’s legislation to redefine wetlands, thinks easing wetlands regulation post-Sackett could incentivize levee construction and aid in flood protection. But legal experts and environmental advocates say that’s a red herring.
“One of the easiest ways to help with flood protection is to be careful about what you build in flood-prone areas,” Davis said, adding that tools such as building codes are an easier legal avenue to codify flood protection.
“Louisiana should not be one of those states that says, ‘Well, the Supreme Court says the Clean Water Act doesn’t apply as widely as it had before, so we shouldn’t do anything either,’” he said. “The real question is: What needs doing and how do we do it?”

The Missouri Supreme Court last week issued a warrant for the execution of Lance Shockley, who recently exhausted his state and federal appeals and was convicted of the 2005 murder of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr. 
The court announced the execution date on Tuesday afternoon.
Graham was shot and killed in his rural Carter County driveway. Graham had been investigating Shockley’s role in a fatal drunk driving accident, which the prosecution argued gave Shockley the motive to kill him. Shockley has insisted he’s innocent.
A jury in 2009 found Shockley guilty of first-degree murder. But in the punishment phase of Shockley’s trial, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on whether he should be executed. 
In most states with active death penalty laws, that deadlock would have resulted in the defendant being sentenced to life without parole. 
But under Missouri law, Shockley’s penalty case then got handed off to a Carter County circuit judge who, after independent review, sentenced him to death.
Group of Republican lawmakers raise concerns about Missouri death penalty

Only Missouri and Indiana give judges the authority to unilaterally decide on the death penalty, a fact that over the years has drawn scrutiny from those who believe it places too much power in the hands of one person and denies defendants their constitutional rights to trial by jury and protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
In 2023 Amber McLaughlin was executed because of the unilateral decision of a trial judge. Several retired judges opposed the execution in a letter to then-Gov. Mike Parson, calling it a “flaw in Missouri’s capital sentencing scheme.”
An analysis included in an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court organized by the national nonprofit watchdog group Project on Government Oversight found Missouri judges, who are elected in most parts of the state, have been more likely than juries to impose death sentences. 
In cases without jury deadlock, from 2000 to 2018, the jury imposed a death sentence in 64% of cases. But in deadlocked cases with a trial judge making the decision, the death penalty was imposed in 86% of cases, according to the brief.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers in recent years have filed legislation to eliminate judge-imposed executions, but the proposals have made little progress.

Shockley has denied his involvement in Graham’s death, citing the lack of physical evidence or eyewitnesses. His attorneys have tried unsuccessfully to get evidence from the crime scene tested for DNA and have argued the police failed to investigate other possible suspects.
“Shockley’s defense at trial was that he was not the one who killed Sgt. Graham,” his attorney wrote in a brief last month. “Shockley has never wavered in that position.” 
His attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The prosecution said Shockley borrowed a relative’s car the afternoon of Graham’s death and the car matched the description witnesses gave of one parked near Graham’s house the afternoon of his murder. Prosecutors also argued the recovered bullets may have been consistent with the caliber of a rifle Shockley owned. No murder weapon was found.
The Missouri Supreme Court, responding to the defense’s argument that the death penalty was excessive or disproportionate punishment for a case relying on circumstantial proof, said courts have previously upheld death sentences in cases hinging on strong circumstantial evidence and here, “the circumstantial evidence was strong.”
Shockley would be the first person executed in Missouri this year, barring intervention from Gov. Mike Kehoe or the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Last year, Missouri executed four people. It was one of four states responsible for 76% of executions that year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_9656-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 10:02:02.768263

California courts have failed to report hundreds of vehicular manslaughter convictions to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles over the past five years, allowing deadly drivers to improperly keep their licenses, a CalMatters investigation has found.
Drivers like Marvin Salazar.
Salazar was convicted in May 2023 for felony vehicular manslaughter after a crash that killed his friend, court records show. Under California law, that’s supposed to be an automatic three-year loss of driving privileges.
But the Los Angeles County Superior Court didn’t report the conviction to the DMV. Two months later, the agency issued Salazar his most recent license. Since then, he has received two speeding tickets and been in another collision, records show. 

Gaudy Lemus, whose son, 18-year-old Joseph Ramirez, died in the crash: “How can he keep driving? We wanted consequences for him. Remove his driver’s license.”

Investigative reporters Lauren Hepler and Robert Lewis uncovered the error and others like it by cross-checking convictions in vehicular manslaughter cases against motorists’ DMV records, as part of an ongoing investigation. Earlier this year, CalMatters reported that the agency routinely allows people with horrifying histories of dangerous driving — including fatal crashes, DUIs and numerous tickets — to keep driving. 
When courts were alerted to the problem, officials at most county court systems responded quickly, thanked CalMatters’ reporters for telling them, acknowledged the mistake and indicated that they would report the convictions to the DMV.

Tara Leal, the court executive officer in Kern County: “They were errors on our part. I’m not going to sugarcoat it.”

The reporting is already forcing change. So far, nearly 200 drivers who’ve killed have had their driving privileges suspended or revoked as a result of CalMatters’ story, updated DMV reports show. While some already had a separate license suspension, 70 appear to have had a valid license before the agency took action in response to the story.

Dems attempt to counter masked federal agents

Amid reports of federal agents conducting immigration raids while driving unmarked vehicles, covering their faces and wearing vests emblazoned with the words “police,” another Democratic legislator is proposing a measure that would make it easier to identify California law enforcement officers.
On Monday Pasadena Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez introduced Senate Bill 805 to require local and state officers to “visibly display identification” when carrying out their duties. The measure would also prohibit bounty hunters from engaging in immigration enforcement.
Though California can’t compel the federal government to obey state laws, the bill would authorize local law enforcement to request identification from someone — such as federal immigration enforcement agents — if there is a reasonable suspicion they are impersonating a police officer.
Pérez’s proposal follows another bill unveiled last week by two Bay Area Democratic senators, which would prohibit local law enforcement officers from covering their faces. Peace Officers Research Association of California, a statewide law enforcement organization, came out against that bill, calling it “ill-conceived” and “unnecessary.”



Report: Only a few companies moved HQs in last decade

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
Less than 2% of California’s 47,000 companies moved their headquarters out of state from 2011 to 2021, and the state only lost 3.9% of its jobs during that period.
That’s according to a new report from the Public Policy Institute of California. The report also found, as CalMatters wrote last year, that companies that relocated their headquarters retained many employees in the state. 
Still, there’s no denying that headquarters exits are trending upward, and that California taxes and regulations play a role, the report said.
About 150 headquarters left in 2011 compared with more than 200 in 2021. But also, over that decade, the report said about 7,250 headquarters opened in the state, and that “new headquarters tend to have many fewer jobs at the outset.” 
David Neumark, an economics professor and one of the report’s authors, said that while “high-profile events make the news,” smaller company openings barely make the news.
The most recent example: John Paul Mitchell Systems, the shampoo maker, is moving its headquarters from Beverly Hills to Texas.

Marvin Salazar was convicted in May 2023 for killing his 18-year-old friend Joseph Ramirez, who was in the passenger seat when Salazar gunned his car, lost control and slammed into a tree, court records show. Under California law, the state should have taken away Salazar’s driving privileges for at least three years.
But the Los Angeles County Superior Court didn’t report the conviction to the DMV. Two months later, the agency issued Salazar his most recent license. Since then, he’s gotten two speeding tickets and has been in another collision, records show. 
“How can he keep driving?” said Gaudy Lemus, Ramirez’s mother. “We wanted consequences for him. Remove his driver’s license.” 
LA court officials belatedly reported the manslaughter conviction to the DMV last month, after CalMatters discovered the failure and asked about the case. It was only then that the state sent Salazar a notice revoking his driving privileges, records show.

CalMatters uncovered the error and others like it by cross-checking convictions in vehicular manslaughter cases against motorists’ DMV records, as part of an ongoing investigation. Earlier this year, we reported that the agency routinely allows drivers with horrifying histories of dangerous driving — including fatal crashes, DUIs and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways. 
But this isn’t just a DMV issue. Reporters identified about 400 cases from 2019 to 2024 in which the drivers’ convictions weren’t listed on their driving records, largely because the courts failed to report that information. The review wasn’t comprehensive; records were unavailable or incomplete in a number of counties.
In Los Angeles, about one-third of all convictions in manslaughter cases we identified were missing from drivers’ records. In Santa Clara County, it was half. We found no missing convictions in Orange County.
In response to our questions, 32 county courts so far have reported more than 275 missing convictions to the DMV. As a result, nearly 200 drivers who’ve killed have had their driving privileges suspended or revoked, updated DMV reports for these drivers show. While some already had a separate license suspension, 70 appear to have had a valid license before the agency took action in response to our reporting.
County courts, law enforcement and the DMV have a long history of poor communication that dates to the days of paper records. Today, court administrators blame the breakdowns on a mix of human error and technological bugs.

Chris Orrock, a spokesperson for the DMV, said the agency sends out revocation and suspension notices “as soon as we’re notified.” 
Even without a conviction, the DMV does have the discretion to strip a driver of their license for a fatal crash. We reported earlier this year that the agency often doesn’t use that power.
But in many cases, there is no discretion. State law, for example, requires the agency to revoke a driver’s license for at least three years after a felony vehicular manslaughter conviction.
As a result of the delayed reporting by the courts, some drivers could end up losing their licenses for far less than three years. That’s because the DMV typically enforces the sanction from the date of the conviction, not the date the court communicates it to the agency. 
Salazar’s current driving record shows him eligible to reapply for a license next spring — three years after his conviction but just a year after records show the state took action to revoke his driving privileges. 
His attorney declined to comment on his driving record but said Salazar did everything the court required.

For Lemus, the months after her son died in Salazar’s car were a blur. The loss was haunting, coming just as the teenager had decided to pursue a career building tiny homes for the homeless. 
She started having such bad panic attacks that she moved to a new city and switched jobs, unable to bear the drive to work through the intersection where the crash occurred. Her 25-year-old daughter still refuses to drive at all.
Lemus said she didn’t initially want Salazar to go to prison, “because it was an accident.” Now, she wonders whether that was a mistake. 
“I don’t want another family to go through whatever we went through,” Lemus said. 
A series of errors leads to reporting failures
State law has long required courts to report vehicle-related convictions to the DMV, including for speeding, DUI and vehicular manslaughter. The agency then puts the violations on a motorist’s driving record and, if necessary, suspends their license.
Last month, CalMatters reporters sent hundreds of names and case numbers to dozens of courts throughout the state and asked why convictions from vehicular manslaughter cases didn’t appear on drivers’ records. Most courts responded to questions quickly, thanked us for telling them, acknowledged the mistake and indicated that they would report the convictions to the DMV.
“They were errors on our part. I’m not going to sugarcoat it,” said Tara Leal, the court executive officer in Kern County, where we found 22 missing convictions.
In many counties, court staff simply neglected to send the information to the DMV.
Court clerks typically enter convictions into a case management system. Many courts use a system that has a tab for them to click on to transmit the information to the DMV.
Vehicle code violations like speeding tickets and DUIs clearly need to go to the DMV, court officials said. But most penal code violations, including offenses like robbery and assault, do not. Vehicular manslaughter is a penal code violation.
Heather Pugh, the Yuba County Superior Court executive officer, confirmed that her court should have reported conviction information to the DMV for eight cases CalMatters flagged. “To address that, we will reach out to the DMV to provide training to our staff on reporting requirements,” she said. “Additionally, we have instituted manual reviews of reportable non-vehicle code convictions to ensure they have been properly reported.”
Similarly, Fresno County’s director of court operations, Vidal Fernandez, acknowledged “the element of human error” in his court not reporting a half-dozen convictions in recent years. After realizing the problem, he said, staff checked further back, to 2015, identified an additional 17 cases and sent those convictions to the DMV as well.
Other counties have their computers essentially programmed to send conviction information to the DMV when clerks update the disposition information on a case, in theory taking human error out of the equation. But in response to questions from CalMatters, some administrators discovered that the programs were missing certain codes and had failed to function as intended.
“Ultimately it’s our responsibility,” said Jake Chatters, the court executive officer in Placer County, where a coding issue kept the court’s system from reporting two manslaughter cases.
In other courts, convictions were apparently reported, but there was some mistake in the information sent — like an incorrect birth date or a missing digit in a license number — and the DMV kicked the report back with an error message. Administrators said clerks are supposed to fix any errors and resubmit the information to the DMV, but in some cases that didn’t happen.
The result of the patchwork process is that even convictions from some of the most high-profile traffic deaths in recent years were missing from drivers’ records.
A deadly street race that grabbed international attention 
Ricardo Aguilar was racing his Dodge Challenger Hellcat in South Los Angeles one December afternoon in 2021, according to the Los Angeles Times, when he struck and killed a pedestrian — Arian Rahbar, a 21-year-old USC student and aspiring medical researcher.
Rahbar’s father, Sam, summarized the void left by his only child. “Without Arian, life as we know it has ceased to exist,” he told a judge.
The story made global headlines amid a spike in traffic deaths in Los Angeles and other California cities. Aguilar was convicted of felony vehicular manslaughter in 2023, court records show. But until a few weeks ago, that was never reflected in his state driving record.
In the section of his DMV report where collisions and traffic violations are supposed to show up, there was instead this message: “NONE TO REPORT.”
His driver’s license was still listed as valid.

It was only in May, after CalMatters asked the LA court for an explanation, that officials reported his and more than 100 other convictions to the DMV as required. Aguilar’s license is now listed as revoked. 
Aguilar’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.
Rahbar’s friend and former high school tennis teammate Ashwin Yedavalli was saddened and frustrated all over again to learn about the court error that allowed Rahbar’s killer to keep his license. 
Yedavalli, now 25, lives in Long Beach and still stops by the crash scene when he’s nearby. He helped organize a tennis tournament in his friend’s memory, and he said it’s unfair that the legal system failed to deliver on fundamental consequences for his death.
“It’s basically been brushed off,” Yedavalli said. “What about Arian’s life and legacy?”
A decades-long failure to communicate
This is not a new problem.
In the early 1990s, the California DMV was so concerned about getting timely and accurate reports from courts and law enforcement that it produced an educational video called “The Traffic Citation Trail.”
Frank Zolin, the agency’s director at the time, sat behind a desk wearing a crisp suit and chunky glasses, his silver hair swept to the side, to deliver the film’s key message: “We cannot achieve traffic safety without effective teamwork between local law enforcement, the courts and DMV.” 
The film goes on to tell the fictionalized story of a reckless young driver who is able to avoid a license suspension because a ticket wasn’t reported to the DMV. In an early scene, the young man rushes to the mailbox to intercept a letter from the agency before his parents can see it.
“They told me four tickets means bye-bye license. There’s only three tickets here,” the driver says in surprise as he reads a warning letter from the state. “The one I got more than a month ago isn’t even here. … It’s party time tonight.”
In a tragic, real-life twist, the actor who played the motorist was killed by a drunken driver more than a decade later. And communication continued to be an issue. 


Robert Bullock worked at the DMV for more than three decades. In that time, he said, drivers would sometimes come in wanting to know whether they could renew their license, despite a conviction.
“We’d pull up the record and it wasn’t there,” said Bullock, who retired in 2019. He said he would tell them, “The court has screwed up, and you kind of got a freebie.”
Technology has, of course, improved from the era of grainy ’90s videos. Back then, police drove boxy sedans and held walkie-talkies the size of bricks. DMV clerks picked through mounds of paper forms, copying information into clunky gray computers with white text on black screens.
Today, at courthouses equipped with online records and modern digital tools, some administrators said they’re upgrading to a new case management system that should ensure conviction reporting is automated. Others said they’re going to do more training and manual checks to make sure the information is sent to the DMV.
In Los Angeles — one of the nation’s biggest county court systems, where we sent a list of 150 convictions that appeared to be missing from driver records — administrators declined an interview request. Instead, they emailed a statement from Rob Oftring, the court’s chief communications and external affairs officer: 
“The Court continues to work expeditiously to identify ways to ensure the successful electronic transmittal of all abstract of judgments to the DMV from its case management systems. This includes additional manual checks to identify in advance technical issues that prevent an abstract from being sent to the DMV. This also includes ensuring all criminal courthouse locations timely process their queues for transmittal and additional mandatory training for court staff.”
A trail of disappointment
For someone like Angie Brey, who’s had to confront a system that often treats deadly crashes as accidents rather than crimes, the promises of change sound hollow.   
She lost her partner and the father of her son, Gregory Turnage, on Mother’s Day in 2021. That’s when wealth manager Timothy Hamano drove onto a sidewalk and hit the 41-year-old Turnage, according to records prosecutors filed in court. Hamano had been drinking beer on the golf course and a bloody mary at lunch in San Francisco before the crash, his wife later told police. 
Hamano pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run early last year. He received virtually no time behind bars after getting credit for wearing an ankle monitor at home while the case was open. The conviction should have prompted the state to revoke Hamano’s license, but the Alameda County court didn’t report it.

“They essentially let him get away with murder, in our minds,” Brey said. “The fact that they didn’t even take away his license … is just mind-blowing.” 
A spokesperson, Paul Rosynsky, said the Alameda court reports hundreds of criminal convictions to the DMV every month, but he acknowledged that staff had missed sending two for manslaughter in recent years, including the Hamano case.
Hamano’s license appears to have been valid as recently as May 7, when DMV records show he got in another collision. (The records don’t detail who was at fault or the severity.) 
The agency sent Hamano a notice on May 28 that his driving privileges were revoked, following CalMatters’ inquiries.
Hamano’s attorney, Colin Cooper, said his client “is traumatized by what he did” and will never forgive himself. Hamano didn’t drive while the case was open and drove afterward only because he had a valid license and insurance, Cooper said. Hamano stopped driving after getting the revocation letter from the DMV, he said. 
Brey said holding drivers accountable for death is the least the state can do. She said she worries every day, when their son has to cross a busy intersection to get to school, that history will repeat itself.
“If somebody can come up on the sidewalk and kill my partner,” she said, “it just makes me really scared for my son.”

Five years after COVID shut down most California high schools, today’s college  students describe a difficult transition to adulthood, marked by fear, loss and a lack of preparation.


As the world settled into pandemic life, students who graduated from high school during the COVID-19 crisis started new chapters of their lives in social and academic seclusion.
Many spent their senior year on Zoom, without homecomings, proms or graduations. They struggled to pass classes and navigate college applications. And they entered college with gaps in study skills and anxiety about social interactions.
They spent their first year of college — typically a time of discovery — in online classes or alone in dorm rooms. Now, some are graduating from college, while others simply gave up. 
Across California students grappled with transitioning to college during the pandemic. The challenges were magnified in the Inland Empire, where only about a quarter of all adults hold four-year degrees, compared to 37% statewide.
“I felt really lonely, and it was really, really stressful at that time,” said Maribel Gamez-Reyes, A UC Riverside student from Inglewood.
Holes in their education
Especially for students who are the first in their families to attend college, what should have been their moment of triumph became months of tension. Some questioned whether they even belonged on a college campus, said UC Riverside Dean of Students Christine Mata. 
“During lockdown students weren’t able to bond and build connections to the institution, or even access support structures,” she said.
Their academic shortfalls and social isolation took a toll. UC Riverside found that math and writing skills were lower among the students who graduated from high school during the pandemic than for previous high school graduates.
In 2019, before COVID, about 13% of incoming freshmen entered UC Riverside at the lowest math level. In 2020 about 20% of freshmen — the class that lost nearly half its senior year to the pandemic — fell into the lowest math tier.
The 2021 class of high school graduates saw the percentage of low-performing math students tick up even more, to 22%. Those students had spent half their junior year and nearly all their senior year in remote learning. 
Likewise, 25% of freshmen entered the university at the lowest writing level in 2019. In 2020 32% fell into the bottom tier. The following year 29% of incoming students started at the lowest writing level. 
Math and English levels among incoming freshmen have improved in the past couple of years, university data show.

Grade inflation in high school contributed to those pandemic-era gaps, said Lesley Davidson-Boyd, associate vice president of California State University, San Bernardino. Some high school seniors graduated at the time with stellar grades but below-average test scores in math and English, she said. 
“There were a lot of holes in their education,” she said. “There were vital pieces that were missing.”
The federal government sent schools billions in extra pandemic funding, but much of California’s higher education money was not spent on helping students catch up academically.
California received about $34 billion in pandemic aid to education, with about $10 billion of that dedicated to colleges and universities, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Of that, $4 billion was direct aid to students, for help with tuition and other college expenses.
Institutions got $5.3 billion and spent some of that on technology to accommodate remote learning. But much of it went to replacing lost revenue, which administrators said backfilled losses from campus and dormitory closures, and enrollment declines.

Enrollment also took a hit at some California colleges and universities, including many Inland Empire campuses. While enrollment in the University of California system overall has climbed steadily since 2020, it remained flat at UC Riverside since 2020. In the decade before the pandemic, its four-year graduation rate climbed from less than 50% to 67%. But that slid to 60% for the class that started in 2020.
California State Universities’ enrollment numbers dropped during the pandemic, and while admissions finally started rebounding system-wide, it has continued to decline at Cal State San Bernardino from more than 20,000 in 2019 to less than 18,000 in 2024. Four-year graduation rates at Cal State San Bernardino had nearly doubled, from about 13% in 2009, to 25% in 2019, before dropping slightly for the class that started during the first year of the pandemic, in 2020.
Enrollment at the California Community College system fell sharply during the pandemic, but has rebounded throughout the state, including the Inland Empire.
Adriana Banda: Playing catch-up
Pandemic graduates who did go to college often played catch-up in their first year, trying to recover academic skills they lost during remote learning.
For Adriana Banda, pandemic education was a lonely exercise in perseverance. Desert Hot Springs High School offered students the chance to go back in person on limited class schedules, with social distancing precautions, but some of Banda’s family members faced medical risks, so it was a “no-brainer” to stay home and learn remotely, she said.
“I had to learn on my own,” said Banda, now 22. “I honestly didn’t learn much that year. I was just trying to get through high school.”

For years she had looked forward to senior milestones — prom, grad night, a senior sunset gathering and weekends with friends — but she watched them fall away as COVID-19 persisted.
“Having all of my senior experiences taken away from me was really disappointing and discouraging,” she said.
Banda plodded through Zoom classes and graduated high school in 2021. She became the first in her family to go to college when she enrolled at Cal State San Bernardino’s Palm Desert campus. 
“Transitioning into college was honestly really hard, especially after coming from a year of remote learning,” she said. “I think during that year I lost the foundational skills I had in school.”
Professors expected high-level work but didn’t always help students struggling with pandemic learning loss, she said.
“The professors didn’t really capture the idea that these students might need more help and support, because of the fact that they weren’t learning in a regular environment for the past year and a half,” Banda said.
“I had a six-month gap because I didn’t know exactly where to start, and I didn’t have the guidance because nobody in my family was in college.” Katie Honeycutt, a San Bernardino Valley College student who dropped her classes to take a job
The social disruption was even worse: “I’m naturally a shy person, so transitioning from a year full of almost no social communication to being back in the classroom and having to make these relationships and friendships work was really, really hard.”
Getting a campus job at the social services office got her out of her shell. In that role she had to engage with other students but noticed many weren’t receptive.
“People just generally weren’t comfortable having regular conversations anymore,” Banda said. “They would avoid eye contact and get nervous.” 
Banda is scheduled to graduate in spring 2026 and plans to pursue a master’s degree and a career as a hospital social worker. The tough lessons of the pandemic will guide her work, she said.

“Seeing how much people genuinely can struggle, and how limited help is, going into social work I’m going to keep that in my head,” she said. “I’m always going to try to the best of my ability to help people.”
Bringing back campus life
Reestablishing campus culture and student life might seem like a lower priority than boosting academic performance in the wake of the pandemic, but university leaders say they’re intertwined. Without connections to classmates and professors, students feel less committed to college.
“Students don’t have the will to stay in school if they don’t feel connected to the campus,” Davidson-Boyd, of Cal State San Bernardino, said. “We saw a rise in dropout rates, and we know that doesn’t just have to do with academics, but connectability to campus as well.”
First year continuation rates for the campus fell, from almost 85% for students who started in 2019 to 78% for those who started in 2020 and 80% for those who started in 2021.
While universities typically encourage students to take a full course load and push through challenging classes, Cal State San Bernardino tried to keep students in school by making it easier for them to drop classes without penalties.
Most students who tried to withdraw from classes but couldn’t do so wound up failing anyway. After two failed classes, many gave up, Davidson-Boyd said: “This was a way to give them an out so they feel like they have more agency over the process.”
Even after pandemic restrictions loosened, campuses continued virtual instruction for some classes and kept dorms at reduced occupancy.

“During lockdown students weren’t able to bond and build connections to the institution, or even access support structures,” Mata said. “They remember being lonely. They were trying to figure out college and it wasn’t what they thought it would be at that time.”
That disengagement hindered attendance and participation during and after the pandemic, Davidson-Boyd said.
“A lot of our students who are failing classes, it’s not that they don’t understand the content,” she said. “They’re just not showing up. Professors are saying that when students are in class they’re not engaged in the same way.”
Cal State San Bernardino reinforced study skills through summer programs for some incoming students, with primers on writing fundamentals and “how-to college math,” she said. And the university introduced a freshman course with tips on identifying their interests, participating in campus events and even asking instructors for help.
Maribel Gamez-Reyes: College application panic
Maribel Gamez-Reyes’ senior year at St. Mary’s Academy, an all-girls Catholic High School in  Inglewood, was a marathon of Zoom classes and digital homework. 
She struggled with virtual math lessons,  and spent so much time online she needed a new glasses prescription for eye strain.
Meanwhile her friendships faded, and lively, campus-wide assemblies she looked forward to were cancelled.
“That was disappointing,” said Gamez-Reyes, now 21. “It was overwhelming, because I realized I wasn’t going to experience all that, and there was this lingering fear because I didn’t know what to expect.”

College applications triggered panic attacks, she said, even with online help from her high school counselor and English teacher.
“I was literally overthinking every decision I was making.”
Gamez-Reyes was excited to be admitted to UC Riverside, but life on campus sparked more stress. The first semester most of her classes were online, which kept her confined to her dorm room and took the joy out of her favorite subject, English.  One of her few in-person classes was a math course, but it was held in a large lecture hall and required students to wear masks.
“I had so much anxiety about coming here,” she said. “But even then I tried to push forward because it was my first choice.”
Her mom kept her grounded. “My mom never went to college, and she was very proud of me for going to college … She said, ‘I know you’re scared and you don’t know people, but you have to try.’”

Gamez-Reyes started small. She chose a residence hall known for its social life, with an open layout that encouraged students to hang out in the hallway or lounge.
She eventually found her niche at the college newspaper, the Highlander, first as a contributing writer and then as arts and entertainment editor, where she oversaw coverage of books, fashion, movies and concerts. She made friends in the newsroom and met people while covering live events. She is scheduled to graduate this year and plans to pursue a PhD program in English.
“I’ve found these spaces where I feel really comfortable, and I’ve excelled overall,” Gamez-Reyes said.  “Even though I didn’t get to experience some of these exciting moments in high school, I’m experiencing that now.”
Small steps toward socializing
Social avoidance was the norm for pandemic graduates, Mata said. Whether because of fear of infection or the months of isolation, students were wary of parties and preferred simple outdoor events, she said.
“The very basic activities that pre-pandemic students wouldn’t be interested in, like a carnival, when we came back to campus, those were the things students gravitated to,” she said.
Outdoor movie nights also were a hit, offering the right balance of space and social interaction.
“It’s almost like starting small and drawing them out with very basic interactions to break down that social isolation that they developed,” Mata said.
At Cal State San Bernardino fraternity and sorority recruitment declined, along with other clubs and activities, Davidson-Boyd said. Students weren’t just feeling antisocial, she said. They were also scared.
“We instilled some panic that just being around other people could get you sick,” she said. “So I think we’re deprogramming that now.”
Carson Fajardo: Drawing students out of dorm rooms
Early in the pandemic, Carson Fajardo was optimistic that Rancho Cucamonga High School would reopen after a few weeks, in time for an assembly he was planning as student treasurer. He felt “bummed and discouraged” when it became clear that school wouldn’t resume in person that year or even the next.
“The class of 2020 got it pretty bad because they didn’t get graduation or prom,” said Fajardo, now 22. “But I still stand on the fact that the class of 2021 had it way worse, because we had everything taken from us. Not only was it junior prom and opportunities, but almost our entire senior year.”

During his senior year Fajardo kept busy with virtual student government meetings and planned fundraisers with local boba shops and pizza places. He played Call of Duty and sometimes fell asleep in Zoom class.
He thought that was all behind him once he entered Cal State San Bernardino as a business major in 2021. 
“Because I felt thwarted in my high school career, I took that to heart in my college career and really wanted to make the most of it,” he said. 
Fajardo became a programming coordinator for his residence hall. But it was an uphill battle to get anyone to join in activities.
“Only a few extroverted people were coming out to these events, but the introverted students were stuck in their dorm rooms and not wanting to come out,” he said.
Students welcomed low-key gatherings such as video nights or arts-and-crafts sessions. But a “homecoming-esqe small dance party” with a DJ, theme and decorations drew only 50 guests.
“We tried to bring back some of what was lost, but it just didn’t pan out well,” he said. “It just fell on its face.”
“There were a lot of holes in their education. There were vital pieces that were missing.”Lesley Davidson-Boyd, associate vice president of California State University, San Bernardino.
Some classes also were disappointing. Although professors found students disengaged, Fajardo thought some professors were also checked out, recycling online lessons from the remote learning period for use in asynchronous classes, where students work at their own pace.
“They taught online through COVID and then reposted their lectures for asynchronous classes where they don’t need to teach and can count it as a class, when all they’re doing is clicking a button,” he said. “There’s no real interaction, no feedback from professors in some of these classes.”
In his junior year Fajardo ran for student government president and won, which gave him a bigger platform to “build back campus culture.” Drawing on his dorm experience, he tried to offer something for everyone. A “Cosmic Coyote” night drew 900 students with laid-back bowling rounds, karaoke, line dancing and a high-energy mosh pit outside. That became an annual event, and a lesson in leadership for Fajardo.
“I think a lot of my growth as a leader came in because before I was more oblivious to what other people’s interests are, or what I think other people’s interests are,” he said.

The largest production that year was “Coyote Fest,” which drew about 7,000 people to a concert featuring rapper Schoolboy Q, along with rides, slides, a ferris wheel, mechanical bull and jousting.
Fajardo graduated in May and plans to pursue a master’s degree and a career in nonprofit fundraising.
“It’s cool for me, starting on the campus and seeing where it was when I first got here, in comparison to where it is now,” he said. “Tradition is the backbone of campus culture.”
Maintaining motivation to graduate
One challenge to keeping students in college comes from the regional job market, Boyd-Davidson said. After all, pay at many warehouse jobs in the Inland Empire start at about $20 per hour and can rise to $35 per hour or more for supervisory positions.
“The Inland Empire has some of the lowest graduation rates in the country,” she said. “We know we’re fighting an uphill battle to get students in school and keep them in school, especially because at warehouse jobs, which we’re surrounded by, the wages are so high.”
For students paying their own bills or helping support families, the payoff of a college degree isn’t always obvious, she said. 
Katie Honeycutt, 21, graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino in 2021 and enrolled at San Bernardino Valley College in a pharmacy technician program in spring, 2022.
“I had a six-month gap because I didn’t know exactly where to start, and I didn’t have the guidance because nobody in my family was in college,” Honeycutt said.
While she enjoyed some in-person college classes, she switched to online classes to coordinate with her work schedule as a supervisor at Ross Dress for Less. The virtual college courses were just as hard as remote learning in high school, she said, and she was missing math skills and other fundamentals she should have learned in her senior year.
“I ended up dropping (the classes), because it was just too much to handle all at once,” Honeycutt said. “I do have stuff to pay, and I can’t just focus on just school.”
Rather than only highlighting the financial rewards of a college degree, Davidson-Boyd said university officials gained traction by discussing the less immediate benefits of higher education: the greater range of career choices college graduates have and the opportunity to contribute to their communities.
While students who started college during the pandemic still feel a sense of loss or hardship,  many who graduate have a sense of accomplishment for having made it through. 
“There’s resiliency, because of what they had to face in starting their collegiate journey,” Mata  said. “I just remind them how special they are and how proud they should be.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/051925_Pandemic-Graduates_KG_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 09:03:06.597141

Gavin Newsom and the Legislature forgoes or delays many of Newsom’s proposed cuts but the deficit is only likely to grow.,"In summary
The budget deal between Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature forgoes or delays many of Newsom’s proposed cuts but the deficit is only likely to grow.


Gov. Gavin Newsom backed off some of his proposed cuts to health care programs in a state budget deal he reached with legislative leaders late Tuesday, but California will move forward with his plan to limit services to undocumented immigrants as the state faces a growing deficit.
The $321 billion spending plan is expected to go before the Legislature for approval later this week, ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year. With health care costs rising faster than expected, the state economy battered by new tariffs and further federal funding cuts looming, officials confronted a $12 billion shortfall that has forced difficult conversations about California’s spending.
Officials did not formally announce the deal as they continue to haggle over the details of a provision that could streamline construction of housing projects near public transit and denser development in cities. Newsom demanded the language, which has encountered resistance from the state Senate.
“We appreciate the strong partnership with the Legislature in reaching this budget agreement,” spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement. “The Governor’s signature is contingent on finalizing legislation to cut red tape and unleash housing and infrastructure development across the state — to build more, faster.”
Though the Legislature already passed its own version of the budget earlier this month to meet a constitutional deadline, it relied more on borrowing and less on program cuts than Newsom, who sought to reverse course on recent major expansions of subsidized health care in order to stabilize California’s long-term finances.  
The budget agreement foregoes or delays many of his proposals. Legislative leaders argued against prematurely kicking people out of a vital safety net as they search for other solutions to address a persistent revenue gap that is projected to reach more than $20 billion annually in the coming years.
With officials ultimately agreeing to fewer spending reductions — reflecting a hope by many legislators that California’s economy will eventually rally — the state will pull about $7 billion out of its rainy-day fund and $6.5 billion from other cash reserves to balance the budget next year.
Nevertheless, the plan freezes enrollment by adults without legal status in Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for the poor, starting in January. After California finished gradually opening up the program to that population last year, more new patients enrolled than expected, contributing to about $6 billion in cost overruns that required an emergency appropriation to Medi-Cal this spring.
The budget deal also eliminates dental coverage for those who remain enrolled, starting in July 2026, and creates a $30 monthly premium for undocumented Medi-Cal patients between the ages of 19 and 59 that will take effect in July 2027.
But it rejects the governor’s proposed cuts to their long-term care benefits, as well to overtime pay for home health aides and funding for reproductive health providers, and does not reinstate a strict asset test that could have pushed thousands of newly eligible older and disabled Californians off of Medi-Cal again.

Public transit agencies and the University of California and California State University also avoid funding cuts under this spending plan, though some of the money for the university systems is deferred and they will be required to take out zero-interest loans from the state’s general fund in the meantime. The deal includes $45 million to help the struggling Sonoma State University, in Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire’s district, to turn around its financial woes. 
Housing, homelessness retain funding
The Legislature successfully pushed to keep $620 million in grants and loans for affordable housing construction and $500 million to support local homelessness services, and to add $100 million in one-time funding for counties to begin implementing Proposition 36. Local government and law enforcement agencies have argued they need far more help to enforce the measure, which was overwhelmingly approved by voters last fall to increase penalties and mandate treatment for certain drug crimes. Newsom remains opposed to that approach, which he contends would return California to an era of mass incarceration.
The budget deal maintains his proposal to close a fifth state prison by next October, which could save an estimated $150 million annually, and more than doubles the size of California’s film and television tax credit to $750 million, another gubernatorial priority as production flees the state.
The plan also relies on other internal fund shifts, including directing $1 billion raised from greenhouse gas polluters through cap-and-trade auctions to pay for firefighting and vegetation management projects. Some lawmakers had objected to using money intended to address climate change this way.
The fate of that cap-and-trade system, which Newsom had proposed to reauthorize through the budget, and his controversial push to fast-track the Delta tunnel are among several significant policy questions left unresolved in the agreement. They could still be addressed in follow-up budget bills in the coming weeks or through the regular legislative process by the end of the summer.
The governor also has yet to agree to a legislative proposal to lend up to $1.75 billion to local governments in Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area transit agencies dealing with their own budget crunches.
And all of this could be revisited again later this year or early next year as California warily eyes a major federal tax bill, still being negotiated in Congress, that could result in deep cuts to health care and food aid funding. Liberal state legislators and advocacy groups are turning up the pressure to raise state taxes to offset those losses, something Newsom has previously vehemently opposed.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/052325_Assembly-Floor_FG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 09:03:06.597141

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah comes in first in many civic-related rankings — it’s the top state for volunteerism, and its capital, Salt Lake City, has also been ranked among the “most patriotic cities.” However, there’s a list in which the state continues to lag behind its counterparts — voting and civic engagement among women.
While that number has been making its way up, it has also fluctuated in recent years, with the state ranking No. 29 out of 51 in the 2024 women’s turnout list, which also includes Washington, D.C., from Utah State University’s Utah Women & Leadership Project. The state’s performance is lower than last year, when it ranked 24 out of 51.
It’s however also a long way from the Utah Women & Leadership Project’s 2006 numbers, which placed the state in the 51st spot. 
The report painted a picture of Utah’s voting history, from the suffrage movement in the state’s early days including high Latter-day Saint support for votes for women with the idea that they would express support for polygamy, to Seraph Young, Brigham Young’s grand-niece, becoming the first woman to vote, to Utah women leading the nation in voter turnout in the late 20th century. But more recently, the state has fallen into the bottom voting participation spots nationwide.

“Women’s voting turnout and political participation have drastically improved since 2010, and Utah has more women serving in the state legislature than ever before,” the report’s authors wrote. “However, as Utah is still below national averages in terms of political representation and consistently ranks among the worst states for women’s equality.”
There are different factors that affect voting rates nationwide, including ethnicity, marital status and education levels — white women, married women and women with advanced degrees are most likely to vote, according to the study. 
“According to one report, inflation, including the rising cost of household expenses, was the most important issue for US women, followed by threats to democracy and immigration/border security,” according to the study. “An increased number of women ranked abortion as their most important issue, most likely due to the emphasis of reproductive rights in the Harris-Walz campaign.”
Utah women’s priorities in the 2024 elections were housing affordability, politicians listening to voters, inflation and government overreach, among others, according to the Utah Foundation. Women also tended to prioritize abortion and women’s rights while men ranked issues like crime and immigration higher up.

Utah women civically show up in other ways, however. They often express policy disagreements through boycotts, protests, contacting the press, and lobbying and interacting with politicians, according to the study. 
An example of those efforts were substantial in 2024, when the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government challenged Constitutional Amendment D, which ultimately led to the Utah Supreme Court voiding the amendment.
But, amid some wins, Utah women face challenges, “including the persistent lack of public support and funding for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence and for efforts that focus on the prevention of sexual assault, domestic violence, and child sexual abuse,” the study says.
Among other concerns affecting women in the state are also gender pay gaps, lack of child care, sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, gender-specific workforce development challenges, and elements of women’s health across the lifespan.
While voting rates have risen in the state, there’s still room for improvement, the authors said.
“Research shows that when young people participate in politics and their community, it shapes their future, and our communities benefit from their perspectives. Equally true, when women and men lead together, organizations, communities, individuals, and families benefit. By empowering more women to take active roles in their communities, we can create a more inclusive, equitable, and thriving Utah for generations to come.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)State judicial staff will conduct a review of fees imposed in Alabama’s court system to better understand the financial issues faced by people going through the legal system, following a meeting of the Court Cost Task Force on Tuesday.
Personnel will review the fees that courts in different jurisdictions charge litigants to access the courts, from civil matters like divorce to criminal charges including murder. The fees will then be compiled and broken into the different counties to get a sense of the financial disparities people face as they access various legal services from their court systems.
“I think we need to update a lot of our court cost studies,” said Alabama Chief Justice Sarah Hicks Stewart, the leader of the task force, in an interview following the task force’s meeting on Tuesday. “It was last updated in 2011, and we need to make sure that we have all the assessments and all the costs that the clerks were identifying, that those are all reflected appropriately in those charts.”
The task force is investigating court costs and the impact they have on the criminal justice system. It is tasked with researching possible avenues for generating money for a court system that has been chronically underfunded.
Staff plan to use the information to determine the amount of revenue the courts collect when adjudicating each case.
Much of Tuesday’s meeting focused on developing a more uniform fee system to potentially reduce the fee disparities people pay depending on the jurisdiction where they live.
“That is the goal, the charge that we have got on the commission,” Stewart said. “That is what we are really going to try and focus on.”
Othni Lathram, director of the Alabama Legislative Services Agency and a member of the task force, also outlined other priorities, including identifying the agencies and organizations that also receive funding from court costs; determining issues related to collection, increasing efficiency and workload for the clerks and backfilling lost funds.
Suzi Huffaker, legislative counsel for the Alabama State Bar Association, showed a spreadsheet of filing fees to indicate a study has been completed for different services charged, but the figures are dated from 2011 and that it is only from one county.
In theory, there should be less disparity in the number of fees levied by each judicial jurisdiction. During the task force’s first meeting in May, Stewart said that Section 96 of the Alabama Constitution is supposed to prohibit state lawmakers from selectively imposing fees on courts, commissions and public officials. But legislators can bypass that rule by enacting local acts with constitutional implications, leading to discrepancies in charges.
The goal of the investigation is to uncover all the court fees that counties impose as a first step toward uniformity.
“We do have an organized way of finding those fees, what they are, and updating those charts,” said Nathan Wilson, administrative director of courts. “What we would probably do is start with what we have, which is baseline 2011, and go back and look at the local acts that have passed since then, and any statewide acts that have passed since 2011, and just put those into the chart on a county-by-county basis.”
Steven L. Nicholas, an attorney based in Mobile, said the research must also identify the number of cases that relate to each of the fees.
“How much money do I have to generate to make it revenue neutral?” he asked. “I need to know how much money is collected so I know what I have to come up with. For each county, you need to know how many times that fee was charged.”
Wilson said that is possible to calculate with the information contained in the system.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250624_110807-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-25 09:03:06.597141

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development has opened public comment on a proposal that would reduce municipal governments’ ability to assist local public schools.
The draft regulation, published Friday, would state that services — such as parking-lot plowing, or the use of public pools or libraries for school functions — would count toward the maximum limit of local aid that school districts may receive from the local government.
The education department said it proposed the regulation change as a way to avoid failing the “disparity test,” which governs the financial spread between the richest and poorest school districts in the state.
That test is required by the U.S. Department of Education because of the way Alaska allocates some federal financial aid.
Local governments, school districts and public-school advocates have vocally opposed the change, and when the state education department asked the state school board to adopt the regulation on an immediate, emergency basis, it prompted a loud outcry that caused the school board to postpone acting on that request.
Now, the board is not scheduled to consider the regulation until at least October, according to a public notice accompanying the draft regulation.
Public comments are being accepted at eed.stateboard@alaska.gov through 5 p.m., July 23.

,California,2025-06-25 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s war on carbon emissions faces setbacks in court and Congress,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-zero-emissions-vehicles-war/,"New laws, a future Supreme Court decision and consumer hesitance are some of the obstacles California must overcome if it's going to see a carbon neutral future.","California’s self-designated deadline for achieving net zero emissions of greenhouse gases is 20 years away. But what is happening — or not happening — in multiple arenas now may determine whether that goal is met.
The largest single source of emissions is the nearly 1 billion miles that Californians drive each day. Accordingly the state has ordered that by 2035, all new cars sold must be zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). However, the state has interim goals and, so far, purchases of  electric vehicles are falling well short.
This year’s goal was to be 35%, but sales have been running about 10 percentage points behind, compelling the Air Resources Board to push the 2026 goal of 43% off until 2027.
Meanwhile the Republican-controlled Congress, in response to pleas from automakers, has passed and President Donald Trump has signed legislation to cancel the state’s authority to deviate from national emission standards, effectively halting the zero-emission mandate.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said. “And they’re never coming back.”
The state is challenging the new legislation in court, leaving the issue up in the air. However, even if the state’s waiver from federal standards is reinstated, the underlying issue of persuading Californians to buy electric vehicles would remain.
“To meet the revised 2027 target, California would need to increase ZEV sales by about 50% from current levels — rising from approximately 23% today to 43% in less than 24 months,” Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, notes in a recent analysis of the situation.
Obviously, the state cannot directly force motorists to buy electric cars and trucks and can only offer subsidies or make it impossible to purchase anything other than a zero-emission vehicle. On paper, the legal onus is on automakers to meet the year-by-year goals, with hefty fines — thousands of dollars per vehicle — for falling short.
Another major front in the carbon war is the Air Resources Board’s “low carbon fuel standard” aimed at compelling refineries to lower the amount of carbon in gasoline.
While the board wanted it to take effect earlier this year, its regulations hit a snag in the Office of Administrative Law, which declared the regulations lacked the “clarity” needed to make them understood by those affected. The air board has rewritten some passages of the regulations, which are hundreds of pages long, and has indicated that they may take effect in July. 
The big issue, at least to motorists, is how they will affect pump prices.
In 2023, the board estimated that adoption could immediately increase gas prices by 47 cents a gallon, and then “on average, from 2031 through 2046 the proposed amendments are projected to potentially increase the price of gasoline by $1.15 per gallon, the price of diesel by $1.50 per gallon and fossil jet fuel by $1.21 per gallon.”
The estimate generated a storm of media attention, and the board responded by refusing to put firm numbers on potential price effects, thus creating a guessing game that will end only when the mandate takes effect.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court declared last week that oil companies have the right to challenge the state’s emission regulations in court.
“The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion.
“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court.”
The 7-2 decision implies that whatever else happens, the Supreme Court could have the last word, and it might not favor California.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/091520_Traffic-Highway-Freeway-Brentwood-AW-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-25 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Will Warren’s story: From 10th grade bench warmer to NY Yankees starter,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/25/will-warren-yankees/,Column: Mississippi native and New York Yankees pitcher Will Warren's incredible story is one of waiting your turn and never giving up.,"Take a look at the photo above. The guy about to deliver the pitch is Will Warren, the New York Yankees star rookie pitcher. Warren stands a strapping 6 feet, 2 inches tall, weighs a streamlined 200 pounds and can throw 97 mph fastballs that move this way and that with pinpoint accuracy.

Will Warren, left, couldn’t get on the mound as a skinny, 5-foot, 4-inch Jackson Prep 10th grader.
Now then, look at the photo to the right from 10 years ago. The kid wearing number 16 is the same Will Warren, then 16 years young and a 10th grader at Jackson Prep. Warren stood 5 feet, 4 inches tall, threw his fastball 78 mph and pitched all of three innings in Prep’s state championship season. Says Warren, “I was a skinny, little guy, and we had a bunch of really talented older guys who could really throw it hard. I wasn’t big enough or good enough. I hardly ever got to play.”
Perhaps this column should be required reading for all the late bloomers in baseball — or any sport, for that matter — who ride the bench while wondering if they are ever going to grow or mature enough to even get a chance. This is a story of waiting your turn and never giving up. This is the story of a kid who at one point couldn’t get on the mound at Jackson Prep’s cozy field on Lakeland Drive and now often takes the mound in pinstripes at mammoth Yankee Stadium in the Bronx before a packed house and national TV audience.
This is the story of a kid who grew nearly nine inches taller his junior year of high school and who still wasn’t considered good enough to be recruited by the big baseball schools in his home state. So he took the only scholarship offer he had at Southeastern Louisiana, worked his butt off and continued to grow, get stronger and learn how to pitch. This is also the story of a guy who, if he continues on his current career path, will someday make millions upon millions of dollars playing the game he was once considered too small and weak to play.
“I grew up a Mississippi State fan, and my dream was to play baseball there,” Warren said on Monday by phone from Cincinnati, where the Yankees are currently playing. “By the time I was really pitching well as a senior at Prep, they already had all their pitchers committed.”
So did Ole Miss. So did Southern Miss. So did all the other SEC and Deep South baseball powers. Southeastern Louisiana, a really good, under-appreciated baseball program, kept showing up at all Prep games, kept telling Warren he was their guy. Finally, Warren committed to Southeastern in Hammond, just two hours away from home. Says Warren, “It was where I was supposed to be.”
He wasn’t an overnight success at SLU either. He pitched only 23 innings as a freshman and had a 1-1 record with three saves (one a three-inning save in a victory over LSU at Baton Rouge, which served a predictor of things to come).
“At Southeastern I got in the weight room really hard for the first time that freshman year and got a lot stronger,” Warren said.
By the time he was a senior, his fastball velocity had zoomed to a consistent 95 mph, sometimes touching 97. He had polished his off-speed and breaking pitches. Most importantly, he threw strikes, as his 95 strikeouts compared to 25 walks attest.
The Yankees, who had shown interest and offered him a free agent contract the year before, drafted him in the eighth round of the 2021 draft. He quickly became one of the franchise’s top prospects. His rise up the Yanks’ minor league ladder was relatively quick: Class A and AA in 2022, AA and AAA in 2023, AAA and a taste of the Major Leagues in 2024.
That first taste of the Big Leagues was more bitter than sweet. He allowed 33 hits and 26 earned runs in just 22.2 innings. 
“I just wasn’t comfortable and was trying to do too much, be too perfect at first,” Warren said.
But then again, nothing has ever come easy for Warren. That said, injuries to two projected starters this past spring opened spots in the Yankees’ starting rotation. Warren pitched well enough in the spring to earn one of them. And, after a relatively slow start to the regular season, he keeps getting better and better. The Yankees have won seven of his last nine starts, and he has pitched at least five innings in all but one. His record stands at 4-4 and opponents are batting only .239 against him. If he continues to progress at his current pace, he will be a candidate for American League Rookie of the Year.
“Experience helps, and I keep learning and improving,” Warren said. “I know I have what it takes. I’m in a good spot with a really good team.”
The Yankees lead the American League East by two games over the surging Tampa Bay Rays, who have been boosted this season Warren’s former Jackson Prep teammate Jake Mangum. The two faced one another May 5 in a game at Tampa Bay. Warren chuckled as he told the story. 
“I got a two strike count on him and threw him a really good slider down and away,” Warren said. “So of course Jake went down and got it, hit a high bouncer that he beat out for a hit — just Jake doing what Jake does. I glanced over at him and gave him a look and he tipped his cap and smiled. It was a moment.”
Mangum, the all-time SEC hits leader at State, was a senior star at Prep when Warren was a skinny, little 10th grader riding the bench, worrying if he would ever grow. Warren was so concerned about his size his parents took him to a pediatrician, who measured (via X-rays) Will’s growth plates. “You’re gonna grow,” the doctor told him. “Your growth plates are wide open. You’re gonna be a late bloomer, son, but you are going to grow.”
And grow he did, more rapidly than he could ever have imagined.
“I always thought Will would be a really good pitcher if he grew, and he did,” Mangum said. “He always had that pitch-ability. He could hit his spots and knew when to throw what pitches. He knew how to pitch. Plus, he just worked so hard at it. I am so happy for Will and what he has accomplished. When he’s not playing us, I pull for him.”
Warren always has believed in himself.
“I’ve always told people I wanted to play in the Big Leagues,” he said. “I definitely believed that I had the ability to take the next step at every level I’ve played. I think you have to have that confidence, that edge. I’ve always tried to be the best I can be at every level. At the same time, every day I am so grateful and feel so blessed to do what I do. It does feel like a dream sometimes. I’m so thankful that God has blessed me with this opportunity.”

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Alabama environmental regulators have agreed to update standards used to limit the amounts of 12 toxic and carcinogenic substances in the state’s waterways, a move that clean water advocates say will help protect those who fish and swim in Alabama’s rivers.
Seven Alabama environmental groups petitioned the state’s Environmental Management Commission to update those standards in April, and that petition was approved at the June 13 commission meeting.
The commission, a seven-member appointed board that oversees the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, ruled in favor of the environmental groups by a 6-1 vote, despite ADEM’s objections.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The decision was a rare win for environmental groups operating in the deep-red state, from a board that rarely votes against the department’s recommendations.
“We’re pleased but somewhat surprised, given the historical reluctance to give environmentalists what they want,” David Ludder, an attorney representing the environmental groups, said in an interview.
Ludder said that, once finalized, the new standards will result in stricter limits on how much of these toxic substances can legally be discharged into Alabama waterways that are sources of drinking water and popular fishing areas across much of the state.
In their petition, the groups noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published new Integrated Risk Information System [IRIS] standards in 2015, but the state had never updated its thresholds to match. The IRIS program assesses the latest scientific research on numerous hazardous chemicals to help federal, state and local regulators determine safety standards for exposure.
“EPA did a very large reevaluation of toxic pollutants in 2015 and it was our hope that ADEM would promptly respond to that 2015 evaluation,” Ludder said. “Since then, every three years, we’ve asked ADEM to do that, to complete that evaluation, and they never were able to do it, and they never were able to provide a specific time limit for doing it.”

(Via Inside Climate News)
Ludder said commission rules require ADEM to use EPA-issued water standards “except where other values are established” in coordination with the Alabama Department of Public Health. That did not happen in this case.
“If you want to set aside the value of the Integrated Risk Information System, you have to develop a justification for something else,” Ludder said at the commission meeting. “And that has to be done in consultation with the Department of Public Health.”
ADEM acting director Jeffery Kitchens told the commission that the petition should be denied because it was “premature,” arguing that ADEM needed more time to evaluate the standards, and that the department was working on the water toxicity standards as a whole instead of keying in on 12 individual contaminants identified in the petition.
Kitchens said the department was moving on a timeline to propose an update to the standards by “late 2026,” aligning with ADEM’s policy of reviewing the guidelines every three years.
“We believe this comprehensive evaluation will result in the adoption of protective, scientifically justifiable criteria,” Kitchens said during the meeting.
Ludder countered that Kitchens’ response did not establish any firm deadlines for updating the standards and that multiple triennial reviews had taken place since 2015 without reflecting the new EPA guidance.
“The petition process is recognized by Alabama law, and it’s designed specifically to move agencies to do something, to reconsider what their rules say,” Ludder said during the meeting. “We’re asking you to do that and not defer to another triennial review.”
The commission—composed of private-sector experts in law, biology, engineering, medicine, geology and veterinary medicine, appointed by the governor—found the argument compelling.
“If our rules say we should be following [the EPA standard], we should be following it until we have a scientific basis to do something different,” Commissioner Lanier Brown, a Birmingham-based attorney, said during the meeting. “And we don’t have something different, so we’ve got to follow those.”
The commission sided with the petitioners, with only commission Chair Frank McFadden voting no.
Ludder filed the petition on behalf of seven Alabama environmental groups: the Alabama Rivers Alliance, Black Warrior Riverkeeper, Cahaba Riverkeeper, Choctawhatchee Riverkeeper, Coosa Riverkeeper, Mobile Baykeeper and the Environmental Defense Alliance.
Charles Miller, policy director for the Alabama Rivers Alliance, said he was encouraged not only by the vote, but by the level of discussion among commissioners, ADEM and the petitioners.
“There were a lot of good questions from the commissioners,” Miller said. “I think this is an example of what happens when we put some thought into our environmental regulations, when we take them seriously.”
ADEM will now be required to update its standards for 12 chemical pollutants. For five of those toxicants—cyanide, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 4,6-dinitro-2-methylphenol, ethyl benzene, and toluene—the state will switch to the updated EPA standard for an oral reference dose, mirroring the EPA’s IRIS reference dose thresholds.
A reference dose is the amount of a toxic substance that a person can be exposed to on a daily basis that is “likely to be without an appreciable risk” of harm. The EPA uses this metric to evaluate potentially harmful chemicals that are not considered carcinogens.
For six other compounds—1,3- dichloropropylene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, hexachloroethane, pentachlorophenol, trichloroethylene and arsenic—the state will use the EPA’s updated cancer potency factor. The CPF estimates how much ingesting 1 mg per day of a certain chemical will increase a person’s risk of developing cancer.
For 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, the petition requested the state shift from using the reference dose threshold to the cancer potency factor threshold.
According to the petition, the updated standards are the result of new research and analysis by the EPA showing the chemicals are harmful at lower concentrations than previously believed.
“While the toxicity values for the toxic pollutants … may have reflected the best science and scientific judgment available at the time of their adoption by the Commission, new information and scientific methods have become available which demonstrate that the toxicity values for the above-mentioned priority toxic pollutants are not sufficient to protect human health,” the petition states. “The proposed amendment will revise those toxicity values to reflect the best available science and scientific judgment and protect human health.”
Ludder said he expects the department to formally propose the updated standards around December, with the new limits incorporated into permits and advisories after that.
“The toxicity value of these chemicals is not the only consideration in establishing what level of water quality will be achieved, but it will definitely improve things,” Ludder said. “It will reduce the amount of toxins in Alabama waters.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cahaba-River-for-June-24-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174

(Getty Images)State politicians are like self-appointed lifeguards that lack the ability to swim, yelling directions to someone drowning, from the shore. Lacking knowledge about education or experience in the field, they mandate senseless policies and practices that do not improve student outcomes. 
Nevada’s newest attempt at “education reform,” Senate Bill 460 was recently enrolled by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. It combined two competing bills: one from the governor and one from Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro. The result is a complete bipartisan mess.
Who or what (AI?) created this monstrosity? It is difficult to consume its 200+ pages even for those familiar and experienced with reading educational studies and legalese. Trust me on that one.
The opening paragraph alone contains a laundry list of ineffective remedies, most of which have failed in other states. The biggest flaw (among many) in this law is promoting the false premise that standardized test score averages effectively measure accountability in education.
Possible positives buried in SB460 are support for pre-kindergarten / early childhood education programs that may help students enter kindergarten on a more level playing field and limiting teacher liability when intervening in physical altercations.
There are no proven educational practices that have ever closed academic achievement gaps or  produced common levels of literacy. Not the interventions, remediations, strategies, or methods included in this law.
There are no effective models of instruction in other states (especially those with 3rd grade retention policies). Phony claims of success made by states, districts or schools are based on flawed statistics and outright lies. There is no “science of reading” or “miracle” in another state that closes literacy gaps.
The mandatory elementary school plans, strategic plans, Educational Service Center, Public Oversight Board, Commissions for Innovation, Funding, Recruitment and Professional Standards, or requirements for hiring a superintendent will not improve state test score averages.
Threatening “low-performing” schools with state takeovers, withholding funding or removing principals has never worked in any other state. The new definition of “low performing” includes schools with state test score averages in the bottom 20th percentile or where less than 50% of 3rd graders are proficient readers. Currently, this describes about half the schools in Nevada.
Oversight, accountability and evaluation of schools, administrators and teachers are pointless if measured by standardized test score averages. Differences in instruction or educational practice do not account for individual differences in standardized test scores. Test score averages should not be tied to school performance or evaluations of teachers and principals.
State and national standardized tests are designed to create a normal distribution (bell curve) of individual scores. The bulk of scores fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles. Proficiency levels are preset; meaning that the number of students that can achieve proficiency is predetermined. It is a rigged game.
Standardized tests rank individual students in relation to their peers. Individual test score ranks are used to sort and label students at all levels of education. State tests were never designed to measure school success or evaluate the effectiveness of teachers and administrators.
Nevada uses the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) as its state-mandated test of academic achievement in grades 3-8; along with about a dozen other states. SBAC consistently delivers a rank of percentile scores for individual students as do other state standardized tests.
The SBAC, like other standardized tests, is not a learning tool. Tests cover a very broad range of material with strict time parameters to comprehend and process test questions.
Students take this once a year battery of tests, are not allowed to see which test items were correct or incorrect, receive results weeks or months later with a raw score, percentile and label. There is no feedback to students which is crucial for learning. There is no opportunity to correct or learn from mistakes.
The preset proficiency level for 3rd grade reading on the SBAC is about the 55th percentile. That guarantees the failure of more than half of 3rd graders as only 45% are allowed to be labeled as proficient readers.
Demographics are the major determinant of test score averages. Higher poverty levels, lower parent education levels, more English learner students ensure that Nevada will remain near the bottom when compared to other states.
Superintendents across Nevada public school districts have grown weary of senseless mandates from the state; usually directed toward curing the perceived educational ills in Clark County. The directives have not improved student outcomes in CCSD or other districts across the state.
If the primary concern is the size of CCSD, then break it up. Create independent districts in Clark County. Start with the borders of the City of Henderson.
Few can comprehend the educational mess created by SB460, certainly not its creators. If oddsmakers set the over/under at 1 for the number of members in the Nevada State Legislature and governor’s office that have read the entire content of this pointless law, bet the under.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/testing-1024x665.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174

Mikie Sherill (D) called Jack Ciattarelli (R) a ""Trump lackey"" who will curtail abortion rights in New Jersey if elected governor. Ciattarelli called Sherrill wrong and dishonest. (Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, used the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning the federal right to abortion Tuesday to attack Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli and warn voters that he would “take away rights from women across the state.”
With President Donald Trump further restricting reproductive rights in his second term, abortion is an issue that could motivate voters in New Jersey’s gubernatorial race, political observers say — if the candidates frame it the right way.
Alyssa Maurice, research director at Stockton University’s William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy, said Sherrill’s potential focus on abortion in her campaign to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy in January could be successful if she pins down Ciattarelli as being anti-abortion rights and the state’s Republicans try to avoid the topic.
But that could be a struggle for Sherrill, Maurice said.
“The challenge they’re going to face is that they have to fight against a sort of apathy on this issue for New Jersey voters in particular, because New Jersey voters sort of feel immune to some of the federal changes because they feel like abortion is safe here,” said Maurice.
Sherrill, speaking to reporters Tuesday, painted her Republican opponent as a “Trump lackey” and a threat to the rights she said she’s fought to protect during her time in Congress. Sherrill supports adding abortion rights to the state’s constitution.
“Jack opposed allowing women to receive 12 months of contraception coverage. He supported Chris Christie’s budgets that defunded Planned Parenthood. He said as governor he would defund Planned Parenthood, and he said he would sign an abortion ban,” Sherrill said. “So, with one stroke of a pen, Jack could begin to take away the freedom we know and love right here in New Jersey.”
Sherrill, who was endorsed Tuesday by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey, also warned that Ciattarelli intends to elect far-right members to the state Supreme Court, where they could upend reproductive rights in the Garden State.
When Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021, he said he would sign a bill protecting abortion rights if the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade (that decision came the following year). He also says getting an abortion should be a decision that’s between a woman, her family, her doctors, and her faith, with some “reasonable” exceptions and restrictions.
Ciattarelli could not be reached to comment Tuesday. On social media, he criticized Sherrill’s comments as “wrong (and predictably dishonest) again.”
“My pro-choice position on abortion up to 20 weeks has been clear and consistent. I encourage anyone to go read my website,” he said.
Ciattarelli said his appointees to the state Supreme Court would be focused on “the disastrous school funding formula and mandated ‘affordable’ housing.”
Maurice said Ciattarelli’s move to shift the focus from abortion is one that will likely play out during the general election. She noted he has a “more difficult challenge ahead when it comes to this issue.”
In October, a Stockton University poll found a majority of New Jersey voters (73%) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 1 in 5 said it should be illegal in most or all cases. It also said, one month before last year’s presidential race, that 73% of voters said a candidate’s views on abortion would impact their vote. Maurice noted those results are consistent with polling from previous years and consistent across gender and political affiliation.
Though Democrat Kamala Harris won New Jersey in 2024, abortion was not enough of a driver for Democrats to prevent Trump’s reelection. The strategy on the Democratic side this time, Maurice said, could be to tie abortion to kitchen table issues that took the forefront in the 2024 presidential election, like the economy and the rising cost of living.
“We’ll probably see that as a strategy as well to be able to relate this to independents who are not as energized by abortion on its own,” she said.
State Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), during Sherrill’s call with reporters Tuesday, emphasized the potential consequences of electing a Republican governor in New Jersey, given that the GOP controls Congress and the White House.
“How much greater than to have a woman who understands that we are capable of making our own decisions with our own medical professionals in a private setting, without the threat of having a constitution that eliminates that right for us,” Ruiz said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Will Solomon: A response to the commentary from the Shalom Alliance.","Dear Editor,


In response to the commentary from the Shalom Alliance: “Vermont legislators have a chance to save Jewish lives — now”:
The Shalom Alliance’s mild-mannered self-description as a “a nonpartisan nonprofit working to build a bright future for Vermont Jews by fighting antisemitism and misinformation in Vermont schools, communities and media” belies several key facts.
First, the group lobbied aggressively against apartheid-free designations passed in five Vermont communities earlier this year by Vermonters who have been rightfully horrified seeing American political support and weapons aid in a massacre of tens of thousands of people in Gaza, and enforce what Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and countless other organizations define as apartheid in Palestine generally.
Second, the bill Shalom Alliance endorses, H.310, would not merely create Holocaust education standards in Vermont (a perfectly legitimate aim), but would define “negative references to … the right to self-determination in the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland” — in other words, anti-Zionism — as “antisemitic harassment,” itself a dangerous and offensive conflation and an explicit threat to freedom of speech.
Third, the group’s incorporator, Mitchell Knisbacher, has donated via the Sandra and Mitchell Knisbacher Foundation to extremist Israeli organizations, including the Central Fund of Israel and the One Israel Fund, which support settlement activities in Palestine.
Despite what the anonymous editorial writers say, their views are extreme and probably anathema to most Vermonters. Voters and legislators should carefully read and reject H.310.

Medicaid is especially important for children and families in rural areas where access to hospitals or doctor’s offices can be difficult.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Julie Ehrlich: Cuts to Medicaid means cuts to children’s health care.","This commentary is by Julie Ehrlich, MD, of Burlington, a pediatric resident physician at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital and a member of the Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.


The U.S. Senate is set to vote on its budget reconciliation legislation in the coming weeks, threatening to decrease Medicaid funding even more than the already alarming proposed cuts by the House-passed budget known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The budget cuts would result in millions of Americans losing their health care coverage and thousands of preventable deaths annually, according to a new analysis published in Annals of Internal Medicine.
Vermont pediatricians are deeply concerned about proposed cuts to Medicaid by the federal government. Why? Because the people and places in our region that care for children rely on Medicaid to provide needed services and to keep their doors open. Significant cuts to Medicaid will impact all children and the pediatric health professionals who care for them.
As a pediatrician in training, I have come to understand the importance of Medicaid for the children and families I care for. I worry that cuts to needed pediatric care will threaten the future of child health in Vermont.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage for our “most vulnerable,” but who exactly is that? Many people assume it is only for those with low incomes, those with disabilities and special needs, but what is often forgotten are the children.
Medicaid is the largest source of children’s health care coverage in the U.S. Our very own “Dr. Dynasaur,” Vermont’s Medicaid program for children and pregnant women, provides health care access to 48% of Vermont children.
Medicaid is especially important for children and families in rural areas where access to hospitals or doctor’s offices can be difficult. Medicaid provides school-based care, like on-site nurses or physicians, mental health professionals and other telehealth care.
Medicaid also covers preventative care for children like immunizations, well-child checkups, mental health services and vision and dental which keeps our kids healthy and in school. Cuts to Medicaid would be a disservice to every child and would have terrible and costly consequences for years to come.
Additionally, children’s hospitals depend heavily on Medicaid, as high as 50-80% of their inpatient days are reimbursed by Medicaid. Cuts to Medicaid funding will mean cuts to available pediatric inpatient beds across the country, a trend we are already seeing with the closure of children’s hospitals nationally and regionally, including Tufts Children’s Hospital in 2022.
Limited inpatient pediatric capacity will stress our region for all children, even those on private insurance. This is an even scarier thought in Vermont where we only have one children’s hospital and a very limited number of pediatric inpatient and intensive care beds.
The new budget cuts proposed by the Senate relies heavily on reducing Medicaid income eligibility, increasing work requirements and limiting exemptions. Not only will many children lose their health insurance, millions of caregivers across the United States will lose their health care coverage, threatening the health and safety of our children.
Research shows that having even one uninsured family member is associated with worse health outcomes for caregivers and their children. The new budget proposal also includes limiting exemptions for caregivers to individuals with dependent children 14 years or younger leaving caregivers of older children without funds to care for them.
Our delegates, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Peter Welch and Rep. Becca Balint are fighting for our children in their action against cuts to Medicaid. But they can’t do it without your support.
The Senate is currently considering the largest cuts to federal health care programs in the history of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and they plan to act by July 4. This is an opportunity for you to lend your voice in a moment that matters. Contact Sen. Sanders and Sen. Welch with your stories. Give them the ammunition they need to fight for your health care and the health care of your children.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.


Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)I went up to the ICU to check on a patient and I saw Sarah, a seasoned nurse I’ve worked with for years, juggling six critical patients. Her eyes were tired, her steps hurried, but she still managed a reassuring smile for a frightened family. Between checking IV lines and updating charts, she whispered to me, “I’m drowning, but I can’t let anyone see it.” That moment hit me hard. Sarah’s dedication keeps our hospital running, but the strain of understaffing is breaking her and countless nurses like her across Indiana.
A mother waits hours in an ER for her child’s care. A patient faces delays for surgery. Nurses, the backbone of our health care system, are stretched to the limit. They manage unsafe patient loads, earn modest wages, and live with the fear that one missed sign or delayed response could cost a life. Many are afraid to speak up, silenced by the risk of retaliation. This is a test of Indiana’s political, institutional, and moral priorities. Gov. Mike Braun and hospital leaders need to restore trust among our nurses.
The numbers paint a grim picture. Indiana hospitals face a 10 to 15% nurse vacancy rate and must train 1,300 additional nurses annually through 2031 just to keep up. Meanwhile, burnout is accelerating. A 2024 survey found that 15% of Indiana nurses plan to leave the profession, citing pay and workload as top concerns. During Nurses Week 2025, frontline caregivers shared stories of chronic understaffing, mental fatigue, and a health care culture that treats exhaustion as routine. The pandemic did not cause this. It revealed how fragile the system already was.
Indiana has a problem: a lack of nurses. And lawmakers are trying to help.

Leadership has failed to meet the moment. Braun’s 2025 budget allocated nothing to address this issue. Instead, it prioritized tax cuts and tighter Medicaid eligibility. It’s unclear if policymakers even recognize the crisis for what it is. If they do, they are certainly not treating it like one. His signing of House Bill 1004, which requires nonprofit hospitals to reduce pricing by 2029 or risk losing tax-exempt status, was a modest step on pricing but does nothing for workforce stability. No mandate for better pay. No investment in training. No plan for retention.
At the same time, the legislature has capped nursing program capacity, bottlenecking the pipeline. Hospital boards continue approving massive executive salaries. IU Health’s CEO earned millions while frontline nurses juggle impossible workloads with stagnant pay. IU Health holds $8.5 billion in assets and is building a $4.3 billion campus, yet its staff face critical shortages. A 2023 study directly linked inadequate nurse staffing to higher mortality rates, longer hospital stays, and millions in preventable costs. This amounts to institutional neglect.
We in Indiana are already paying the price in patient outcomes and a deteriorating standard of care. Strategic investment is essential to safeguard care and retain talent. People expect their hospital to be staffed and safe. Indiana’s leaders must listen to the people who keep the system running and act accordingly.
Here is how Indiana can begin to change things:
Tie Medicaid funding to safe, patient-centered staffing and fair compensation.
Hospitals receiving public funds should commit to care models grounded in safety, not cost cutting. That means fair pay for nurses with regular cost-of-living increases and staffing models that reflect patient needs. Keeping nurses in the profession protects both patients and the system.
Cap executive bonuses at nonprofit hospitals that fail to support their workforce.
Systems like IU Health, Community Health, and Ascension must lead by aligning leadership rewards with staff and patient outcomes not just financial performance.
Invest in nursing education and retention.
Raise faculty pay. Expand loan forgiveness. Fully fund a nurse residency program to grow the workforce and retain new graduates in high-need areas.
Protect nurses who speak out.
Enact strong whistleblower protections so nurses can report unsafe conditions without risking their careers.
These actions are necessary, evidence-based, and fiscally responsible. Better staffing means fewer errors and healthier communities. When nurses are supported, patients thrive and the entire system becomes more stable.
We cannot afford to keep building hospitals while ignoring the people who make health care possible. Braun and hospital leaders must protect the workforce now. Because without nurses there is no health care. And without action there soon won’t be enough left to care.

Mumford football stadium in Baton Rouge after it was granted $1.27 million for the lights from the Louisiana PSC’s Public Entities program. (John Oubre / Southern University)When a lighting contractor approached the Iberia Parish School District in Louisiana and offered it no-strings attached money for energy efficiency upgrades, Harry Lopez, manager of maintenance for the district said, “Flags went up, of course.”
Lopez had a reason to be cautious. Advocates and contractors alike say there isn’t a single program in the country that offers free money for efficiency upgrades to schools or other public buildings — except in Louisiana. 
After learning the too-good-to-be-true offer was real, Lopez signed up. To date, contractors have installed energy-saving LED lights in more than a dozen schools in the Iberia Parish district at a cost of $2 million, paid for by Louisiana’s residential and commercial electric customers through their monthly power bills. 
The free money came from the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s “public entities” program run by each of the five commission members within their respective districts. 
The program is funded by half of the money collected from the monthly energy efficiency fee charged to ratepayers of the state’s largest utilities. The other half is used by the utilities for their own energy efficiency programs. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Each of the elected commissioners receives $2.2 million to $3.8 million per year to allocate to schools, municipalities, parks and other public entities in their districts for energy efficiency projects. Since the program began in 2017, the commissioners have awarded about $80 million, mostly on lighting and some for upgrades to heating and cooling systems.
The commissioners’ program is intended to cost-effectively reduce energy consumption — a strategy that can lower utility bills and benefit the planet through reduced fossil fuel emissions. In many cases, it accomplishes those goals. 
But with few rules, almost no competitive bidding, an opaque selection process and no independent audits, it is also a wasteful “patronage” system, according to one energy watchdog. 
Even some commissioners question the lack of safeguards around the program. But largely they praise it, saying it benefits everyone in the state by lowering power bills for government facilities.
“The concept that it’s improper or corrupt, or any other adjective you want to assign to the public entity program, I think is just incorrect,“ Republican Commissioner Eric Skrmetta said. 
Democratic Commissioner Davante Lewis has a different view, calling the program, “literally … a slush fund with no checks and balances on commissioners to dole out cash that is collected from every ratepayer.”
  Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta secured $400,000 in utility ratepayer funds to provide energy-efficient lighting at two Northshore Technical Community College campuses. The projects were part of a program that allows commissioners to choose local government buildings for fully funded energy efficiency retrofits paid by ratepayers. (Northshore Technical Community College Facebook page)
Commission kills plan for independent program
In April, the commission on a 3-2 partisan vote killed a long-debated statewide energy efficiency program to be run by an independent third party after Republican commissioners argued the administrative cost for that program was too high.
Some commissioners boast their program only costs 1-2% of its budget to administer. But Lewis and his staff found the true administrative costs paid to contractors are between 30% and 35%. 
An analysis conducted by a commission consultant and shared by Lewis shows that by one metric, the commission’s program was nearly twice as expensive as the program commissioners rejected. That analysis said the commissioners’ program costs nearly 5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy saved, compared to the proposed third-party program, which would have cost 2.8 cents per kWh saved. 
Daniel Tait, a researcher with the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute who has investigated Louisiana’s public entities program, pointed to what he sees as hypocrisy in rejecting the independently administered program. 
“(The commissioners) want to yell about how energy efficiency is not a good investment,” Tait said. “Then they go over here to this public entities program, and they are wasting dollars left and right on ineffective energy efficiency programs.”
Consumer advocate Logan Atkinson Burke says the commissioners’ program does not directly help the people who need it the most in one of the nation’s poorest states. Louisiana residents use the most electricity per household in the United States. Upwards of one in five households in some parts of Louisiana can’t afford their monthly power bills.
At the same time, industries, which use almost half of Louisiana’s electricity, can opt out of paying for it. 
“I don’t think it’s appropriate,” Burke said, “for there to be such an opportunity for, quite frankly, patronage … to have zero-cost programs that low-income customers are paying for.”
Documentation missing, rules ignored
The energy efficiency programs run by Entergy Louisiana, Cleco and Southwestern Electric Power are guided by more than 12 pages of PSC rules requiring evaluation, verification and proof of cost effectiveness. The utilities must file hundreds of pages of documentation about their energy efficiency programs each year. Entergy Louisiana’s 2024 report was 520 pages. 
By contrast, the commissioners’ program requires a fraction of that documentation. The rules run just three pages. And record-keeping is scattershot; even the total amount spent on the program isn’t clear on an internal commission spreadsheet that loosely tracks the projects.
The few rules the commission has for its own program are not always followed. Floodlight could not locate any annual reports filed by any of the recipients, even though the eight-year-old program requires annual reports for three years after a project is finished. 
The PSC also could not find those records. Agency spokesperson Colby Cook said the agency would “circle back with recipients where the project has been completed to ensure they are in compliance with the reporting requirement.” 
The rules require a project “must demonstrate an improvement in energy efficiency.” But Lewis described the selection process as “undefined.” 
The applications are taken, evaluated, approved, and upon completion, inspected, almost entirely by the commissioners and their staff, though the commissioners began hiring part-time engineers in each district to help evaluate the applications in 2021. 
“This is an area of detail that is challenging and unlikely that commissioners or their staff would have the expertise in,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and national utility director for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
  A 2020 Facebook post by Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta urges residents to re-elect him, citing his work to bring energy efficiency projects to benefit local governments. Shortly afterward, the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute revealed that Skrmetta’s business partner had gotten millions of dollars in contracts under the program, which is run by individual commissioners within their districts. (Facebook via the Wayback Machine)
Not ‘designed for cost savings’
It’s difficult to tell whether the prices charged under the commissioner-led program are fair. 
The invoices and projects are hard to compare, said Mike Morris, owner of MM Energy Solutions, the largest contractor with the public entities program. Even in the one district where a commissioner requires three bids on every project, those bids might be for completely different projects. 
Contractors don’t respond to a request for proposals (RFP) for the projects — which is standard in government contracting — but instead submit proposals they devise on their own. One might propose new tube lights, Morris said, while another flat panel lights, which can be more expensive but provide better lighting.
“There’s no way to compare it, because there’s no RFP with specifics on what you are actually bidding on,” he said. “It’s really hard to put an exact apple-to-apple on all this.”
In addition, Floodlight found that some of the projects approved by the commissioners won’t last long enough to pay for themselves. 
According to the PSC’s own records, it would take an estimated 249 years’ worth of energy savings at $600 a year to pay off the $124,000 cost of new lights on a softball field in Ascension Parish, south of Baton Rouge. And in 128 years, energy savings from lighting upgrades around Jefferson Parish would finally pay for the $650,000 cost of those lights. 
Floodlight found one-fifth of the commission’s projects will take more than 10 years to pay off — a common benchmark to determine if a project is worth the investment. 
Commissioners acknowledge replacing infrequently used lights, such as those at ballfields, is not the most effective for energy efficiency but that those projects benefit entire communities. 
The commissioners’ program “has not been designed for cost savings,” Burke said. 
“It has been designed to be an opportunity for … five elected officials to dole out money to the political entity of their choice.”
Program emerges ’out of the blue’
Harry Lopez in Iberia Parish isn’t the only one unfamiliar with the PSC’s public entities program. When Louisiana’s utility-run program came up for reauthorization in 2017, then-Commissioner Lambert Boissiere, a Democrat, introduced a never-publicly-discussed proposal to establish a commission-run energy efficiency program. It passed unanimously.
Bradley-Wright, who then worked at the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said the establishment of a new efficiency program was a complete surprise. 
“To my knowledge it had never come up before and did indeed come out of the blue,” Bradley-Wright said.
Floodlight found that Boissiere, who led the charge for the program, didn’t use any of that money for energy efficiency projects in his district for four years — until 2021. Longtime incumbent Boissiere was defeated in 2022 by Lewis, who inherited $16 million in unspent energy efficiency funds. 
Boissiere acknowledges the program has flaws.
“I felt that, in my opinion, it could have been administered in a more transparent manner,” he said. “It would make the policy that much better. I just always fought to make it a little better.”
Morris says many of the schools he’s worked at are long overdue for a lighting upgrade. He says some of the lighting hadn’t been changed since he went to middle school in Opelousas. Morris is 70.
“You ought to talk to these people in these schools,” Republican Commission Chairman Mike Francis said. “They’re flipping out man, with their cost savings and the new lights. They’re even complaining they’re too bright.”
Even Lewis, who has concerns about the program, isn’t shy about promoting its outcomes. Last year, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram with a $1.46 million check with officials from Southern University, which received more than $4 million from Lewis for energy-efficiency projects.
  The fees for the state’s energy efficiency programs are collected as two line items on customers’ bills as shown in this Southern University utility bill from 2022. Half of the revenue collected goes to an efficiency program run by Louisiana’s major utilities (the QS rider), and the other half (PE rider) funds the public entities program. (PSC records)
‘Free enterprise’ at work?
The public entities program is not advertised anywhere on the PSC website. It has received little press since it was created. Schools and other public agencies largely learn about the program like Lopez did, through a contractor who approaches them and offers to prepare an application to the appropriate commissioner. 
Skrmetta calls it “free enterprise,” with contractors talking to local governments to find out what they need.
In the early years of the program, one of Skrmetta’s business partners in a film production company won most of the contracts, according to research done by Tait of the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI). 
Since Tait blew the whistle on the relationship between Skrmetta and Jason Hewitt in 2020, Hewitt’s company, Brillant Efficiencies, no longer works with the program. 
“After this article came out,” Hewitt told Floodlight in an email, “we simply could no longer do business in the program as the negative press was too much to overcome.”
But Hewitt’s company had problems long before the EPI report.
In early 2020, Commissioner Foster Campbell refused to pay Brilliant Efficiencies the full amount invoiced for a completed lighting project at Grambling State University after repeatedly instructing Brilliant Efficiencies over several years to scale back the scope of the project. 
After Hewitt was awarded that contract, the Democratic commissioner implemented a bidding procedure in his district. His staff sought after-the-fact bids on the Grambling project, discovering “gaping price disparities” of up to $200,000 between Brilliant Efficiencies’ bid and other companies’ bids. 
Hewitt defended his work in a 77-page response to Campbell, saying among other things that the price comparisons were unfair and citing “unexpected delays and costs” associated with the new program. 
Skrmetta denied steering any business to Hewitt. Francis also denies favoritism in the program. 
“It looks like we’ve just got a couple of special friends,” Francis said, “and that’s just not the case at all.” 
Floodlight reviewed campaign finance records from 2017 on, finding seven donations totalling $6,250 to three commissioners from contractors who got business through the public entities program. 
A 2024 Floodlight investigation found Louisiana PSC members have cozy ties with the utilities they regulate, receiving nearly 43% of their campaign donations over the past 10 years — more than $8 million — from those companies and their allies. Louisiana law also lets commissioners engage in unreported private chats with representatives of the utilities they regulate — ”ex parte” communications that are banned or subject to strict reporting requirements in many other states, Floodlight found.
Burke says without a transparent selection process, entities without connections to the commissioners could be left out. “They are not selected on (the) most, greatest cost effectiveness,” she said. “It’s simply unclear who, how and and why winners and losers are selected.”
Dearth of bidding raises questions
The bulk of the work is handled by just a few contractors, including Morris, who started his contracting firm, MM Energy Solutions, in 2020 after a career in health and fitness. 
He quipped: “This is a lot easier than to try to convince a bunch of Cajun people to quit eating boudin, crackers and drinking beer.”
Morris says it’s the quality of his work — not his connections — that have led to contracts and subcontracts for more than 180 of the 515 projects approved. 
“Mike Francis is not handing out stuff to me. I got to earn my business. I’ve always had to earn my business with these guys,” Morris said. 
Campbell is the only commissioner who requires multiple bids for projects. In 2020, he introduced a motion to require bidding on all commission projects. It failed on a party-line 3-2 vote. 
Lewis says his office has received letters from the utilities — which pay the public entities’ contractors directly — questioning some program costs. The three utilities declined to comment on any problems with the program.
“The utilities have been very clear that this program is not run correctly,” Lewis said, citing concerns over inflated costs for light bulbs and invoices that are not “fully correct.” 
Lewis asked an Entergy Louisiana representative to discuss those issues at the PSC’s April meeting. But Larry Hand, Entergy’s vice president of regulatory affairs, demurred.
“Ultimately it is a commission-led program,” Hand said. “When we get the approval from the (commissioner’s) office and also from the (PSC) … that triggers our obligation to pay.”
Campbell says it’s up to the individual commissioners to make sure the job is done well “and not just take people’s word for it.” Campbell and Lewis have pushed for program reforms. Francis, the chairman, says he’s open to changes.
“If we get a majority of the commissioners say, ’Let’s put more checks and balances on the public entity side,’ I won’t disagree with that,” Francis said. “But right now, I feel comfortable with what kind of value we’re getting for the money we’re spending.”

Dozens of insurance companies, including Cigna, Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare, agreed to several measures, which include making fewer medical procedures subject to prior authorization and speeding up the review process. Insurers also pledged to use clear language when communicating with patients and promised that medical professionals would review coverage denials.
While Trump administration officials applauded the insurance industry for its willingness to change, they acknowledged limitations of the agreement.
“The pledge is not a mandate,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said during a news conference. “This is an opportunity for the industry to show itself.”
Oz said he wants insurers to eliminate preapprovals for knee arthroscopy, a common, minimally invasive procedure to diagnose and treat knee problems. Chris Klomp, director of the Center for Medicare at CMS, recommended prior authorization be eliminated for vaginal deliveries, colonoscopies, and cataract surgeries, among other procedures. Health insurers said the changes would benefit most Americans, including those with commercial or private coverage, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care.
The insurers have also agreed that patients who switch insurance plans may continue receiving treatment or other health care services for 90 days without facing immediate prior authorization requirements imposed by their new insurer.
But health policy analysts say prior authorization — a system that forces some people to delay care or abandon treatment — may continue to pose serious health consequences for affected patients. That said, many people may not notice a difference, even if insurers follow through on their new commitments.
“So much of the prior authorization process is behind the black box,” said Kaye Pestaina, director of the Program on Patient and Consumer Protections at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Often, she said, patients aren’t even aware that they’re subject to prior authorization requirements until they face a denial.
“I’m not sure how this changes that,” Pestaina said.
The pledge from insurers follows the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot in midtown Manhattan in early December on the way to an investor meeting, forcing the issue of prior authorization to the forefront.
Oz acknowledged “violence in the streets” prompted Monday’s announcement. Klomp told KFF Health News that insurers were reacting to the shooting because the problem has “reached a fever pitch.” Health insurance CEOs now move with security details wherever they go, Klomp said.
“There’s no question that health insurers have a reputation problem,” said Robert Hartwig, an insurance expert and a clinical associate professor at the University of South Carolina.
The pledge shows that insurers are hoping to stave off “more draconian” legislation or regulation in the future, Hartwig said.
But government interventions to improve prior authorization will be used “if we’re forced to use them,” Oz said during the news conference.
“The administration has made it clear we’re not going to tolerate it anymore,” he said. “So either you fix it or we’re going to fix it.”
Here are the key takeaways for consumers:
1. Prior authorization isn’t going anywhere.
Health insurers will still be allowed to deny doctor-recommended care, which is arguably the biggest criticism that patients and providers level against insurance companies. And it isn’t clear how the new commitments will protect the sickest patients, such as those diagnosed with cancer, who need the most expensive treatment.
2. Reform efforts aren’t new.
Most states have already passed at least one law imposing requirements on insurers, often intended to reduce the time patients spend waiting for answers from their insurance company and to require transparency from insurers about which prescriptions and procedures require preapproval. Some states have also enacted “gold card” programs for doctors that allow physicians with a robust record of prior authorization approvals to bypass the requirements.
Nationally, rules proposed by the first Trump administration and finalized by the Biden administration are already set to take effect next year. They will require insurers to respond to requests within seven days or 72 hours, depending on their urgency, and to process prior authorization requests electronically, instead of by phone or fax, among other changes. Those rules apply only to certain categories of insurance, including Medicare Advantage and Medicaid.
Beyond that, some insurance companies committed to improvement long before Monday’s announcement. Earlier this year, UnitedHealthcare pledged to reduce prior authorization volume by 10%. Cigna announced its own set of improvements in February.
3. Insurance companies are already supposed to be doing some of these things.
For example, the Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to communicate with patients in plain language about health plan benefits and coverage.
But denial letters remain confusing because companies tend to use jargon. For instance, AHIP, the health insurance industry trade group, used the term “non-approved requests” in Monday’s announcement.
Insurers also pledged that medical professionals would continue to review prior authorization denials. AHIP claims this is “a standard already in place.” But recent lawsuits allege otherwise, accusing companies of denying claims in a matter of seconds.
4. Health insurers will increasingly rely on artificial intelligence.
Health insurers issue millions of denials every year, though most prior authorization requests are quickly, sometimes even instantly, approved.
The use of AI in making prior authorization decisions isn’t new — and it will probably continue to ramp up, with insurers pledging Monday to issue 80% of prior authorization decisions “in real-time” by 2027.
“Artificial intelligence should help this tremendously,” Rep. Gregory Murphy (R-N.C.), a physician, said during the news conference.
“But remember, artificial intelligence is only as good as what you put into it,” he added.
Results from a survey published by the American Medical Association in February indicated 61% of physicians are concerned that the use of AI by insurance companies is already increasing denials.
5. Key details remain up in the air.
Oz said CMS will post a full list of participating insurers this summer, while other details will become public by January.
He said insurers have agreed to post data about their use of prior authorization on a public dashboard, but it isn’t clear when that platform will be unveiled. The same holds true for “performance targets” that Oz spoke of during the news conference. He did not name specific targets, indicate how they will be made public, or specify how the government would enforce them.
While the AMA, which represents doctors, applauded the announcement, “patients and physicians will need specifics demonstrating that the latest insurer pledge will yield substantive actions,” the association’s president, Bobby Mukkamala, said in a statement. He noted that health insurers made “past promises” to improve prior authorization in 2018.
Meanwhile, it also remains unclear what services insurers will ultimately agree to release from prior authorization requirements.
Patient advocates are in the process of identifying “low-value codes,” Oz said, that should not require preapproval, but it is unknown when those codes will be made public or when insurers will agree to release them from prior authorization rules.

This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.  Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Out-of-state doctors are pushing for laws that will make it harder to detect who prescribes and sends abortion medication, as anti-abortion lawmakers look for ways to stop the flow of pills to their states.
Patients have continued to receive abortion pills in states with near-total bans, so much so that the number of abortions has actually increased since the fall of Roe v. Wade, despite near-total abortion bans. This is mostly thanks to “shield laws.” Working from states like New York, California and Massachusetts, providers meet virtually with pregnant patients in states with bans and write them abortion pill prescriptions. Patients receive the pills in the mail to take from home. One in 5 abortions are now done through telehealth, according to the Society of Family Planning, and about half of those are for people getting care because of shield laws.

THE NEVADA CONTEXT
The Nevada State Legislature this year passed Assembly Bill 411, which would have allowed prescriptions for drugs used for medical abortions and miscarriage management to list the name of the prescribing health care practice, rather than the name of the specific individual providing the prescription. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed the bill, writing in his veto letter that he believed the bill would reduce transparency in clinical follow-up situations where identifying the prescribing providers quickly may be crucial. – April Corbin Girnus

Now, doctors are working to anonymize that process by pushing to hide the name of the prescriber from the labels of mifepristone and misoprostol — the two drugs used in medication abortions. The effort marks a new step in the escalating battle between states over whether and how people in America can get abortions — and to what extent individual states’ laws can influence medical care coming from another.
“We are seeing two very different worlds right now in the United States in terms of the directions of laws and policies,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who provides telehealth abortions from Massachusetts to people in states with bans. “Shield law states are doing more to not only protect reproductive rights within their own state, but to protect avenues for all abortion seekers in the country to be able to get safe and legal care.”
Typically, prescription bottles include information such as the name of the doctor who prescribed medication, details about the medication and appropriate dosage, and the name of the patient receiving medication. But that information has become invaluable in civil and criminal cases filed by anti-abortion law enforcement officers.
A handful of states — New York, Maine, Vermont and Washington — have already passed laws to remove prescriber names from abortion pill bottles. Proposed legislation in Massachusetts, currently working through the state Senate, would similarly allow this change, although at least one shield law practice in the state, Foster’s Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project, has already removed prescribing doctors’ names from pill bottles citing guidance they received from the state attorney general.
A proposal in California, the largest shield law state, would go a step further. The bill, currently making its way through the state Senate, would remove not only the name of the prescribing health care provider but also the patient receiving medication. Proponents say that could protect patients who are concerned about someone discovering they ordered abortion pills.
The legislative trend comes as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. Both Texas and Louisiana’s attorneys general have pushed criminal and civil cases targeting Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based physician who allegedly prescribed abortion pills to patients in those states. The cases pose a first test of shield laws and are likely to ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
The Texas suit against Carpenter was filed after a pregnant woman in the state developed bleeding and went to the hospital, according to court filings from the state. The filings assert that the “biological father of the unborn child” found medications that appeared to be prescribed by Carpenter.
“If an abusive partner were to find a package of abortion pills in the trash can, if it says Dr. XYZ, already you have someone to name in a lawsuit,” said Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has advised state lawmakers on crafting shield laws. “If it doesn’t have it, it’s a critical piece of information. How do you know who prescribed the pills?”
Separately, legislators in Texas unsuccessfully sought to end telehealth prescriptions with a bill, which died in the legislature, that would have allowed anyone to sue people who prescribe or send abortion pills to Texans for at least $100,000. Louisiana lawmakers are poised to pass legislation that would create similar punishment structures, allowing the “biological father,” his parents, or the parents of the pregnant person to file civil suits against out-of-state abortion providers.
Abortion rights supporters say that removing the doctor’s name from a prescription label would add security for those who rely on shield laws but are nervous about heightened efforts to target providers, a concern that has only grown since this weekend’s shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses. News outlets have reported that the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter, had a list of alleged targets in his car that included abortion providers.
“It goes a long way in ensuring that providers are protected at a time when we’ve seen increased violence and animus toward abortion providers and reproductive health providers generally,” said Lizzie Hinkley, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which worked to help pass such a bill in New York. “Anyone who has their name on a pill bottle will risk detection by hostile parties in states that have banned abortion.”
One California doctor who practices with telehealth practice A Safe Choice said he deliberately keeps a low profile. Only a few close friends know about his work providing abortions to people out-of-state. But through his organization, he hears almost once a week from other health care professionals who want to offer telehealth abortions to patients living under bans. He believes a bill like California’s could encourage even more to do so.
“Allowing the provision of services without the providers needing to put their name on the prescription labels will add an additional layer of security and confidence for the providers,” said the doctor, who asked that his name be withheld because of the ongoing legal threats against abortion providers. “This is a very important next step.”
The California bill could have an outsized impact. Most shield law prescriptions are filled by California-based pharmacies. That includes those called in by doctors who are practicing in other states, such as New York, but who don’t want to mail the pills themselves.
“There is no pharmacy in New York state that mails pills for us, so we have to rely on pharmacies in California,” said one physician in New York, who asked that her name be withheld because of the legal actions taken against Carpenter. “All the shield law providers across the country are waiting with bated breath for this bill to be passed.”
New York has passed a law removing prescriber names from abortion medication labels created in the state, she said, but that hasn’t affected her. Because she calls prescriptions into a pharmacy in California the labels are subject to the Golden State’s laws — and as a result, her name is still listed on the bottle when she orders abortion pills for out-of-state patients. Her patients live in states all over the country.
“It’s very stressful. I wish we could get California to move a bit faster,” she said.
The California bill has been approved by the state’s lower chamber but is still awaiting Senate passage. It’s faced little resistance and has received support from the state’s attorney general and lieutenant governor. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has built a public profile in part through vocal support of abortion protections, has not weighed in, and his office said he does not comment on pending legislation.
Still, there are legal questions about bills like California’s. Federal law requires that medication labels include the prescriber’s name — a stipulation that some argue could conflict with and possibly override the state-level protection.
But these questions haven’t been raised regarding other similar laws. Some legal scholars argued that the federal statute is ambiguous, and that pharmacies could say the state law still satisfies federal requirement by including the name of a medical practice — as New York’s and Maine’s do — rather than of an individual prescribing doctor or nurse.
“If you have the address and the practice and you’re able to easily identify where the prescription came from, that’s the purpose of this rule,” said Rachel Rebouché, dean of the Temple University School of Law. “The issue is being able to, for safety reasons and for monitoring, understand that someone who has the authority to do this has done it. There’s no question that putting the name of the practice does that.”
The blue-state push comes as abortion opponents have stepped up their efforts not only in individual states, but in their quest for national restrictions on mifepristone, calling for the federal government to prohibit dispensing it through telehealth.
That campaign has included building a body of research that they say highlights its potential risks — which runs against mainstream medical findings and that some researchers have said rely on “junk science.”
While President Donald Trump has remained quiet on abortion, members of his administration have suggested openness to curbing access to medication. This month, Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary committed to having his agency review mifepristone’s approval, though it’s not clear what that would ultimately mean. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he supports taking another look at the drug’s safety.
“In light of the situation at the FDA, it is urgent to ensure that California clinicians and pharmacists can prescribe and deliver mifepristone to the patients who rely on us,” Dr. Kelly Pfeifer, a California-based doctor who also provides abortions in Kansas, said at a committee hearing for the state’s bill. “This bill will allow us to continue to treat our patients even if politicians in Washington act against the science to further limit mifepristone.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/abortion-pills-scaled-1-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

This malign neglect directed towards children and teenagers is evident in Gov. Ron DeSantis’ continued pretense that there are no starving school-aged children, and that the state is more than capable of providing food and sustenance to them.
Organizations that provide food have long been raising the alarm about persistent hunger in the Sunshine State.
According to Feeding America, more than 2.3 million people endure hunger in Florida, with researchers estimating that between 613,000 and 800,000 of them are children.
However, DeSantis World ignores such realities because who knows better what we the people need than a petty, vindictive politician?
Child hunger in Florida has become nakedly partisan, as evidenced by DeSantis’ continued war against America’s poor, middle, and working classes. Twice in the past two years, the governor has refused about $500 million in federal monies for summer and school lunch programs. His people claim programs already operating in the state can more than handle the need.
In December 2023, Mallory McManus, deputy chief of staff of the Florida Department of Children and Families, told reporters: “We anticipate that our state’s full approach to serving children will continue to be successful this year without any additional federal programs that inherently always come with some federal strings attached.”
 ‘We’re good’
Advocates on the ground strenuously disagreed.
“One of the statements we continue to hear is that Florida already offers summer meal programs and therefore we’re good, we don’t really need a program such as Sun Bucks [a federal food program]. I surely wish that were true,” said Sky Beard, Florida program director of No Kid Hungry.
“The work we and other partners do demonstrates that’s an inaccurate perception. Less than 10% of children who participate in free and reduced lunch during the school year are also able to get a summer meal.”
No Kid Hungry Florida issued a report in 2024 that detailed food insecurity’s effects on low-income and even middle-income Florida families and children as a result of the increasingly untenable cost of living. The report found that 72% of Floridians found it more difficult to afford groceries compared to the year before.
“This burden isn’t limited to lower-income households; 60% of middle-income families, earning between $50,000 to $99,000, are also feeling the pinch. Amidst a growing affordability crisis, putting nutritious meals on the table has become a daunting task for many,” the report says.
Meanwhile, DeSantis and his MAGA Republicans allies are steadfastly rejecting federal funds — on ideological grounds — to expand Medicaid for the working poor, the vulnerable, and those mired in poverty.
 Discarding children
The organization ProtectOurCare detailed DeSantis’ longstanding antipathy towards providing access to healthcare via the Affordable Care Act.
“As governor, Ron DeSantis has 0revented hundreds of thousands of Florida residents — disproportionately people of color — from receiving coverage by refusing the expand Medicaid,” the organization said in a fact sheet on its website.
“Florida Republicans, led by Ron DeSantis since 2019, have been blocking Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, preventing up to 726,000 Floridians from obtaining Medicaid coverage, remaining a ‘hard no’ on expanding Medicaid even as millions of residents faced hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Of the hundreds of thousands of currently uninsured residents that would become eligible for the program if DeSantis expanded Medicaid under the ACA, around 57% are people of color, with Black residents disproportionately shut out of coverage, comprising 28 percent of those in the coverage gap despite forming just 17% of Florida overall.”
This indecent, immoral behavior and the scripted discarding of children is perhaps seen most profoundly with DeSantis and Republicans’ cold-hearted disregard for the slaughter of the state’s children because of America’s obsession with guns and Republicans’ obeisance to the National Rifle Association and the formidable gun lobby.
Florida’s next generation is dying in alarming numbers and neither DeSantis nor any of his Republican MAGA allies has raised a hand to protect young people as people have endured school shootings and suicides.
In Florida, like the rest of the United States, guns account for the most deaths among children and teenagers. According to CNN, gun deaths continue to be the leading cause of death for young people since surpassing car accidents in 2020.
 Preventable
Everytown, America’s largest gun violence-prevention organization, tells us that “mass shootings haunt our nation’s collective conscience. Each breaking-news alert floods the nation with grief, fear, and anger at the countless acts of preventable violence.”
Perhaps most heartbreaking is that the vast majority of these deaths are preventable. Among children and teens:

Firearms are the leading cause of death for American children and teens.
More than 2,800 children and teens die by gun homicide every year. For children under the age of 13, these gun homicides most frequently occur in the home and are often connected to domestic or family violence.
Black children and teens in the U.S. are more than 18 times more likely than white children and teens of the same age to die by gun homicide.
Firearms accounted for 18% of childhood deaths (ages 1 to 18) in 2023, the most recent year for which data are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 3,500 children died in gun-related incidents that year. That’s about five children lost for every 100,000 children in the United States. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to a KFF analysis.
This weak response has been profoundly influenced by the National Rifle Association and America’s gun lobby. All victims and communities get from DeSantis, Republicans, and the NRA are “thoughts and prayers,” and legislation to bolster school security and promote mental health services. Their prescriptions fall far short of dealing with this national nightmare.
 Backtracking
Unbelievably, Gov. DeSantis has said he supports repealing the existing age requirements that prohibits 18-20-year-olds from buying rifles, shotguns, and other long guns from licensed gun dealers and handguns from private owners. He also advocates repealing red-flag laws and wants to allow Floridians to open-carry weapons.
Meanwhile, DeSantis on May 28 signed into law HB 6025, which eliminates restrictions on firearm and ammunition sales during locally declared emergencies.
The effects of gun violence are incalculable in terms of the loss of life, injuries, psychological damage, and economic fallout.
“Mass shootings in the U.S. have significant consequences for mental health, the economy, and community well-being,” according to a recent INFORMS Marketing Science Journal study. “They can lead to long-term mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, not only for direct victims but also for those exposed to the events or living in affected communities … .”
Where is the anger; where is the outrage? Where are the voluminous public protests and demands that our “leaders” do their damn jobs. Are we to believe that the majority of Florida’s parents are cool with what our political leaders have done, are doing?
When it comes to stamping out violent crime, these people refuse to restrict unlawful gun purchases; implement universal background checks; safety training; safe and secure gun storage; implementing stricter provisions on gun owners carrying firearms in public spaces; concealed carry permit requirements and limitations; or limits on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which can cause extensive harm.
Theologian and activist Traci Blackmon captures the barbarism in which the MAGA Republican minority is so completely immersed:
“Who is this ‘god’ they worship? This god of guns but not of grace? This god of greed but not generosity? This god of the womb but not of the woman?”
And the children suffer.

(Screenshot from oral arguments)Indiana’s highest court weighed allegations of TikTok’s alleged deceptive practices in the Hoosier State on Tuesday, skeptical of arguments from both sides about jurisdictional issues. 
The two suits, heard together, were filed by Attorney General Todd Rokita against the popular, short-form video app in December 2022 in Fort Wayne. He accused TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, of violating Indiana’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act with its age rating for those 12 and older — claiming that it contained more sexual content, profanity and drug references than advertised.
Rokita’s TikTok legal battle part of array of contingency fee contracts

The above made TikTok unsafe for children, he continued. Additionally, he claimed in a separate lawsuit that the company failed to protect user data from the Chinese Communist Party.
Justices noted ongoing national security concerns about the app, including a rare bipartisan law requiring ByteDance to sell the app to an American company. President Donald Trump, who embraced the app in his second campaign, has intervened and delayed that law’s implementation three times. 
“Congress doesn’t agree on much, but they agreed on this. And the (U.S.) Supreme Court said it’s okay to (ban) in this context,” said Justice Christoper Goff. “But now, we’re on pause … this seems to be a completely unique circumstance. And I cannot, for the life of me, imagine, with all of that going on, why it would be appropriate for us, or reasonable for us, to cite the precedent to exercise jurisdiction here and write a rule for all time.”
Conservative and liberal lawmakers both cite worries about TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Some have openly wondered if the app feeds user data to Chinese authorities, including Rokita.
“Our lawsuit against TikTok was filed to protect our children and to protect our data privacy that we allege is being stolen by the Chinese Communist Party. We maintain their business model intentionally deceives children and adults to drive up profits by saying it is appropriate for kids and that your personal data is safe. Neither is true,” the office said in a statement in 2023. 
The lower courts dismissed Rokita’s suits and the agency appealed the case to the Indiana Supreme Court. State attorneys on Tuesday countered that the “federal law over the divestiture of ownership of TikTok has nothing to do with this case,” maintaining that the issue at hand was “deceptive and misleading representations made to consumers.”
 Arguments before the court

Attorney Brian Paul, representing TikTok and ByteDance, argued that the Indiana Supreme Court wasn’t the appropriate venue for the case, which is the first issue before the justices.
“Indiana is seeking to punish TikTok for statements that were not made in Indiana, that are not about Indiana, that were not targeted at Indiana and were not tailored to Indiana,” Paul said in his opening remarks. 
The state previously argued that justices could intervene because Hoosiers enter into user contracts with TikTok when they download the app.
Paul said because TikTok has no physical presence in the state, not even a server, Indiana wasn’t appropriate for the lawsuit — though the company makes $46 million off of Hoosier data annually by using collected data to tailor advertiser content, plaintiffs said.

Justices seemed to doubt that reasoning, pointing to other products, like magazines shipped across state boundaries, and legal precedent. 
“TikTok seeks to escape the rules that apply to everyone else, from print magazines to burger franchises,” said Solicitor General James Barta, arguing on behalf of the state. 
Barta said that these “daily exchange(s) of data” are used by the plaintiffs to craft “addictive content” based on user locations to earn millions.
“And yet, TikTok says Indiana courts can do nothing to hold it accountable for misleading and deceptive statements that induced Indiana parents to download this app for themselves or for their children, and that ultimately end up harming children and other users,” Barta concluded.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush wondered if such a broad application of Indiana law might capture other apps and social media companies anytime a Hoosiers accepts a website’s cookies or agrees to a user contract. 
“Every one of those is going to be subject to (our jurisdiction) no matter where they’re located or the product?” Rush asked. “… are we going to now have personal jurisdiction of any company that grabs and sells data in Indiana, no matter how small?”
That concern appeared to resonate with some of Rush’s fellow justices. 
“The implications for things like free speech, for interstate commerce seemed, to me, to be just breathtaking,” said Goff.

In response, Barta said the core of the case was about deception and misleading consumers and that the state “has a significant interest in protecting its consumers, in having its courts interpret its laws.”
Justice Derek Molter noted, however, that it was “unusual” to claim a violation of Indiana’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act without the exchange of money. 
“… it is core to TikTok’s business model to be able to monetize users’ time and attention and this is, of course, not the only company that does this,” Barta said. “… it would be awfully odd to say that the legislature has been completely unaware of this, and yet has decided to do nothing about it with the Deceptive Consumer Sales Act.”
He said the law doesn’t cover “free” transactions, but does apply to an exchange of goods and services. He contends that Tiktok users exchange their data for entertainment. The state is seeking civil penalties and a jury trial as allowed under that law. 
Justices, led by Rush, indicated they would issue their ruling “in due course.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-25 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Richard Jordan set to be executed,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/25/richard-jordan-set-to-be-executed/,Richard Jordan's appeals to courts and for clemency from the governor fail to halt scheduled execution.,"Barring a last minute reprieve, the state of Mississippi is set to execute Richard Jordan this evening. 
Attorneys representing the 79-year-old, the state’s oldest and longest serving inmate on death row, filed a flurry of motions with the U.S. Supreme Court and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals this week. As of today, the appeals court denied his request for stay, and the high court hads not responded to a request for stay.
A week after receiving a clemency petition for Jordan, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves denied it. Reeves has not granted anyone clemency during his two terms in office. 
He said Jordan admitted being guilty of kidnapping Edwina Marter at gunpoint from her family’s home in coastal Harrison County in 1976 while her 3-year-old son was sleeping, and of forcing Marter to drive into a forest and killing her by shooting her in the back of the head.
“At this time, all necessary procedures are being followed with the anticipation that the execution will proceed as scheduled.”
Jordan was first convicted in 1976 for the kidnapping and murder of 34-year-old Edwina Marter, a mother of two, on the Gulf Coast. 
He had four trials before a death sentence stuck in 1998, and in the following decades, Jordan has sought appeals of his conviction. 
Edwina Marter’s now-adult sons, Eric and Kevin, and her husband, Charles, do not plan to attend the execution, but Edwina Marter’s brother is expected to be a witness. 
Eric Marter previously told Mississippi Today that he would have liked Jordan’s death sentence to have been carried out sooner, not almost 50 years after the fact. 
Advocates from the state, the South and beyond have called for Jordan’s sentence to be commuted to life without the possibility of parole, echoing some reasons cited by Jordan’s attorneys, including his age and potential safety risk, how long he has been in prison, and a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder from service in the Vietnam War. 
About a decade ago, Jordan and fellow death row inmate Ricky Chase became the lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s execution lethal injection protocol. 
Last week, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate ruled that Jordan’s execution could proceed, writing that he had not proved that the state’s lethal injection protocol was likely to cause “serious illness and needless suffering.”
He also cited a previous Supreme Court ruling that states the 8th Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment doesn’t guarantee prisoners a painless death. 
Wingate, however, did issue a provision: the state has to stop Jordan’s execution if he shows signs of consciousness. 
This is the second execution Wingate has allowed to proceed for plaintiffs and intervenors in the lawsuit. The previous death row inmate who asked Wingate for a stay based on his involvement in the suit was Thomas Loden Jr., who was executed in 2022.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081403/AP060710014048.jpg,,,2025-06-25 08:03:30.138174

House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, on Monday formed the Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform and empowered it to study Missouri’s property tax system and recommend “solutions to ensure fairness, transparency and sustainability for taxpayers and municipalities across the state.”
The committee’s formation comes on the heels of Patterson floating the idea of a special legislative session in September, when lawmakers are already required to consider whether to override gubernatorial vetoes.
“You go around to any of the counties… and they’re bringing up property taxes,” Patterson said earlier this month. “This is a huge problem. I would say it goes to crisis levels.”
Property taxes are the main source of revenue for local governments, funding schools, public safety and other functions. Rising housing costs, coupled with property reassessments, have put the way the taxes are calculated under the microscope, with lawmakers looking to provide relief to taxpayers without bankrupting local governments.
Missouri school funding task force turns its attention to property tax inequities

The topic even emerged as part of discussion over the state’s public school funding formula. A state task force created to study Missouri’s education spending spent its latest hearing this week focused on how property taxes have contributed funding inequities.
When Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into session earlier this month to consider a $1.5 billion incentive package for professional sports stadiums in Kansas City, he agreed to allow an amendment requiring most counties to put a hard cap on increases in property tax bills.
In 75 counties, tax bills would not increase more than 5% per year from a base amount, or the rate of inflation, whichever is less. In 22 others, no increase in the basic bill would be allowed.There are exceptions built in for newly voted levies and the additional value from improvements.
Many of the larger counties of the state, including Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis, were excluded altogether from the legislation.
The property tax amendment caused a fissure among conservatives in the Missouri Senate. Some supported the measure in an attempt to win tax relief concessions during the special session. Others decried it as an unconstitutional bait and switch designed to fool taxpayers, pointing to a requirement in the Missouri Constitution that property taxes be “uniform upon the same class or subclass of subjects.”
Even Patterson, who voted in support of the bill that included stadium funding and the property tax cap, acknowledged questions about whether it could survive a constitutional challenge.
“One thing I don’t do is guess what is going to happen in our courts,” Patterson said. “I’ve heard from a lot of attorneys that say it absolutely is. I’ve heard from some that said that it isn’t. I do think it’s constitutional.”
The interim committee created by Patterson will hold seven hearings across the state this summer to gather input and explore legislative solutions. State Rep. Tim Taylor, a Republican from Bunceton, will serve as chairman.
State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Columbia Democrat, will serve as the ranking minority member.
“Property taxes are one of the most common concerns we hear from Missourians,” Taylor said, “and it’s clear that our system needs a closer look.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125_patterson1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

I have watched patients come back from the edge only to wake up to nothing: a referral sheet, no phone, no ride, and no plan. The ER doors close, but the crisis continues.
Narcan, or naloxone, is often called an overdose antidote. That is not how it works. It does not resolve an overdose. It interrupts it. It buys time. What exists in that time, or does not, determines what happens next. In many parts of Missouri, that time leads nowhere.
In my region, the nearest detox facility may be two counties away. Behavioral health beds are nearly impossible to find. Transportation is unreliable or nonexistent. Follow-up care, when it exists, is often out of reach or out of network.
I have seen people arrive unresponsive, receive Narcan, then walk out of the hospital hours later. No ride. No contact. No plan. Just a printout and a warning. That is not recovery. That is abandonment.
Medicaid expansion was supposed to address some of these failures. It did not. Coverage on paper does not mean care in practice. I have seen patients with active Medicaid turned away because no local provider would accept them. I have watched people deteriorate while waiting for treatment that never came.
We were trained to administer Narcan. We were not trained to discharge someone into the same conditions that nearly killed them. There is no protocol for that moment. No guidance for the guilt that follows.
Narcan became available without a prescription in 2023. That mattered. But availability is not the same as access.
In the Ozarks and the Bootheel, many pharmacies still do not stock it. Some pharmacists still refuse to dispense it. Insurance coverage is inconsistent. Stigma continues to decide who receives care and who is left behind.
When formal systems failed, local initiatives stepped up. Programs like MO-CORPS trained bartenders, teachers, shelter workers and pastors. They distributed thousands of naloxone kits. They stocked Narcan in gas stations and churches. They did it on limited funding because they live in these communities, too.
In 2024, Missouri saw a 25% drop in overdose deaths — the first real progress in years.
In 2025, Congress proposed cutting $56 million from naloxone programs. That money supplies clinics, jails, and shelters. It trains first responders. It keeps people alive. Cutting it is not streamlining. It is surrender.
Some claim that we have done enough. That Narcan is widely available and the rest is a matter of personal responsibility. But anyone who has worked in a rural ER knows that survival does not end when someone starts breathing again. It begins there. What happens next is what matters. And in too many cases, there is no next.
Narcan is not treatment. It is not housing. It is not transportation. It is not recovery. It is a tool. It buys time. Without systems to support that time, we are wasting it.
Scaling back now is not efficient. It is dangerous.
In rural Missouri, it will mean fewer kits in squad cars. Longer waits for ambulances. More people dying alone. More families finding their loved ones too late.
We know what works. We are choosing not to fund it. That is not a lapse in policy. It is a failure of will.
Fund naloxone programs. Protect MO-CORPS. Require Narcan in public buildings. Expand Medicaid-funded treatment. Train rural providers in trauma-informed care. Stop making survival dependent on zip code and income.
I have pushed Narcan. I have managed the drip. I have watched people wake up to a world that offers them no way forward.
This could have been the start of something stronger.
Instead, we are watching it disappear.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Narcan-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)With the state’s budget deadline less than a week away, the Wisconsin State Assembly approved a slate of bills that would create new programs but withheld funding, which Republicans said would come later. Democrats criticized Republicans, saying they couldn’t trust that the funding would actually be passed. The body also approved a pair of bills related to nuclear power and bills that will increase penalties for criminal offenses.
Assembly Republicans gathered ahead of the floor session to stress the need for bipartisan negotiations and progress on writing the state budget.
Budget negotiations fell apart last week for the second time as Senate Republicans walked away from talks with Gov. Tony Evers. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said in a statement at the time that discussions were “heading in a direction that taxpayers cannot afford.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said during a press conference that he has been in communication with Evers, including on Tuesday morning. 
Vos said the discussions about child care funding are “preliminary” with “a lot of details to be worked out.” He said Assembly Republicans remain “steadfast” in its opposition to “writing checks out to providers” but are open to working with Evers on child care. 
Evers told reporters Monday he wouldn’t sign a budget if it doesn’t include money for child care.
“Republicans need to get their act together and come back and let’s finish it up,” Evers said.
Asked if he would sign a budget that doesn’t include funding for the state’s Child Care Counts program, Evers said “no.” 
Evers has not vetoed a budget in full during his time in office, though he has exercised his partial veto power extensively, rejecting major tax cuts and making changes to extend increases for school revenue – to the great irritation of Republicans.
“I think in the end we’ll be able to find a consensus around that topic,” Vos said about child care funding. 
Vos also said Republicans are already taking some action related to child care. Assembly Republicans have announced measures including a 15% tax credit for the business expenses at child care facilities, no-interest loans and allowing 16-year-olds to be counted as full staff as ways of addressing the crisis.
Evers said discussions about the funding for the University of Wisconsin had included “a positive number” though he wouldn’t go into details. Last week, Vos said his caucus intended to cut $87 million from the UW system. 
“I know we’re going to make investments in trying to make sure that parents have access to child care, I know we’re going to make a historic investment in special ed funding and I know we’re going to do some reforms at the university. Those are all things that we would love to do as part of a bigger deal,” Vos said, adding that legislators have to make sure any plan can get through both the Assembly and the Senate and then to Evers. 
Vos said the most thing thing for Assembly Republicans is getting tax cuts passed and signed by Evers, saying they have learned from previous budgets where tax cuts have been vetoed and other parts of the budget is approved. The budget committee has approved a $1.3 billion tax cut package for the budget bill already.
“It’s better for us to find a compromise,” Vos said. “We’d like to have a guarantee from Gov. Evers that we’re going to get tax cuts signed into law. In exchange, he would like a guarantee that we’re going to have some increases in investments that he cares about.”
Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said he is in communication with Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) working on figuring out when the budget committee will meet next. 
“We’re hopeful our Senate colleagues will join us in the next couple of days,” Born said.
 The deadline for the budget — and end of the fiscal year — is June 30.
“I think if we are actively talking about a budget in the next couple of days, we can hammer out details in a hurry. That’s the way budgets are built. If people are ready to work, we’ll get things done,” Born said. 
Republicans have a slim 18-15 majority in the state Senate, which is leading to some difficulties passing a budget, as their caucus can only lose one vote and still get a budget passed without Democratic votes. Two members — Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) — have expressed concerns about the budget.
Nass laid out several “benchmarks” that would get him to vote for a budget in a press release Tuesday, including a $3.5 billion one-time tax rebate that would provide $1,600 to joint filers and $800 to individual tax filers, ensuring the new budget doesn’t create a structural deficit and making cuts of $700 million to $1 billion and no more than $1.5 billion in new bonding for buildings.
“I will not support the Vos-Evers budget proposal because it contains too much spending, special interest pork and the creation of a significant structural deficit,” Nass said. “The Vos-Evers budget plan is neither conservative nor taxpayer friendly. However, if passed it would be a big win for the politicians and lobbyists.”
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), who is a member of the Joint Finance Committee, called Nass’ proposal “reckless” in a social media post and said Republicans are in “disarray.” 
“It shows that Republicans do not care about maintaining the essential services that Wisconsinites need and want — public schools, UW, roads, healthcare,” Roys wrote. “We need a budget by June 30 or all of it is at serious risk.” 
Bills passed that will rely on funding in budget
The state budget overshadowed debate about several other bills Tuesday as Democrats complained about the lack of funding included in the bills and the lack of trust they have that Republicans will release the funding. 
Republicans, however, said the funding would come later in the budget. A similar argument took place in the state Senate last week. 
Republicans are splitting the bills from the funding as a way of working around Evers’ veto power. Evers has objected to this. Evers’ legislative affairs director sent letters to Republican lawmakers telling them that if they want their bills to become law, the policy needs to be included in the budget, the funding needs to be attached to the bill or the bill needs to include language that states the policy only goes into effect if there is funding. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said at the start of session Tuesday that lawmakers have yet to take meaningful action on the budget and that is unacceptable.
“I want to be very clear about what happens in Wisconsin, if we fail to pass a budget before July 1. There will be no new special education, mental health, or nutrition spending for our schools. Project positions will end overnight. There will be cuts to programs like county conservation and tourism, and much more,” Neubauer said. “There are real consequences to not passing a budget on time. It will hurt Wisconsinites, and it really is unacceptable. It does not need to be this way.”
Neubauer said that Republicans are allowing the “extremists” in their party to hold up the budget process when lawmakers should be listening to their constituents. She said the floor session is an example of Republicans ineffectiveness.
“Even as the budget process is in complete chaos, the majority is writing a series of unfunded bills to the floor that they allege would receive funding in the budget,” Neubauer said. “My biggest question right now is, what budget? Republicans do not have a plan to fund these bills. They do not have a plan for our state budget, and they don’t have a plan to move our state forward. Wisconsin deserves better.”
Unfunded bills create ‘bizarre budget’ process
One bill — AB 279 — would instruct the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to create a talent recruitment grant program meant to lure out-of-state families to relocate to Wisconsin. It passed by voice vote.
Rep. Alex Joers (D-Middleton) said he supports the idea but is concerned about the lack of funding.
“It creates a grant program and there’s no grants, there’s no funding in this bill,” Joers said. “You all need to fund your bills.” 
Bill author Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake) said his bill would help communities market themselves to people looking to relocate. He said he delivered five motions to the committee, but none were included. The committee took action on the WEDC budget earlier this month. 
“They told me to get these passed through the House and through the Senate and they’ll come back and find the funding,” Armstrong said, adding that he agrees the program shouldn’t be mandated without the money.
SB 106, which the Assembly concurred in, would provide the framework for the Department of Health Services to certify psychiatric residential treatment facilities. The facilities would provide in-patient care for people under 21 and are aimed at helping keep young people in crisis stay in-state for care.
Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) said it is “outrageous” that the bill doesn’t include funding. 
“It’s not a workable bill if it’s not funded,” Vining said. “This is irresponsible governing. It is fiscally irresponsible. You guys have got to stop playing games.” 
Rep. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston) said the bill is critical so that young people in crisis have support from the state and their families. When it comes to funding, he said that would come later.
“It will be coming up in separate legislation as we negotiate, as this budget moves forward. We are not going to put a bill out without funding, and I don’t appreciate scare tactics like that because this won’t happen, I have a lot of budget motions, and I am working with JFC to get that accomplished,” Snyder said. “Let’s work on getting the foundation built and then finding out the cost and fund it.” 
SB 108 would require DHS to develop a portal to facilitate sharing of safety plans for a minor in crisis with specific people. It passed in a voice vote.
SB 283 requires the Department of Transportation to create a public protective services hearing protection program to provide specialized hearing protection devices to law enforcement and fire departments. 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) said the bill is really good, but won’t work without funding.
“We’ve heard that Joint Finance is going to fund something, and it doesn’t happen,” Emerson said. “$15 million for hospitals in the Chippewa Valley still sitting in Joint Finance. Money for the reading program, still sitting in Joint Finance. Money for PFAS, still sitting in Joint Finance. There’s a lot of broken trust between the people of Wisconsin and that committee, so we need to see that the funding is here. We need to see it right now. Otherwise, I don’t see how we can get a bill like this passed.”
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha), who is a member of the Joint Finance Committee, said during debate that Republicans have “set the stage for a bizarre budget” by approaching new policy in this way. He said Republicans have previously asked Democrats to trust funding will be released as they’ve allocated funding in a roundabout way, noting that in previous budget cycles lawmakers put money in supplemental funds as a way of requiring additional approval from the budget committee before the money was released.
“I voted for a literacy bill last year — $50 million to help kids read — and that money is still sitting there… We have the ability to appropriate funds, so we could have added funding to all these bills today,” McGuire said. 
McGuire said Republicans could be aiming to effectively reduce agencies’ budgets by mandating new projects without including the funding. 
“There’s the possibility that this is just a secret way of cutting agencies and of robbing every other program that those agencies administer because that’s what happens if we don’t administer the funds,” McGuire said. “Those agencies have to make the choice between the program that we require them to allocate funds for and other programs… and it makes it harder for people to receive services that they already need.” 
Nuclear power bills
The Assembly approved a pair of bills meant to move progress on nuclear energy in Wisconsin, which will now head to Evers’ desk for consideration.
One bill — SB 125 — would require the Public Service Commission to conduct a study to determine potential sites for a nuclear power plant. 
The other — SB 124 — would create a Nuclear Power Summit Board in Wisconsin meant to host a summit in Madison to advance nuclear power and fusion energy technology and development and to showcase Wisconsin’s leadership and innovation in the nuclear industry. The summit would need to be held within the month after instruction starts at the new engineering building at UW-Madison, which is supposed to be finished in 2028. The funding for the building was approved by the Legislature and Evers in 2024. 
Rep. Supreme Moore Omokunde (D-Milwaukee) said he is concerned about Wisconsin’s energy, but the bills as they are are missing some steps.
“Where’s our integrated resource plan? Have we developed one? In other states, they have an integrated resource plan, which lets us know just how much carbon emitting fuel we need to be producing and let’s not produce any more than that,” Moore Omokunde said. “We need to be determining the speed of nuclear energy, the cost, the safety.” 
Moore Omokunde said the state should take an “all of the above” approach and consider different types of energy including nuclear, wind and solar to allow Wisconsin to better decide its “energy future.”.
Snyder said that with technological advances, including artificial intelligence, other types of energy such as windmills and solar won’t be able to provide enough energy. 
“This is something for the future. If you want the cleanest energy, you have to include nuclear,” Snyder said. “We can’t be living in the past of Chernobyl. Fear does not move us forward.” 
Sortwell compared technological advances in energy production to the difference between the Flintstones and the Jetsons. He said lawmakers worked with Evers’ office and the PSC and other stakeholders on the bill. Evers had proposed including $1 million in the state budget to support a nuclear power plant feasibility study.
“The nuclear renaissance is upon us here in Wisconsin and in the United States, and it’s time for everybody else to get on board,” Sortwell said. 
New and increased penalties
The Assembly also passed bills that increase — or create — criminal penalties. 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) spoke in opposition to the slate of bills, saying they will contribute to mass incarceration in Wisconsin. 
“Locking people up does not need to be the solution to every single piece of legislation,” Clancy said. “Incarceration has become this Legislature’s default response to every single claim you think is wrong in this state. It’s incredibly harmful and it doesn’t work.”
AB 26 would make it a Class H felony to threaten or commit battery against a juror or a member of a juror’s family. 
While talking about this bill, Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) said he was thankful Clancy was in the “minority of the minority of the minority” on the issue. He said it would help protect family members of jurors.
“While you may as an individual juror not feel particularly at risk yourself, maybe you’re concerned about your family being threatened, and so this is making sure once again that we have a justice system that is deciding on the merits of the case,” Sortwell said.
AB 35 would change current law that says candidates can’t remove their names from ballots unless they are dead. The bill comes in reaction to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. trying unsuccessfully to remove himself from the Wisconsin presidential ballot in 2024 after he dropped out and endorsed President Donald Trump.
Under the bill, candidates withdrawing from national or statewide races would have to pay the Wisconsin Elections Commission a $1,000 fee — or $250 for a non-statewide office. 
The bill would also make it a Class G felony with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years if someone intentionally makes or files a false statement withdrawing a person’s candidacy.
AB 53 would also make it a Class H felony to cause or threaten to cause bodily harm to a community service officer in response to an action the CSO took in an official capacity. It is currently a class A misdemeanor to cause bodily harm to another person.
AB 65 would make it a Class F felony with a maximum penalty of $25,000 and 12 years and 6 months in prison if someone intentionally enters another person’s home without consent with intent to commit battery.

(Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.

But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 Police investigations and funding

In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 New statewide tracking systems

Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

Idaho rancher Jay Smith has a wolf problem.
Over the last 20 years, Smith said wolves have killed more than 200 of his cattle and caused major financial harm to his family’s business.
﻿
“At today’s value at nearly $2,000 a head, times that by 200 and see if we could have invested that money over time what would that have been?” Smith said. “Significant.”
Smith and his wife, Chyenne, raise Black Angus cattle near the town of Carmen, a tiny community near the Continental Divide, just west of the Montana border.
Jay grew up nearby; his family has been ranching in the area since 1924.
Last year, the family celebrated its centennial on the land.
But their history goes back even longer.
Smith has a family history book documenting cattle ownership back to the 1600s.
“So my family’s cattle raising lineage goes way back,” Smith said.
There’s something else that goes way back in Smith’s family: Warnings about wolves that have been passed down through the generations.
 Idaho rancher ‘got to be a cowboy every day’ of his life 

The J Lazy S Angus Ranch is situated in a green valley set in the shadows of high mountain peaks, some of which rise above 10,000 feet.
Wildfire smoke often hangs in the air during the summer. And on the other side of the valley, the Salmon River cuts through the landscape.

The ranch features a classic red barn, a horse corral, an assortment of farm machinery and a renovated old cabin surrounded by shade trees.
They have a small herd of Morgan-Quarter Horse crossbreeds and an array of cattle dogs that go everywhere with the Smiths, including high up in the surrounding mountains.
“One of the main reasons Chyenne and I bought this place is A, because ranching is in my blood,” Smith said. “But B, it’s exactly how we wanted to raise our children. I wanted them to have the work ethic and the animal husbandry background that I grew up with. I think it’s very important.”
Running cattle and working the ranch is all he’s ever known, and Smith wouldn’t trade it for anything.
“I don’t know if you ever watch TV, but I got to be a cowboy every day of my life, so I don’t know how you go wrong there,” Smith said. “(There is) a lot of freedom. These ranches are big, and so we had a lot of private property where us kids could go a long ways without getting in trouble or being in the wrong spot. And I don’t know how a city kid could ever get their head around that, but we could literally go for miles and not be somewhere we shouldn’t be.”
 Ranching and living in wolf ground zero

The Smiths’ several hundred cattle have a lot of room to roam, too.
During summers, the cows live in the high country. They spend 12 to 16 weeks each in a cow camp way up in the mountains, roaming far and wide on public land.
And that’s where they run into trouble with wolves.
Only a few ridgelines separate Smith’s ranch from wolf ground zero: one of the original sites of reintroduction 30 years ago – Corn Creek in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness.
From their porch on the ranch, Jay and Chyenne Smith can see the Diamond Moose Grazing allotment, where wolves have a track record killing and harassing livestock, Smith said.

“It’s been one of the most consistently conflicted allotments throughout the years,” Smith said.
Jay Smith was 22 years old in 1995 when the government reintroduced wolves. He has seen ranching before wolves were reintroduced and the difference the animals made after they were reintroduced.
“We worked really hard to keep (reintroduction) from happening,” Smith said. “And then when it became inevitable and we could see the writing on the wall, then we started trying to position ourselves for how to live with the inevitable. It was coming. We’ve been here 100 years. We’re not leaving. So now how do we make this work?”
 Idaho rancher affected by wolf depredation says compensation hard to come by

Not only do the wolves literally eat into their business, but every time the Smiths or other ranchers speak out or try to do something about it, they say they are vilified.
“The negativity and the hate towards ranchers is worse than the wolves, in my opinion, and it’s because the public’s been fed this fairy tale of what wolves are,” Chyenne Smith said. “And we’re the bad guys in every one of those stories.”
Jay Smith said he hasn’t seen a nickel in compensation for the livestock wolves killed.
“We have been paid for zero head ever,” he said.
Although Smith said he hasn’t been paid for any of his livestock losses, other Idaho ranchers have.

The state of Idaho has a compensation program to reimburse livestock owners the fair market value of animals that are killed by wolves or grizzly bears.
It applies to cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, chicken, llamas and even bees – basically any animal used for food or in food production.
From 2014 to 2022, the state of Idaho’s livestock compensation program paid out $687,029.50 to 299 different livestock producers for compensation for verified livestock losses, state records show.
But to be paid, livestock owners must have a confirmed wolf kill claim filed with the Office of Species Conservation each year.
“In the topography we run in, we can’t find them in time,” Smith said. “They just simply don’t come home. We’ll find a pile of bones. We’ll find wolf scat right on top of those bones. I mean, we know what happened to them. But as far as Wildlife Services coming in and being able to make a confirmation report to send to the Office of Species Conservation to put us in the reimbursement program, we are zero for 200. That’s our batting average.”
State records show that most investigations of wolf complaints don’t conclude that wolves were definitely responsible.
From July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, Idaho Wildlife Services investigated 99 complaints of livestock losses blamed on wolves, state records show. About 28% of those investigations ruled wolves’ responsibility for livestock deaths were “confirmed” or “probable.”
But more than two-thirds of the wolf complaints, about 68%, were classified as “possible/unknown.” In some cases, wolves may have eaten the carcass of livestock after the animal was already dead but did kill the animal.
Smith said his losses add up.
“We have lost over 200 head of livestock in that 20-plus years to wolves,” Jay Smith said.
“One year we’ll lose 20 head of cattle, and one year we’ll lose zero,” he added. “And we just never quite know how to explain or how to do better, or how to mitigate that risk. It’s very variable, and it’s very unknown. But it’s remained over the years. It hasn’t gone away. It sounds like it’s come and gone, but the wolves are still back there.”
And even if wolves don’t kill livestock like cows and sheep, even the presence of wolves can distress animals enough that they aren’t as healthy and wouldn’t be worth as much at market.
But wolf supporters say the number of livestock killed is extremely low. In Idaho, Montana and Wyoming wolves are confirmed to have killed an average of less than 300 domestic animals per year – out of 6 million cows and sheep in those states.



But even if the overall numbers and percentages are low, the cost is high for the farming and ranching families like the Smiths.
With 30 years of experience since reintroduction and all the claims made by wolf advocates and all the meetings with the feds, nothing has changed Smith’s mind about wolves.
He opposed reintroducing wolves, and now that they are here, Smith thinks there are too many of them. As a result, he thinks ranchers should be given broad authority to kill wolves to protect their livestock.
And as the chairman of his local county’s Republican Party central committee, Smith has helped make that happen. He said he co-wrote a 2021 state law that helped make it easier to kill more wolves by expanding when and how they can be hunted and trapped.
The law allows hunters to purchase an unlimited number of wolf tags to kill wolves and makes trapping on private land legal year round.
“There’s still people vehemently against every proposal we have,” Smith said. “And I don’t know why. We’re not out to kill them all. We’re just out to make a living and keep our livelihoods.”
Chyenne Smith agreed.
“It’s about not being able to do everything we can to protect what’s ours when we need to,” she said.
 The role trapping plays in the wolf v. livestock debate

When there are problems with wolves harassing or killing livestock, ranchers often call on trappers to catch the predators.
And one of the best people at trapping wolves is Rusty Kramer.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He’s the president of the Idaho Trappers Association and the incoming president of the National Trappers Association.
Whether it’s badgers, beavers, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, muskrats or wolves, if it’s legal to trap in Idaho, Kramer has probably caught it.
Depending on the animals, he’s used scent lures, bait or even blind set traps, hoping to entice an animal to step on a silver dollar-sized pan, which triggers the trap’s jaws to lose around the wolf’s foot and seize hold.
Once a wolf is trapped, Kramer shoots it behind the shoulder with his .22 magnum pistol, killing it. Since wolves were reintroduced, he’s trapped and killed 25 to 30.
Kramer was born and raised in Fairfield, Idaho, near the Sawtooth National Forest in central Idaho.
“I just learned how to trap looking over my dad’s shoulder and riding around with him and just kind of fell in love with it as a kid and I’ve been doing it ever since,” Kramer said.
It started as damage control, trapping ground squirrels and marmots, also known as rock chucks, to protect the alfalfa. Later, he moved on to coyotes and muskrats.
Kramer’s father taught him how to process and sell the pelts, stressing the importance of using every part of the animal. As a kid, the pelts put a little extra money in his pocket.
For him, trapping is a way of life and a family tradition.
Today, Kramer said the Idaho Trappers Association runs the largest fur sale in the United States, in Glenns Ferry, where a trapper can make good money for a wolf pelt.

A quality wolf pelt can go for $500 or more.
For 10 years as an adult, Kramer lived in Boise – the state’s largest city – about a 90-minute drive from Fairfield. After Micron Technology laid him off, Kramer returned to Fairfield.
But it’s tough to make a living on trapping alone, and Kramer also runs an alfalfa farm and is the watermaster for his local water district.

It’s the farm where Kramer and other farmers run into trouble with wolves. Ever since wolves came back, Kramer says, a lot more elk are hanging out in the valley where he and many other farmers grow alfalfa. He says the elk hang out there to keep safe from wolves, who tend to avoid agricultural areas because of the human presence. The elk trample the fields and eat the alfalfa, creating a headache and a cost for Rusty.
“I don’t hate wolves,” Kramer said. “I very (much) admire wolves. How far they can roam and how cunning they are and survive out there.”
But he thinks it was a mistake to reintroduce wolves to Idaho.
“I’m under the opinion it would be cool to snap your fingers and it’s back to ‘Dances with Wolves’ days,” Kramer said, referring to the 1990 movie starring Kevin Costner. “You know, where it’s buffalo from Ohio to Oregon and grizzlies and wolves. But there’s only so many places that grizzlies, wolves and buffalo can have in the 21st century, because they just roam so far. These aren’t foxes and coyotes that can live around humans.”
“There’s just not enough space for them in the 21st century, in my opinion,” Kramer said.
 Does Idaho’s Wood River Wolf Project offer a solution to protecting livestock from wolves?

Suzanne Asha Stone is trying to to demonstrate that ranchers can live side-by-side with wolves today.
Thirty years ago, Stone was an intern working on the wolf reintroduction project. Since then, she’s become a prominent wolf expert and advocate.
She is the executive director of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and a co-founder of the Wood River Wolf Project in Idaho.

Lately, Stone has been focusing on helping ranchers protect sheep and cattle without killing wolves.
Stone said the catalyst for the work was a “train wreck” of conflict between wolves and sheep in 2007 in central Idaho’s Blaine County.
Unaware that wolves were denning with pups in the area, a rancher let out his flock of sheep with some livestock guardian dogs for protection, Stone said.
“So to wolves, having those dogs come in meant that they had strange wolves coming in and were a significant threat to their pups,” Stone said. “The rancher, of course, didn’t know this. He had no idea that the wolves were there. But within 24 hours, we had dead sheep, dead livestock guardian dogs and a (wolf) pack with a death warrant on their head.”
Stone said the community came together after the event to look for a way to project sheep and wolves.
“It was at that time that the residents of Blaine County pushed back hard and said, ‘We really enjoy having wolves here. We had our own little Yellowstone happening right in our backyard, where we could go out and watch these wolves and their pups, and we want to keep them alive,’” Stone said.
From there, Stone sat down at the table with ranchers in the area, as well as an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services.
Stone said just about everyone was skeptical, even wolf biologists who wanted to keep more wolves alive.
“And so we sat down with all of them and then reached out to the ranchers and just said, ‘Let us try these nonlethal tools. Now everybody’s telling us we’re going to fail, but let’s try and see what happens,’” Stone said.
Stone started using something called fladry.
It’s nothing more than a barrier of waving flags, but it has proven successful to deter wolves in Eastern Europe and help sell high-mileage Hondas stateside.
“It looks like the flagging that sits around used car lots, basically,” Stone said. “It doesn’t look intimidating to us at all. Wolves don’t like it. They don’t trust it. And so we were able to keep the sheep behind those fladry pens for the rest of the season without having a single other loss. And the wolves were right there raising their pups for a good part of that summer. No more incidents at all.”
Stone’s critics called it beginner’s luck and questioned whether she could replicate her results over long periods of time or large areas.
That led to the creation of the Wood River Wolf Project, which for the last 17 summers has been partnering with ranchers in the area to use non-lethal tools and techniques to protect sheep from wolves.
The project area covers about 4,600 square miles of rugged, mountainous terrain.

Stone says there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to wolf conflicts – different terrain, different predator behavior, even varying access to electricity can affect what works. So, she’ll try just about anything – and her group has over the years. They’ve used solar-powered strobe lights, blasted air horns, played recordings of helicopters, even had cowboys play music.
In one case, wolves were feasting on llamas at an eastern Oregon ranch. So Stone’s team set up those 20-foot air dancers you see at car lots and lit them up at night.
“So when the wolves came over the top of the hill, they saw this enormous monster up there flapping around and making all kinds of noise, and oh my gosh, they were in the next county the next day,” she said.
“We’ve only lost two wolves in the 17 years now of the project and an average of less than five sheep a year for that entire 17-year period,” Stone said. “So it’s the lowest loss of livestock to wolves in any area where wolves and livestock overlap in the Western United States, probably beyond that. It’s a very successful project, and we use less money than what they do to kill wolves outside of the project area, where they’re losing more livestock there.”
But Stone hasn’t convinced everyone. In fact, one key holdout is her own state government.
Even when nonlethal methods of wolf control are available, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s written policy preference is to kill wolves to reduce the overall wolf population in the state.
“A lot of what we’ve learned here is being applied in countries all over the world, just not in the state of Idaho, and not to any real extent beyond our project area, because the state is so determined to kill wolves rather than to live with them,” Stone said.



Coming next week in Howl: Part 5, Ghost Wolves
Some experts say states are cooking the books on wolf numbers and that the anti-wolf forces are winning. Idaho Department of Fish and Game wolf counting methods have come under scrutiny by outside researchers, and some of the original people who helped bring wolves back 30 are worried the work they do could be undone.

(Photo courtesy of the Dodge County YMCA)For months child care providers and their allies campaigning for direct financial support from Wisconsin lawmakers have highlighted employers and the economy as central to their pitch.
Child care providers are “the workforce behind the workforce” in one of the rallying slogans of the provider-parent coalition Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN).
Employers and business owners themselves, however, have largely stayed in the background — from time to time offering testimonials about their employees’ need for child care, but rarely weighing in on policy alternatives.
Last week more than 75 business leaders broke that pattern, sending a letter to members of the Wisconsin Legislature.
“Wisconsin’s lingering child care crisis … cannot go unaddressed any longer by state legislators, because Wisconsin remains at a workforce crossroads that presents significant, pressing challenges for businesses and the economic vitality of the state,” the group wrote.
“We therefore ask you to advance a significant long-term state investment in child care in the 2025-27 state budget because inaction will further shutter child care programs and continue to hamper efforts to stabilize and grow Wisconsin’s workforce.”
The letter was distributed with the help of the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association (WECA), which provides advocacy and professional services for child care providers and also conducts policy research.
Campaign continues for direct subsidy
The letter embraces what Gov. Tony Evers, child care providers and their allies have been seeking in the 2025-27 Wisconsin budget this year: A direct state subsidy for child care providers. Evers and providers have warned that without that kind of support there’s likely to be a drastic shutdown of child care centers across the state in the coming months.
“Child care programs operate on razor-thin margins with budgets balanced on parent fees, which, despite being costly for families, do not cover the full cost of programs providing high-quality care,” the letter states.
“As employers, we have explored and implemented different local initiatives to help grow access to care,” it adds. Nevertheless, “those solutions are limited and must be complemented with a long-term, significant investment of state revenue.”
Tracy Propst, the executive director of the Beaver Dam Chamber of Commerce, helped organize support for and signed the business letter.
“I really do believe child care is part of an economic strategy,” Propst told the Wisconsin Examiner. “If you don’t have access to abundant and economical child care, you are going to lose workforce.”
Mary Vogl-Rauscher, a human resources consultant in Beaver Dam, joined the letter along with businesses she works with.
Prospective fee hikes are “enough of an increase, if we don’t get the subsidies, to take people out of the workforce,” Vogl-Rauscher said. “From an employer perspective and a business perspective, if [the cost of care] goes up and we don’t continue with the state subsidies, it’s going to make an even bigger economic impact.”
Vogl-Rauscher is active in the local and state chapters of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) and organized a community discussion of the issue this spring. 
Propst and Vogl-Rauscher both say they’ve sought to persuade their local Assembly member, state Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam), the Joint Finance Committee’s co-chair, that the lawmakers should add the subsidy program into the budget. 
“I’ve had conversations with Mark,” Propst said, adding that he told her that the committee was “doing something,” although not what she had asked for. “He will listen to his constituents,” she said. 
Middle-class squeeze
Both Propst and Vogl-Rauscher said their conversations with Dirk Langfoss, CEO of the Dodge County YMCA and a board member at the Beaver Dam chamber, were instrumental in clarifying the problem.
The Dodge County Y has the largest child care program in the county. Langfoss told the Wisconsin Examiner that competition for employees with other businesses has produced “upward pressures” on wages. The average weekly rate for infant and 1-year-old care is $253 — which adds up to $13,000 for all 52 weeks in the year. Rates are lower for older age groups.
“The middle-income families are the ones that are getting squeezed,” he said, with some telling him now that “they are strapped.”
If subsidies end entirely and the Y has to raise its rates, “those families are going to have to make some very hard decisions,” Langfoss added.
Propst views a direct investment now as a step toward something more comprehensive. “It’s really about child care stabilization,” she said, allowing providers to get their footing.
She also considers the immediate situation to be urgent, and fears the urgency hasn’t gotten through to many people.
“I just think this has snuck up on the businesses,” Propst said. “Like they weren’t aware this is happening, and here we are. And they don’t realize the ramifications of what’s going to happen — and that’s child care closures, child care price increases, and we’re not going to have enough providers.”
Direct investment divisions persist
While child care advocates have been arguing for a direct investment for years, the argument hasn’t fully caught on with the broader public or in the business community.
Among business leaders and the public, “there is a general recognition that child care is essential for workers, especially those that are taking care of young children,” said David Celata, vice president of policy and research for the Greater Milwaukee Foundation. But the true cost of care and why most working families can’t afford it is “an incredibly complex issue,” Celata told the Wisconsin Examiner.
“The numbers really don’t add up until we recognize that there is a social and economic good related to child care that we are failing collectively to truly maximize,” he said. “That then requires some sort of a public investment to strengthen the infrastructure of our child care sector.”
In Wisconsin the campaign for a state child care subsidy has been underway since the 2023-25 budget after monthly grants from federal COVID-19 pandemic relief funds helped child care providers raise wages without having to increase the fees families paid.
The Legislature’s Republican majority turned aside attempts to continue the subsidy program, Child Care Counts, with state money in the 2023-25 budget. Evers subsequently redirected other federal funds to extend the program at reduced rates through the middle of 2025.
The last of those funds will run out by early July. A survey that the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty released in April found that as many as one in four child care providers said they might shut down without the continued support. Anywhere from half to two-thirds of programs forecast fee increases.
Evers put a $480 million proposal for a state-funded Child Care Counts program in his 2025-27 budget. Republicans on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed it from the budget along with more than 600 other proposals Evers included before beginning work on their own version of the document.
After visiting a child care center in Waukesha County on Monday to highlight his subsidy proposal, Evers told reporters that he would not sign a budget this year without direct child care support. Evers said the provision was part of his ongoing budget negotiations with the Legislature’s GOP leaders.
Direct funding is still a sticking point, however.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters Tuesday that Republicans are open to working with Evers on child care but remain firmly opposed to “writing checks out to providers.”

Until that happens, water affordability advocates are asking appropriators in the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives for $60 million in the next state budget to support water assistance programs across the state.
The pending Senate package and the budget request were up for discussion Tuesday before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Human Services as the chamber worked to finalize its 2025 fiscal year budget. The slow pace of their budget work has been a point of contention between the House and the Democratic-led Senate, which is ready to begin negotiations.
State Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen), the subcommittee’s chair, expressed his willingness to cut water affordability appropriations in the next budget while dining with fellow Michigan Republicans in Mackinaw City earlier this month.
On Tuesday, Maggie Pallone of Public Sector Consultants presented a report to the subcommittee on the history of water assistance programs in Michigan and the potential need for a new statewide program. Pallone said there was a significant need for a program that addresses all Michiganders’ water access needs that “doesn’t know zipcode,” and recognizes that this is an issue for families of all sizes and ages.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Michigan Legislature has in the past given one-time dollars to water assistance programs, with $25 million allocated in the 2020 fiscal year, $60 million in 2024 fiscal year and $10 million to be disbursed this year.
The Senate’s appropriators are seeking to raise total water affordability spending to $13 million for next fiscal year.
Meanwhile, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) and other senators reintroduced legislation in April that would ensure access to clean water. The package includes Senate Bill 248, Senate Bill 249, Senate Bill 250, Senate Bill 251, Senate Bill 252 and Senate Bill 253. It has bipartisan support, with state Sen. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) as a key sponsor.
Pallone said there were local programs offering the same protections and services, but there have been problems implementing them in certain areas of the state.
Of the 4.1 million total households in Michigan, at least 1.2 million of them were 200% below the federal poverty level, with an average $47,800 annual income. The median household income in Michigan is $71,149, and the average monthly total water bill is around $84, Pallone said.
When Public Sector Consultants was hired to chart the need for water assistance programs in the state to assist Chang in craft the water affordability bills in previous sessions, the firm found that 371,522 households couldn’t afford to pay for water and that their water bills were more than 2% to 3% of their annual income.
She noted that even Birmingham, which is typically regarded as a wealthier community, qualifies for some of the programs being discussed.
Lawmakers push for action on revamped water affordability bills during lame duck session

Sara Rubino, representing the Michigan section of the American Water Works Association, said Michigan communities are facing a difficult reality as the cost of providing safe and reliable drinking water rises with households unable to keep pace.
Upgrades to statewide water systems are needed to do that, but those also come at a cost, Rubino said. Since local water systems are supported by local customer fees and rates, and not county or state dollars, those most affected by rising rates are families on fixed or limited incomes, like senior citizens.
The Michigan section of the American Water Works Association helped craft the Senate’s water affordability package and Rubino said it supports the package as a long-term solution with a sustainable funding mechanism. She added that the package offered a fiscally responsible and commonsense approach that builds a bridge between household affordability and system sustainability.
“Safe water service is just as essential to life and public health as electricity and gas,” Rubino said.
The Senate has not yet scheduled a committee hearing on the legislative package, but until then, Rubino asked Roth’s committee to support a $60 million one-time allocation to water affordability programs in the next budget to ensure those services continue.
State Rep. Kimberly Edwards (D-Eastpointe) asked Jasmine Carson, executive director of the Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency, what happens to families if money for programs already funded by the Legislature dry up.
Carson said if those families are experiencing an active water crisis, they could face additional health risks and housing instability. She later added that the situation also contributes to factors of homelessness.
Changes to Senate legislation include local opt-out
Roth said his committee was still working on the policy side of the equation with Chang on the Senate bills, which included making sure the committee had all the available information on what’s in the bills this time around.
Debra Pospiech, a member of the water affordability stakeholder group working with the Detroit Water and Sewage Department, said one of the major changes to the Senate package from last session is that the money will stay within four existing MDHHS regions. Another big change is that the monthly fee proposed in the legislation was reduced to $1.25, and will increase by 25 cents each year if the need is still there to cover the cost of the program.
A third change is an opt out provision for local communities, which was raised earlier in the hearing by Roth. Those communities can opt out to start their own program and keep that $1.25 fee within their own system’s provider charge.
Pospiech also spoke to the need for a statewide water assistance program. She noted that without an appropriation to tide systems and local programs over until the Senate bills move, water providers have three options when someone doesn’t pay their bills: they can put a tax lien on a resident’s home, shut the water off or sue the customer.
“For some families, none of those options will work, and the water provider has an uncollectible customer there,” Pospiech said. “They have choices to make. It’s either use one of those three options, or that debt just keeps accruing and they have to make some tough decisions when it’s time for increasing rates the following year.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8370-scaled-e1744389791409-1024x922.jpeg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

(Getty Images)Indiana youth tobacco use plummeted to its lowest levels in decades, but flavored products and nicotine dependency in youth still pose serious concerns according to the 2024 Indiana Youth Tobacco Survey released Tuesday. 
Since 2000, the Indiana Department of Health has surveyed over 4,800 public middle and high school students every two years to monitor tobacco trends. The 2024 results show the lowest cigarette use in the past two decades – dropping from 31.6% in 2000 to less than a percent.
E-cigarette use among high school students has also fallen to 5%, the lowest rate since Indiana began data collection for e-cigarettes in 2012. Despite progress, e-cigarettes remain the most commonly used tobacco product among youth. Approximately 15,000 high school students and 5,000 middle school students said they currently use them.

Nearly half of high schoolers who vape reported using e-cigarettes frequently, which is considered 20 or more days in the past 30 days. One in three middle and high school students said they experienced strong cravings or felt a strong desire to use a tobacco product. 
The report also found an increase in oral nicotine pouch use. While still less commonly used than vaping, the percentage of high schoolers who reported trying nicotine pouches doubled – from 2.3% in 2022 to 5% in 2024. These popular pouches contain nicotine, flavorings and other ingredients marketed as an alternative to traditional products. 
In 2020, the legal purchasing age for tobacco changed from 18 to 21 in Indiana. However, in 2024, 49% of high school students thought it would be somewhat or very easy to get tobacco products if they wanted some. 
Findings also noted marijuana use, though fewer students reported currently using the illicit drug. Less than 5%, or 4.6%, of middle school students reported trying marijuana, compared to 13.3% of high school students. Over 4% of high school students reported current use and many reported dual use of tobacco and marijuana. 
The report reveals that roughly one in three students live with someone who uses tobacco products – likely influencing future use in youth. About 25% of youth who have never used tobacco said they are susceptible to smoking in the future. 
Although Indiana’s youth tobacco use remains below national averages, health officials say more work is needed to protect Hoosiers from tobacco usage.
“Comprehensive tobacco control programs remain essential to reducing youth tobacco use,” Indiana Department of Health director of Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Miranda Spitznagle, said. “By working together — parents, schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations — we can continue protecting young Hoosiers from the harms of commercial tobacco products.”
Youth who are interested in quitting e-cigarettes can text INDIANA to 873373, while parents, educators and healthcare providers can visit in.gov/vapefreeindiana for resources to help prevent youth tobacco use.

If Wyoming's congressional delegation continues to follow Trump's zeal to sell public lands in the West, they’ll face a political firestorm, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Tread lightly on our public land, politicians! appeared first on WyoFile .","Even smart politicians make stupid mistakes. That’s how they lose political power; that’s how they get un-elected.

Opinion

Here’s how it happens. An elected official deludes himself or herself into thinking they are unassailable, that their seat is safe because they’ve never been seriously challenged. This is political hubris and leads to mistakes. They finally cross a line, push the envelope too far and run into political Kryptonite.
Those officials’ hubris reaches the point where they tell their constituents, “We don’t give a rat’s ass what you think, we’re gonna do what we want.” This attitude toward their jobs and their constituents is the graveyard of political ambition.
All three members of our Wyoming congressional delegation are smart politicians. Their election records bear this out. But they are going down a path that will end up in their political doom. So we should give them fair warning.
Perhaps the clearest warning that our delegation could receive is a reminder of what happened to U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, an outcome that they themselves, to one extent or another, contributed to. Cheney’s seat seemed secure and her popularity bulletproof until she acted in a way that was intolerable to Wyoming’s electorate. Voters turned on Cheney as quickly as a striking rattlesnake, and her political career in the Cowboy State came to an abrupt end.
U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and Rep. Harriet Hageman, through their unwavering support for Trump, seemingly enjoy secure places in Wyoming politics. But if they slavishly follow Trump in his zeal to sell public lands in the West, they’ll face a political firestorm every bit as hot as the one that scorched Cheney.
Maybe they misread the room and don’t grasp how their constituents feel about the half of the Big Empty that is in public lands. Sure, we cuss federal land management agencies up one side and down the other. We were taught that by our parents and grandparents. But they also taught us that we can hunt, fish, camp, rockhound and generally goof around on our public land without having to beg permission from anyone.
The public domain in Wyoming is interwoven into the fabric of our land ethic, an ethic that is passed down from one generation to another. It is, quite simply, how we think of ourselves and the landscape around us. It’s how we think of our home.
When politicians — whether our own representatives or an eastern businessman like Trump — try to tell us that we are wrong, then we get pissed off. When they say that large swaths of our home should be sold to the highest bidder, our bullshit detectors go off and our hackles go up. And then we vote. Just ask Cheney.
The public land issue cuts across partisan boundaries and bridges demographics in Wyoming. It is where the right wing and the left wing meet on common ground. For a politician to ignore or discount the depth of this ethos in the electorate is a grave mistake. To call it a silly overreaction is political suicide.
I think our delegation is feeling the hot blast of pushback against Trump’s misguided notion of disposing of public land in Wyoming. And that pushback is coming from folks who, up until now, thought our delegation could do no wrong. I think it’s dawning on them that this is a Rubicon they can’t cross if they want to keep their election certificates.
It will be instructive to watch how the delegation deals with this crisis.
I’d suggest that they pay close attention to the rally that will be held at the Wyoming Capitol at 6 p.m., Thursday. They should keep a head count of the number of their constituents protesting the sale of our public land and compare that with the number of Wyomingites carrying signs that say, “Hell yeah. Sell it all.”
If they can’t read the room, and they call the protest a silly overreaction, I guess they can wait to look at the numbers in the next election. The choice is theirs.
But smart politicians who can sense their neighbors’ anger, and who are willing to stand their ground against bone-headed ideas like privatizing Wyoming’s public land, can smell political blood in the water. They’re flexing their muscles to run against our complacent incumbents. Here endeth the lesson.

Wyoming is many things to many people, but public land is why they come and why they stay, writes guest columnist Chris Madson.
The post Public land — land of the free — defines Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","I wasn’t born in Wyoming, but, as the old saying goes, “I got here as soon as I could.” For me, that was August of 1960 when my parents packed up the kids and headed west from St. Louis, a station-wagon version of Lewis and Clark. On our way home from the Pacific, we bent south, like William Clark, and found ourselves along his fork of the Yellowstone River in the Sunlight Basin. I was not quite 10 years old, and the North Absarokas were an obsidian-tipped arrow straight into my soul.

Opinion

Up until that week, my idea of freedom was a hundred acres of timber along a creek that cut its way down a steep valley through the bluffs of the Mississippi, dove into a culvert under a four-lane highway, and found its way down the rip-rapped bank to join the Father of Waters. It was a marvelous place for a bunch of suburban kids — oak, hickory and wild cherry on the uplands, giant sycamore and soft maple along the creek, whose dappled waters trickled over limestone outcrops and lingered in gravel-bottomed pools — but it was a tiny spark of wildness in a landscape that had been thoroughly settled. Even the kids knew that.
If we left the creek and climbed up toward the ridges on either side, we ran into the back fences of suburban yards, carefully mowed and festooned with “No Trespassing” signs. Now and then, an irate householder would catch a glimpse of us in the woods and yell — we disappeared into the shadows like smoke.
So the water and timber and wildflowers and snowfields and peaks of the Shoshone National Forest were like a revelation of God to me. The family came back again and again over the next several years, and I was loosed with a flyrod, four Muddler Minnows and a smashed peanut butter sandwich to follow the creek as far as curiosity and gumption would take me.
After college, I settled down in the Midwest to start a family, but every summer, I was back for as long as the company could spare me, with a wife and two apple-cheeked little girls in tow, to taste the freedom we had somehow lost back east.
Then, I had a chance to come to Wyoming full time. The offer was exhilarating, but I thought it over before I accepted, not because of what the job entailed, but because of how I felt about the West. They say familiarity breeds contempt, or at least boredom, and I wondered whether the sage and mountains might lose some of their shine for me if they were always at the back door. I decided to take the chance.
That was 1983. In the years since, I’ve rambled around most of the state, from Devil’s Tower to the Bear River Divide, Jenny Lake to Vedauwoo. I’ve hunted, fished, canoed, hiked, photographed, picnicked and contemplated my navel, and I’m pleased — and relieved — to report that the big sky has never lost its shine for me. In fact, the love affair has deepened over time as I’ve come to appreciate the subtle charms of the sage as much as the flower-strewn meadows above timberline. It wasn’t until I moved to Wyoming that I experienced September and October here, arguably the best months of the year, not only in the West but anywhere.
All of this is set against the backdrop of public land. I own 34 of the BLM’s 1:100,000-scale maps covering Wyoming, 32 of the USGS quads, and an assortment of national park and forest maps on the side, all of them dog-eared and stained from days spent crammed into backpacks. I’m proud to say I’ve worn out two compasses, something that never could have happened behind the Midwest’s fences.
Wyoming is many things to many people. The boosters tout its minerals; the politicians brag on the rugged independence of its people. But, let me tell you: public land is what defines Wyoming. It’s why I came; it’s why I stay. I think I share that sentiment with many other residents.
You hang a “No Trespassing” sign on Wyoming, and it will be no different than Illinois, with a lot less rain and much longer winters. If all I have left is the view of the Tetons from a crowded parking lot and locked gates off every highway, I can think of better places to spend my time.
Back in the 1930s, America’s poet laureate, Archibald MacLeish, looked at the state of the nation and asked a penetrating question:

We wonder whether the great American dream
Was the singing of locusts out of the grass to the west and the
West is behind us now:
The west wind’s away from us
We wonder if the liberty is done:
The dreaming is finished
Or if there’s something different men can dream
Or if there’s something different men can mean by 
Liberty . . .
Or if there’s liberty a man can mean that’s
Men: not land
We wonder
We don’t know
We’re asking

I wonder whether there’s liberty a man can mean that’s men, not land. Here in Wyoming, I think there’s little doubt. Public land means my freedom.
Don’t you sell an inch of it.

It serves immigrants with limited English knowledge, Coloradans experiencing homelessness, students pursuing careers in the trades, concurrently enrolled high schoolers and students who are the first in their family to attend college. 
That mission of accessible education guides Adriana Cordova, CCA’s academic advising director, in her work. A CCA graduate herself, Cordova knows what it’s like to be nervous and at times lost in college.
“I’m a first-generation student, and I migrated here in 2003 from Sonora, Mexico. The expectation was always for me to go to school, and it wasn’t easy,” said Cordova, who graduated in 2017 and went on to earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees. “At CCA, I was able to get a hang of what college was.”

Part of what has made CCA feel like home for Cordova is the diversity and welcoming environment she said she has experienced at the college. 
Some of the resources that support the CCA community, including peer instructors, college readiness programming and faculty training workshops, are funded by the federal government through a $2.5 million grant, distributed over six years. The college was eligible for the grant because it is a federally-designated Hispanic-serving institution — one of 16 in Colorado and 615 in the United States. But now federal grants for such institutions could be at risk.
Colorado’s Hispanic-serving institutions range from community colleges in the suburbs of Denver to regional public universities nestled up north in Greeley and south in Alamosa County along the Rio Grande. They vary in size and focus, but they all enroll at least 25% Hispanic students and serve a high proportion of low-income students. 
Federal lawsuit raises discrimination concerns
The federal Hispanic-serving institution designation is in the spotlight with a recently filed federal lawsuit in Tennessee that argues these programs unconstitutionally discriminate based on ethnicity. The lawsuit, filed by the state of Tennessee and the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, “is about ensuring that opportunity is extended to everyone on an equal basis,” according to a statement from Students for Fair Admissions. 
Students for Fair Admissions declined an interview request for this article but referred to the written statement. The lawsuit argues that the federal Department of Education’s Hispanic-serving institution program discriminates against institutions and students in Tennessee, a state that has no colleges with such designation. While many colleges in Tennessee serve some low-income and Hispanic students, none meets the 25% threshold. 
“A federal grant system that openly discriminates against students based on ethnicity isn’t just wrong and un-American—it’s unconstitutional,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement.

The federal government awarded slightly more than $228 million to Hispanic-serving institutions in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Although the money goes specifically toward Hispanic-serving institutions, each institution must use its grants for programs and services that are open to all of its students, regardless of race or ethnicity. 
Gina Garcia, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, studies higher education issues and has published extensive research on Hispanic-serving institutions. Garcia cautioned that a loss of these federal grants could be “devastating” to these institutions, which typically use the money for student support and innovation.
“These are capacity-building grants, and what that means is that they do not allow you to give any of the funding or any of the opportunities specifically to one group, because the money goes to the institution, to make the institution better, and so anything the institution does is going to be for every student,” Garcia said. 
‘Safety and support’ for students
Julianna Montoya graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver last month, with a major in public health, two minors in biology and pre-health care and a concentration in community health education. In the fall, the first-generation college student will pursue a master’s in public health at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
Attending a Hispanic-serving institution allowed her to “find safety and support as a Latina.” 
“I entered college with a million nerves about navigating the higher education system,” Montoya said. “I came in with my sister who is 16 months older than me, and we were really trying to figure out who we are as individuals. She and my peers here have been a support for me.”
What most stood out to Montoya was taking a health care ethics class with a Latino professor who “walked in with his marginalized identity, as well as his background as a professional in the field.”










If you were a student here and you had a teacher’s assistant in your class, you benefited from these grants.


– Manuel Del Real, of Metropolitan State University of Denver


MSU, which has 16,500 total undergraduates, became a Hispanic-serving institution in 2019, after a 12-year process that focused on recruitment, retention and data collection.
In 2007, the university enrolled 13% Hispanic students. Now that number is 37%. Since becoming a Hispanic-serving institution, it has received $14 million in federal grants.
Manuel Del Real, MSU’s executive director of Hispanic-serving institution initiatives and inclusion, said the designation has been helpful to “communicate that we are here for our students.” He emphasized that the grants are beneficial to all MSU students, whether they are Hispanic or not. 
“If you were a student here and you had a teacher’s assistant in your class, you benefited from these grants,” he said.
Del Real said he is not focused on the ongoing federal lawsuit by Students for Fair Admissions because “even if the designation goes away, we’re still going to stick to our mission and values.”
“Yes, we’re thankful for getting these grants,” Del Real said. “But whatever happens, we’re going to continue being an institution that’s minority serving, and that continues to serve all of our students.”
Achievement gaps persist
The federal Hispanic-serving institution designation was created in 1992, stemming from concerns that Hispanic students were largely enrolled in colleges and universities with poor educational outcomes and low government funding.
Between the years 2000 and 2020, Hispanic post-baccalaureate enrollment has tripled in the U.S., according to the Postsecondary National Policy Institute. However, enrollment and degree completion gaps remain. In Colorado, the four-year graduation rate for Hispanic students is 44%, compared to 59% for white students, according to the nonprofit Excelencia in Education.

These inequalities are why Hispanic-serving institution grants and designations matter, said Angela Marquez, the vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion and chief of staff at Community College of Aurora.
“We want to be culturally responsive and create a classroom environment that is optimal for the success of our Latino and Latina students, and for the unique needs of all of our students,” Marquez said.
For Cordova, supporting students means connecting them with resources that span beyond academic support, including food assistance, counseling and housing services.
“We don’t just help them get signed up for classes,” Cordova said. “We ask, ‘What’s going on with work? What’s going on with family?’ We want them to graduate, but we treat them like humans in the process.”

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republicans in North Carolina’s legislature are split on the details of hurricane relief for the western mountains.
Almost a month ago, the House approved a new round of aid as the region continued to rebuild from Hurricane Helene. That aid bill then sat frozen for a month — until Monday. Senators fast-tracked it and sent it back to the House, with major changes.
The last-minute Senate markup threw a wrench into plans to approve the aid before the legislature leaves Raleigh this week. The House on Tuesday unanimously voted to reject those changes, forcing lawmakers to go to a conference committee and iron out a compromise.
“To the surprise of probably no one in this room, it made some significant changes, many of which are important to the people of western North Carolina,” said Rep. Dudley Greene (R-Avery). “We’ve been working feverishly to try and digest, and get our heads around, some of these changes.”
Greene said he was hopeful that the chambers could meet in conference “as early as this week.” But it could also come later.
A Democrat from the Asheville area urged his colleagues to back the House’s rejection Tuesday.
“This bill is certainly a much worse version than we sent over,” said Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe). “I look forward to making it better.”
In a statement Tuesday, Gov. Josh Stein urged lawmakers to swiftly meet in conference.
“Western North Carolina cannot afford for process to get in the way of progress,” Stein said. “The legislature should work quickly this week to set aside their differences and do their job to support folks rebuilding after Helene. I stand ready to get this sorely needed relief out the door.”



The broad strokes of both chambers’ relief plans are similar. Both set up the state for more reimbursement from federal aid programs. They send bundles of money to local governments to help with ongoing repairs and projects, and to help rebuild private roads and bridges.
But several key line-items are changed or removed altogether between the two plans. And the ways in which the spending is sourced vary.
The Senate’s plan is more expansive than the House’s. It sends $700 million to the state’s Helene fund and spends $480 million of that money. (The rest would sit in the Helene fund, available for further aid down the line.) It lays out hundreds of millions of dollars for federal water and sewer projects, and steers another nearly half a billion of already appropriated money toward Helene-related road and bridge repairs.
The House’s bill allocates $464 million, and also sets out the hundreds of millions of federal dollars for water projects.
Among the biggest omissions in the Senate’s proposal: a $60 million grant program for small businesses.
That program, a longtime request from western lawmakers and advocates, was scratched. Republicans are citing the state constitution’s “emoluments clause,” saying such a program would be unconstitutional. Some Democrats are dubious of that argument — and so is the House Republicans’ leader.
“I have a different legal opinion on it, obviously,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters Tuesday evening. “We do things all the time to help folks who have suffered in a disaster. We do it a lot in agriculture in this state. So, I just simply disagree.”
Local governments in western North Carolina, many of whom are facing budget shortfalls, would see aid in both plans, though the details vary.
The House plan would send out $15 million for debris removal, and $5 million for tech assistance. And the Senate bill sends a new bundle of $100 million to an interest-free loan program run by the state treasurer’s office.
A $25 million, three-year farm infrastructure recovery program established in the House plan is absent from the Senate’s. Instead, the Senate plan lays out $8 million for a program focused on agricultural manufacturing and processing.
Both plans also include money to repair damages to school facilities and UNC System campuses.
The two plans also differ greatly in where they pull money to fund their aid from.
The House bill claws back money from NC Innovation, a private research nonprofit.
And the Senate plan pulls from a variety of reserve funds, while redirecting over half a billion dollars already allocated to transportation maintenance and local aid. That move has sparked concern among Democrats, and is also expected to be a primary point of discussion with House Republicans.
The legislature has thus far appropriated $1.4 billion in state dollars to Helene recovery. Lawmakers are expected to leave Raleigh for an extended period after this week.
“I will say that the chairs of each side on that issue continue to talk,” Hall said. “So I think they’re relatively close to getting something done. Whether we end up passing that this week or when we come back, not clear yet.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 07:05:41.086401

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia is due to appear in a downtown Nashville courtroom today for a hearing scheduled to set conditions for his release pending trial on human smuggling charges.
Federal prosecutors, however, continue to fight for him to be detained. On Sunday a federal magistrate judge issued an order dismissing claims that Abrego posed a flight risk or danger to the community. Prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to challenge the order. 
Should he be released on bond, Abrego will most likely be taken into the immediate custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and could be deported, prosecutors said.
If Abrego is deported, the United States would “lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case. This would be irreparable harm to the public,” they argued in legal filings submitted Tuesday.
Prosecutors are seeking a temporary 30-day pause on proceedings to litigate their legal claims that Abrego be detained pending trial.
Federal magistrate judge denies government’s motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Family members of Abrego Garcia are also expected to make an appearance in Nashville, joining community leaders “to address concerns over due process, advocate for vulnerable communities and demand justice for Kilmar Abrego Garcia” a news release by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition said.
Abrego, an Salvadoran national living in Maryland, has served as a symbol of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. 
A father of three and a union metal sheet apprentice with no criminal history, Abrego was sent to a Salvadoran prison in March, despite a 2019 order that allowed him to reside in the country while his immigration case was considered. The 2019 immigration order specifically barred his deportation to El Salvador, where, Abrego said, he feared gang violence. 
A federal prosecutor in Maryland conceded he had been deported in error during a hearing about Abrego’s deportation. On Tuesday, the New York Times was among the news organizations that reported the prosecutor, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint that alleged he was questioned by his bosses over why he had not also argued instead that Abrego was a terrorist, despite a lack of evidence. Reuveni was then placed on administrative leave when he refused to sign onto a legal brief making the same claims against Abrego. Reuveni was subsequently fired.
The Supreme Court in April ordered federal officials to facilitate Abrego’s return. It wasn’t until June 6 that he was flown to Nashville to face criminal human charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. 
Kilmar Abrego Garcia enters not guilty pleas while federal judge defers decision on his release

Prosecutors now allege the 2022 Tennessee traffic stop was part of a national smuggling scheme in which Abrego was paid to drive immigrants illegally in the country from Texas to other states. 
An agent with the Department of Homeland Security testified he began his investigation into the three-year-old traffic stop in April, while Abrego remained in the El Salvador CECOT prison and after the Supreme Court had ordered the government to facilitate his return to the United States.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Federal prosecutors in Nashville ask judge to keep Abrego Garcia detained until trial

In her order denying the prosecutors’ motion to detain Abrego, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes expressed skepticism for some of the government’s claims. 
Federal prosecutors argued that a teen boy was present with a number of Hispanic men when Abrego was pulled over for speeding in Tennessee in 2022. The presence of a minor during a crime can be legal grounds for keeping an individual detained pending trial. They also argued that Abrego was a gang member who could intimidate potential witnesses. Abrego has not been charged with crimes related to minors or gang activity.
Holmes questioned the reliability of witnesses and evidence prosecutors cited, noting that some of the individuals made deals for their own criminal and immigration cases in exchange for their testimony. She also concluded that some of the government’s claims relied on “multiple layers of hearsay.”

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)People who believe the call to action, Black Lives Matter, to be controversial and provocative should buckle up.
What we’ve been witnessing these last weeks has been a new call to action: Immigrant Lives Matter.
Yes, even undocumented immigrant lives matter.
Black Lives Matter stirred passionate backlash unlike anything I’ve seen since the 1960s. 
Immigrant Lives Matter is now a cry to recognize the humanity of people who are suffering violent attacks after being demonized as “aliens.” 
I’ve written on immigration as a reporter, columnist and editorial writer for decades. The most invective I’ve had directed my way has been about who I am as the son of immigrants.
“Go back to Mexico” was a common retort to things I wrote. Each time I’d chuckle to myself: “Hard to do since I’m from California.” 
Yup, I’m not from Mexico. But my parents were. And they lived in this country without legal status until I was in grade school.
I’m quite familiar with immigrant life, although, thanks to the 14th Amendment (also under attack by the Trump administration), I’m a citizen. 
I’ve seen up close what being afraid of deportation looks like. The fear that a family would be torn apart, loss of livelihood and loss of the country you chose to work in, pay taxes for, build a family in and the only one your children know. And, in my case as with many other immigrants and children of immigrants, the country in whose military you chose to serve.
That experience and those decades of writing on immigration taught me that among the hottest buttons around are those dealing with the border, particularly when people cross it who don’t look and talk like you. 
Standard disclaimer: You don’t have to be a racist to be concerned about immigration and immigrants, but using terms such as invasion, infestation, vermin, criminals and threat to American identity and values is a big tell.
As is calling out the military to combat a non-existent foreign invasion.
Black Lives Matter speaks to the current plight of people whose ancestors were unwilling immigrants, packed into slave ships and brought here by force. Dehumanizing racism and the shocking mistreatment of Black citizens by police has dogged our nation from the beginning.
But  even that call to action, after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, was roundly disparaged.
Wrap your head around that. Americans who have been around since the country’s founding and over whose slavery a country fought a bitter civil war are still not considered American enough to  insist on being treated as Americans.
All that immigrants and those who stand in solidarity with them are asking is that the basic precepts of fairness, humanity and, importantly, due process extend to them as well. 
Immigrants are in a vulnerable position. Demagoguing about invasion and infestation is just too tempting for nativists and opportunists who prey on prejudices for political gain.
Los Angeles has been in the news because of protests that the Trump administration has been trying very hard to depict as a violent conflagration. But the protests have been  mostly peaceful by people reasonably objecting to ICE raids. The ICE targets are people who have worked here for years, raising U.S. citizen children and doing the work Americans won’t do. 
Despite footage of “violent“ protesters cast as “invaders” faced by brave military troops, California’s governor and many others have noted that there was no widespread, destructive civil unrest, much less the foreign invasion that the demagogues claim justifies military involvement. 
Be afraid. We need to stop underestimating the appeal of nativism. It’s real in this country.
But something happened after President Trump’s unwarranted use of the military in Los Angeles and in reaction to his military parade in Washington D.C. (lightly attended, to the president’s dismay).
The “No Kings” protests. 
I saw them as solidarity with Immigrant Lives Matter.
Black lives will always matter. After the phrase was coined, some people  insisted that it meant other lives mattered less. 
Nonsense, then and now.
Immigrant lives matter, as with Black lives, as much as your life does.  And if we don’t protect the lives of the people in the crosshairs now, we all could be next.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) With control of the Virginia House of Delegates hanging in the balance, national Democrats are pumping another $400,000 into the fight — and putting their weight behind candidates they see as crucial to flipping Republican districts this November.
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), an arm of the Democratic National Committee focused on state legislative races, announced the new funding Wednesday along with a fresh slate of endorsements for candidates running in competitive districts. 
Lindsey Dougherty will challenge Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, in the 75th District. Leslie Mehta is taking on Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, in the 89th, while. May Nivar will face Del. David Owen, R-Henrico, in the 57th District. And Kacey Robins Carnegie is up against Republican Mike Lamonea for the open Hampton Roads seat in the 89th District, following Republican Del. Baxter Ennis’ decision to not to seek reelection. 
All candidates recently won contested primaries and now enter general election matchups in districts labeled “competitive” by the Virginia Public Access Project — prime battlegrounds Democrats hope to flip and Republicans aim to defend. 
Though the DLCC backs candidates nationwide, Virginia is a centerpiece of its 2025-2026 Target Map of battleground states. Other states in the mix include North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, where Democrats are looking to flip legislatures or strengthen their footholds in GOP-leaning terrain. 
“We’re backing hardworking and authentic candidates in the toughest battlegrounds who are out in their communities every day, talking to voters about how they’ll fight the chaos in Washington and put working families’ opportunities first,” DLCC President Heather Williams said in a statement. “This investment will fuel them as they continue working on the ground to protect and expand Democrats’ razor-thin majority this fall.”
The new funding is part of a seven-figure investment the DLCC plans to make in Virginia this cycle. The DNC also announced earlier this year it will transfer $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years. 
The goal, DLCC Chair Ken Martin said, is to help build a stronger Democratic bench at the state and local levels — a strategy that could also yield future candidates for Congress and beyond.
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” Martin said in an April press call. 
Meanwhile, the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) is sharpening its focus on Virginia and New Jersey, the two states holding gubernatorial and legislative elections this year. Virginia’s off-year elections are often viewed  as a referendum on the White House —- and with President Donald Trump back in office, the RSLC is warning against a repeat of the 2017 Democratic wave. 
In a recent memo, the organization noted that Virginia has a history of electing governors from the party opposite the sitting president — a trend Republicans are eager to break this year.
To that end, the RLCC and the House Republican Campaign Committee have launched two six-figure digital ad campaigns. Republicans are also embracing early and mail-in voting to mobilize low-propensity voters — a shift encouraged by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, despite past GOP resistance to expanded absentee voting laws.

Wilder Youth Development Center in West Tennessee is slated to be built. (Photo: Google Earth)Tennessee is planning to build a juvenile detainment facility for pre-adjudication in West Tennessee even as it spends hundreds of millions reconstructing two facilities, all while the state is mired in a lawsuit alleging mistreatment of youth offenders.
Republican Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson said Tuesday he supports construction of a detention center on a Madison County site being purchased next to Jackson’s criminal justice center where minors would be held until their cases go through juvenile courts across the western part of the state. The facility could cost $45 million to $55 million, but some local governments are willing to chip in, according to Jackson.
Lawmakers passed legislation this year requiring a study of the state’s juvenile detention and treatment facilities to determine whether another center is merited. The report by the Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is expected to be finished in January 2026 to present to the legislature. But, the preliminary results appear to be clear.
“I think they found out, not just yes, but heck yes, there’s definitely a need for this in rural West Tennessee,” Jackson said.
  “Every sheriff and pretty much every juvenile judge in West Tennessee is saying we’ve got to have a place” to house juvenile offenders, said Sen. Ed Jackson, a Jackson Republican.
Outside of Memphis, only 10 beds are available in rural West Tennessee for minors awaiting adjudication for serious crimes, eight in Madison County and two in Dyer County, the senator said. 
Jackson described a situation in which Tipton County law enforcement had to hold a teenager charged with a gun-related crime in a local motel, with deputies monitoring him around the clock until his court date, because the sheriff’s office didn’t want to send him to a Memphis facility.
“Every sheriff and pretty much every juvenile judge in West Tennessee is saying we’ve got to have a place,” Jackson said.
Youthful offenders can’t be housed within hearing or eyesight of adult offenders in county jails or prisons.
State Rep. Gloria Johnson said Tuesday the state’s emphasis on toughening laws locking up minors is misplaced. Instead, Tennessee should be taking steps such as raising the minimum wage to keep teens from committing crimes, concentrating on mental health treatment and rehabilitating those who get into trouble, she said.
“I think the Tennessee Legislature is creating criminals instead of preventing them, and they just want to mass-house them. They are throwing our kids away instead of doing what’s right for them,” said Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat.
Rebuilding youth detention
The State Building Commission’s executive subcommittee this week authorized the use of a construction manager/general contractor for designing and setting a guaranteed price to build new Woodland Hills and John S. Wilder youth detention centers in Nashville and Fayette County. The projects are budgeted at a total of $333.3 million.
Those projects are moving ahead even as the state is caught in a lawsuit filed by Disability Rights Tennessee against the state, the Department of Children’s Services and the commissioners of DCS and the Department of Education in June 2024, alleging they are illegally and unconstitutionally warehousing kids with disabilities in prison-like facilities.
About 600 to 650 youth are in DCS juvenile justice custody at any one time, 1,200-1,400 annually, and an estimated 65% to 85% live with a disability, based on national data, according to Disability Rights Tennessee.










I think the Tennessee Legislature is creating criminals instead of preventing them, and they just want to mass-house them. They are throwing our kids away instead of doing what’s right for them.


– Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville


Tennessee doesn’t operate any juvenile facilities considered to be locked down, instead contracting with three Tennessee private entities for “hardware secure” facilities and another from Texas, totaling 159 beds for youths who commit serious offenses.
Thirty other facilities run by private entities provide lower level security, or secured only by personnel, similar to that at Wilder Development Center.
The year-old lawsuit details cases in which youth offenders were held in solitary confinement for months, causing them to become suicidal. It also cites the Richard L. Bean Center in Knoxville as using solitary confinement to punish youths.
Lawsuit charges Tennessee Department of Children’s Services violated kids’ constitutional rights

The lawsuit describes a 17-year-old boy beaten more than 31 times, a 15-year-old girl shackled and dragged across a floor to solitary confinement, multiple cases of pepper-spraying and situations in which “bounties” were placed on kids to induce attacks after they filed grievances against staff or complained about conditions. The filing also says packaged noodles were used to reward those who beat up other youths.
The State Building Commission’s Executive Subcommittee approved the state’s construction plan without discussion this week for Woodland Hills and Wilder facilities.
Asked if he’s concerned about the lawsuit’s allegations as the state spends heavily on new facilities, Comptroller Jason Mumpower said, “We want things to be right, both for the public and for the people who are housed there.”
Republican Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin sponsored the bill ordering a study of the state’s juvenile facilities after receiving a letter from the city of Germantown requesting more space for juvenile offenders in their region. City officials described problems with “overwhelming capacity issues” at West Tennessee detention centers and raised concerns about juvenile offenders returning to “community environments” without receiving the rehabilitation or treatment they needed.
Reedy’s bill, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County, directs the commission to study facilities that house juvenile offenders found to be delinquent and placed in the custody of the Department of Children’s Services or who are detained by juvenile courts while waiting for hearings.

(Bob Wick/BLM/Public domain)The Trump administration’s revised Department of the Interior strategic plan calls for expanded fossil fuel development across federal lands, while omitting any reference to public land sales first raised in an earlier draft.
Required under a 1993 statute and in 2010 amendments to that law, the draft plan outlines high-level goals for Interior’s management of 480 million acres of federal land, including about 24 million acres in Colorado. Language emphasizing a commitment to extraction is particularly stark. In a break from contemporary descriptions of the natural resources under federal management, the Trump administration declared in a proposed introduction to the plan that the department “is the U.S. balance sheet, and natural resources are the country’s assets.” 
“These lands — rich in energy, minerals, biodiversity, and recreational value — are worth trillions of dollars to current and future generations,” the draft introduction continues.

Chris Winter, executive director of the University of Colorado Law School’s Getches-Wilkinson Center for Natural Resources, Energy, and the Environment, said the draft plan confirms what many in the environmental community have feared: a shift away from conservation in favor of extractive industries.
“The administration is going to emphasize extractive industries and fossil fuels on federal public lands and is going to move away from conservation and renewable energy,” he said.
The plan makes no mention of renewable energy or even of climate change, a sharp contrast from Interior’s current guiding template. The Biden-era 2022–2026 strategic plan emphasized climate resilience and a transition to clean energy. The new draft, by contrast, omits the subject of climate entirely. That is one of several breakpoints critics say reflects a reversal in federal priorities.
The absence of any mention of renewable energy in the strategic plan signals, to some experts, a deeper shift in federal priorities. Wyatt Sassman, an associate professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law who specializes in natural resources matters, thinks a federal abandonment of that imperative is already underway.
“At least some reporting has suggested that (the) Fish and Wildlife (Service) has stopped issuing permits for wind energy projects,” he said. “I don’t see any legal process for that. And it’s seemingly inconsistent with the way it’s treating fossil energy projects.”
It may undercut environmental review
President Donald Trump did not wait very long after taking office to tighten restrictions even on wind energy production that does not rely on public lands for facilities. Seventeen states, including Colorado, and the District of Columbia launched litigation May 5 in a Boston-based federal court in an attempt to prevent the administration from executing his Jan. 20 executive order that purports to halt offshore wind energy development. 
Trump’s team at Interior is expected to pursue a continued sharp reversal, facilitated by a likely attempt to deregulate oil and gas activities on Bureau of Land Management and other lands and waters under Interior’s control. Authors of the document explain that the department “will focus on expediting leases and streamlining and cutting regulations while promoting conservation.” Moreover, “by offering economic incentives and better access to energy resources, Interior will encourage private investment and create more American jobs.” 
Environmental advocates say they are not surprised by the draft plan’s focus on stimulating the national economy, but they warn that the plan may presage a determined effort to evade or undercut processes mandated in public land laws. The danger in that approach, Sassman said, is that Interior decision-makers may act in a manner that is blind to environmental consequences. “My sense is that it will get in the way of them trying to make good, well-reasoned decisions,” he said.










The thing that really concerns me is that what I'm seeing is a lot of efforts to sort of cut any type of public participation, to cut any type of perceived red tape.


– Sally Paez, attorney at New Mexico Wild


Sally Paez, a staff attorney at Santa Fe-based New Mexico Wild, warned that Interior’s language about process streamlining signals an intent to sidestep longstanding environmental review laws.
“The thing that really concerns me is that what I’m seeing is a lot of efforts to sort of cut any type of public participation, to cut any type of perceived red tape,” she said. “And, by ‘perceived red tape,’ what I mean are bedrock environmental laws that are in place to make sure that extraction is done in a way that doesn’t destroy our very limited water supplies in our arid state, and doesn’t impact big game corridors or endangered species and things like that.”
Environmental advocates warned that Interior’s approach may undercut review even under the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act. Paez called the effort “unprecedented,” citing fast-tracked reviews and diminished public comment periods.
The administration did not provide in the newest version of the draft strategic plan any details about how much additional logging Interior will seek to advance on BLM lands. A March executive order directs increased logging on BLM and Forest Service lands, and the strategic plan calls for “active timber management” to reduce wildfire risk but does not specify locations at which more timber extraction would occur or the scale of tree removal.
Grazing and mining are not specifically addressed in the May document, though the drafters note a commitment to “clean coal” and reiterate a traditional adherence to “multiple-use land management.” According to the draft plan, that approach will “ensure the country’s public lands can be used for recreation, grazing, timber sales, mining, and mineral exploration, all of which provide revenue for the U.S. government.”
Public land sales dropped 
Beyond extractive industries, the strategic plan outlines priorities for water infrastructure but avoids mention of critical regional shortages. Interior would “upgrade and maintain water infrastructure to ensure water supplies while also promoting water conservation and reuse for drought resiliency.” But there is no mention in the document of how the department would approach questions of reduced supplies in the Colorado River Basin and California rivers and, other than a nod toward hydropower as an energy source, the challenge of assuring adequate flows for wild salmon in the Columbia River system and other anadromous fish freshwater habitats.
Interior offers little detail about wildlife protection in the draft strategic plan, at least beyond mention of promoting hunting and fishing on public lands and a promise “to remove harmful invasive species, delist endangered species once recovered, and involve local communities in decisions about managing nature and wildlife.” To Winter, this lack of clarity raises a risk that Interior may fail to advance the goals of the Endangered Species Act.
“We’ve already seen very aggressive steps to roll back protections under the Endangered Species Act,” he said, pointing to a recent proposal to redefine the ESA’s definition of harm to exclude damage to vital habitats. “We suspect that the administration intends to undermine protections for wildlife moving forward.”
The draft strategic plan includes a stated goal of strengthening “government-to-government relationships with Native Americans and Insular Areas.” That objective, the document says, would involve “shared management of land, increasing investment in education and jobs programs, and managing trust assets for beneficiaries.”
However, the plan does not mention existing co-stewardship arrangements at major national monuments in the West, such as Bears Ears in Utah and Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands in California. It also does not address whether those monuments will retain their protections under the Antiquities Act.
The draft strategic plan’s utilitarian perspective may nevertheless have little impact on expected legal battles over the department’s efforts during the next few years to facilitate oil, gas, and coal production and mineral exploration, logging, and grazing.
“I’ve never seen the strategic plans relied on in a legal context,” Sassman said. “There are other kinds of legal actions they will have to take in order to effectuate these goals.”
A first effort at a 2026-2030 plan, released in April, also declared that Interior’s first priority will be to “restore American prosperity.” That version, unlike the one Interior released last month, also explicitly raised the prospect of public land sales. Winter said that the exclusion of that idea from the new rendering should not be taken as a signal that the administration has abandoned the proposition. 
“I don’t think the administration is backing away from that idea,” he said. “This issue is being taken up by Congress as part of the (budget) reconciliation process and this is really an issue that will be determined by Congress and not by the department because that’s where the authority lies.” 
The public will have an opportunity to comment on the plan, once Interior finalizes a draft. The department has not yet posted it at regulations.gov, the federal government’s online portal for that purpose.

As U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) conducts raids on farms at the direction of the Trump administration, some lawmakers and agricultural organizations in Pennsylvania are criticizing the effort.
“This move could have devastating consequences for our nation’s food security,” Pennsylvania Farm Bureau President Chris Hoffman said in a statement. “Without a stable, dependable workforce, our fields will go unplanted, our crops unharvested, and our livestock uncared for. The dedicated men and women who work on our farms alongside our farmers are not just employees; they are the bedrock of our food supply chain. 
“Any disruption to their ability to work threatens the availability and affordability of food for every American family,” he added. 
The organization has more than 25,000 members and is the largest agriculture organization in the state. Hoffman said he and his fellow farmers are “deeply concerned” about the reports that Trump’s administration, after a brief pause, would resume and continue ICE raids on farms, ranches and packing plants.
Bailey Fisher, the group’s federal affairs specialist, told the Capital-Star the organization is worried that the raids can impact agriculture when they are already facing a workforce shortage.
“Agriculture and the workforce is not something where you can just hire a new person every week. It takes a while to train that person, especially if they’re working with livestock,” Fisher said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One example she noted was how some may not feel comfortable working with a dairy cow or may not have the background with large animals.
“So, it’s not just a matter of finding just somebody to milk your cow,” Fisher said. “It takes experience. It takes somebody who’s comfortable doing it, knowing the animal, knowing what the animal needs.”
“It’s not just something that anybody can do and that anybody wants to do,” she added.
Pennsylvania’s dairy industry is the number one segment of its agriculture economy, according to Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture.
Fisher said she has heard the calls for the industry to just “hire domestic” workers.
“We have tried that. Trust me, we have tried every possible solution you could think of, and the domestic workforce is just not there in the Ag industry,” Fisher said. “A lot of Americans, they prefer the office job over getting up at 4 a.m. to go milk a dairy cow or being out in the hot summer heat, picking lettuce, harvesting lettuce, or fruit, etc.”
Fisher said she’s seen reports about ICE raids on farms in other states, but as of Tuesday afternoon, has not received any calls about any recently taking place in Pennsylvania.
She said while the group’s members respect federal agents and federal officials, they should know their rights and have the paperwork prepared.
“So we’re telling them, ‘Don’t be disorganized. Have your information ready to go, if need be,’” Fisher said.
She said the Farm Bureau hasn’t sent out any guidance for supervisors and workers on how to handle a visit from ICE, but instead is leaving that up to the employers to seek their own legal guidance.
“We don’t really try to get involved in guiding them on legal issues like that,” she said.
The administration’s change of heart has rankled some members of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation.
U.S. Rep. Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson (R-Centre) represents the commonwealth’s rural 15th Congressional District. He called the raids earlier this month in some states “just wrong.”

Thompson, the first Pennsylvanian to chair the House Committee on Agriculture in nearly 170 years, is a Trump ally. But, he also realizes the potential impact on the country.
“They need to knock it off,” Thompson told reporters on June 12, according to POLITICO. “Let’s go after the criminals and give us time to put processes in place, so we don’t disrupt the food supply chain.”
U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, has also been critical of the approach.
“I’ve been clear that we need to address the immigration crisis in our nation and keep violent criminals off our streets – but deporting the hardworking people who keep farms across our country afloat is not the solution,” Fetterman told the Capital-Star. “If we just round up the 40 percent of farmworkers who don’t have papers without a real plan, the only thing we’ll do is increase costs for families.”
“I’ve shared my concerns with Secretary (Brooke) Rollins and am grateful for her partnership as we continue protecting Pennsylvania farmers and farmworkers,” he added. “Instead of treating migrant labor as a political football, we need legislative reform to address this issue head on.”
One potential solution to Fetterman is the Affordable and Secure Food Act, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO). The proposal would provide a number of reforms, including extending the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program. The United States Department of Agriculture describes the program as one that “helps American farmers fill employment gaps by hiring workers from other countries.”
During a Q&A with the Capital-Star this past March, Thompson discussed the need to reform the H2-A program, saying it “does not help our year-round agriculture needs.”










A lot of Americans, they prefer the office job over getting up at 4 a.m. to go milk a dairy cow or being out in the hot summer heat, picking lettuce, harvesting lettuce, or fruit.


– Bailey Fisher, the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau's federal affairs specialist.


Hoffman, the state Farm Bureau president, also called on Congress to prioritize H-2A visa reform and described the current system as “cumbersome, expensive, and fails to meet the year-round needs of modern agriculture.”
The American Immigration Council estimates that 196,100 undocumented migrants live in Pennsylvania, which is based on the most recently available census data from 2023. Just under 30,000 may work in the farming industry, according to estimates from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, which cites 2017 census data.
The Capital-Star reached out to Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District), a member of the House Agriculture Committee, for comment, but did not receive any responses. Thompson also did not respond to an additional request for comment.

There are many things that have changed for the better in North Carolina prisons over the last century.
That said, it’s also true that North Carolina summers have always been miserably hot and that commercial air conditioning was first introduced nearly a century ago — facts that render the lack of air conditioning in many of our state’s prisons today an absolute scandal.
The Department of Correction has been pursuing an initiative to finally end this tortuous situation, but there remains a long way to go as many facilities remain unairconditioned.
And that harsh reality is a threat to everyone in the facility – guards and incarcerated people alike – especially men and women prisoners who are elderly and in bad health.
The bottom line: As with the lack of adequate staff and so many other inhumanities in our prison system, it’s our cheapskate legislature’s refusal to appropriate adequate funds that is ultimately to blame. One wishes each lawmaker would have to spend a summer night in one of these facilities to experience the cruel and unusual punishment their inaction is inflicting.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)More than 100 bills now have a chance to ultimately become law this year, though many with reduced price tags and scope.
Among those advanced were bills to approve exclusive rights to internet gaming for Wabanaki Nations, establish a property tax relief task force, add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns, and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer. 
The Legislature will return on Wednesday to ultimately decide which to send to Gov. Janet Mills, as well as to potentially consider other bills still in limbo in the chambers. 
The 116 proposals advanced on Tuesday were selected out of nearly 300 bills that had been placed on what’s known as the appropriations table, which is managed by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee that sets the budget. Most bills placed on the table already passed both chambers but still need to be funded. 
In total, the bills on the table would have cost about $2.5 billion over the next two years, but there is about $7 million left to be allocated after Mills signed the budget addition into law on Monday. 
Some of the bills the appropriations committee voted “off the table,” to send back to the full Legislature for consideration, were advanced without changes. 
That was the case for the bills related to igaming for the Tribes, the property tax task force and Asian American history requirements. It was also the vase for a bill to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department and another to alter the real estate transfer tax in an effort to protect mobile home parks.
However, the committee amended a number of bills to reduce their cost or strike it altogether.
For example, the committee voted LD 1126 — the bill to require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns — off the table after removing its appropriations, noting that the Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck said the positions those funds would have supported were not necessary to fulfill the goal of the bill. 
Meanwhile, another bill related to firearm regulation — LD 1867, to prohibit financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases  — remains on the table, though Republicans on the committee attempted to move it off.
One of the most common ways the committee amended bills was by striking their fiscal notes but then allocating just $500 to set up a fund that keeps a path open for future funding, by the state or other revenue. 
This was the case for LD 1738, which aims to fund proper disposal of syringe litter, LD 1529, which seeks to enhance the protection of high-value natural resources statewide, and LD 1643, which would establish the Maine Life Science Innovation Center, among others. 
After the committee included a $3 million appropriation for family planning services in the budget, it opted to also vote an amended version of a bill, LD 143, off the table to provide up to another $3 million by making such a transfer a priority for any unappropriated surplus of the general fund.
This move received sharp rebukes from Republicans on the committee, including Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) who said she was “thoroughly disgusted.”
But Republicans on the committee successfully moved a few items off the table. One was a bill to create the Net Energy Billing Cost Stabilization Fund. Another was a bill to provide that accrued and unused hours of earned paid leave from the previous year of employment must be available in the year of employment. And another was a bill to extend the statute of limitations on criminal actions involving aggravated sex trafficking.
In other cases, the committee funded proposals but at reduced amounts.
This occurred with bills to fund free health clinics and the Maine Emergency Medical Services Community Grant Program, as well as two proposals to reduce student homelessness, one aimed at helping students at risk of homelessness and another aimed at students who are already unhoused. 
One bill ended up requiring no committee action — LD 1425, which aims to improve access to sustainable and low-barrier trauma recovery services — because it is being funded by settlement money provided by the Office of the Maine Attorney General. 
This bill as well as a handful that were incorporated into the budget will still remain “on the table” upon adjournment because they’ve been funded an alternative way. 
Some of the bills on the table that were funded through the budget include an expansion of Maine’s version of a child tax credit for children under six and an initiative to help mitigate the fact that the Older Americans Act is no longer funded by the federal government.
Further, committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said before concluding work Tuesday night that the committee intends to carry over the bills still on the table into next year. 
“There’s another chance for all of them,” Rotundo said.

The changes expand GOP control of elections to the local level. 
Last month, Boliek appointed a Republican majority state elections board under a new law that took appointment power away from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. 
Stein has sued over the law, but state appellate courts have allowed it to go into effect. Historically, the governor’s party has held majorities on the state and county boards. 
Reporter Bryan Anderson was first to identify the partisan switch. 
Local boards of election are the on-the-ground decision makers that pick polling locations, set early voting schedules and hours, and decide whether provisional ballots should be accepted. 
Local board majorities appoint county elections directors with approval from the state Board of Elections executive director. 
The new Republican state Board of Elections made quick use of its power to replace the state elections director with Republican Sam Hayes last month at its first meeting. 
“I hope we’ll continue to have an election board that is focused on upholding the laws of the state of North Carolina and not involved in the partisan politics,” Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), one of the Senate Elections Committee chairmen, said Tuesday afternoon. 
Greg Flynn was a Democratic member of the Wake County board who was not reappointed Tuesday. 
Flynn said in his years on the Wake board, most of its votes were unanimous and members “worked together pretty well.”
The change “I think will have a big effect on early voting site decisions,” he said. 
In 2018, when local boards were split 2-2, Wake Republicans voted against opening an early voting site at NC State University, Raleigh’s News & Observer reported. In 2014, a dispute over a proposed early voting site at Appalachian State University in Boone reached the state Supreme Court, WRAL reported. 
The state Board of Elections met Tuesday to approve a plan to collect missing identification numbers from voters who don’t have them attached to their names in the state’s electronic voter database. 
About 98,000 of these voters, those who registered after 2004, won’t be able to have their ballots automatically count until they provide a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number. The Board is going to send information to these voters asking for the information next month. 
Mail will go out later this summer to about 96,000 voters who don’t have that information attached to their files, but who showed ID when voting. They will vote regular ballots. 
A third mailing will go out to voters who haven’t responded to previous notices. 
The mailings will include pre-addressed, postage-paid envelopes.
Additionally, county elections officials will review the electronic files for data that is missing even though the voters supplied it. 
The Trump Justice Department sued the Board of Elections last month claiming that the missing government numbers violate federal law. 
Hayes told the Board the Justice Department has tentatively signed off on the plan and it could result in an agreement to resolve the lawsuit. 
The DOJ lawsuit echoed claims that GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin, the failed candidate for a state Supreme Court seat, made as he tried to overturn his Democratic opponent’s November victory. 
The Republican National Committee and the state Republican party made the same claim when it sought to purge 225,000 voters from the rolls. 
As part of Griffin’s suit, the state Court of Appeals ordered the Board to gather the missing voter information.
The goal of the data collection is to comply with the Court of Appeals order and resolve the lawsuits, Hayes said. 
“I intend to follow the law, both the letter and spirit,” Hayes said.  “I believe that this will instill confidence in our elections, and I have said election security and voter access are just two sides of the same coin.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5071578-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-25 06:00:36.370628

(Photo courtesy of Wyatt Young)As Virginia’s various government agencies wait to hear how the federal budget will affect their funding, some departments have already seen significant cuts that are putting a hold on important hazard mitigation projects and emergency management support.
In an effort to understand the full scope of federal cuts on the commonwealth, state House members have been hosting committee meetings in communities across Virginia. In a Friday meeting in Norfolk, which increasingly faces rising sea levels and coastal land loss, officials shared projects and goals that will not move forward.
“This is fiduciary responsibility in making sure that we’re preparing our communities for what is 100% coming,” said Jay Ford, the Virginia Policy Manager for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “And if we don’t, we’re going to be holding the bill at a multiplier many times higher on the backside. It’s about making limited tax dollars go further, and the right move there is to invest in climate resilience on the front end.”
According to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, projects in the region that have already had their federal funding cut include:

Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation – $300,000 for flood mitigation from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
City of Hampton and nonprofit Wetlands Watch – $20 million for flood mitigation at Aberdeen Gardens from the Environmental Protection Agency
Newport News – $517,000 for Stoney Run Flood reduction improvements
City of Portsmouth – $24 million for improvements to the Lake Meade Dam
Hampton Roads Planning District Commission – $200,000 for updates to Hazard Mitigation Plan

“People got caught up on buzzwords and that’s super unfortunate. But each administration will have different priorities,” Ford said. “But at the end of the day, if someone actually looked at these projects, these are infrastructure, plain and simple.”
The Lake Meade Dam funding was part of the cancelled Building Resilient Infrastructure Communities program that was discontinued by FEMA earlier this year. It also had allocated $12 million to improve Richmond’s water treatment facility that has been plagued with issues leading to multiple boil water advisories this year.
“When we’re looking at dam safety or we’re looking at a neighborhood where more than a quarter of the citizens live in the flood zone, it has nothing to do with this bigger picture of climate change. I mean, that is exacerbating the issue, but this is just about people and water quantity and health and human safety,” Ford said. “…the end result is, we have neighborhoods that are less safe as a result of that, and we have a high risk situation with flood damage to personal property and risk to human safety.”
Ford said the loss of research and data from the U.S. Geological Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration due to funding cuts harms local municipalities that rely on that information to form their resiliency and infrastructure plans. He highlighted the work being done at universities across the commonwealth that can help fill some of those gaps.
“We have tremendous capacity, but we’re not really centralizing it in any way to make sure everyone’s working together to help protect Virginia communities. And we’re really under investing in them,” Ford said.
Local governments are now looking for alternative funding streams for projects that have been cut. While it is unclear the scope of what the federal government will be willing to pay for as larger budget debates are carried out, some of the projects are being retooled in the application process to submit to other agencies as infrastructure projects rather than solely resilience projects.
In terms of state funding for resiliency projects, Virginia is still missing out on millions of dollars for flood mitigation because Gov. Glenn Youngkin removed the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI. While the Floyd County Circuit Court ruled his removal of the state from the program unlawful, the state has not been placed back into the program while appeals play out, Inside Climate News reports.
“We’ve had the situation now where scores of localities have finished a resilience plan. They’ve sent it to the state hoping that was going to unlock these community flooded preparedness dollars, and the pool has just shrunk significantly because we’ve gotten out of RGGI,” Ford said.
With flood mitigation projects taking a backseat, the Virginia Emergency Management Association (VEMA) is urging legislators to find a way to fund their work without federal help, or at least less of it. VEMA supports state agencies, schools, higher education institutions, businesses, faith-based organizations, and others in emergency situations.
Unlike The Virginia Department of Emergency Management, VEMA is more focused on advocacy and expanding emergency management to corners of the state that may not have a full time emergency manager in place. 
“One dollar spent in mitigation renders six dollars worth of cost savings in a future disaster,” said Jared Hoernig, co-chair of VEMA’s legislative committee. “You know that is significant if we can relate to the studies like for the Hampton road area where there was a $15.6 billion potential loss if we had a category three hurricane that hit Hampton Roads”

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-06-25 09:02:03+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,SNAP doesn’t just feed families — it sustains Pennsylvania’s farms and food economy,Capital-Star Guest Contributor,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/food-insecurity/snap-doesnt-just-feed-families-it-sustains-pennsylvanias-farms-and-food-economy/,"Agriculture is Pennsylvania’s leading industry. Roughly 25 cents from every grocery dollar spent goes back to the farm. That means when SNAP dollars are slashed, it’s not just low-income households that suffer, it’s also the 48,800 family-run farms across the state that feel the blow.","A “SNAP welcomed here” sign is seen at the entrance to a Big Lots store in Portland, Oregon. (Getty Images)A package of lean ground beef tastes the same whether you pay for it with cash, credit, or  EBT card. Food retailers should know. They are the ones putting it out for sale each day for  their customers.  
Out of the 40,000 different food items you might see in a larger supermarket, ground beef is  one of the most commonly purchased by both SNAP and non-SNAP households. It’s up  there with a gallon of milk, a loaf of bread, and poultry. 
The biggest difference between a SNAP household and a non-SNAP household? An EBT  card, and some tough times. Not what they buy. 
In fact, when it comes to food items purchased by SNAP households – an overwhelming  majority of which include at least one member who is a child, an elderly adult, or person  with a disability – the top ten categories and top seven specific commodities are the same,  though ordered differently. 
The reason is simple. 
SNAP families are regular families who happen to need some  temporary assistance putting food on the table. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When the USDA studied this issue, they found that about 40 cents of every dollar of food  expenditures by SNAP households is spent on basic items such as meat, fruits, vegetables,  milk, eggs, and bread. Another 40 cents are spent on a variety of items such as cereal,  prepared foods, dairy products, rice, and beans. The last 20 cents out of every dollar  typically goes on sweetened beverages, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar.  
For non-SNAP households? Pretty much the same.  
And just as important, the economic activity that SNAP purchases support is exactly the  same as from a non-SNAP household. Grocers don’t order SNAP ground beef and non SNAP ground beef. Beef is beef. Milk is milk. Bananas are bananas.  
Businesses along Pennsylvania’s food supply chain – from your local grocery and  convenience store, to wholesale and distribution companies, food producers, and farmers  – all benefit greatly from SNAP. It’s arguably the most successful public-private partnership in  American history. 
Recent events and some back-of-the-napkin math bear it out. During the COVID-19  pandemic, the federal government introduced SNAP Emergency Allotments (EAs) to help  address rising food insecurity. These were temporary, additional payments to households  receiving SNAP benefits. EAs provided SNAP households an additional $95 in benefits per  month, at minimum. When EAs ended in March 2023, the Department of Human Services  reported an average loss of $181 per SNAP household across Pennsylvania.
Beyond what that loss meant for families themselves – and we know it meant increased  food insecurity, greater reliance on food pantries, and heightened financial stress – for  businesses in the food sector it meant, quite literally, less food being purchased, and  therefore ordered, and therefore produced. 
With more than one million SNAP households in  Pennsylvania each losing an average of $181, we can estimate a direct contraction of  almost $189 million per month in the state’s food economy when Emergency Allotments  ended. And of course the true economic impact was larger than that because we know that  for every dollar invested in SNAP, there is an impact worth more than $1.50 that goes into  local economies supporting those businesses getting food to store shelves, and the people  they employ.

As you read this, Congress is contemplating massive changes to how SNAP is funded.  While exact figures remain the subject of negotiation, the upshot is that a sea change could  be on the way that would fundamentally alter how food assistance works in the United  States, with potentially catastrophic impacts not just to SNAP recipients but your local  supermarket, food producers, and farmers across Pennsylvania. 
Of course there are always opportunities and ways to improve the way government  programs work, and we should be clear-eyed about taking on that challenge when it comes  to SNAP. 
But the fact is it remains a highly popular, and massively successful program that  fundamentally achieves what it sets out to do: Provide temporary assistance to families  who need help putting food on the table.  
SNAP also means a great deal to the farmers, truck drivers, warehouse workers, and food  sellers in our communities, who all benefit from the added demand the program helps  support. Pennsylvanians, and in particular our congressional delegation, should not lose  sight of that as work on a federal budget reaches a climax in Washington.

For the second week in a row, Ohio Senate Bill 56 was up for a possible vote out of the Ohio House Judiciary Committee, but both times the vote did not take place. 
Once the bill is voted out of committee, it can be brought to the House floor for a vote. The Senate passed the bill in February.

Last week, the bill was removed from the committee agenda and this week the committee meeting — which only had S.B. 56 on the agenda — was canceled. 
“We are going to push pause,” state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said when asked about the marijuana bill. “We’re going to take the summer and come back and potentially take another crack at it.”
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said the Senate raised more than a dozen issues related to S.B. 56 last week. 
“I just told my caucus, ‘We’re not going to just say, OK, because we’re so anxious to pass the marijuana bill, which I’d like to get it done, but we’re not going to give up House priorities to do that,’” he said last week. 
The lawmakers are currently working on the state’s two-year operating budget, which Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine must sign before July 1. The lawmakers will go on summer break after the budget is finished.
S.B. 56 would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, limit the number of active dispensaries to 400 and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
It would keep Ohio’s home grow the same at a limit of six plants per person and 12 plants per residence. State Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, introduced the bill in January and the bill originally would have limited Ohio’s home grow from 12 plants down to six. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment.
“The people of Ohio spoke very clearly on this issue,” said Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. “They knew what they were voting on, and they voted to pass adult-use cannabis recreationally here in the state of Ohio.”
Intoxicating hemp products 
The House has made significant changes to S.B. 56, most notably adding regulations to intoxicating hemp products.
As the bill currently stands, only a licensed marijuana dispensary would be able to sell intoxicating hemp products that have been tested and complied with packaging, labeling and advertising requirements.
The Ohio Department of Commerce would regulate intoxicating hemp products and drinkable cannabinoid products. Grocery stores, carryout stores, bars, and restaurants would continue to be able to sell drinkable cannabinoid products.
Isaacsohn agrees there should be regulations around intoxicating hemp products, but wants it to happen through a “clean bill.”
“It is so tied up in trying to overturn the will of the voters,” he said. “If we had a clean bill to fairly regulate intoxicating hemp, we could have voted on it months ago, years ago. … There are so many common sense things that we agree on, and when the majority brings forward a clean bill, we would be happy to vote for it.”

The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
State Rep. D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron, was planning on introducing amendments to the bill’s hemp provisions during Tuesday’s committee meeting, but that didn’t happen since the meeting was canceled. 
The American Republic Policy worked with Swearingen on the amendments which would have allowed licensed hemp companies in Ohio to continue to operate their retail stores and create a unified regulatory framework for hemp and marijuana products, said Dakota Sawyer of American Republic Policy. 
“The same regulations that would apply to marijuana under the Ohio administration code would apply to hemp products as well,” he said. “We are ensuring that we do not have state-sanctioned monopolies in the state of Ohio, that federally legal hemp products can be accessed through independent businesses, and that they would not be forced to go into dispensaries.” 
Sawyer said forcing hemp products into only dispensaries would eliminate market competition. 
“We want to ensure that there are options out for people, to ensure that they are able to purchase what they love, what they would want … and to ensure that we do not have state-sanctioned monopolies,” he said. 
State Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, said 3,000 hemp businesses would close if S.B. 56 passes as it currently stands — with hemp products only being sold in dispensaries. 
“We need to reward the good actors,”  she said. “We need to ID check our hemp products when it is consumable. We also need to allow these businesses to stay open.”
Wesley Bryant, company owner of 420 Craft Beverages in Cleveland, said he already does many of the things that are outlined in the proposed amendment. 
“Every square inch of my facility is fully covered by cameras,” he said. “We have a full track and traceability of everything that comes into my facility. We even go so far as to double check IDs. And my doors stay locked throughout the day. You have to be buzzed in order to enter the facility.”
DeWine and various lawmakers have expressed safety concerns for children when it comes to hemp products, but Sawyer said the average age of an Ohio hemp customer is 40 years old. 
“It’s not geared towards children,” Sawyer said. “What some legislators have done is created this mystical boogeyman that says that all these hemp people are doing all these crazy things that are attracting minors. And essentially we’re saying, let’s punish the bad actors that are doing that, but let’s not punish the good guys for that.” 
But Adrienne Robbin, deputy executive director of Ohio Cannabis Coalition (OHCANN), said Ohio children are being put at risk by intoxicating hemp products. 
“It’s a sad day for all Ohioans that we’re going to continue to see these illicit products be sold in our state over the summer,” she said. “These products are being marketed to (children) specifically,” she said. “I think the hemp industry is really good at pulling a few good actors out and highlighting them, but the reality is, the majority of these products are illicit.”
Sawyer said he would prefer to see the legislation as two separate bills — one with marijuana regulations and a separate one with hemp regulations. 
“Marijuana and hemp are totally separate in terms of the industry and products,” he said.

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Rep. Juliet Harvey-Bolia said she filed House Bill 71 last year as “a contingency plan” in case Kamala Harris won the U.S. presidential election and “people were going to continue flowing through the border.” She said Donald Trump’s victory made the bill less important, but she decided not to withdraw it because “there’s no harm in putting the bill through anyway.”
If passed on Thursday and signed into law by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, HB 71 would ban New Hampshire public schools, colleges, and universities from housing immigrants. Any school in violation would lose state funding. The bill includes exceptions for short-term shelter during natural disasters, such as a hurricane or snowstorm. It would include both migrants being housed while the government tries to resettle them and while they’re en route to deportation.
Harvey-Bolia said this is about ensuring schools aren’t shut down to make space for migrants.
“This is about students,” she said. “After we went through COVID and all that, I think us parents were frustrated with shutdowns.”
Harvey-Bolia, a Tilton Republican, said the inspiration for the bill was a school closing in New York City to shelter migrants. In January 2024, during a severe storm, migrants were moved from a tent shelter to a Brooklyn high school during a severe storm, a move that caused intense backlash from the community, according to news reports from the city. Students attended classes online for one day while migrants waited out the storm.
She and other lawmakers also pointed to the issues at migrant shelters in Massachusetts, arguing they’re inappropriate for school buildings. Last Monday, during a committee meeting to discuss the bill, Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican, said he did a public records request for incident reports at facilities in Massachusetts that were used to house migrants.
“Looking through them, there were incidents like fights, assaults, overdoses, rapes, and attempted suicides in those reports,” Cordelli said. “A lot of the reports were redacted, a lot of information, but that’s what I found going through them.”
Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, said that for these provisions, the “base policy” of the bill, “we all agree with it.” However, there were differences between the House and Senate’s positions on other aspects of the bill.
Non-germane amendments
In addition to the sections regarding use of school and college buildings to house migrants, the Senate added new unrelated provisions to the bill that were not present in the House’s version. One of those provisions would require towns and cities with 10,000 or more people to personally notify homeowners of any changes to their property’s valuation and to post the change publicly in a newspaper, online, and on social media. 
When negotiators from the House and Senate met to hash out these differences last week, House representatives accepted the change but with one tweak. They removed the requirement that municipalities personally notify homeowners because they were afraid it would require them to purchase stamps, making it an unfunded mandate. The language was updated to just require they post the valuation changes publicly.
Senate negotiators also tried unsuccessfully to get their House counterparts to incorporate language from a different bill, Senate Bill 241, into HB 71. That language sets up a state fund to accept private donations to raise money for the state parks division to build a wheelchair accessible pier at Hampton Beach. Negotiators with the Senate argued it would create a tourist attraction, allow people with disabilities to enjoy the beach, and be done without state funding. House negotiators refused to accept the provision over concerns about maintenance and parking, and doubts that private donations would cover the project.
The negotiators will now take the newly amended bill, with the property valuation provision, to their respective chambers for a full floor vote on Thursday. If it passes both chambers, Ayotte will have the options of signing it into law, vetoing it, or allowing it to become law without her signature.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/migrantsschools-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 06:00:36.370628

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
Uber, Lyft oppose some bills that aim to prevent assaults during rides

That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.










We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault.


– Rachel Lovell, associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University


But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
Thousands are suing states over sexual abuse in juvenile detention facilities

In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sexual assault survivors can now track their rape kits in most states

In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

The decision marks a partial victory for Gov. Josh Stein, who sued over provisions of Senate Bill 382 — a measure approved by the GOP-dominated General Assembly shortly after last fall’s election that sough to limit gubernatorial powers. A panel of the Wake Superior Court ruled in his favor on judicial appointments, but against him on a provision removing his ability to appoint a member and the chair of the North Carolina Utilities Commission. The court also upheld a separate law reducing Stein’s power over the Building Code Council by requiring supermajority votes for any action.
The three-judge panel was made up of James Floyd Ammons, Jr., A. Graham Shirley, and Imelda J. Pate — an Independent, Republican, and Democrat, respectively. The law would have helped Republicans maintain dominant majorities on the state Court of Appeals and Supreme Court, where they control 12 of 15 seats and five of seven seats, respectively.
Stein lost two challenges to other provisions of SB 382 earlier this year, with a Wake Superior Court panel ruling against him on a section of the bill removing the State Highway Patrol from his authority and a Court of Appeals panel denying his effort to retain oversight of the State Board of Elections, despite a Superior Court ruling in his favor.
Stein posted a reaction to the ruling on his personal account on the social media platform X expressing a mixed reaction:

“The court’s decision supporting the Governor’s authority to make judicial vacancies maintains our state’s separation of powers. The court should have followed those same principles in its ruling on the Utilities Commission and Building Code Council, and I’m disappointed it did not.
Utility costs are rising, and heat waves like this week prove the importance of our state’s diverse energy mix and clean energy economy. As our state legislature and our federal government both seek to roll back our clean energy future, North Carolina families will be the ones who foot the bill.”    
State Treasurer Brad Briner, who received appointment power to the Utilities Commission in place of Stein, praised the Superior Court for upholding his new authority. In April, he named former environment secretary and climate change skeptic Donald van der Vaart to the board.
“This decision affirms that the governor does not have ultimate authority over other duly elected members of the Council of State to carry out their roles and responsibilities as members of the executive branch,” he said. “The judges, to their credit, carefully reviewed the matter, and properly found that the General Assembly is not prohibited from empowering the treasurer to appoint a member to the Utilities Commission.”
Tuesday’s decision is likely to be appealed to the state Court of Appeals, which has shown a greater willingness to support Republican efforts to tighten control of the judiciary, such as when it backed Judge Jefferson Griffin’s challenge to the state Supreme Court race.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Owners of small pharmacies — many themselves members of local chambers of commerce — are accusing the Ohio Chamber of Commerce of siding with huge corporate middlemen who are driving them out of business. 
That undermines Ohioans’ health and costs the state’s businesses and taxpayers far more in the long run, the pharmacists say.
Pharmacies of all sizes are battling with drug middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, over provisions in the state budget governing how prescription drugs are priced and how pharmacies are paid for dispensing them. 
Measures intended to help pharmacies were built into the Ohio House version of the state operating budget, stripped out by the Ohio Senate, and are now in the hands of a conference committee working against a June 30 deadline.
New data show Ohio pharmacy closures even worse than originally thought

Ohio and other states have been hemorrhaging pharmacies for years, and at an accelerating pace. Last year, Ohio lost 215 pharmacies and the total number dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory, according to an online tracker launched by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. 
That creates serious health concerns, especially in underserved areas where many face health and transportation challenges. The loss of a community’s sole pharmacy can make it nearly impossible for some to get their medicine or professional advice about how to manage their diabetes or blood pressure.
Closures of isolated pharmacies creates deserts, and they’re growing. In Meigs County in Southeastern Ohio, for example, nearly 40% of the census tracts are part of what the pharmacy board calls pharmacy deserts. 
“As more pharmacies close in Ohio, we’re going to see poorer health — we’re not going to see positive outcomes,” said Denise Conway, owner of Conway’s Danville Pharmacy. “We’re going to see more ER visits. It’s just going to cost employers more.”
CVS in 2017 bought and closed the Lonsinger’s, the sole pharmacy in Danville, leaving the nearest one in Mount Vernon, 12 miles away.
“One man broke down crying,” librarian Betty Carpenter in 2019 told The Columbus Dispatch about an elderly resident. “He said, ‘I can’t walk to Mount Vernon.’ He could walk to Lonsinger’s.”
Also in 2019, Conway and her husband bought a Danville building and opened a pharmacy there while Knox County opened a health clinic on the premises. It was a rare example of a health care desert restored to life. Other Ohio communities aren’t likely to be so fortunate.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We’re down to about 300 independents,” said Dave Burke, a pharmacist, former state senator and executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association. “We’re really afraid as an organization that people are going to lose access to care. Care that keeps them out of the hospital. Care that shortens their stay in the hospital. And care that keeps them employed.”
Burke and many other pharmacists blame the rush of closures on the conduct of the big PBMs, the middlemen that are part of giant corporations. They decide on behalf of insurers what drugs are covered, and they decide how much to reimburse pharmacies for the drugs they dispense.
The three biggest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRX and Express Scripts — control nearly 80% of the covered prescriptions in the United States. 
Critics say that enables them to extract huge, non-transparent discounts from drugmakers. They say it also enables them to force pharmacies into disadvantageous, take-it-or-leave-it contracts. Critics say that reimbursements under them are low and that they impose arbitrary rules and fees.
Each of the big-three PBMs is part of a vertically integrated, Fortune 15 health conglomerate. Each of those also owns a top-10 health insurer.
In addition, CVS owns the largest retail pharmacy chain and they all own mail-order pharmacies. So the big three get to decide how much to reimburse their own pharmacies as well as those of their competitors. 
Pharmacists and their advocates say the disputed language in the state budget would end those conflicts and rectify many problems. 
It would prohibit PBMs from imposing rules (and subsequently charging fees) that go beyond those of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. It would end the murky system of reimbursements by requiring PBMs to pay pharmacies the prices listed in a public database — the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, survey. 
And it would require PBMs to pay pharmacies roughly $10 for each prescription they dispense. With the NADAC reimbursement meant to ensure pharmacies break even on the drugs, the dispensing fees are meant to cover overhead such as payroll, supplies, rent, and insurance.
“By definition the calculation is break-even,” Burke said. “You are paying (Medicaid’s) post-rebate cost of the drug. The only way to cover the bottle, the cost of the lid, the bag, the heat, the lights, the payroll is the dispensing fee.”
The provisions that the state Senate stripped out of its budget version mirror reforms the Ohio Department of Medicaid undertook in 2022. 
Following concerns among pharmacists and investigations by a newspaper and the state auditor, the department mounted its own probe of drug transactions. It learned that in 2017, two PBMs — CVS Caremark and OptumRx — billed the state $224 million more for drugs than they paid the pharmacies that had bought and dispensed them.
The Medicaid department fired the PBMs, created its own, single PBM, based reimbursements on the NADAC survey and started paying pharmacists a $10 per-prescription dispensing fee. 
Despite the higher reimbursements and dispensing fees, an analysis released earlier this year found that the new arrangement saved the state $140 million. That led many to conclude that the middlemen were skimming a hefty portion of the money flowing through the system.
Ohio Medicaid got rid of big middlemen, paid pharmacies more and saved $140 million, report says

Even so, applying the same rules to non-Medicaid transactions would “harm small businesses and their employees,” said Rick Carfagna, a former state representative who is now the senior vice president of government affairs at the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.
“PBMs are business-to-business entities, and they exist only because a company or health plan hires them,” Carfagna said in an email. “When you increase dispensing fees on a per-prescription basis, you’re impacting the ability of employers, including small businesses, local governments and labor organizations, to balance their budgets by controlling their health care costs. These increased fees eventually find their way downstream, in whole or in part, to all of those employers utilizing PBMs.”
Carfagna didn’t respond directly when asked whether Ohio’s independent and small-chain pharmacies are themselves small businesses that have been rapidly disappearing. 
Conway, who is herself chair-elect of the Knox County Chamber of Commerce, said Carfagna and the Ohio Chamber used deceptive language in fighting for the PBMs.
“The Ohio Chamber in their testimony called the dispense fee a tax,” she said. “It’s by no means a tax. It’s the cost of running a business. A dispense fee has always been built into the model of reimbursing a pharmacy. You can’t put a zero there. It’s the cost of running a business.”
Burke, executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, said the Ohio Chamber’s position also ignores that Ohio Medicaid saved money when it increased dispensing fees and switched to a transparent system of reimbursements. Several other states, most recently Minnesota, have adopted similar arrangements.
“Every state that has gone to a transparent model hasn’t gone back to the traditional one,” Burke said. “They’re saving money and they’re not going back.”

Republish photo only with original article.)With the three-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion rights advocates are looking at a time when funding cuts could spell the closure of clinics and the limiting of reproductive access in Ohio and nationwide.
But local advocates are also resolute in saying health clinics will continue to serve Ohioans, and fight to maintain the rights in the state.
The federal budget reconciliation bill is still being debated, but one provision that has been included would “defund” Planned Parenthood, which the organization says could mean the closure of 200 clinics across the country.
Funding under Title X “family planning” grants could be slashed as well, which would also impact reproductive health clinics.
Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the measure a “big bad betrayal of a bill” in a Tuesday news call, and said the funding cuts in the bill “would make it harder, if not impossible, for everyone, everywhere to get an abortion.”
Since the 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization moved the issue of abortion legality to the states, Ohio has passed a constitutional amendment that in 2023 placed the right to abortion into the state’s founding document, making abortion legal up to viability, as determined by a physician. The measure passed with 57% of voters that November.
But the newest state operating budget, which could be approved by the General Assembly this week, could cause more limits to abortion services via a provision related to Medicaid.
The House and Senate both brought along a measure from Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget that would eliminate the Medicaid expansion group from the state’s program if the federal budget contributes less than the 90% it’s paying currently.
Should that contribution drop even 1%, the state budget states the expansion group, which policy experts say accounts for about 770,000 Ohioans, would be dropped from their health insurance.

That would represent 30% to 50% of patients who go to Cincinnati-area Planned Parenthood clinics just to obtain birth control, according to Nan Whaley, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region.
For other services, like health screenings, primary care services, specialist referrals, and abortion services, Whaley said patients who lose their Medicaid coverage likely “will go nowhere.”
“It’ll make Ohio less healthy, it’ll make abortions go up in Ohio,” Whaley said. “What’ll happen is the opposite of what (legislative and congressional Republicans) claim to want.”
While clinics will still be able to provide services to those with commercial insurance, the idea that the most vulnerable Ohioans will be without health care strikes advocates even more than threats to their existence that they’ve experienced many times before.
“There aren’t enough words for ‘unacceptable,’ and every Ohio congressperson should be voting ‘no’ and should be fighting for their constituents,” said Lauren Blauvelt, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio. “There’s no cost-savings in taking away people’s insurance.”
For Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health clinics, being the target of potential funding cuts and disapproval by elected officials who oppose abortion rights is nothing new.
“All providers and most non-profits are under attack in a way that they’re not use to in this environment, but we’re used to this,” Blauvelt said.
Clinics are working to continue providing as much care as they can, including providing and hoping to expand virtual health care.
Lexi Dotson-Dufault, executive director of the referral and resource service Abortion Fund Ohio, said her team is beginning to work with telehealth providers, in an effort to expand services and in anticipation of clinic closures, but more importantly so pregnant individuals can get questions answered.
“People are still confused about what care they can access in Ohio, where they can get that care, who’s there to help them access that care,” Dotson-Dufault said.
Once the budgetary decisions have been made, abortion rights advocates are also preparing for another fight: the total abortion ban bill that was recently introduced in the Ohio House.
While Dotson-Dufault, Whaley, and Blauvelt emphasized the unconstitutionality of the bill, which would seek to undermine the reproductive rights amendment, they aren’t taking it lightly.
Blauvelt said she remembers when the six-week abortion ban didn’t have the full support of the legislature or pro-life advocates, but then ended up being signed into law before it was struck down in court.
“Our supporters are not backing down, we are focused and we take this threat seriously,” Blauvelt said. “We expect our lawmakers to do better.”

Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, has a major part to play in supporting Medicaid recipients and rural hospitals in his home state, writes Clay Wirestone. He just has to raise his voice. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)It’s all come down to this.
The U.S. Senate will vote soon on a gargantuan tax and spending package that will rip health care coverage from thousands of Kansans and put our rural hospitals at grave risk of closure.
The numbers boggle the mind. Kansas will lose $4 billion in Medicaid funding, money that goes to cover low-income families. Some 13,000 residents will lose their coverage under the program as lawmakers try to secure massive tax cuts for the wealthiest among us.
So now’s the time for U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, that Kansas Republican stalwart, to step up and say publicly what he’s apparently been saying privately. Moran needs to come to Kansas now — today, if he can manage it — and hold a town hall meeting. Anywhere will do, although a centrally located city such as Topeka would allow more people to attend. He needs to invite every reporter from the Midwest. And he needs to make clear, for all to hear, that he supports poor Kansans and vital health care services.
Don’t do it someday, senator. Don’t assume your behind-the-scenes murmurs will make a difference.
Stand up and make some noise. Now.
I wouldn’t be asking Moran to do this if it didn’t seem like, at some level, he wanted to. I wrote on Monday about reports from Politico and The Hill that he had “raised concerns” and “drawn public red lines” with other senators concerned about cuts. I’m counting out U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, our other Republican in D.C. He’s been telling would-be doctors that they should toughen up and work their way through medical school without loans.

But there’s more. At a Senate gathering Monday, according to Punchbowl News, “Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who has stayed relatively quiet in public, also spoke up during the meeting, saying the provider tax language is bad for his state.”
He even gave a quote to the The Hill on Monday, saying, “I still have concerns about a few provisions in the bill. I’m not satisfied yet.”
Anyone with a modest sense of current-day politics understands why Moran has laid low. There’s little benefit these days to speaking out loudly when it comes to President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” The administration prefers private, closed-door negotiations. Trump and his staff have made clear their disdain for outspoken voices such as Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican. Voting with the president most of the time doesn’t count. Public fealty counts more.
Nevertheless, Moran has earned political capital over his decade-plus as a senator, romping to a third term victory in 2022. He has refrained from social media fireworks and other grandstanding. He’s widely respected across Kansas and has made a point of charting a sensible course.
He has little to lose by speaking to Kansans. Sure, I understand why he may have avoided February’s virtual town hall, held during the height of Elon Musk’s reign of terror at the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has vacated the premises, though, and I think that Kansans of every political stripe would welcome Moran’s voice.
Kansans depend on Medicaid. They depend on rural hospitals. Moran understands this and, from all appearances, has been fighting for both.
He should actually articulate those principles now, publicly and unashamedly.
He might be surprised by the support he gets.

When I held a knife for the first time, I squeezed the handle so hard that my knuckles turned white. I blinked an even number of times, and kept my fingers far away from where the sharp edge was, like it’d reach out and cut me. 
This feeling spread to other areas of my life. On tests, I had to bubble in answer sheets perfectly. When I rode the bus, I held onto the screws by the window because I believed that it would help if we ever crashed. 
During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I received a diagnosis for generalized anxiety disorder. I told a therapist about the discomfort that I felt doing everyday tasks, and they recommended weekly sessions until the feelings stopped.
However, they never did. The cost of these visits kept increasing, and eventually, my family and I realized that maybe therapy wasn’t the right choice.
But I kept obsessing over even numbers, erasing and re-filling answer sheets until they were just right, and fearing everything from knives to hospitals to driving. This was just how I lived my life, and I worried if nothing could ever change that.
Recently, I finished my first year at Ohio State University. I met incredible people, embraced new experiences, and broadened my knowledge of computer science.
Although, throughout this year of positive change, those same feelings continued to grow. I wasn’t sleeping well, and I was overwhelmed by the same bizarre, scary thoughts that had put my life on hold.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
So, like 35% of college students in the United States, I logged into my university’s counseling website and scheduled an appointment with a professional.
Soon, I was back on campus, and in my current therapist’s office. After a few sessions, she asked me if I knew what obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was. Then, she explained that this disorder accurately described the symptoms I’d been experiencing. She said that I wasn’t alone, that it was treatable, and that it no longer had to define who I was.
These counseling services are not burdens on our state’s $61 billion dollar operating budget. 
In fact, in a study published by the Healthy Minds Network, 77% of students surveyed reported that emotional and mental difficulties impaired their academic ability, yet only 45% of students sought counseling or therapy within the past 12 months. This is not without reason.
College students face significant barriers to receiving mental health care. In a report published by the Journal of College Student Mental Health, 89% of student participants noted that cost was the most significant barrier to receiving treatment.
To remedy these issues, Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed a $20 million dollar line item for college mental health services in Ohio’s state budget. For comparison, the current state budget allocates 600 million dollars for a new Cleveland Browns stadium.
Despite this line item being presented by a Republican governor, regarding an issue which has large bipartisan support, Republican members of the Ohio House decided to strike it from the budget.
Currently, I receive treatment for my OCD from Ohio State’s Counseling and Consultation Services, working towards a state of normalcy that I likely never would have achieved otherwise. However, my story is certainly not unique. If these cuts to college mental health care continue, many more students may not be able to say the same.

As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

Larry Hogan and former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock disagreed at times Tuesday, but they weren't disagreeable -- the two were engaged in the sort of civil discourse that they say America needs more of, and less partisan sniping.","Former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D), left, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) share a laugh at a Tuesday forum on the need for more civil debate and bipartisanship in politics. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan disagreed pretty sharply Tuesday with former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock over the use of force to respond to violent protests and the legality of the U.S. military raid Saturday on Iran.
But their disagreement during a forum in Washington, D.C., was civil, polite even. There were no raised voices, no made-for-social-media putdowns. Just the sort of agreeable disagreement that both men said America needs more of.
“You can’t get anything done unless you’re willing to listen to the other side,” Hogan said at the Pew Charitable Trusts offices in downtown Washington. “When the partisan shouting stops is when you actually start to listen…. People these days seem to be more interested in winning an argument than solving a problem.”
Hogan, the former Republican governor in a blue state, and Bullock, a former Democratic governor in a red state, were the featured speakers at a session on “How States Are Navigating an Era of Uncertainty,” hosted by The Pew Charitable Trusts and States Newsroom. (Maryland Matters is part of the States Newsroom network.)
Both said that during their time as governor, they learned the importance of elected officials from differing parties working together to find common ground on policy solutions, even though it was rarely easy.
  Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R). (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“It wasn’t all ‘Kumbaya,’” Hogan said of his time working with the Democratic legislature. “We didn’t always agree. But we disagreed without demonizing the other side, and we tried to find common sense, bipartisan solutions to every problem.”
That formula didn’t always work out for them. Hogan flirted with a presidential bid in 202o, but decided against it after polls showed overwhelming GOP support for President Donald Trump in Maryland; Bullock got in the race that year, but was never able to make a dent in a crowded Democratic field and dropped out early.
Both ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate seats after their terms as governor ended. Bullock won about 45% of the vote in a 2020 challenge to Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who took 55%. And just last year, Hogan lost his bid for an open Senate to Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md), earning 43% of the vote to her 53%.
Despite their mixed success rate, both men said Tuesday they firmly believe that bipartisan efforts are best for the United States. Bullock said he hopes that it’s “not a bygone era” of politics.
“I’d say the best advice is to not pay too much attention to all the noise and to try to actually sit down and focus,” Bullock said. “If it’s just both sides yelling at each other, we’re never going to get anything done on every single issue. And that tends to happen. The more heated the rhetoric is, the less productive it is.”
Virginia Mercury Editor-in-Chief Samantha Willis moderated the discussion between the two former governors. (The Virginia Mercury is also a part of States Newsroom.) While the two former governors generally agreed and backed each other up, their ability to politely disagree was on display when Willis asked about the recent American bombing strikes in Iran.
Over the weekend, Trump ordered bombing raids on three nuclear facilities in Iran in an attempt, after almost two weeks of raids by Israel, to destroy the Iranians ability to develop nuclear weapons. Trump ordered the raids without seeking permission from Congress, which has to approve any act of war, leading to criticism over the propriety of the attack.

Hogan, for years a vocal critic of Trump, said he hopes the attack is a step toward peace in the Middle East and said he agreed with Trump’s decision to try to kneecap Iran’s nuclear efforts.
“The law says you have to notify Congress, which they did,” Hogan said. “You can’t have a debate with 535 people on when you’re stopping the biggest exporter of terrorism from getting a nuclear weapon … the commander in chief is empowered to make decisions like that.”
Bullock questioned how much notice Congress actually received before the attack, but agreed that Iran “getting nuclear capabilities would be very, very problematic.” He said the greater concern is the “erosion” of norms at the federal level.
“Congress deserves a heads up,” Bullock said.
Willis also asked about the rise in political violence, referencing the assassination attempt on Trump during his 2024 campaign as well as the recent killing of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and attack on Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman in politically motivated attacks. She asked how the two would respond to the situation if they were governor.
Hogan said that it’s up to state leaders and the federal government to “tone down the rhetoric.”
“America is deeply divided, and there’s angry, violent people on both sides … continuing to use inflammatory partisan rhetoric makes the problem much worse,” he said. “It’s really what I’ve been talking about for 10 years – nobody was listening, apparently.”
Bullock pushed back on Hogan, saying that there’s a difference between “political violence and reacting to political violence.”
  Former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D). (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“When you have an incident like what happened in Minnesota, every single statewide officeholder and governor and legislator — irrespective of the political party – ought to be standing up and saying, ‘That’s not right,’” Bullock said. “We may disagree, but we don’t countenance or accept political violence.”
They were more in tune when it came to the broad and “indiscriminate” cuts outlined in the Budget Reconciliation legislation currently in the hands of the U.S. Senate, often called the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by Trump.
Hogan said that while he agrees with efforts to cut down on what he called “inflated” federal spending, those sorts of cuts need careful and precise consideration, rather than taking a “meat ax” to the budget reconciliation bill.
They also agreed that the mass layoffs at federal agencies are costing thousands of Americans their jobs, including Marylanders and Montanans. Hogan urged governors to prepare for the needs of constituents as a result of those layoffs.
“Every time you lay somebody off, it’s not just the shrinking of the federal government, it’s real people,” he said. “We need to think about what kinds of benefits they’re going to see, how do we do workforce development and job retraining and reskilling?”
Hogan is often mentioned as a possible candidate for his old job when the governor’s seat comes up again in 2026, but when asked by reporters after the panel, he would only say he is “enjoying retirement” right now — and spending time promoting bipartisan politics.

Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland State Board of Education unanimously accepted final recommendations of a 58-member Blueprint special education work group Tuesday aimed at ensuring students with disabilities aren’t forgotten in the state’s multibillion-dollar education reform plan.
The group met for nearly two years to produce 27 recommendations in the report that are connected to the five pillars in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future: early childhood education, teacher diversity and retention, college and career readiness, more resources for student success, and governance and accountability.
When local school officials submitted their first Blueprint implementation plans in March 2023, every one said help was needed to recruit and retain teachers in all levels of special education. That need remains, the report said.
The board did not set a timeline for adopting the recommendations, but Liz Zogby said one that could be implemented in the coming school year is to provide special education training for general education teachers.
“It is really heartening that we have walked this dream for the last two years to get this done,” said Zogby, who co-chairs the work group with State Superintendent Carey Wright. “You can’t have change without getting leadership that truly believes in the vision and going to stand up for it.”
Zogby, who’s also co-chair of the Maryland Down Syndrome Advocacy Coalition, was praised by Wright, board President Joshua Michael and others as one of the main advocates for integrating special education in the 10-year Blueprint reform plan.
Board member Joan Mele-McCarthy, whose term expires after this week, suggested an analysis of the recommendations to see which could be implemented first and which would have the most impact.

“Because you have a lot of recommendations, I worry that in your effort to implement all of them, none get achieved or accomplished,” said Mele-McCarthy, executive director of The Summit School in Anne Arundel County.
“As I leave the board, I encourage my colleagues to keep talking about special education, the needs of children who have special needs and to really look at their achievement,” she said. “Unless we really pay attention to that and help children learn and achieve, we will not see the success that we would like.”
The recommendations include:

Strengthening partnerships between families, local school officials and state and community organizations;
Providing constant professional development for teachers and related service providers to teach students with disabilities; and
Proposing legislation for the 2026 General Assembly session to commission an “adequacy study” of Maryland’s special education funding.

Mele-Carthy, Zogby and Antoine Hickman, assistant state superintendent with the division of special education, noted that this year is the 50th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which was signed into law in November 1975 by then-President Gerald Ford.
Zogby said the state has about 106,000 students with disabilities, about 13% of the total student population.
“Dr. Michael talked about that inclusion isn’t a strategy. It’s a value. Completely agree,” Zogby said. “We can’t live that value without the presence of students in our classrooms.”
Library updates
The state board also approved amendments to bring state regulations library media services in line with the Freedom to Read Act approved by the legislature last year. The act, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) and Del. Dana Jones (D-Anne Arundel), reflected a national conversation about what books and materials should be publicly available in schools and libraries.
Maryland became one of the first states in the nation to enact strong protections for access to information in libraries, as well as penalties for those who attempt to thwart access.
Moms for Liberty, a conservative parental-rights group with about 300 chapters nationwide, has been one of the leaders pushing for stricter rules for school systems to select library books. Maryland has nearly a dozen local chapters including Carroll County, which successfully sought to remove dozens of books last year from school libraries.

The state law requires local school officials to manage library programs and not exclude or remove materials “because of partisan, ideological, or religious disapproval.” The law also says a local school board “may not dismiss, demote, suspend, discipline, reassign, transfer, or otherwise retaliate against a librarian, certified library media specialist, or school library media program support staff for performing their job duties.”
All local school systems must create a committee to review any books and other materials in school libraries that are challenged for removal. Beginning Oct. 1, local school systems will be required to have school library media program implementation documents that will berare reviewed and then approved by local school boards every two years.
The state Education  Department will implement a procedure to conduct periodic reviews of local school system library media programs to help identify any professional development needs for school staff.
Part of the updated regulations will require a certified school library media specialist in each school. Some schools do that now, but others may have one person who rotates between five and 10 schools, said Elise Brown, assistant state superintendent of instructional programs.
Michael asked how much flexibility local school systems — also called local education agencies, or LEAs — have when it comes to library personnel.
“The LEA has a lot of flexibility,” Brown said. “It really is determined by how they interpret [state regulations].”
Michael had a message for some local school officials and the public when it comes to “local control.”
“While we have a tradition of local control, what is on the books is a state public education, and so it is essential that our local schools maintain that trust and uphold the standards,” he said. “Should those standards not be upheld that we set, the tradition of local control will be challenged.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Antoine-Hickman-and-Liz-Zogby-6-24-2025-1024x806.jpg,,,2025-06-25 03:02:52.285947

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Maryland joined two more legal challenges to the Trump administration Tuesday, one to defend a specific minority business program and another to challenge a sweeping legal maneuver the White House has used to terminate billions in federal funding.
The legal actions, like many against the administration, were filed by Democratic attorneys general and governors from 20 or more states and the District of Columbia. They are the latest of about two dozen such suits that Maryland has joined since President Donald Trump took office.
The states filed a friend of the court brief in a federal case in Kentucky that Maryland Attorney General Brown called a “backdoor attempt to dismantle” the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program in federal contracting.
The lawsuit targets the Office of Management and Budget and a dozen other federal departments and agencies for what it calls their unlawful use of “a single subclause buried in federal regulations” to cut “billions of dollars of federal funding” to the states.
That subclause says a congressionally approved grant can be canceled for a handful of reasons, including if the grant “no longer effectuates … agency priorities.” OMB originally interpreted that to apply when new evidence showed that a grant was ineffective or not feasible. It was not to “terminate grants arbitrarily.”
But that’s what OMB has done since Trump took office, says the suit that was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. OMB now claims that that five-word clause “permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind.”
Electric shock: Maryland has not joined suit against Trump over EV sales rules

Under that interpretation of the regulation, Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency directed federal agencies, including all of those listed in the lawsuit, to cut billions in grants that were already awarded in what the lawsuit described as a “slash-and-burn campaign.”
In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Brown’s office said that in Maryland these cuts have targeted funding for STEM research, food purchasing programs that support underserved communities and modernization of the state’s unemployment insurance systems.
The lawsuit is asking the court to rule that the OMB clause doesn’t “independently authorize the Trump administration to terminate funding based on agency priorities that were identified after the grant was awarded.”
Alternatively, the lawsuit seeks to overturn the Trump administration’s decision to terminate billions of dollars in federal funding “based on purported changes in agency priorities.”
“The Trump administration cannot unilaterally cut federal funding that Congress has already approved simply to serve its political agenda,” Brown said in a statement Tuesday. “We will not stand by while Maryland families lose access to healthy, affordable food or our universities are stripped of critical research funding.”
The challenge to the Department of Transportation’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program stems from a lawsuit filed by two highway contractors in 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. They argued that the program violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause by mandating a certain amount of funds be reserved for woman- or minority-owned businesses.
The program, founded in 1983, aims to ensure nondiscrimination in the awarding of contracts and has steered billions in federal transportation and infrastructure contracts to minority- and woman-owned businesses. Disadvantaged Business Enterprises include firms that are classified as a small business, majority owned by women, minorities or other socially and economically disadvantaged adults, and are run day-to-day by women or minorities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The federal government, under former President Joe Biden, initially opposed the lawsuit. But after President Donald Trump was returned to office in January, the government switched its position and now sides with the highway contractors, according to the brief. The administration asked the court to issue a consent order which “could restrict or eliminate” the program across the country, according to a statement on Tuesday from Brown’s office.
The brief argues that if the court were to grant the order requested by the federal government and the two highway contractors, it would be exceeding “the proper role of the court in our adversarial system of government, because the parties requesting the order take the same position on the issues.”
“This so-called settlement is a backdoor attempt to dismantle a program that helps underrepresented businesses compete for federally funded transportation projects,” Brown said in a separate statement Tuesday. “We’re fighting to protect fair access, strengthen our infrastructure, and ensure these investments benefit all of our communities.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/russvought2025-scaled-1-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-25 03:02:52.285947

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Sign up for the 19th daily newsletter.
In an upset, Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani will be the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, defeating candidates including Andrew Cuomo, who was seeking a political comeback nearly four years after he resigned as governor of New York amid sexual misconduct allegations.
Cuomo conceded the race Tuesday night, before the final results of ranked-choice voting were clear.
“Tonight was not our night,” Cuomo told a crowd of supporters. “Tonight was Assemblyman Mamdani’s night. He put together a great campaign, and he touched young people and inspired them and got them to come out and vote. And he really ran a highly impactful campaign. I called him, I congratulated him, I applaud him sincerely for his effort.”
Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described Democratic socialist, ran a campaign centered on making New York City more affordable. He proposed offering free universal child care, creating city-run grocery stores, rolling out free bus service and freezing rents on rent-stabilized units.
One year ago, Republican primary voters renominated President Donald Trump, who was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll between his first term and his return to office in January. Trump’s reelection was seen as marking a political and cultural backlash to the #MeToo movement.
But in New York, Democratic voters rejected a former governor who left office following a bombshell 165-page report overseen by the New York attorney general’s office that found he had sexually harassed 11 women, including some state employees.
Those findings were echoed by similar investigations conducted by the Department of Justice and the New York State Assembly. At the time, Cuomo apologized while denying the most serious allegations against him. In the years since, Cuomo and his allies have cast doubt on his accusers’ credibility and painted him as the victim of politically motivated investigations.
While New York City is overwhelmingly Democratic, Mamdani isn’t guaranteed a victory in the general election in November. Mayor Eric Adams, the embattled incumbent, is running as an independent. Cuomo also has indicated he could run as an independent on a “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. Unlike the primary, the general election won’t be held with ranked-choice voting, under which voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidates reach a majority on the first round of ranked-choice voting, votes are redistributed until a candidate gets to above 50 percent.
If elected, Mamdani would be the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor.
Cuomo came into the race leading with name recognition and with allies pouring millions of dollars into an allied super PAC. Mamdani, by contrast, built up an energized and passionate grassroots of volunteers. In a crowded field, ranked-choice voting also lent itself to coalition building — Mamdani cross-endorsed fellow progressives Michael Blake and Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller.
Issues like public safety and affordability, and not Cuomo’s scandals, took center stage in the mayoral campaign. But Mamdani still hammered Cuomo on his record in response to Cuomo criticizing him as inexperienced.
“Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace,” Mamdani said in a June 12 mayoral debate. “I have never cut Medicaid. I have never stolen millions of dollars from the MTA. I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done those things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2221884032.jpg,,,2025-06-25 01:00:00.017998

Lavine,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/25/as-hate-crimes-increase-this-ct-agency-steps-up/,It is an unfortunate reality that the number of hate crimes in the nation and in CT have been steadily rising in recent years.,"It is an unfortunate reality that the number of hate crimes in the nation and in our state have been steadily rising in recent years.
 Statistics gathered by the F.B.I indicate that there were 6,121 reported hate crimes in 2016; 8,263 in 2020, and 11,862 in 2023.  Some 5,900 of the incidents in the 2023 report were anti-Black, three times higher than the next highest racial or ethnic category. Religion-based incidents in the 2023 report totaled 2,699, more than half driven by anti-Jewish bias; incidents involving anti-Muslim bias also rose. 


The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports that the number of hate incidents reported in Connecticut jumped from 91 in 2020 to 682 in 2024 —an increase of 650 percent.  Antisemitic incidents in Connecticut, according to the ADL, spiked from 24 in 2020 to 184, dropping slightly to 159 in 2024. Connecticut hate crime statistics compiled by the state police also show an upward trend. In 2021, there were 75 hate crime incidents; in 2024 there were 103. Hate crimes in Connecticut went from 87 in 2021 to 130 in 2024.
The numbers can numb us to what has been happening. Each crime, and incident, represents a traumatic event that can live with the victim for a lifetime. And when an individual is targeted because of who he or she is, damage is done to that individual’s entire community. As ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt put it: “Hate crimes deserve priority because of their special impact. They not only hurt one victim, but they also intimidate and isolate a victim’s whole community and weaken the bonds of our society.”
Concerned about what was happening, the Connecticut legislature passed a law creating the Hate Crimes Advisory Council (HCAC). Pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes Section 51-279f, the council is responsible for encouraging and coordinating programs that increase community awareness and reporting of hate crimes. It also is charged with making recommendations for legislation concerning hate crimes, including recommendations on restitution for victims, and alternative sentencing programs for juveniles and first-time offenders. 
The committee members, appointed by the governor, represent a diverse group of people from the private sector, police authorities, and state government. Consistent with its charge, the HCAC has been busily engaged in a wide variety of initiatives. Here are some of the most significant.
Website: A website has been created through the efforts of Amy Lin Meyerson, co-chair of the HCAC. It contains information about the HCAC and its activities, including membership, meeting dates meeting agendas, meeting minutes, hate crimes laws, and other information. Improvements to the website are now being studied.
Regular meetings: Meetings of the HCAC are held every other month. They typically involve discussions of what is being done by the HCAC’s many subcommittees, what initiatives are being undertaken, and invited speakers who are experts in the hate crimes area, or who represent various of the communities affected by hate crimes.
The communities include but are not limited to the Black, Jewish, trans, Asian, handicapped and Sikh communities. Hybrid meetings, held in person at the Office of the Chief States Attorney, 300 Corporate Place, Rocky Hill, are open to the public.
Investigative form: Ensuring that law enforcement is equipped to effectively investigate hate crimes has been a top priority. In collaboration with the Police Officer Standards and Training Council (POSTC), the council developed a model policy guiding officers on how to identify, investigate and rapidly report hate crimes and bias-related incidents. Police departments across the state have adopted and implemented this policy.
Third party reporting portal: It is an article of faith that hate crimes are radically underreported for a number of reasons, including the reluctance of victims to contact police authorities due to distrust or concern about immigration status. 
While we encourage individuals to report hate incidents to local law enforcement, we concluded that an alternative public reporting tool would encourage people who prefer not to deal with police authorities to report their victimization. Working with community stakeholders an online portal is being created to permit victims to report hate crimes and hate incidents without contacting police authorities. 
Cooperation with state and federal authorities. The HCAC has worked with federal and state law enforcement authorities to coordinate efforts. Police authorities have supported the council’s efforts from the start. 
In particular, the HCAC has worked closely with the office of the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP). Ronnell Higgins, who has aggressively supported increased investigation of and prosecution for hate crimes. Specifically, the State Police created a Hate Crimes Investigative Unit in July 2022, which is dedicated to staying on top of trends, sharing information with other police authorities, and organizing awareness events throughout the state at which unit speakers explain hate laws to attendees and discuss hate crimes enforcement in all its aspects. 
The Office of the Chief States Attorney, Patrick J. Griffin, has actively worked with the HCAC to study possible improvements in our laws and develop more effective law enforcement strategies for investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. States Attorney Griffin has actively supported the work of the council, assisted in proposing legislation, and made fighting hate crimes a priority of the state’s attorneys around the state.
Outreach: The HCAC has joined state and federal authorities, including the Investigative Unit and F.B.I., in reaching out to mosques, synagogues, churches, and local communities to create working relationships and inform town residents about what state and federal authorities are doing to fight hate crimes. It has sought to urge residents to report hate crimes or hateful activities—such as leafletting by white supremacist or neo-Nazi actors– if they occur. Public meetings, often organized by the state police, are being held all throughout the state to inform citizens about efforts being made to fight hate crimes.
Filing of annual reports: Annual reports, found on the website, are filed to outline what has been accomplished in the previous year.
Public awareness advertisement: A 30-second public awareness spot has been created informing the public what they can do if they have been victimized by a hate crime and informing the public about the existence of the online portal.  The spot should be shown on various sites in a matter of weeks. Some final issues need to be evaluated before the advertisement can be released. 
Legislative efforts and proposals: The HCAC’s charge includes recommending possible changes in the law relating to hate crimes. The HCAC has spent a great deal of time considering whether to ask the legislature to consider adopting various legislative changes including consolidating and amending the present patchwork of hate crimes laws and permitting members of a victim’s community to make a victim impact statement about the effect of a hate crime on the community of which a victim is a part.
Hate crimes and hateful incidents not only harm individuals but also spread fear through the community of which a victim is a part and corrode our civic sensibilities. They also tear at the social fabric of our multi-ethnic democracy which, for all its challenges, is still a miraculous achievement. 
We invite everyone concerned with this issue to attend meetings of the HCAC and go to local events presented by law enforcement.
After all, we are all in this together.

This One Big Beautiful Bill Act was introduced in Congress on May 20 and passed by the Republican controlled Congress on May 22 – two days later. All attempts to debate content within the bill by non-Republican members of Congress were ignored. If the U.S. Senate votes to pass this bill, it will become law. The Trump White House is urging the Senate to pass this bill ASAP.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a 1,037 page document, riddled with oblique references to established law that would be up-ended if the bill passes in the Senate. There are, as the New York Times writes, “Hidden Ways Trump’s Megabill Would Remake America” for everyone. 
Would there be winners and losers? Of course – there would be winners and losers. You have already heard about major changes to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and the detrimental effect these changes would have on millions of people. But, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act changes everything – and I mean everything. Everything about American life would be affected: agriculture, the armed services, energy, commerce, financial services, homeland security, border security, customs – and the judiciary. 
The judiciary? Yes, the judiciary.
As the recent article points out, “An under the radar provision of the bill would brazenly undermine the power of federal courts.” Holding parties in contempt of court gives our federal court system remedy for blatantly ignored court rulings. What potential criminal would not want to eliminate that remedy? The new “system” would weaken the very justice system that has enabled the nation to survive.
Let’s be clear, the “power of U.S. Courts to hold parties in contempt of court has deep roots in English common law and has evolved significantly throughout U.S. history. The power to punish contempt was established by the late 18th century.” Then, “Following the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, Congress established the lower federal courts and explicitly granted them the power to punish contempt of their authority through the Judiciary Act of 1789.”
President Trump and Trump’s Congress are intending to up-end well over 200 centuries of English precedent and American civil law? Rather bold, I would say, not to mention unwise.
Perusing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, I came across Section 530A, regarding Trump Accounts. Trump Accounts? What are Trump Accounts and who would these benefit? The section reads, “A Trump account means a trust created or organized in the U.S. for exclusive benefit of an individual” and then goes on to state that Trump accounts “shall not be includable in the gross income of the distributor,” meaning the individual. What is that about? Would certain individuals be exempt from taxation, using a financial Trump Trust? I think people should understand a little more about this before the Senate passes this bill.
With such rapid passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by the 119th Congress, who, including congressional representatives, could evaluate this bill effectively? It is too much, too fast. It is everything all at once. And, it is not “beautiful.”
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If President Trump sees this bill as “beautiful,” I think there are a lot of other people who think is very ugly.

Matt Woods, R-Jasper, won election to Senate District 5 Tuesday night.
As of 9:16 p.m. Tuesday, Woods had 7,707 votes (86%) in unofficial returns for the north central Alabama Senate district, which includes Lamar, Fayette, Walker, the northern half of Tuscaloosa County, and the western part of Jefferson County. Democratic nominee Ryan Cagle, a progressive faith leader and community organizer and the first Democrat to run for the office since 2010, conceded around 9 p.m. At 9:16 p.m., he had 1,238 votes (13.1%).
A message seeking comment was left with Woods Tuesday night. Cagle in his concession statement congratulated Woods and said his “heart remains full and the fight continues.”
“We were outnumbered and out funded in every way, but we made incredible strides this campaign. In the face of insurmountable odds we have planted seeds that I know are going to continue to grow and blossom,” he said in the statement.

In a previous interview, Woods said he wants to continue and build on the district’s conservative leadership and bring his experience in the House, where he focused on education policy, to the Senate. Cagle offered a different vision and campaigned on bringing change to the district, saying he believes that established politicians have long ignored it and are not attentive to and aware of the region’s needs.
The seat was previous held by former Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Reed, R-Jasper, who resigned the seat at the start of the year to join Gov. Kay Ivey’s administration as Senior Advisor to Workforce Transformation. As Senate leader, Reed was a strong ally of business interests, expanding tax incentives and workforce training.
The seat is strongly Republican. Reed first won the seat in 2010 as a first-time candidate with 73.3% of the votes. Reed subsequently ran unopposed in the Republican primaries and was not challenged by a Democratic candidate in 2014, 2018 and 2022, according to Ballotpedia.
David Boyett, probate judge in Lamar County, described the turnout as “very low” and “not a normal turnout by no means,” but that significantly more people showed up to vote compared to the Democratic primary held in March, where the county recorded 38 votes.
“We’ve been out and visited the majority of the precincts all day today, and I’m looking at a very low turnout. I’m seeing somewhere around 400 total votes cast so far,” Boyette said Tuesday afternoon.
Woods also said he was seeing a low turnout earlier in the day, but that he expected more people to show up in the evening.
“We think there will be an uptick when people get off work,” he said in a text message.
Cagle, when asked what kind of turnout he was seeing, said in a text message Tuesday afternoon, “honestly I don’t know because I’m at work! #workingclassproblems.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Matt-Woods-1024x683.png,,,2025-06-24 23:02:16.969700

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington lawmakers and the governor Tuesday got the grim state revenue news they’ve been expecting.
Estimates show tax collections for the two-year operating budget that begins July 1 will be hundreds of millions of dollars less than what they assumed when they passed the budget that Gov. Bob Ferguson signed last month.
Revenues are lagging as consumers grow cautious and businesses retrench in response to the Trump Administration’s shifting approach on tariffs and trade. Many people are also tightening their spending while Congress ponders cuts to federal programs like Medicaid and food stamps.
The decline in receipts will force the state to draw down savings, but Ferguson isn’t summoning the Legislature into a special session to respond.
At least not yet.
“While this revenue forecast is disappointing, it is not surprising. At this time, I do not anticipate calling a special session,” Ferguson said in a statement. “We are closely monitoring developments from the federal government that could force me to revisit that question. We will also carefully review the next revenue forecast in September.”
Democratic and Republican budget writers shared the not-quite-yet assessment after Washington’s chief economist, Dave Reich, delivered the quarterly estimates to the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council.
“Certainly, I think we don’t have to come back for a special session,” said Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, the lead budget writer in the Senate. “I don’t see any reason today that the governor would ask us to do that, but that is his prerogative, not ours.”
Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, the Republican on the House Finance Committee, pointed out that lawmakers will begin their next scheduled session only about six months into the next biennium. 
“When we come back in January, we would have time to make some adjustments in the budget to make sure that we do not end up going negative by the end of the biennium,” he said. 
It will be a different story if the downward trend in collections is repeated in the September and November forecasts, he said.
By the numbers
Tuesday’s sobering update follows a tense legislative session in which the Legislature’s Democratic majority and the first-term Democrat governor overrode Republican opposition to approve spending reductions and tax increases to counter a shortfall Ferguson pegged at $16 billion.
That final budget calls for $77.8 billion in spending across government, including public schools and colleges, health care, social services, housing, corrections, and environmental protection. 
It paid the tab with $71 billion in tax collections plus more than a billion in cash reserves and roughly $4.3 billion from new and higher taxes that will begin to kick in later this year. The state will end the fiscal cycle with $80 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund.
Tuesday’s forecast puts a kink in the equation.
Setting aside the anticipated boost from the new taxes, it shows the state will haul in $490 million less in the 2025-27 budget, and revenues will drop another $638 million in the 2027-29 cycle. However, the net decline is pegged at $720 million because revenues for the current budget will be $407 million higher than forecast in March.
When all the adding and subtracting is done, the state’s general fund will be operating with razor-thin savings. 
“We believe the budget can weather the negative economic impacts we see in this forecast driven by federal action,” state Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the lead Republican budget writer for House Republicans, said the majority party’s overspending, not federal policies, are to blame for the situation.
“This crisis was made in Olympia, not Washington, D.C.,” he said. “Slower growth in sales tax and real estate tax should have been a flashing red light. Instead, Democrats plowed ahead with the largest budget in state history, no cushion, no discipline, and no plan. They spent us into a deficit before the ink even dried.”
Ferguson has already directed state agencies to look for more cuts in their budgets.
“This will not be easy. We already made many difficult decisions last session,” he said. “Washingtonians expect us as leaders to make the tough decisions to live within our means and still deliver core services.”
Bracing for federal fallout

Meanwhile, the governor met with six other statewide elected officials Tuesday morning to discuss how best to respond if the Trump administration and Congress stanch the flow of federal funds to the state.
Since taking office, the administration has delayed, frozen, canceled, or threatened to block numerous grants, in some instances triggering legal action by Washington and other states.
And the Republican-controlled Congress is considering proposed budget legislation that would sharply reduce federal funds for Medicaid, food assistance and other significant programs.
“We explored strategies for how to best protect core services for Washington communities reliant on federal funding without giving in to the Trump Administration’s attacks,” Ferguson said in a statement after the meeting.

(Capital-Star file)The state Senate has passed a bill that would eliminate out-of-pocket costs for follow-up breast imaging after a mammogram detects an abnormality.
Under current state law, insurance companies must fully cover mammograms for those over the age of 40 – in some cases, younger with a doctor’s recommendation. They also have to provide no-cost coverage of follow-up MRI’s and ultrasounds for those at high risk for breast cancer.
Listen to Emily’s audio recap here:

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24epBCFOLOweb.mp3
 
Senate Bill 88 would expand that to mandate no-cost coverage for patients regardless of risk, if a previous screening detected an abnormality or their doctor recommends it. 
Sponsor Sen. Frank Farry (R-Bucks) said his wife has battled breast cancer during the past 18 months.
“Some initial diagnostic screenings are inconclusive. They show something, but it’s not a clear diagnosis. And, unfortunately, [patients] may have to pay for further diagnostic testing to find out if they have breast cancer,” Farry said. “I know the challenges our family has faced. And we are very blessed to have good health insurance and access to wonderful health care providers in southeastern Pennsylvania. But not every Pennsylvanian can say that.”
Co-sponsors include Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Berks/Montgomery), whose 21-year-old daughter and half a dozen other relatives have been diagnosed with breast cancer. 
Another is state Sen. Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), herself a breast cancer survivor.
“I see every day, young women who don’t really even qualify for any kind of breast cancer screening, they have breast cancer,” Ward said. “And if they hadn’t pushed forward on their own, maybe paid for some of that care, we’d never know that they had breast cancer until it’s way too late.”
Ward has been a leader in expanding breast cancer prevention coverage in the commonwealth. 
Out-of-pocket costs for follow-up imaging often exceed $1,000, according to Pat Halpin-Murphy, president and founder of Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Coalition. 
Halpin-Murphy said she’s seen bills far beyond that, including a recent one for more than $4,700.
About 20 percent of patients say they would skip breast cancer screenings and follow-up exams if they had to pay a deductible, according to a study published in Radiology in 2022. 
“Early detection means nothing, if patients can’t afford the diagnostic imaging needed to confirm or rule out cancer,” said Sen. Devlin Robinson (R-Allegheny). “This bill closes that gap.”
Coverage would begin in 2027, if the House passes Senate Bill 88 in time for Gov. Josh Shapiro to sign it before the end of October, Halpin-Murphy confirmed.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/state-capitol-harrisburg-copy-1024x460.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 21:00:45.845962

The state House will not pass the mini-budget the Senate approved Tuesday. 
Instead, the House budget committee voted on its own slimmed-down spending plans. 
Republican budget writers in the House and Senate have been unable to bridge their considerable differences over spending and future taxation. They are not on track to approve a comprehensive budget before July 1. 
Legislators plan to take a weeks-long break beginning this week. They are talking about returning to Raleigh for a few days each month if they have bills to approve. A comprehensive budget could come up for a vote later this summer. 
House Speaker Destin Hall said the month-to-month schedule could continue into next year, when the regular “short session” begins. 
State law allows spending to continue into the next fiscal year at previously approved levels, even without a new budget. But new initiatives won’t be funded, and state employees and teachers won’t know about their raises. 
After the Senate approved its mini-budget on a 39-6 vote, Hall said his chamber would not agree to it. 
The Senate’s bill “kind of creeps over into trying to get as close to a comprehensive budget as possible without having one,” he said. 
While Hall was talking to reporters, the House budget committee began discussing its spending bills. 
One includes 2.5% raises for state employees, raises teacher pay next year by an average of 6.4%, and reduces vacant state positions by 20% across state agencies. 
A second bill includes money for about a dozen items and puts money into the state building fund.

(Photo provided by the Missile Defense Agency)A new bill in Congress cosponsored by Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan calls for the federal government to spend almost a billion dollars on new military projects in Alaska.
The Golden Dome Act, cosponsored by the Alaska Republican; Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-North Dakota; and Rep. Mark Messmer, R-Indiana, seeks to implement a presidential executive order that calls for the creation of an extended missile defense system for the United States.
Envisioned by the president and modeled after Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, the Senate proposal envisions a system that could protect the United States against long-range missiles fired by a foreign country.
Overall, the act authorizes more than $23 billion to buy new missiles and build and plan new facilities.
That figure is on top of $25 billion earmarked for missile defense in the under-construction budget reconciliation bill, colloquially known as the Big, Beautiful Bill.
Sullivan has been a longtime proponent of America’s current limited missile defense system, which includes a large radar system in the Aleutian Islands and missiles based in underground silos at Fort Greely, near Delta Junction.
The effectiveness of that system and similar efforts has been repeatedly questioned, and tests have not shown that it is effective against significant numbers of missiles or when decoys or other countermeasures are used, a March 2025 report concluded.
The first-draft text of the Golden Dome Act, posted online Tuesday, calls for $460 million to be spent on new missiles and missile silos at Fort Greely.
Another $500 million is earmarked for a separate, as-yet-unbuilt missile defense system known as “Aegis Ashore.” 
The Aegis missile system is ordinarily used by the U.S. Navy, and after several successful uses, proponents have called for ground-based Aegis missiles as well.
The $500 million would cover planning, site selection and construction of an Aegis Ashore facility in Alaska. Additional funding may be needed to complete that project.
Additional money is earmarked for the Cobra Dane radar system in the Aleutians, currently used to track objects in space.
During a news conference, Sullivan noted that on Monday, the missile defense radar at Clear Space Force Station, near Healy, tracked a live intercontinental ballistic missile in a test for the first time since being upgraded in 2021.
The test had been delayed for more than three years due to a variety of problems, including the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“It was a huge success,” Sullivan said of the test. “We can do this. The Golden Dome Act will ensure a long-term statutory framework that will make us safer and cement this critical national security initiative into the laws of our nation.”

(U.S. Forest Service)A Republican proposal in the U.S. Senate that could have put millions of acres of public land in Washington up for sale has hit a roadblock, but the lead lawmaker behind the idea is planning to press ahead with a scaled-back version. 
This piece of a sprawling GOP tax cut and spending bill would have required the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands across 11 Western states within the next five years. There were 5.4 million acres in Washington that could have been included in those potential sales.
But on Monday, the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian said this proposal did not comply with rules that would allow for it to be fast-tracked as part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
U.S. Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, who is spearheading the land sale provisions, outlined changes he planned to make in a social media post on Monday. 
These included removing all Forest Service land from the proposal and limiting the amount of Bureau of Land Management acreage to parcels within five miles of population centers. Lee also said he wanted to establish “FREEDOM ZONES to ensure these lands benefit AMERICAN FAMILIES” and “PROTECT our farmers, ranchers, and recreational users.” 
Opponents still see a battle ahead.
“I don’t trust him and I don’t trust his process,” said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. “We will be here to the last minute, making sure that they do not succeed in putting this into a bill, and if they do, we will be there with an amendment fighting it tooth and nail on the floor.” 
If Forest Service property is removed from the bill, it would dramatically downsize how much land could be affected in Washington. Of the 5.4 million acres covered in the state by the original proposal, only 344,252 acres are Bureau of Land Management parcels, according to data released by the Wilderness Society. 
Lee’s proposed limit to land within five miles of a population center would likely further reduce that amount of acreage. 
But even if Lee revises his proposal in the way he described, Cantwell said high-traffic recreation sites in the Columbia River Gorge and the Methow River Valley, and sagebrush hunting grounds in the Columbia Basin could be included. 
Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, who is also a Democrat, has spoken out against the proposed public land sell-off as well.
And Gov. Bob Ferguson said Monday that he and his team were “exploring our options if this shortsighted proposal moves forward.” 
Before the GOP-backed tax policy and spending bill cleared the House, Republicans in that chamber scrapped a proposal to make 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah available for sale. They did so following bipartisan opposition from public land activists, the outdoor recreation community, and conservation groups. 
“It’s no secret that some Republicans have wanted to do this,” said Conservation Northwest Senior Policy Director Paula Swedeen. 
Swedeen raised concerns about how land sales could carve up wildlife habitat or lead to development in areas at risk of wildfire.
Groups that opposed the provision in the House anticipated that Republicans would revive a public land sale proposal in the Senate, said Jonathan Owen, director of the Olympic Peninsula conservation group Wild Olympics Campaign. 
The now-blocked Senate version of the plan would have required the interior and agriculture secretaries to select between 0.5% and 0.75% of eligible lands to dispose of via competitive sale, auction, “or other methods designed to secure not less than fair market value.” 
“Something like this has never been done before at this scale and would be a slippery slope,” Owen said. 
Along with Washington, the Senate plan called for making lands eligible for sale in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. About 250 million acres of land, including the 5.4 million acres in Washington state, would have been eligible for sale. 
In Washington, this included parcels in the Olympic National Forest, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Snoqualmie National Forest, the Okanogan National Forest, the Mt. Baker National Forest, the Alpine Lakes Wilderness and the Wild Sky Wilderness. 
Lee has said previously that his goal was to open “underused” federal land for housing. But critics said there was no requirement that the land be used for home construction.
In Lee’s original proposal, 5% of the revenue from each land sale would be given to local governments for infrastructure to support housing development, 5% would be earmarked for land maintenance, and the rest of the money would go to the general federal coffers.
In recent congressional testimony, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum described the targeted areas as “barren land next to highways with existing billboards that have no recreational value.”
Others disagree. Lauren McClean, mayor of Boise, Idaho, said Tuesday during a press conference hosted by Cantwell that the land that was potentially up for sale includes access to trailheads and other recreational sites. 
“In this proposal, the sale of public lands would potentially block access to the over 200 miles of trails that we have that lead from our city into open spaces,” McLean said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/okanogan-wenatchee-national-forest-sign-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-06-24 21:00:45.845962

Department of Education directed that American institutions of higher learning halt any “hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life” related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
The directive on DEI drew immediate (and successful) legal challenges nationally, but rather than wait for their outcome, the University of Alaska’s Board of Regents moved with alacrity to embrace it. Within the week, it had ordered university President Pat Pitney to comply with the federal mandates and instruct her chancellors to, among other things, assure that “the Universities’ websites and other electronic or print material representing each‬ university, no longer refer to “affirmative action,” “DEI” nor utilize the words “diversity,” “equity,” “inclusion,” or other associated terms‬.”
In adopting a policy explicitly rejecting DEI, the regents demonstrated the nature of anticipatory obedience: acting to comply in advance of any pressure to do so in order to avoid potential consequences from some higher authority.
It was clear that the regents were motivated to protect the university and its dependence on federal funding that was threatened. It is natural for us as human beings to take steps to avoid pain and maximize survival.
And it is that instinct that authoritarian regimes take immediate and full advantage of, forcing conformity through targeted actions against one or a few institutions so that others will retreat in fear.
In his maximalist assault on American institutions in his first months in office, President Trump demonstrated his mastery of coercion. His war on higher education began with attacks on Columbia University and other “elite” schools for their antisemitism. Threatened with cuts of tens of millions in federal funding, Columbia immediately capitulated. Northwestern University promptly announced steps it was taking to comply, but did not escape the loss of funding. Hundreds of America’s universities took notice. 
Harvard University, while acknowledging that changes were warranted, refused to comply with the Trump directives, leading to escalating steps by Trump to crush Harvard’s resistance: curbing hundreds of millions in grants, threatening to revoke its tax exempt status and to bar foreign students from enrolling. Harvard’s defiance has found vindication in the courts and emboldened other institutions of higher learning to defend their independence from unprecedented government intrusion.
The Trump administration initiated parallel assaults on other pillars of American society, issuing executive orders, for example, barring certain law firms from interacting with federal agencies on behalf of their respective clients. In almost all cases, the identified firms had either employed lawyers or represented clients adverse to his interests. Some of the most noteworthy law firms in the country capitulated to the pressure, ultimately entering into agreements requiring them to provide pro bono services on behalf of the administration nearing $1 billion in value. Other well-known law firms refused to be coerced, viewing the administration’s actions as a distortion of American justice and the role of attorneys to provide diligent representation. 
No court has upheld the claims the Trump administration has made in court to defend its actions. Nevertheless, as Scott Cummings, professor of ethics at the UCLA School of Law, has noted, Trump’s assault on law firms has had a deliberately powerful chilling effect. “Already, many firms are declining to take on cases that challenge the administration’s policies. That’s not a side effect of the crackdown. It was the purpose all along.”
All of us must resist the temptation to acquiesce into anticipatory obedience. The greater the urge to conform, the greater the power of a regime to impose it without having to lift a finger. If the Trump administration can so quickly coerce leading segments of our society to back away from principles that we have historically espoused, we should expect that further intrusions on both institutional and individual liberty will quickly follow.

(Courtesy of Douglas County)OMAHA — The Douglas County Board appears poised to appoint a retired chief deputy of the County Treasurer’s Office to fill the top spot in the office left open this spring when John Ewing Jr. was elected mayor of Omaha.
During its weekly meeting Tuesday, the Douglas County Board discussed the legal process of filling the position, essentially the county’s banker who oversees the collection of taxes. Ewing had about 18 months left in his elected treasurer’s term when he submitted a resignation letter June 6 so he could begin mayoral duties.
County Board Chair Roger Garcia told the board he preferred a “non-political option” to fill the term: Tim Cavanaugh, who had served as chief deputy of the Treasurer’s Office. Cavanaugh retired in January 2021. Cavanaugh, also a retired Omaha Police captain, currently serves on the elected board of the Metropolitan Utilities District. (State law would allow him to serve in both positions simultaneously.)

The County Board did not vote on an appointment. Garcia said he preferred to discuss the potential appointment this week, followed by a formal vote July 8. No commissioner publicly objected to Cavanaugh. 
Commissioners said they had received calls from interested parties, though no other contender was identified during the discussion. Board member P.J. Morgan said that Cavanaugh, who is not related to Board member Jim Cavanaugh, would be an “excellent choice.”
Jane Alexander more recently has served as Ewing’s chief deputy. She told the Nebraska Examiner earlier this month that she was not interested in pursuing the treasurer’s job permanently. 
Garcia was among several who had approached Alexander about the opportunity, and he noted a couple of barriers, including the residency requirement, that led her to opt out. She lives in Sarpy County. He said that Alexander told him that she supported the appointment of Cavanaugh to fill the post until the next treasurer is elected in November 2026 and takes office the following January.

Garcia said his preference is to have a team that knows and could “take care of the office” and operations until the public could elect the next treasurer. 
Garcia said that both Cavanaugh and Alexander have expressed that they would not run for election to the post.
Board members Tuesday also approved a motion to increase Alexander’s salary to reflect her leadership of the office until an interim is formally appointed.
Under law, the board has 45 days, or until around July 21, to fill Ewing’s position.

Raghib Allie-Brennan said his arrest on a shoplifting charge was due to his failure to scan two items at a Target store in Bethel.,"State Rep. Raghib Allie-Brennan, D-Bethel, said Tuesday on social media that his arrest on a shoplifting charge Monday evening was due to his failure to scan two items as he used the self-checkout at a Target store in Bethel.
“I was in a rush to bring items to my grandmother in the hospital, the store didn’t have bags, and I was juggling multiple purchases,” Allie-Brennan said in a post on Facebook.
He was issued a misdemeanor summons for 6th-degree larceny.
A Bethel police summary of his arrest stated Allie-Brennan was detained by Target loss prevention personnel who told police they recognized him from “previous unreported larcenies.”
He was arrested after police reviewed security video showing him attempting to leave the store with $26.69 in unpaid merchandise, police said. The summary provided no further details.
Allie-Brennan, 33, a four-term lawmaker first elected in 2018, did not respond to a request for comment beyond his statement on social media, which did not directly address the accusation of previous thefts.
“While I do not have a record, I take full responsibility for the error and am working through the legal processes to resolve the matter quickly and respectfully,” he said on Facebook.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said in a statement he has spoken to Allie-Brennan, who represents portions of Bethel and Danbury.
“He recognizes the high standard to which I hold our members and is taking responsibility for inadvertently leaving the Target self-checkout without scanning several items,” Ritter said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/190109-state-of-the-state-Raghib-Allie-Brennan-1.jpg,,,2025-06-24 21:00:45.845962

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout 2025)The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is suing the state over a new law that created a felony charge for elected officials who vote in support of sanctuary policies for immigrants.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Davidson County Chancery Court on behalf of seven members of the Metro Nashville Council, argues that the law violates local elected officials’ First Amendment right to free speech.
The statute creates a Class E felony for local public officials who vote to adopt a “sanctuary policy” and requires any official who violates the law to be removed from office “as soon as practicable.” The charge is punishable by up to six years in prison and a $3,000 fine.
“This law infringes on the constitutional protections I have as a legislator: to do what is best for my constituents without fear of interference,” Metro Councilmember at large Zulfat Suara, one of the plaintiffs, stated. “We must not allow the state to usurp these protections. As a public official and an immigrant, I cannot accept a law that makes compassion a crime. Many immigrant families already live in fear — if they come after immigrants, who will they come for next?”
Suara is joined in the suit by Council members Clay Capp (District 6), Brenda Gadd (District 24), Sandra Sepulveda (District 30), Terry Vo (District 17), Ginny Welsch (District 16), and Delishia Porterfield (Council member at large).
Bill criminalizing votes for immigrant sanctuary policies ‘constitutionally suspect’

Representatives for Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk, who are named as defendants in the suit, were not immediately available for comment.
District 25 Metro Council member and attorney Jeff Preptit is representing his fellow council members as co-counsel on the suit alongside ACLU-TN Legal Director Stella Yarbrough and Ben Gastel, Preptit’s colleague at Herzfeld, Suetholz, Gastel, Leniski and Wall PLLC. 
“This legislation makes it a felony for local leaders to do the job our communities elected them to do,” Preptit said in a news release. “Local leaders shouldn’t face criminal charges for passing policies that reflect the values and safety concerns of our neighbors — especially when those policies ensure trust between residents and local government.”
The provision is part of a broad-ranging immigration enforcement plan spearheaded by Gov. Bill Lee’s administration to align with the Trump administration’s immigration policy. Lee signed the bill into law in February after it passed in a special legislative session with strong support from the Tennessee General Assembly’s Republican supermajority.
Sen. Todd Gardenhire, the Republican chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined Democratic senators in voting against the measure after calling it a “dangerous precedent.”
Prior to the law’s passage, First Amendment, government accountability and legal experts said the law was “constitutionally suspect.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson said in an emailed statement in January that “requiring localities and public officials to comply with federal law is not a matter of public opinion” and that the criminal penalties “reflect the overwhelming belief of our constituents” regarding support for the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement.
A 2019 Tennessee law already prohibits the adoption of “sanctuary policies,” broadly defined as any formal or informal policy that in any way limits state or local government cooperation with federal immigration agencies. That law allows the state to withhold grant funding from jurisdictions that adopt such policies, and gives citizens the right to file a civil suit challenging policies they suspect of violating the law.

Henry McMaster, surrounded by legislators and agency directors, shows a bill he signed combining three health care agencies into one at the state's health care campus in Cayce on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)CAYCE — Residents with substance abuse disorders, disabilities and mental health needs will be able to more easily access state services under a law the governor ceremonially signed Tuesday.
The bill, which Gov. Henry McMaster actually signed into law in April, created the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities by combining three agencies — the departments of mental health, disabilities, and alcohol and drug abuse services — into one.
“What we are doing here today is going to change our state,” McMaster said. “It is going to fix some things that have been going on for a while.”
Divisions of the new agency, overseen by the former agency heads, will administer services for mental health, disabilities and substance abuse. But people with concurrent issues, such as mental health concerns that lead to substance abuse, will no longer have to go through a disjointed and inefficient system bogged down by bureaucracy, officials said.
SC public health overhaul could be resurrected, senator says: ‘It’s not trivial.’

South Carolina’s public health system was the most fragmented in the country, according to a 2024 independent study the state commissioned. Senate President Thomas Alexander, one of the bill’s lead sponsors, compared the process to ping-pong, since a person looking for services was likely to get bounced around among the agencies.
“So many of the individuals that need care by one of those agencies needs care by another agency,” the Walhalla Republican said. “We’ve kind of had that silo system here in South Carolina.”
It’s unclear whether consolidating the agencies and creating more efficient processes will mean cutting positions, officials said Tuesday. The state’s human resources department has until June 2026 to officially streamline services by removing duplicative efforts.
The agency’s approximately 450 Columbia-area employees are working out of the state’s new health campus in Cayce. The campus, which also houses the Department of Public Health, was once the site of the now-defunct SC Electric & Gas Company, as well as its parent company, SCANA.
Who will lead the agency is still up in the air. The law put the agency under McMaster’s Cabinet, allowing him to nominate a director for Senate approval. That director will answer directly to the governor.
The Department of Public Health was also a product of a restructuring bill. In 2023, McMaster signed a bill splitting the massive Department of Health and Environmental Control into two separate Cabinet agencies.
  Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, speaks about a bill combining three health care agencies into one at the state’s health care campus on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)
A previous version of the health care agency combination bill would have wrapped the newly created Department of Public Health into the new health care agency, along with the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, and the Department on Aging.
The bill died on the final day of the 2024 legislative session, as members of the Freedom Caucus who opposed the bill ran out the clock before the House could give it a final vote. The proposal would consolidate too much power under a single person, creating a “health czar,” said opponents in the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.
By removing the Department of Public Health from the fold, this year’s bill passed with almost no opposition.
Despite including fewer agencies, the version that became law still addressed the most vital issues people faced accessing services, said Sen. Tom Davis, a longtime champion of restructuring the health care system.
“The one thing that came up over and over again, and that (the report) stressed over everything else, was that DDSN, DMH and DAODAS have overlapping populations, and if you do nothing else, take care of this,” the Beaufort Republican said. “Government is all about good, not perfect.”
The state’s restructuring began more than 30 years ago, with former Gov. Carroll Campbell’s major consolidation of state government in the early 1990s. The combination of health agencies celebrated Tuesday completes that goal, Davis said.
“Today, I think we can declare restructuring complete,” Davis said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4087-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating an oil spill that entered the West Nishnabotna River from a truck stop near Avoca.
The spill follows a complaint of discharged petroleum at the same Eagles Landing Flying J Truckstop from this spring that the DNR was still investigating and working to help clean up when Tuesday’s spill was observed. 
Alison Manz, an environmental specialist senior with the DNR, said it’s unknown how much petroleum entered the river, though she believes the spill was caught “right at the very beginning” of the plume.
Absorbent booms and other clean-up tools were placed immediately downstream in an effort to contain the petroleum from spreading and, as of Tuesday, no dead fish had been observed in the river.

Several months ago, when the department investigated the previous complaint regarding petroleum contamination at the same site just north of Avoca off Interstate 80, the staff found a “bigger issue” when they realized petroleum was being discharged into a stormwater retention basin.
Manz said the retention basin has been plugged and is “completely contained” but clean-up for the roadside ditch and culverts connected to the retention basin has been an ongoing process. “We don’t know how long that basin has been draining into the roadside ditch,” Manz said. 
Recent heavy rains impacted the clean-up process of the ditches and caused an unknown amount of petroleum to flow into the West Nishnabotna River.
“I don’t know if we’re ever going to know what the quantity that went to the river is, because all the residual that’s in the soil and in the culverts … we’re never going to know quantity,” Manz said. 
She said the DNR has “no idea” how long the retention basin had been contaminated with petroleum discharges and draining into the ditch before the spring complaint brought it to the department’s attention. 
A press release from the DNR said Eagles Landing has been cooperating with the clean-up activities, which Manz said will be extensive. Before the crews can clean and drain the plugged retention basin, they must excavate the roadside ditch and clean the culverts. 
The department must also find the source of the leak. “We know that it’s coming from Eagles Landing, but we don’t know where,” Manz said. 
In 2011, the same facility had a leaking underground storage tank but it received a “no action required” classification by the department following site assessments and cleanup. 
Jessica Montana, the supervisor for the DNR’s field office in Atlantic, said the facility had to have monthly monitoring reports conducted by a certified groundwater professional submitted to DNR. 
Montana said the facility was in compliance and was “spot on” with submitting the reports. 
The spring complaint and subsequent spill into the West Nishnabotna, however, means the DNR must investigate whether this petroleum is coming from a new leak or from the previously identified leaking underground storage tank. 
“We’re still investigating what was released, and where, and why, and we’re still determining the source,” Montana said. 
The DNR has advised the public to avoid the contaminated area on the river.

Partizanfilm, a new nonprofit art house movie theater, is set to open this fall in downtown Burlington — just around the corner from the former location of Merrill’s Roxy Cinema, which closed in November.
Five Burlington residents purchased a commercial condominium located at 230 College St., which has been vacant since the Restock Shop, a low-waste store selling refillable personal care items, closed two years ago. The owners hope to renovate the space to make it a two-screen “microcinema” that shows first-run independent and foreign films seven days a week, in addition to the occasional older film.
Partizanfilms announced construction plans for the theater June 15. More than 130 people have joined the cooperative through paid memberships, and an additional 120 volunteers offered to assist with its opening, according to Brett Yates, the nonprofit’s president and one of its five founding board members.
“People are really eager to see it, to see another movie theater get going,” he said.
Yates and the four other board members have been planning to launch Partizanfilm since the Roxy’s owner announced its closure, he said.

As Vermont’s biggest city and cultural center, Burlington felt incomplete without a movie theater, and the closure of its only cinema “felt like a slight” to the city, Yates said.
Yates spent part of his 20s working in movie theaters and now works as a ski lift operator and freelance journalist. His wife, Michelle Sagalchik, a high school U.S. history and civics teacher; Antonio Golán, a communications lecturer at the University of Vermont; Gretchen Schissel, a curricular program specialist at the university; and Ali Hamedani, a physical therapist round out the founding board members. 
None of the five founders have run a business before. But when they learned that no existing business planned to reopen a downtown theater, they decided to take matters into their own hands by launching a grassroots effort to create a member-operated nonprofit cinema.
“I don’t think any of us feel qualified,” Yates said. “We just wanted to do it, and I guess that’s our qualification, is that we wanted to do it.”
Merrill Jarvis III, the third-generation owner of the Roxy, previously told Seven Days he would place a deed restriction on the building if he sold it, preventing future owners from operating a movie theater there.
That restriction ended Sagalchik and her peers’ hopes that someone might step in to renovate and reopen a modernized cinema where the Roxy once stood. 

“Had it seemed more certain that the Roxy would be up for sale with the possibility of being renovated into a movie theater, we would have trusted and hoped that someone would take on that project,” said Sagalchik. “But we sort of doubt that is going to happen.”
When asked in an interview for his response to the new theater’s plans to open, Jarvis declined to comment.
Yates and Sagalchik said they are not attempting to recreate the Roxy. Instead, their independent project aims to keep movie theaters alive by embracing a nonprofit model that solicits arts grants and tax deductible donations, which they said mirrors a broader trend in recent years of nonprofit art house theaters.
Community-centered cinema initiatives are also popping up elsewhere in Vermont, such as the reopening of The Bigger Picture in Waitsfield as a nonprofit, according to the Valley Reporter.
Partizanfilm plans to rely primarily on donations, grant funding and membership sales to stay in business. For an annual membership fee of $60, patrons get to pay $2.50 less per ticket than non-members. For non-members, tickets are slated to cost $12 in the evening, $8.50 for a weekend matinee and $7.50 for a weekday matinee.
The owners expect members to play a significant role in the theater’s direction and oversight through electing board members and weighing in on issues at annual meetings. The theater’s democratic governance structure is modeled after a consumer cooperative, according to Yates. 
However, Partizanfilm does not plan to issue patronage dividends. Instead, the owners expect to reinvest all revenue into the theater’s operations and programming, he said.
“We didn’t want to do it any other way,” Yates said. “We’re hoping that it will be an example that a business can be run democratically, and it can be run to serve a community’s needs.”
“Nobody is doing this to make money,” he added. “We’re all doing this together. We’re going to make decisions together, and we think it’s going to work.”
Outside of the film screening rooms, current plans are to put the lobby to use as a social area with a small bookstore and cafe serving beer, wine, coffee and snacks. Yates said he encourages the use of the space for post-viewing conversation or to simply to hang out. 
The founders envision the future theater functioning as a third space to foster connection not only among moviegoers, but also all who enter its doors, according to Yates.
“This will be a place where the energy will be right,” he said. “And I hope people will enjoy it as a place beyond just going to the movies.”
Sagalchik said the five-person team, all of whom reside in Burlington, has a natural affinity for mobilizing public support for grassroots efforts. 
“This is sort of an extension of that kind of organizing energy,” she said. 
Despite major renovations still pending, the theater’s owners are hopeful to be up and running by Nov. 1, Sagalchik said.

(Screenshot of SCETV Supreme Court livestream)COLUMBIA — A voter advocacy group and lawyers representing South Carolina’s General Assembly each made their case Tuesday to the state Supreme Court over whether the state’s post-census redrawing of congressional voting lines violate the state constitution.
Filing suit last July, the South Carolina League of Women Voters argued that political gerrymandering of the map redrawn by legislators and signed into law in January 2022 watered down Democrats’ influence in the coastal 1st District, to the point that it violates the state constitution’s guarantee of an “equal right to elect officers.”

In Wednesday’s hearing, justices said there’s nothing in the constitution specifically banning the consideration of politics in redrawing voting maps. They questioned how they can tell legally when the Legislature goes too far.
John Gore, the lawyer representing Senate Republicans, asked the court not “to wade into this political thicket.”
While questioning the League of Women Voters attorney, justices said they worried a ruling that sought to create political parity would unintentionally go too far and swing election results in the other party’s favor. In this case, that would mean favoring Democrats over the state’s ruling party.
“What I hear you saying is, you’re asking us to take it upon ourselves to decree who gets political power.” Justice George James said.
Chief Justice John Kittredge said it’s not the court’s place to give any party the edge.
“I don’t have the right to select the winner; I have the right to vote,” he said. “I don’t have the right to have a pity party and sour grapes if my candidate loses.”
Justice Leticia Verdin said the court can’t essentially “act as a Legislature” and redraw the lines with its decision.
The latest lawsuit followed a 6-3 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May 2024 that tossed out an earlier case brought by South Carolina chapters of the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union arguing state legislators drew the coastal 1st District, held by Republican Nancy Mace, on racial lines.
In that case, staff and members of the GOP-controlled Legislature testified it was politics — not race — that influenced how the lines were redrawn following the 2020 Census.
The League of Women Voters pointed to that testimony, including statements from the lead map drawer that he was instructed by legislators to review how precincts voted in the 2020 presidential election and move them into new districts to create a Republican majority in the 1st District.
“I think the record is clear that elected officials use (political gerrymandering) and voters largely hate it,” said the organization’s legal director, Allen Chaney.
He recognized that the 1st District is the only one in the state swayed by making the Legislature try again on redrawing congressional maps.
But no voter, Democrat or Republican, has the right to decide the outcome of an election. The issue is whether one party’s influence has been intentionally diluted to give the other the advantage, he said.
  South Carolina Chief Justice Kittredge asks questions Tuesday, June 24,2025, of lawyers for the South Carolina League of Women Voters. (Screenshot of SCETV Supreme Court livestream)
“So, what does that mean?” Kittredge said, asking how to measure that. “Give us some guideposts that we could latch onto.”
In setting a potential precedent, the court needs “manageable standards,” James said, “instead of saying this just doesn’t look right.”
In response, Chaney said any future challenge to district lines would need to prove legislators purposefully tried to dilute someone’s vote based on whether they vote Republican or Democrat and accomplished that aim in a way that sways the results of an election.
But Gore, the lawyer for Senate Republicans, argued while politics was a factor in the maps’ drawing, it wasn’t the only factor.
Using Chaney’s suggestion to decide what crosses the line between an acceptable use of politics and what’s unconstitutional is problematic, said Andrew Mathias, the lawyer for House Republicans.
“It becomes so unmanageable that it’s arbitrary,” he said. “It is asking the court to call balls and strikes without a strike zone.”
Mathias and Gore went on to argue that voter preferences can change over time. And, in South Carolina, where people don’t register by party, voters can participate in either party’s primary, making it more of a guess of who’s Republican versus Democrat.
South Carolina’s 1st District has long been reliable for Republicans. However, a population explosion on the coast turned it more purple. In 2018, Democrat Joe Cunningham flipped the seat to blue for the first time in nearly 40 years.
Two years later, Mace ousted him by 1 percentage point, flipping the seat back to Republican control. After the post-census redrawing of lines, Mace easily won in 2022 against Democrat Annie Andrews.
Finally, lawyers for the Legislature argued, if South Carolinians do not like the results of an election or the way congressional lines are drawn, they have other ways of changing them that don’t involve the courts — they can chose to vote a politician out in the next election cycle or they can lobby the Legislature for a constitutional change outlawing political gerrymandering.
But Chaney said the very nature of political gerrymandering means those aren’t real options, because it reduces voters’ influence over their elected officials.
“It cannot be that the only check on this sort of inversion of representative democracy is convincing lawmakers to give away their own power,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-24-at-2.22.41 PM.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

Masters, R-Berkeley, sits in a meeting of the House Public Heath subcommittee on March 5, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)State Del. Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, denied on Tuesday allegations that he is responsible for an antisemitic comment made by a private Instagram account that used his name and is linked to an organization he recently led.
In a statement Tuesday, West Virginia Democratic Party Chairman Mike Pushkin called the comment — which he says came from Masters — “disgusting, dangerous, and completely disqualifying.” Pushkin, who is Jewish, urged Gov. Patrick Morrisey to “show moral leadership” and call for Masters’ resignation.
The comment in question was made three days ago by an account with the handle @NoQuarterMasters in response to another comment on a post from April 12 about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. The comment read: “[Portnoy is] not white. He’s a Jew. We never claimed them. That’s why he’s short tiny and weak.”
  A screenshot taken Monday of the comment left by @NoQuarterMasters three days ago in response to another user’s 10-weeks-old comment on a video about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, denies that the account that left the comment belongs to him despite allegations to the contrary.
In a phone interview Tuesday with West Virginia Watch, Masters said he didn’t have “any active Instagram account.”
“That is certainly not something I am typing or saying or believing,” Masters said, continuing to call the framing of the comment “bizarre.”
“Yeah, that is certainly not something — I mean, I’m not declaring who white people do and don’t claim, and that, that’s — no it’s just not a belief [of mine],” he continued, referring to antisemitism and the idea that “there’s declarations as to who is and is not white.”
A screenshot of the comment from @NoQuarterMasters was sent to West Virginia Watch on Monday. It was still posted and public on Instagram on Tuesday morning. Tuesday afternoon, Pushkin reached out independently to West Virginia Watch with a statement regarding the post.
Until Tuesday afternoon, the name on the @NoQuarterMasters account was Ian T. Masters and the link in the bio was for the West Virginia Citizen’s Defense League, a Second Amendment advocacy group where Masters served as president from 2015 until at least January 2025, when he was appointed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey to serve in the West Virginia House.
By 2:20 p.m. — after Masters’ conversation with West Virginia Watch — the name on the account was changed to I. Masters and the link to the state Citizens Defense League was removed from the bio.
  A screenshot of the @NoQuarterMasters Instagram account taken at 11:16 a.m. on Tuesday (left) shows the full name Ian T. Masters along with a link to the website for the West Virginia Citizens Defense League, where Masters served as president from 2015-2025. A screenshot of the same account taken at 2:20 p.m. Tuesday (right) — after Masters was interviewed by West Virginia Watch — shows the name on the account changed to I. Masters and the link for the WVCDL removed from the bio.
The profile picture on @NoQuarterMasters shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in West Virginia. The rest of the information in the letter is covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. 
The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals. The runes include the Valknot, the Life Rune and the Wolfsangel, among others.
  A screenshot of the profile picture used on the @NoQuarterMasters Instagram account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in West Virginia and several runes described by the Anti-Defamation League as being associated antisemitic views and groups.
According to Instagram, the last two digits of the phone number used for a password reset on the @NoQuarterMasters account match those from Masters’ personal cell phone number, which he used to return a phone call from a West Virginia Watch reporter on Tuesday.
When asked Tuesday if there was any chance someone would be impersonating him given all these connections, Masters said he “didn’t know.”
“I’ll certainly be looking into it,” Masters said. “I’m trying to recall even having any active Instagram account, so I don’t know.”
Many posts from the West Virginia Citizens Defense League’s Instagram account in 2023 — when Masters was serving as its president — showed @NoQuarterMasters tagged in photos alongside accounts with the same names as other officers for the organization. 
Masters, a lawyer by trade, signed off on many of the captions for those posts as Ian T. Masters, Esquire.

  Another screenshot of an Instagram post made by the West Virginia Citizens Defense League in March 2023 shows @NoQuarterMasters tagged in the photo with a caption signed by Del. Ian T. Masters.
In his statement, Pushkin said the comment made by @NoQuarterMasters — which he attributes to Masters despite his denial — was not just antisemitic but “rooted in white supremacy.”
“As a lawyer and a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, he should have known better — but clearly, he does not,” Pushkin wrote. “His bigotry is an embarrassment to his district, to our state, and to the values we are supposed to uphold as Americans.”
In addition to calling on Morrisey to call for Masters’ resignation Pushkin said House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, “should speak clearly and unequivocally in defense of decency and demand that Delegate Masters resign.”
“There is no place in our legislature for vile hate speech,” Pushkin said. “West Virginians deserve better.”
Morrisey’s office did not respond to requests for comment on this article. Hanshaw was not available for comment on Tuesday. Ann Ali, communications director for the state House of Delegates, said Hanshaw is not unfamiliar with dealing with situations where allegations have come against sitting members of the House.
“Unfortunately, this is not the first time we’ve had a report of a delegate doing or saying something completely unbecoming of the office of the West Virginia Legislature and I think in every instance [where the allegation is proven], Speaker Hanshaw has used the tools at his disposal to demonstrate his disapproval,” Ali said. 
Ali said that those powers, however, can be limited; they do include removing a sitting member from committee assignments as well as changing office assignments, seating assignments in the chamber or parking spot assignments. Other powers, Ali said, are not in the speaker’s purview since members are often elected to the Legislature by people in their respective districts. 
Masters, however, is not one of those members as he was appointed to the House seat by Morrisey in January after delegate-elect Joseph de Soto was accused of threatening to harm and kill lawmakers. De Soto had won the November 2024 election as a Republican then switched his party affiliation to Democratic shortly before being arrested for making terroristic threats. 
House Republicans in January voted to vacate the seat instead of expelling de Soto, saying it was the correct way to deal with the seat since de Soto was on house arrest and never sworn in. The vacate move prompted a legal challenge from the state Democratic Party, who argued that the seat should have gone to Democrats due to de Soto’s party switch.
The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled against state Democrats in one of their challenges over the seat. 
During the 2025 session, Masters served on the House Committee on Health and Human Resources as well as the Public Health and Health Care Regulation subcommittees. 
He was the sponsor of three bills this session: House Bill 2662, creating a felony vehicular homicide and aggravated vehicular homicide charges in the state; HB 3483, relating to mental health examination requirements and HB 3489, relating to vaccine requirements. 
None of those bills made it out of committee, however the Senate version of HB 3489 did pass and became law earlier this year with Morrisey’s signature.

“It’s maybe a five-plus-million-dollar project with no guarantee of any money coming back,” Gabe Lajeunesse, one of four partners, said.

This story by Cassandra Hemenway was first published in The Bridge on June 24.
A planned 31-lot subdivision on Isabel Circle in Montpelier that’s been in the works for nearly three years has been suspended. The “Stonewall Meadows Phase II” project, which is fully permitted with ground-breaking originally expected this year, is now on hold according to Gabe Lajeunesse, one of four partners invested in it.
“The partnership has determined that due to rising costs and the current economic uncertainty, we must suspend work on this project for now. The financial risks have become highly speculative, making it difficult to proceed in a market-based approach,” Lajeunesse wrote in an email to The Bridge, which also went out to Montpelier city officials.
“It’s maybe a five-plus-million-dollar project with no guarantee of any money coming back,” Lajeunesse told The Bridge in a June 20 interview. He pointed to a partnership with the city that fell apart as one of the reasons for pausing the project.
The four partners on the project are Lajeunesse, his brother Jason Lajeunesse, Barre City developer and mayor Thom Lauzon, and Pat Malone of Malone Properties in Montpelier.
The group bought the 72-acre wooded parcel just off of Isabel Circle for $3 million in 2024 and clear-cut a large swath of it in November of that year, preparing the site for housing lots. The four partners had planned to take advantage of a new city policy under which the city might pay for the project’s infrastructure — roads, water pipes, and sewer pipes — funded by a bond of $1.5 to $1.7 million that voters would be asked to approve. Aacred would have to guarantee that enough homes be built to pay the bond back via increased property taxes and water and sewer fees.
The plan never reached voters. In January 2025, city councilors cancelled a vote about proposing a bond for the Stonewall Meadows project after learning taxpayer investments might not be fully protected from the risk of loss.
In his June 12 email to The Bridge, Lajeunesse wrote: “We initially moved forward following early discussions with Montpelier that indicated potential financial support. However, efforts to secure a Strategic Partnership Agreement did not advance past city council to the voters. While we had hoped to continue solely through market-driven solutions, current conditions cast significant doubt on that path.”
Lajeunesse was careful to say the development is paused, not stopped. He pointed to new legislation signed by Gov. Scott, which creates a new financing tool for infrastructure that supports housing construction, but the timing and mechanism for that tool is not yet clear.
“We would love to see some public support that would make it more feasible,” he said, “… (and) we’re open to reengaging with the city and seeing if there is a strategic partnership.”
Lajeunesse ended his email with “Montpelier’s support would not only create much-needed housing but also set a precedent for future large-scale projects like the Country Club Road and Sabin’s Pasture projects.” He then thanked the city staff for their support, and said he “remain(s) open to creative solutions that could help make this project a reality.”

But as commissioners […]","Supporters of medical cannabis helped two measures reach the 2024 general election ballot, Initiatives 437 and 438. Some spoke during a public hearing at the University of Nebraska at Omaha on Oct. 25, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — It’s unclear what requirements the state commission to regulate medical cannabis in Nebraska might enact to license such operations by this fall, ahead of a deadline next week for detailing the criteria for applications.
The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission has until July 1 to write licensing criteria under state law. But as commissioners gear up for their next meeting Thursday, the first with all five commissioners, they have indicated they will consider adopting draft or emergency criteria to accept or deny licensing applications after July 1.
Licensing must begin by Oct. 1, the same time any other requirements for medical cannabis must be enacted, according to a pair of laws that voters overwhelmingly approved in a pair of November ballot measures.
However, with less than 48 hours until the next commission meeting, there is no specific indication of what criteria the board will consider.

Michael Coffey has since been appointed to a vacancy on the Liquor Control Commission. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Also on the agenda is a legal “memorandum of agreement” to help with future rulemaking involving the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and Gov. Jim Pillen’s Policy Research Office, the policy lobbying arm of the state’s chief executive.
No draft rules or regulations, including licensing criteria, have yet been made public.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which has led medical cannabis ballot measures since 2020, said she’s faced a lack of transparency and been unable to reach the commission or have questions answered in recent weeks, leaving many advocates “extremely frustrated.”
“I didn’t know we could be more frustrated than what we have been previously, but there just seems to be a new layer added every single day,” Eggers said Tuesday.
A legal ‘memorandum of agreement’
Final regulations can’t be approved this week because state law requires 30 days of notice before a public hearing on proposed guidelines. If there are no major changes after that, and the commission approves the guidelines, the governor and Attorney General Mike Hilgers would have final say.
A copy of the proposed “memorandum of agreement” obtained by the Nebraska Examiner indicates that the commission will consider contracting with DHHS for “legal services,” such as providing research, administration and enforcement of commission duties. It could also recommend draft legislation or policies, advise on legal impacts and participate in the rulemaking process.

DHHS CEO Steve Corsi, Policy Research Director Kenny Zoeller and Dr. Monica Oldenburg, who chairs the Medical Cannabis Commission, would enter the agreement if adopted Thursday.
Oldenburg did not respond to a request for comment ahead of the meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office has already pledged to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission if and when it begins medical cannabis licensing. Office spokesperson Suzanne Gage said Tuesday that the office will provide legal support and guidance to the Medical Cannabis Commission, as it does to other agencies and commissions.
The commissioners are already being sued by a former state senator alleging that the Nebraska laws violate federal law that classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug that has a high potential for abuse and “no currently accepted medical use.”
Pillen and Corsi, as well as Eggers and other ballot sponsors, are among those named in that lawsuit. A Lancaster County District Court judge is considering whether to dismiss the case.
DHHS: ‘Cannabis is not a medication’
The ballot measure that Eggers’ organization led through November 2024 was designed to sidestep DHHS, because officials of the state health agency have “adamantly” opposed legalization over many years. That includes March, when DHHS again opposed legislation, led by Republican State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair and supported by Eggers and other longtime advocates, to help clarify the process for implementing the ballot initiatives.
Dr. Roger Donovick, executive medical officer for DHHS, said at a March legislative hearing: “DHHS maintains that cannabis is not a medication and does not agree with its legalization.”

Under the ballot measures, any health care practitioner can recommend that patients or caregivers legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis. Cannabis can’t yet be legally purchased in Nebraska, and some advocates have turned to health care providers in neighboring states for authorization.
Eggers said the legal memorandum would give “almost full authority” to DHHS to take over the rulemaking, which the campaign never intended and which voters never considered.
Instead, voters legalized medical cannabis and created the five-member Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, made up of three governor-appointed members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and up to two more members also appointed by the governor.
Eggers said that was because the Liquor Control Commission has had a good track record of regulation and has valued the necessity of safeguards and of providing guidance to law enforcement.
“I believe it is another direct and intentional step that they are taking to absolutely destroy patient access to medical cannabis,” Eggers said of involving DHHS.
‘Another gut punch’
A DHHS spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that the agency has neither issued any guidance related to medical cannabis nor received any complaints against physicians related to the new laws since they took effect in mid-December.
“DHHS will adhere to state statute and follow regulations and licensing processes implemented by the Nebraska Cannabis Commission,” said Jeff Powell, DHHS director of communications.

Eggers said DHHS, however, has looked at cannabis as a “farce.” She laid the blame for the confusion and lack of transparency at the feet of Hilgers and Pillen. Hilgers led opposition to the most recent legislative bill that advocates rallied behind. It fell 10 votes short last month.
“Talk about another gut punch to the people of this state,” Eggers said. “And the ultimate gut punch is to the patients that are waiting at home, that have hope that on Thursday we are one step closer to access, but what I think we see rolling out here is that the day that they receive access is getting farther and farther and farther away.”
Some lawmakers who backed the hands-off legislative recommendation from Hilgers, as well as U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., a former governor, did so partly because they first wanted to see what the Medical Cannabis Commission would do.
A separate legislative attempt to shield physicians from possible civil, criminal or professional liability from recommending medical cannabis also failed last month.
Public comment desired
Eggers said she understands patients and advocates are tired and may feel as though their voices aren’t being heard, but she said families, loved ones, neighbors and children still need Nebraskans to get loud and show up.

She said Nebraskans have a right and a duty to be part of the process. Commissioners have said they want to hear from the public, too.
“At some point, I do believe that lawmakers and state officials who are doing everything in their power to stand in the way of this and to ignore the voice of the people, to stand in the way of the will of the people, I do believe they lose at some point,” Eggers said. “But at this point, they’re winning, and Nebraskans should be absolutely disgusted … with how this is being handled.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission will meet at 10 a.m. Thursday in the first-floor hearing room of the Nebraska State Office Building in Lincoln, 301 Centennial Mall South.
Commissioners at their first meeting June 9 preliminarily approved public comment periods of up to one hour and three minutes per speaker, though a majority of the commission can change how the public participates. Written comments can be submitted to shannon.nyhoff@nebraska.gov.

DemasAction in the Michigan Legislature on Tuesday saw the House of Representatives pass long-awaited bills to curb bots for gobbling up concert and event tickets en masse, while the Senate advanced enhanced traffic penalties to protect bicyclists and others on state roads.
In the House, legislation was advanced with strong bipartisan support to ban the use of bots to purchase large quantities of event tickets. The bills were inspired by Taylor Swift fans who got burned by ticket bots during the singer-songwriter’s Eras Tour. The bills are sponsored by state Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford) and state Rep. Mike McFall (D-Hazel Park), House Bill 4262 and House Bill 4263, respectively.
Multiple hearings on the bills were serious in nature but carried a light tone, rife with nods to Swift’s music and lyrics.
That did not change as Harris and McFall celebrated the package moving to the Senate on Tuesday. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“‘Mastermind’ bot operators flip their ill-gotten tickets for massive markups, profiting at the expense of real fans – who are left ‘Haunted’ by high prices. And after the inflation Michigan families experienced in recent years, expensive tickets are part of a ‘Death by a Thousand Cuts,’” Harris said in a statement. “‘This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things.’ But we don’t have to go ‘Dancing with our Hands Tied’ here. Our bipartisan plan will protect consumers by cracking down on the shady characters who use bots to get around purchase caps and resell tickets at ‘Treacherous’ prices.’”
Together, the bills would allow the Michigan Department of Attorney General to pursue legal action against anyone using automated technology to circumvent online ticket purchasing limits. The penalties include civil fines of up to $5,000 per ticket purchased using an automated bot.
A Senate version of the package – Senate Bill 158 and Senate Bill 159 – are nearing passage in the upper chamber.
Meanwhile, the Senate on Tuesday passed a two-bill package sponsored by state Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) and state Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell), which aims to protect bicyclists, pedestrians and others on roadways.
Senate Bill 216 and Senate Bill 217 would enhance penalties against motorists convicted of moving violations that also resulted in them striking vulnerable people on roadways with their vehicles.
“Whether walking to a friend’s house, cycling out on rural roads, or crossing the street in a wheelchair – everyone deserves to use our roads to get to where they need to go safe and sound,” McCann said in a statement. “By increasing accountability for drivers to share the roads with all who navigate them, we can prevent needless tragedies from occurring and ultimately save lives.”
The changes were hailed as comprehensive but simple updates to the state’s “move over” traffic law, which requires motorists to slow down or move over into a different lane when encountering stationary vehicles with flashing, rotating or oscillating lights.
Albert in a statement said the law would be easy to follow and communicate publicly, aiding enforcement in situations that apply to every situation when a vehicle is pulled over and using its warning lights.
“This change will help make roadways safer for all – especially those in or near stationary vehicles,” Albert said.
The bills now move to the House, where the chamber is mulling its own version of the same bills from state Rep. Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo) and state Rep.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Although abortion remains generally legal in Montana, people on the frontlines in the Treasure State said work on the ground has changed since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
In the 2022 Dobbs opinion, the nation’s highest court overturned Roe vs. Wade, which protected the right to abortion based on medical privacy.
Since then, laws criminalizing abortion took effect in Idaho, South Dakota, Texas and elsewhere, and staff at clinics in Montana are fielding more phone calls from people out of state with questions about medical care.
“What has changed is the intense heightening of fear and confusion,” said Helen Weems, owner of All Families Healthcare in Whitefish.
The Guttmacher Institute estimated 155,000 people traveled out of state for abortion care in 2024, or 15% of all abortion patients obtaining care in states without total bans. It said the number is a decline from 2023, but still represents an increase from the pre-Dobbs baseline of 81,000 in 2020.
And providers at Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula have seen women from other states they feared were at risk of death, even as a report released this week identified women who died preventable deaths outside Montana due to complications after abortion bans took effect.
More people in Montana also need financial support, such as gas money to get to a clinic, according to the Montana Abortion Access Program.
In recent interviews, in advance of the third anniversary of the Dobbs decision, providers and advocates in Montana reflected on the changes they have seen in the field during the course of three years.
They also argued Montanans who support reproductive freedom should remain vigilant despite protections that remain in place in the Treasure State.
“The values of Montanans, everyday Montanans, continue to be that we strongly value our privacy, and we don’t want the government interfering in any way with our ability to make medical decisions,” said Nicole Smith, with Montanans for Choice.
Three years ago, millions of people in this country lost their right to access safe and timely abortion care, said Mary Sullivan, with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana.
“Your access to care shouldn’t depend on where you live, and that’s what we have to continue fighting for is everyone having access to essential care,” Sullivan said.

In 1999, the Montana Supreme Court opinion in Armstrong vs. State of Montana found the state Constitution protected abortion based on privacy, similar to the rationale in Roe.
Since then, the state Supreme Court has found numerous laws attempting to restrict abortion unconstitutional based on the privacy protections in the Armstrong case.
Despite those protections, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe, advocates for reproductive freedom in Montana collected signatures to place Constitutional Initiative 128 on the ballot last November, and voters approved the measure to specifically enshrine abortion protections in the state Constitution.
Earlier this month, the Montana Family Foundation announced it had sued the state of Montana over CI-128, alleging the state should have printed the entire amendment language on the ballot, and asking the amendment to be declared null and void.
The case is pending, even as the landscape for health care providers who offer abortion quietly, but significantly, shifts.
In 2024, the Montana Abortion Access Program served more clients and pledged more funding to help pay for abortions and travel than it did in its first 10 years combined, said executive director Erin Case.
The uptick started during the COVID-19 pandemic, grew after the Dobbs decision, and the need has continued to grow, she said, especially as people experience financial struggles.
“That increase has not stopped,” Case said.
Case said even though Montana is generally well served, with six clinics in the state that provide abortion care, including four operated by Planned Parenthood of Montana, access for patients in more rural areas can still be difficult.
Montana Abortion Access Program started in 2009, and it covers as little as $30 in travel support for a patient who needs to get to a clinic, she said. But in August 2024 and April 2025, the organization had record breaking demand, with 63 clients served each month.
In April, it pledged $24,549 toward the costs of abortion care and travel, the largest amount ever pledged in one month, Case said.
“The urgency for us is still there,” Case said. “There are still a lot of people accessing abortion care who need help.”
Since the Dobbs decision, women have died in the country from complications after abortion bans took effect, according to one of several reports released this week by Montanans for Choice. The report identified six documented cases whose families publicly shared stories.
It identified women in Texas and Georgia, citing reporting from The New Yorker and ProPublica. ProPublica said data is hard to come by, including because reviews are slow or even stalled.
In one case, a medical team failed to provide timely treatment for a miscarriage, and ​​the woman died of an infection in a case experts described as “horrific,” said the report from Montanans for Choice. It said one woman passing blood clots during a miscarriage bled to death in a fatality more than 12 experts found to be preventable.
Tess Fields, executive director of the Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula, said four months ago, a young woman from Idaho called the clinic for help because of the abortion ban in Idaho.

The woman was eight weeks pregnant and scheduled an appointment a couple of weeks out to arrange for time off work and the drive of seven hours, Fields said.
Then, she called the clinic again and reported cramping, bleeding and intense pain.
The woman refused the urging of Blue Mountain staff to go to the hospital, Fields said: “This person was absolutely terrified and said, ‘I can’t do that. I can’t tell them that I am scheduled to have an abortion in Montana. What if they arrest me?’”
The woman drove seven hours straight, in pain, bleeding and alone, to the Blue Mountain Clinic, and within 15 minutes of her arrival, providers learned she was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, Fields said.
The condition is potentially fatal, she said, and Blue Mountain transported her to a local hospital, where she received emergency surgery.
“It’s about saving lives,” Fields said. “This person was so scared … of accessing health care in her own state, that that was the situation that she was put in. And she could have died on the way here, driving alone.”
The Dobbs decision means Blue Mountain Clinic is hearing from more pregnant people who need help, and Fields said it is poised to raise $1 million this year in order to add staff, including a provider.
Fields said she’s proud of the history of the clinic, which opened nearly 50 years ago as the first in Montana and one of the first in the nation to provide abortion care. It provides the full range of family practice medicine — wellness exams, vaccines, chronic pain management, more.
“In our view, that (full range) includes abortion care,” Fields said.
She’s also proud that one of its founders, the late Judy Smith, was instrumental in the case that became Roe vs. Wade at the U.S. Supreme Court; that supporters rebuilt a reinforced clinic after an arsonist firebombed it in 1993; that some of the art on display in the new building is made of relics of the fire, such as an old phone, repurposed by clinic patients.
Sullivan, of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said after Dobbs, opponents of abortion made “incredibly hostile attempts” to restrict it, but that isn’t the most enduring outcome she’s witnessed.
“What has changed the most is how fired up people are about their reproductive rights and just how much people do not want the government interfering in these decisions for them and their families,” Sullivan said.
She said CI-128 was one example: “The signatures turned in were a state record for any ballot issue in the state.”
She said the 2025 Montana Legislature was also the first time since the 1990s that an anti-abortion bill was defeated on the Senate floor.
Although abortion remains legal in Montana, Smith, with Montanans for Choice, said people still don’t have full reproductive freedom here.
Montanans passed CI-128, to enshrine abortion rights into the state Constitution, and it may be disputed at the Montana Supreme Court, but Smith said it only reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade.
“We all know that Roe v. Wade was never enough,” Smith said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Montana allows for care up to fetal viability, typically 23 to 25 weeks, but she said so many people need care after viability, and those people have to leave the state.
Weems, with All Families Healthcare, said medication abortion needs to be protected as well. She said more than half of all abortions in the country take place by mail, and the number in Montana, a rural state, is the same or higher.
She said since Roe was overturned, maternal and fetal deaths have increased. She sees patients from Idaho too, and she said their fear is palpable.
“They are terrified to be pregnant because being pregnant in Idaho is dangerous,” Weems said.
The Dobbs decision also has had a chilling effect on obstetrics in general, she said. Fewer people are going into obstetrics training, she said, and fewer people will be trained in abortion in the future because they are being trained in states where abortion is banned.
“It will mean fewer providers (of abortion care),” Weems said.
Despite the bulwark the 1999 Armstrong case has provided to women seeking medical care, and the resounding 58% approval of CI-128, Smith and others said people who want to ensure reproductive freedom isn’t further eroded need to remain vigilant.
In particular, Smith said, legislation to grant “fetal personhood” criminalizes women for having a miscarriage or stillbirth, has been attempted in Montana, and it could be again, despite being out of alignment with the values of Montanans, she said.
Since the Dobbs decision, she said, the atrocities women have experienced in other states could happen in Montana without fighting to protect their rights.
“We will not tolerate it,” Smith said. “We will not stand it. Abortion bans are torture, and we have a long way to go to achieve true reproductive freedom in this state and in this country, and we believe pregnant people deserve care and support, not criminalization.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4680-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

Lawmakers on the state Senate Housing and Human Services Committee heard from housing stakeholders Tuesday about the state of Michigan’s rental landscape and legislation that aims to eliminate barriers to affordable housing.
Application fees can cost interested renters more than $100, and can be charged without any guarantee that a compatible unit will be available, eclipsing the actual cost of performing a credit and background check used to evaluate an application, Sen. Rosemary Bayer (D-Beverly Hills) told committee members.
And that’s just one of the inappropriately high fees landlords in Michigan are charging, Bayer said, outlining the changes sought under her bill, Senate Bill 372.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In addition to rental application fees being capped at $25, under Senate Bill 372, landlords would be barred from using a person’s credit score as a determining factor in denying a rental application
Landlords would have to inform tenants in writing before accepting a rental application what information will be accessed to screen the applicant’s eligibility and what findings could result in a denial of an application, under the legislation. If the landlord takes adverse action to a person’s application, the landlord would be required to give the applicant a copy of the screening report and provide an opportunity for the applicant to discuss the decision with the landlord.
Potential renters would have the opportunity to sue landlords for up to $1,000 of damages and other costs associated with bringing legal action if they violate provisions of the law.
Under Senate Bill 373, landlords would have to provide at least one rental payment option that would place an additional charge on tenants like an online payment fee or credit card convenience fee.
Unforeseen fees charged by landlords on top of rapidly increasing rents are preventing Michiganders from accessing safe and affordable housing options, Eric Hufnagel, executive director of Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness told lawmakers.
Namely, “junk fees” or hidden predatory fees are of growing concern in Michigan, Hufnagel said. “Junk fees” are often arbitrary and unpredictable, with landlords erroneously charging tenants additional fees for maintenance requests or “convenience fees” for paying rent online, even if that is the only option the landlord offers to make payments.
Senate Bill 375, also being considered by the committee, would bar landlords from charging fees that are “not reasonable” or that would add additional costs to what is already covered under a rental agreement, like a fee for garbage removal that is greater than the cost the landlord incurs for garbage removal.
“Renters deserve predictable fair housing costs that are transparent,” Hufnagel said. “As housing affordability continues to be a pressing issue in Michigan with rents rising, as of January 2025 the statewide average of rent has increased by 7.2%,… this legislation reflects a broader push to protect tenants’ rights and to promote equitable housing practices.”
Michigan was one of 21 states in 2023 where more than half of renters spent 30% or more of their income on housing, which according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development classifies them as “cost burdened” and susceptible to struggling to pay for other essentials like medical care and food.
Finding affordable housing that is safe is already hard enough without a past eviction haunting a person’s rental history, Bayer told committee members. Having an eviction or even legal record that eviction proceedings were held, regardless of outcome, can ruin a person’s ability to secure housing, she said.
The ‘scarlet ‘E’ of eviction” is a black mark on a person’s record that can prevent a person from making it through a rental screening process, regardless if the tenant committed any wrongdoing to warrant an eviction process to commence, Housing Law Attorney for the Michigan Poverty Law Program Jim Schaafsma told the committee.
Senate Bill 374 would outline a process to get excision records sealed and expunged under certain circumstances including if the person who was the subject of the eviction fulfilled the terms of the earlier judgement.
Job loss can happen to anyone, even two income households, Bayer said, and the destruction an eviction has on a person’s record is too extreme to not allow for there to be opportunities for a person to rebuild their life.
“Eviction, as we know, is one of the most traumatic things that can happen to any person or family. It can really cause them to spiral down all the way to homelessness, even when the circumstances surrounding the eviction were no fault of their own,” Bayer said.

Many potential initiatives have been tried and have failed to close the achievement gap between lower-income students and students of color with their white and more well-off peers. That makes a proven, research-backed program like debate a rare thing in education.
The post An argument for how to engage students and narrow achievement gaps: Let them debate[...]","MASSACHUSETTS HAS LONG been a leader in K-12 education, yet it has struggled to close the longstanding achievement gap between lower-income students and students of color and their white and more affluent peers. The pandemic only made things worse, as Massachusetts saw the largest widening of that gap of any state studied by researchers at the Center for Education Research Policy at Harvard and the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford. 
Effective approaches that can close persistent achievement gaps have been elusive. Yet a proven strategy to do just that exists in our backyard. What’s more, it’s one that excites and energizes young people while helping them develop skills that are crucial to success in high school and beyond. 
Debate team competition has typically been an activity more associated with students in well-off suburbs. But more than 700 students across 40 schools in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Chelsea, Everett, and Malden participate in afterschool policy debate, where they showcase their skills at advancing an argument in competition against other teams. And there is now evidence that taking part in policy debate is not just an engaging extracurricular activity, but can help boost academic achievement among students from historically-underserved backgrounds and put them on a college-bound trajectory.   
A 2023 study, conducted by Beth Schueler from the University of Virginia and Katherine Larned from Harvard University, looked at the impact of participation in the Boston Debate League, a 20-year-old nonprofit, among Boston Public Schools students from 2008 to 2017. The researchers analyzed data from 3,515 student debaters and a control group of comparable BPS students who did not take part in debate. The study found a statistically significant correlation between student participation in BDL’s debate program and gains in English language arts achievement on MCAS as well as increases in the likelihood that students graduate from high school and enroll in post-secondary education.  
BDL debaters perform significantly better than their peers, in particular, on the set of English language arts MCAS questions that require critical thinking and analysis, gaining the equivalent of an additional two-thirds of a full year of average 9th grade learning. Ninth-grade debaters who started in the lowest performing English language arts quartile of the MCAS made the biggest gains. The study’s authors wrote that “policy debate represents a rare program with high potential to help reduce educational inequality on literacy and critical thinking skills among secondary school students.”  
The Boston Debate League, founded in 2005 and part of a network of urban debate leagues across the country, was established to make policy debate accessible to students who wouldn’t typically have opportunity to take part in such an activity: Black and brown students, students from lower-income communities, students who may speak English as a second language, and those who may be immigrants or may have an individualized educational plan. 
Through this activity, students at all levels can dive into rigorous text, work collaboratively with classmates and educators, and think critically about real world problems.  
In debate competitions, upwards of 250 young people pack into a conference-style room on a college campus or a high school cafeteria on a Friday afternoon or Saturday morning, ready to compete in a tournament. The room is buzzing as they go over last-minute notes with their coaches and teammates, perfecting their arguments for the day’s debate rounds.  
The energy is similar to that of the first big game of the season. Each tournament is the culmination of weekly afterschool debate practices where students hone their arguments, explore both the affirmative and negative sides of an argument — because they must be prepared to argue both — research their points, and find evidence to back up their claims. 
But debate isn’t limited to the podium. The same buzz of energy is present in area classrooms where educators use innovative debate-inspired practices to encourage students to build their argumentation skills and think critically.  
Through this instructional approach, students learn how to consider multiple perspectives, analyze and question evidence, consider sources and their credibility, and prepare an argument. The Boston Debate League works with nearly 250 educators each year, coaching them on how to engage about 3,000 students annually with debate-inspired practices. 
Whether it’s an English, science, history or math class, this debate-inspired approach allows students to feel empowered to express their viewpoint, backed up by evidence from the text, or to explain the reasoning behind their approach to solving a problem. This is critical thinking in action – the very skill many people say we need to do more to foster to prepare students for college and career success.  
Many potential initiatives have been tried and have failed to close the achievement gap between lower-income students and students of color with their white and more well-off peers. That makes a proven, research-backed program like debate a rare thing in education.  
The students shown by the recent study to make big strides linked to debate participation are the same ones the state is struggling to bring up to speed. Making it even more powerful is the study finding that debate participation is not just linked to a narrowing of the achievement gap but to higher rates of high school completion and post-secondary enrollment. 
Whether it is a policy debate class, an afterschool debate team, or professional development to help educators integrate debate-inspired practices into their teaching, debate-related activities shouldn’t be limited to districts that can afford the investment. They should be accessible to every student and teacher across the state.  
Debate programs like the Boston Debate League largely depend on philanthropy, while also receiving some money in fees paid by participating schools and districts and some funding through a state budget line item. The Legislature should prioritize making more funding available to less well-resourced school districts to incorporate policy debate and debate-inspired practices into their curriculum. The state should also direct funding to schools of education at public higher education institutions to incorporate debate-inspired teaching practices and training into their educator training programs for new educators. 
Scaling effective education strategies is always a challenge, but bringing debate to the much larger population of Massachusetts students and teachers who would benefit from its impact will require more public resources. 
Massachusetts recently made a big commitment of new educational funding when it launched an initiative providing free community college for all residents. Making a far more modest investment in debate programs — now backed by research showing their impact on educational outcomes among groups of students who have struggled the most — should be a winning argument.   
Jackney Joseph is managing director of external affairs at the Boston Debate League. She was a fellow with the Civic Action Project, a Massachusetts nonprofit focused on training the next generation of civic leaders, and took part in CommonWealth Beacon’s New Voices training program on effective op-ed writing, a partnership with the Civic Action Project and the Institute for Nonprofit Practice.

(Provided by the Bitterroot National Forest and Inciweb)An executive order signed earlier this month by President Donald Trump would look to “consolidate” five federal wildland fire agencies into one.
The U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs and National Park Service all have departments that fight fires on their land.
Two federal departments oversee the effort — the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. Trump directed them to consolidate their efforts within 90 days of the June 12 order. The Federal Wildland Fire Service would be under control of the U.S. Department of the Interior, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfire season is already underway across North America, with large fires burning in Canada and Alaska. Washington and Oregon have also begun to see fire seasons pick up, too. In Montana, several fires have flared, but only one has reached 2,000 acres in size this year so far.
U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, a Montana Republican, introduced legislation in February to combine wildland fire agencies in a bipartisan effort with U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat. 
“For too long, layers of senseless bureaucracy and red tape have splintered our wildfire management system, failed our brave firefighters on the ground, and let entire communities be wiped off the map by wildfire,” Sheehy said in a statement on Feb. 6. “The time is now to reshape our approach to American wildfire management and start fighting fires better, stronger, and faster.”
Sheehy, who helped found an aerial firefighting company, has been a force on legislation surrounding wildland firefighting as a freshman senator. He’s been a sponsor or cosponsor on 15 firefighting bills, including one that was recently signed by Trump that reauthorizes the sale of Department of Defense parts to repair the nation’s firefighting fleet.
Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment. However, Sheehy’s office did issue a statement thanking the president for taking action on wildfires as his repair bill was signed.
Trump’s order also cast some blame on local fire agencies, saying they “continue to disregard commonsense preventative measures.” It added that many firefighters across the country were relying on outdated equipment and were slow to respond because of “unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy.”
A fact-sheet for the order also identified how the federal government wants to modernize firefighting. It also seeks to declassify historical satellite data to help improve wildfire prediction.
“The order directs the use of available technology, including AI, data sharing, innovative mapping, and weather forecasting, to enhance state and local wildfire identification and response capabilities,” the fact-sheet said. 
According to the U.S. Forest Service, about 98% of wildfires are suppressed before they reach 100 acres. The other 2% are large and often dangerous, which Andy Stahl, the director of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, describes as acts of nature in line with a hurricane or earthquake.
Large fires weren’t ever going to be stopped, and wildland fire agencies have little room to improve, according to Stahl, who also took issue with Trump’s usage of the 2025 Los Angeles fires as the “purpose” of the order.
Those fires were driven by structures burning, adding to the intensity and scope of the inferno. A total of 16,251 homes, commercial properties, and other structures burned during those fires, according to research by UCLA.
Furthermore, Stahl noted, wildfires can’t really be fought effectively in high winds — fire breaks can quickly be jumped by embers and spot fires can turn into larger blazes. Extreme fire behavior is driven by low relative humidity, strong surface wind, unstable air, and drought, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, a government agency. None of those things can be changed by firefighters.
“The executive order is mostly political posturing for the MAGA crowd, for the firefighters, you know, and, it’s just bizarre, and it won’t change anything,” Stahl told the Daily Montanan. “Nothing in this executive order is going to move that 98% needle.”
There were 64,897 wildfires reported in 2024 according to the National Interagency Fire Center and they burned almost 9 million acres. Additionally, nearly 4,500 structures were lost to wildfires last year. In 2023, the country spent more than $3.1 billion on wildfires, which is the most recent cost estimate available.
The five-year annual average suppression cost is nearly $3 billion. As a source of comparison, the country spent more than a billion dollars on suppression just once between 1985 and 2001, though those numbers are not adjusted for inflation.
The Forest Service, which did not respond to a request for comment, covers 193 million acres of land, while the Bureau of Land Management manages 245 million acres.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Land that Sioux Falls economic development boosters had once hoped to see anchored by a $500 million slaughterhouse is now on offer as a men’s prison site.
Also a prison site option, as of Tuesday: a hundred-plus acres of ranch land just east of Box Elder, the growing city near Ellsworth Air Force Base.
Letters offering up the Pennington County ranchland and the land near what would have been Wholestone Foods in Sioux Falls were posted on Tuesday on the Project Prison Reset task force’s website. Gov. Larry Rhoden formed the group in February to study options to address the state’s swelling correctional population after lawmakers said no to the 1,500-bed, $850 million prison the governor wanted to build in southern Lincoln County.
Prison group stuck between local opposition and limited space

The task force has since rejected that Lincoln County site as an option, in spite of the state having spent about $50 million on it so far, capped the price of a new prison at $600 million, and asked Rhoden to push back the date of the planned special session of the Legislature next month at which lawmakers would be asked to sign off on a final prison plan. Rhoden agreed to the delay. 
Until Tuesday, the task force’s two remaining property options for a new prison that don’t involve land already owned by the Department of Corrections were outside of Worthing and Mitchell, respectively. Citizens and some community leaders in both cities have rallied against prison construction, however.
The task force winnowed down the options to Worthing, Mitchell and existing DOC properties in Sioux Falls and Springfield from a list of more than a dozen submissions, each sent in response to a request for information a few months ago.
The state wants at least 100 acres of land for a prison, ideally within 20 miles of its existing penitentiary workforce in Sioux Falls.
Unbuilt slaughterhouse, ranch added to options list
Tuesday’s two late-arriving options came from opposite ends of the state.
Sweetman Partners of Sioux Falls sent a letter to the task force on Tuesday to inform the group that if the state wants it, the company would be happy to negotiate a sale of 137 acres of its eastern Sioux Falls property off Interstate 229.
The land is just south of what would have been a 1,000-employee hog operation. Wholestone, part of the Iowa-based, producer-owned Pipestone Cooperative, had recently aimed to open what would have been one of the largest swine butchering operations in South Dakota in that industrial park, and the company still owns the land.


 Locations of the potential prison locations that remain in play, plus the location of the original rural Lincoln County site that’s been ruled out.
Sioux Falls voted down an effort to ban new slaughterhouses in the city on the 2022 ballot, but the project nonetheless fizzled. By mid-2023, Wholestone had partnered with an Iowa company to meet its production needs. 
Today, Sweetman Partners is in the process of selling off smaller hunks of the property just to the south of the Wholestone land. Sweetman’s managing partner said in his Tuesday letter to the Project Prison Reset task force that he’d be “willing to sell it all to the State of South Dakota.”
“If you are interested and would like to  enter into negotiations, please let me know,” Thomas Sweetman wrote.
Sweetman told South Dakota Searchlight he got a call near the end of May from someone – he couldn’t recall who – asking him if he’d sell the land to the state for a prison. He said yes, and was told to write a letter to the lieutenant governor saying as much.

Lt. Gov. Tony Venuhizen, who leads the prison task force, emailed a copy of the resulting Sweetman letter to his fellow task force members on Tuesday. He also forwarded along the pitch from the economic development coordinator for the city of Box Elder. Both letters were posted to the Project Prison Reset task force website.
The Box Elder letter touts just under 105 acres of land owned by Gikling Ranch LLC as a workable prison option. The city of Box Elder would service the site for water and utilities, the document says, and the state could take advantage of the area’s large and growing workforce. 
Box Elder has grown rapidly in recent years to meet the Air Force’s anticipated needs as it expands the base to host B-21 bombers. 
“The city offers a pro-growth climate, excellent access to training and education resources, and a collaborative approach to public-private partnerships,” the letter from Box Elder’s Sean Overeynder wrote.
Any sale of the land, he said, “is subject to appropriate due diligence and additional discussion with the City of Box Elder,” and final approval would need to come from the city council.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The Trump administration is planning to make it easier for employers to hire temporary migrant workers, U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told attendees Tuesday afternoon at the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in Santa Fe.
Chavez-DeRemer said due to the backlog of temporary work visa applications, she is establishing “an emergency agency” within her office to process the work permits “on the spot.”
The move comes as the administration resumes immigration raids at farms, restaurants and hotels, despite having previously said those would decrease due to concerns about worker shortages.
Chavez-DeRemer said she will be working with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the Department of Agriculture “to understand the exact needs,” because as it stands, a work visa application must go through all three agencies.
“That’s where the hangup happened,” she said. “We’re going to do one dedicated, one-stop shop as I call it … and have a live dashboard to see exactly when those permits will be done.”
Chavez-DeRemer said she is often asked if visa applications can be done more quickly and cost less.
“Labor costs are always the highest in any business, and our farmers and ranchers know that food security is national security,” Chavez-DeRemer said.
Chavez-DeRemer told the governors the work visas for specialty occupations; temporary agricultural workers and temporary workers in industries like hospitality, landscaping or construction “are very important to a lot of your respective states and our rural communities.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat and the association’s outgoing chair, said the temporary work visas are critical to the agriculture sector. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said most western U.S. states have significant agriculture industries that rely on migrant workers.
“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” Cox said. “None of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Cox expressed approval of Trump’s immigration agenda so far and asked Chavez-DeRemer for more information about changes to the visa system.
“I think we’ve all agreed that we need to stop illegal immigration and fix legal immigration, and get that piece right, and this sounds like a huge step forward in fixing that second piece,” Cox said. “I appreciate that the president is fixing the first piece — and we feel much better about where we are there — but that second piece of streamlining those visas, getting workers in here and doing that could be very key.”
The Department of Labor on Friday stopped enforcing a Biden-era rule that protected union organizing activities among temporary farmworkers. Chavez-DeRemer said the rule harmed farm employers and made it harder for them to hire people.
Chavez-DeRemer said the work visa changes will “come across fairly rapidly.”
“They want a solution, and they wanted it yesterday, and now we’re finally going to lean in,” she said.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican, said the law around H2A visas, which permit people to do temporary or seasonal agricultural work, hasn’t changed since he was elected in 2018.
“There’s not been a single law passed but it’s a lot harder to get an H2A worker in 2024 than it was in 2018,” Armstrong said.
Later, Chavez-DeRemer said her department will work with Congress “on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Several governors of Western states on Tuesday endorsed formalizing a partnership to help each other deal with the aftermath of increasingly devastating wildfires, citing the long-term effects of post-fire flooding and also uncertainty about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s future. 
Governors from New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado attended a panel discussion on the topic of post-fire flooding at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe. The governors questioned experts — including state emergency response officials and a government landslide scientist — at a discussion called “Flood After Fire – Enhancing Safety in Post-Fire Landscapes.”
The governors described the phenomenon as increasingly urgent due to wildfires burning hotter and larger across the West. High-severity wildfires can change soil composition, converting even modest rainstorms that fall on burn scars into potential floods or debris flows. 
In New Mexico, for example, post-fire flooding has impeded the recovery from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, both for the City of Las Vegas as it tries to rebuild its water treatment facility and for smaller communities in and around the 534-square-mile burn scar. Other Western governors, including Spencer Cox of Utah, said they’re increasingly concerned about flooding after fires. That was the case when Cox came across the aftermath of a fire that burned this week. 
Las Vegas to get $98 million to replace water treatment facilities after 2022 wildfire damage

“The first thing I thought when I drove into that community had nothing to do with the fire or the homes burned,” he said. “What I realized was, for the next five or six years, things are going to be pretty awful for those people because of the mudslides and the runoff, the sediment that comes down.”
The conversation occurred as at least six wildfires burn across New Mexico, and as burn scar areas in northern and southern New Mexico experience severe flooding or are warned to be on high-alert for it.
While no FEMA official sat on the panel, the agency’s past performance with post-fire flooding and its future loomed over the meeting. Participants mentioned the agency’s name more than 10 times, and speakers noted the challenges they’d face if the agency is dismantled, as called for briefly by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
While New Mexico’s United States Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján say the agency should still exist, they recently called on FEMA to change the way it deals with post-fire flooding. The agency has “repeatedly struggled to respond effectively” to second-order effects from wildfires, including “cascading disasters such as landslides, flooding and water system failures that compound damage and slow recovery,” the senators wrote.
NM’s U.S. senators to Noem: Reform FEMA. Don’t scrap it entirely.

Collin Haffey, a Washington post-fire recovery leader who worked for New Mexico Forestry Division during the 2022 wildfires here, spoke on the panel and said there’s a “tremendous amount of uncertainty” about the federal government’s role in wildfire recovery going forward.
“If I’m trying to build my portion of the railroad track to meet them, I don’t know how far to go,” he said. “And I think that that lack of communication down to the local level is putting lives and recovery at risk.”
So he called on the WGA to create a formal agreement between Western states, one that could help states help each other deal with the aftermath of devastating wildfires amid uncertainty about what type of aid could come from the federal government.
“We have these peer-to-peer networks because I have their cell phone numbers,” Haffey said. “But that’s not necessarily the best.”
In response, Cox, who on Tuesday was named the new WGA chair, said he would spearhead an effort to create a regional partnership. 
“Even if we weren’t, you know, seeing FEMA reform and changes happening there, we should have been doing this anyway,” he said. “And so let’s do it anyway.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9972-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 20:05:19.467533

Reversal of Clinton-era rule opens up roadbuilding and commercial logging on tens of millions of acres nationally that have been managed with a high level of environmental protection for the past quarter century.
The post Trump’s ag boss is cutting 3.3M ‘roadless’ acres from 9 national forests in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration is ending an environmental protection policy that opens up nearly 59 million acres of federal land in the United States — a Wyoming-sized expanse — to roadbuilding and timber harvest.
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday she was rescinding the heavily litigated 2001 Roadless Rule. The pronouncement came while state executives met in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for the Western Governors’ Association conference.
“Time and again, this Clinton-era policy has proven faulty and misguided,” Rollins said in her keynote address to Gov. Mark Gordon and others. “That’s why I’m excited to announce today, here with you for the first time, our intent to repeal the disastrous roadless rule.”

The rescission was another “aggressive” move, the native Texan told the governors, to help achieve President Donald Trump’s agenda of increasing American logging. In the last six months, the administration has both initiated an executive order and a more-specific secretarial order intended to stimulate commercial federal timber harvesting — though the industry faces major headwinds that may prove insurmountable, including in parts of Wyoming.
Rollins’ repeal will directly affect the administrative status of 3.26 million acres of inventoried roadless area in Wyoming. 
Impacted forestland within the state ranges from a few small tracts of roadless area bordering Flaming Gorge Reservoir on the Ashley National Forest to 1.43 million acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest that’s adjoining towns like Alpine, Star Valley Ranch, Jackson and Pinedale and treading far into the backcountry. 
Some 3.3 million acres of nine national forests have been classified as roadless areas for the past 24 years. (U.S. Forest Service)

Some members of those communities are eager for the change. 
The week before Rollins’ announcement, the Wyoming Legislature’s Select Federal Natural Resource Management Committee met in Pinedale and discussed roadless areas. 
“If there’s a prime target, where you can actually access some of the stuff in roadless [areas], it’s probably the Greys River,” Lincoln County Commissioner Kent Connelly told the state lawmakers. 
The lack of logging in the roadless-designated Salt River and Wyoming ranges, he said, puts Star Valley communities at risk from wildfire. 
“Alpine is totally in trouble if we catch the Greys River on fire,” Connelly said. “There’s no way to defend it. Or Star Valley Ranch. That’s all there is to it. You’re going to have to watch it burn.” 
Nearly 40% of the 3.6-million-acre Bridger-Teton National Forest has been managed as a roadless area, marked in brown in this map, for the past quarter century. The designation is going away under the second Trump administration. (U.S. Forest Service)

Nationally, nearly half of all inventoried roadless areas — some 28 million acres — are considered high or very high risk for wildfire, Rollins said. Since Clinton imposed the rule in 2001, more than 8 million acres of roadless areas have burned, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a statement supporting the rescission. 
Roadless areas in Wyoming and beyond have their benefits, especially ecologically. Even adaptable species like elk eschew roaded habitat, research has found, and wilderness-like roadless regions on the landscape can prove surprisingly rare. 
The end of the roadless rule delivers a “major blow” to the state’s values, Wyoming Wilderness Association staffer Peggie dePasquale told WyoFile in an emailed statement.
“The Roadless Rule has been a keystone in maintaining beloved wild landscapes across Wyoming for almost 25 years,” dePasquale said. “Clean water, clean air, healthy wildlife populations and opportunity to escape into pristine landscapes that aren’t crisscrossed by roads, are all characteristics that define Wyoming, and are all characteristics we stand to lose with the rescission of this long standing and critical rule.”

Hook-and-bullet advocacy groups have also come out in opposition to Rollins’ roadless rule rescission. National forests already have twice as many miles of roads as the entire U.S. National Highway System, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers lobbyist Kaden McArthur wrote in an emailed statement. 
“Repealing the Roadless Rule isn’t about improving forest management—it’s about expanding a development network that threatens intact landscapes hunters, anglers, and wildlife can’t afford to lose,” McArthur wrote.
In early June, U.S. Rep. Andrea Salinas, an Oregon Democrat, reintroduced the Roadless Area Conservation Act, legislation that sought to codify inventoried roadless areas in the National Forest System so that they could only be rescinded by an act of Congress. 
Observers had been anticipating changes to the roadless areas. 
“It’s a Forest Service rule, and the Forest Service can take a look at changing their rules,” Wyoming State Forester Kelly Norris told members of the Wyoming Legislature’s Federal Natural Resource Management Committee last week. 
Elimination of roadless areas in Wyoming will clear up some inconsistencies in the books, according to Norris. Several national forests located inside the Equality State operate under plans that predate the 2001 Roadless Rule, including the Bridger-Teton, Bighorn and Medicine Bow-Routt. As a result, their guiding land-use plans are at odds with roadless areas that were layered on top, she said.
“There are over 300 miles of roads in roadless [areas] in the Bighorn National Forest,” Norris told WyoFile. “There’s been talk of doing corrections for years.”

The settlement would give Dawn Bishop McLin her job back as a tenured professor. 
McLin’s case is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the state’s college governing board and the historically Black university. Two others have cited gender discrimination when it comes to the board’s presidential search and its selection process. 
The proposed agreement, which is still being hammered out by attorneys, would return McLin to her position as psychology professor. It would also restore the roughly $38,000 in research grants she lost after her termination, as well as $10,000 in pay for summer school courses she would have taught this semester, all totaling $48,000. 
IHL attorney Pope Mallette also requested a motion for the settlement agreement to be closed to the public, which prompted U.S. District Judge  Henry Wingate to question the move by the taxpayer-funded governing board. 
“The court does not seal public money,” Wingate said in response to Mallette’s request. 
The parties spent much of the morning in separate rooms discussing the settlement and hashing out attorney fees. 
Last year a faculty panel reviewed the university’s basis for McLin’s termination and recommended she be reinstated to her job “as a tenured faculty member fully restored,” the original court filing states. 
The exact circumstances of her termination weren’t released, but members of the faculty senate executive committee have said McLin was apparently placed on leave without any written warning and accused of harassment, malfeasance and “contumacious conduct,” a term stemming from IHL policies that means insubordination. 
Marcus Thompson, who has since resigned as Jackson State University president, did not respond to the panel’s recommendation, putting McLin in a state of limbo, ultimately forcing her to resign. 
McLin, who was elected as JSU’s faculty senate president in 2020, received support from the American Association of University Professors, a national organization that backs academic freedom, and fellow colleagues following her termination. Thompson ignored multiple letters from the professional organization.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24093257/3X0A5054.jpg,,,2025-06-24 19:07:33.878042

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)It’s halfway done.
The Maryland State Board of Education unanimously approved a memorandum of understanding Tuesday with the Blueprint Accountability and Implementation Board on their respective roles and responsibilities when it comes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
The AIB, scheduled to meet Thursday, must also approve the memo.
The memo comes after more than three years into the implementation of the sweeping 10-year Blueprint implementation. It aims to streamline the process and eliminate constant frustration from local school systems due to the lack of clarity and final guidance by responding to both agencies.
The memo calls for the two boards to meet at least quarterly “to discuss progress, challenges, and strategies related to Blueprint implementation.” Their last joint meeting was Jan. 28. It also calls on the Blueprint board to share recommendations and evaluations with the Board of Education and for both agencies to “maintain open communication channels.”
The seven-member AIB board and its staff oversee the 10-year plan, while the state board approves any Blueprint documents submitted by the state’s 24 school systems, and other state agencies that craft elements of the Blueprint.
The Blueprint law also requires the state Department of Education to provide technical assistance and lend expertise on education policy.
State Superintendent Carey Wright acknowledged there has been “some confusion” from local school leaders, parents and other stakeholders on who was in charge and who to talk to about certain parts of the Blueprint implementation.
“I think what we’ve landed on is a good place to start,” Wright said Tuesday. “This is much clearer and more carefully defined in terms of who owns what, where the Blueprint is concerned.”

A color-coded chart highlights the roles and responsibilities based on the five Blueprint pillars, or priorities: early childhood education, high quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness, more resources for students in need and governance and accountability.
Most of the roles are already being followed, per state law, such as the AIB taking the lead to ensure all 24 school systems offer starting teacher pay of $60,000 a year by July 1, 2026. The state board will continue to seek ways to improve educator pay.
In terms of early childhood education, the state board will continue seeking ways to expand full-day prekindergarten, assess student readiness for kindergarteners and expand pre-K services in public schools and child care providers as part of the “mixed-delivery system.”
The AIB will examine the racial, ethnic, disability-status and income makeup of full-day pre-K students and assess whether the mix of public and private prekindergarten providers “is effectively meeting the needs of families.”
The state board will lead on a few other Blueprint responsibilities, with the AIB consulting, such as establishing high school curricula, contracting with a public or private entity for a college and career readiness study and implementing a financial management and student data system.
Board member Nick Greer, who attended the meeting virtually, asked why the AIB will lead in monitoring and reviewing the performance of teacher preparation programs, rather than doing that jointly with the department. Alex Reese, chief of staff with the department, said that’s based on state law, but that “there’s nothing preventing us from picking up the phone and touching base [with the AIB] and then connecting on various pieces of the work.”
Paul Lemle, president of the Maryland State Educators Association, said he hopes having an agreement between the state board and AIB makes the Blueprint implementation run smoother.
“It’s really the goal of the Blueprint that our schools are better. So, if the process is a problem, we want to fix that,” he said in a brief interview during a break in the meeting. “We hope this kind of confusion is going to be resolved.”

Recent testing has confirmed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furans in fish at levels that are unsafe for consumption by tribal peoples, according to a press release sent Tuesday.
“This is a precaution rooted in science and our responsibility to protect tribal health and well-being. We urge our people to stay informed and make safe choices,” said Tom McDonald, CSKT Council Vice-Chairman.
CSKT officials also advise members to avoid consuming rainbow trout and northern pike harvested from the Bitterroot River and the upper Clark Fork River above the Bitterroot River to Rock Creek, and, to avoid consuming rainbow trout from the Blackfoot River.
The press release said that PCBs, dioxins, and furans build up in fish tissue over time through water, sediment and the aquatic food web. These contaminants pose a health risk to all fish consumers, and an even greater health risk to the most sensitive members of the tribal population including women of child bearing age, pregnant nursing women, and young children. 
These contaminants have been linked to negative health effects in the immune, and nervous systems and may be associated with birth defects. Dietary exposure to PCBs is linked to development problems in children whose mothers were exposed to PCBs before becoming pregnant. PCBs and dioxins are classified as probable and definite human carcinogens, respectively. Dietary practices are the most important source of exposure to PCBs, dioxins and furans.
CSKT is aware that avoiding the consumption of fish from these waterbodies reduces opportunities for tribal members exercising off-reservation fishing rights. The tribes will continue to work to maintain the rivers and fisheries within CSKT aboriginal territory where they are healthy, and restore the rivers and fisheries where they are harmed.
This advisory is indefinite and will remain in place until further notice.

An Indiana-based gardening retailer has submitted a $9 million bid to purchase Gardener’s Supply Company, a popular employee-owned Vermont business that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday. 
Gardens Alive, Inc., is currently the sole bidder ahead of a potential auction on July 18, according to court documents. The auction will only take place if additional bidders emerge. 
Gardener’s Supply, known for its wide range of quality gardening products, disclosed in its bankruptcy filing last week that it owes more than $4.5 million to 30 creditors, including two international companies and four based in Vermont. These debts, which are not backed by collateral, have left some small suppliers questioning whether they will ever recoup the money they’re owed. 
Among them is River Berry Farm in Fairfax that sold Gardener’s Supply vegetable and herb transplants this season. Co-owner David Marchant said the bankruptcy came as a surprise — and with it, a financial blow. Gardener’s Supply owes the farm about $64,000, or about 10% of the business’s gross profit for the year, he said.
“It’s a significant hit. It’s not gonna put us out of business, but it’s gonna certainly drastically change the outcome of the year for us and our employees,” he said. 
“I know the buyer who’s bought from us real well and I wish we had gotten hints earlier,” Marchant added. “It’s too bad they didn’t let everybody know that they were in trouble.”Hannah Decker, co-owner of Fairfax Perennial Farm Inc., which has done business with Gardener’s Supply for 17 years and sells to four of its locations, is “cautiously optimistic” she will receive the $50,000 she is owed, which she estimates is almost a quarter of the farm’s yearly business.

“The timing of this really sucks …  June is for perennials,” she said. “If I don’t have their business going forward with those locations, that’s a quarter of my business right there.”Gardener’s Supply, founded in 1983, has long been considered a staple Vermont brand. Its employee-ownership model and 20-year streak winning Seven Days’ “Best garden center award” have made it a fixture in the state’s business community.
But in recent years, the company struggled to recover from what it described as the “post-COVID downturn in business,” according to a statement from a company spokesperson. Rising shipping costs, increased competition, tariffs and steep marketing costs were cited as contributing factors.
The company has “partnered with external professionals to strategically restructure its operations,” the spokesperson wrote. “… As a result, AGR [America’s Gardening Resource] has made the decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a planned move to facilitate a transaction with a potential buyer.” 
Gardener’s Supply is being represented in the filing by Patrick J. Reilly, who previously represented Tupperware in its bankruptcy filing and subsequent sale. The bankruptcy announcement was first reported by WCAX. 
Julie Elmore, a customer who has been shopping at Gardener’s Supply since it opened, said she has valued the company’s dependability.
“They’ve really got an excellent reputation. I know people all over that love to order stuff from Gardener’s Supply cause they have good quality, they have good return policies. … I really respect companies that take care of their workers and that have employees who have ownership in it,” she said.
Morgan Brown, a manager at Gardener’s Williston location, said news of the bankruptcy was sad but that employees were sticking together.
“I would say this is the most Vermont place I’ve ever worked,” she said. “Everybody’s kind of taking [the bankruptcy] together. We’re a community business, everybody knows each other. We’re all very close, so we’re kind of just leaning on our coworkers to make everything, to keep going, we’re business as usual and we’re happy to be here,” she said.

Congress first enacted the U.S Forest Service’s “Secure Rural Schools and Self-Determination Program,” in 2000 to help fund counties comprising large swaths of public, tax-exempt forest land that previously received revenue from timber sales. The program expired in 2023, and a measure to extend the program did not pass muster in the House of Representatives late last year during budget negotiations.
But the newest bill passed unanimously by the Senate on June 18, extends the funding program through 2026.
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, both Republicans introduced the bill along with a bipartisan group of senators mostly from western states in February.
“Many of our rural counties rely on the SRS Program to support schools, road maintenance, and more. I’m glad to see my bipartisan bill to reauthorize SRS pass the Senate, and I’ll always fight to support education programs and critical infrastructure projects in our rural communities,” Daines said in a press release.
The SRS funding formula is based on economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary by county. The payments go toward rural schools, road maintenance and other programs that serve the counties.
In Montana, 32 counties received $16 million in 2023, according to U.S. Forest Service data.
Counties in the northwest part of the state received the most money with Lincoln County receiving $4 million, Sanders receiving $1.6 million and Flathead earning $1.2 million.
The bill now heads to the House for consideration.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3376-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 19:07:33.878042

The Nebraska delegation once again emphasized that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon, as Trump — as well the delegation — touted the U.S. strikes as a success, because Iran’s nuclear sites are “completely and fully obliterated.” The Trump administration has confirmed the existence of a classified U.S. report saying that Iran’s nuclear program was set back only a few months by the bombings and missile strikes, and called the assessment that was shared first in a CNN report “flat-out wrong.”

When asked about the leak, Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, had a simple statement: “Iran can never get a nuclear weapon.” 
Congressional briefings on the strikes were postponed on Tuesday. National Democrats and some Republicans have questioned Trump’s authority to take military action without congressional approval. Others have questioned the success of the strikes. 
“There’s zero evidence that I’ve seen that the nuclear program was completely and totally obliterated as Donald Trump has claimed,” U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a news conference Monday in Washington. 
Jeffries strongly opposed Trump joining the war between Iran and Israel without first securing the support of Congress. But he sidestepped questions about whether the decision was an impeachable offense or whether he would support a bipartisan resolution to limit the president’s power for additional military action against Iran.

House Speaker Mike Johnson argued Tuesday that the War Powers Act, the 1973 federal law requiring congressional authority to wage war, is unconstitutional. He said the Iran-specific proposal would fail in the House.
Bacon said that additional U.S. actions might be needed if the strikes were ineffective. 
“I don’t think [Trump] wants to do this again unless there’s evidence that these strikes were not effective,” Bacon told reporters in a Wednesday press call. “Then maybe you’ll have to reconsider.”
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb, said after the strikes that Trump ‘took the necessary steps to keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran’s reach.” Fischer also released a statement that Iran must end its nuclear enrichment program and return to the negotiating table. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts said the strikes “mean Iran is further from possessing a nuclear weapon.” Republican U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd District, said Trump “acted decisively.”

GOP U.S. Rep Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, said the strikes  “will not only help keep America safe but can provide peace and stability around the world.” Flood later told the ABC Affiliate KETV that ‘strikes needed to happen.’
After Iran’s choreographed attack on an American-operated air base in Qatar, seen by some as an off-ramp to the current ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Earlier this month, Israel launched an attack on Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, with aerial attacks on Tehran targeting its nuclear and military infrastructure. 
While the delegation members said they hadn’t yet been briefed, they are following Trump’s lead on messaging about the conflict. The delegation had already hinted that they planned to support whatever Trump did. 
Congressional briefings are scheduled for later this week.

Brett Guthrie of Bowling Green.
Guthrie had used his clout as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to protect a Medicaid funding stream that Kentucky hospitals say is critical to their survival.

That funding stream now is at risk in the U.S. Senate, which is proposing even steeper cuts than the House to the federal-state program that pays for 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care.
If proposals from the Senate Finance Committee become law, “you’ll have hospitals closed, services eliminated and 20,000 jobs eliminated” in Kentucky, warns Nancy Galvagni, president and CEO of the Kentucky Hospital Association. 
“We’re encouraging our senators to support the House language on state directed payments,” Galvagni said Tuesday in an interview.
While Republican senators from some states are voicing worries similar to those of Kentucky hospitals, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell had a different message for Senate Republicans in a closed meeting Tuesday, reports Punchbowl News.
“I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid. But they’ll get over it,” McConnell was reported as saying.
Punchbowl reports that during the closed meeting, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, raised concerns about Senate-proposed changes to the provider tax that helps support hospitals caring for large numbers of Medicaid patients. Tillis warned that provisions in the mega-bill that Republican leaders hope to approve by July 4 could result in GOP electoral losses similar to those suffered by Democrats after passage of Obamacare.
A spokesperson for McConnell, the former Senate Republican leader, told the Lantern: “Senator McConnell was speaking about the people who are abusing Medicaid — the able-bodied Americans who should be working — and the need to withstand Democrats’ scare tactics when it comes to Medicaid. Senator McConnell was urging his fellow members to highlight that message to our constituents and remind them that we should all be against waste, fraud, and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Sen. Rand Paul’s office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
35 Kentucky hospitals considered at risk of closing
At issue is a tax that Kentucky and other states collect from health care providers and use to supplement Medicaid payments. The goal is to boost what hospitals are paid for treating low-income Medicaid patients closer to what commercial insurers would pay for the same services. 
  Nancy Galvagni. (Kentucky Hospital Association photo)
These state-directed payments pumped $4.5 billion into Kentucky hospitals in fiscal year 2024 and are expected to reach $5.5 billion by 2026. That’s a quarter of the entire Kentucky Medicaid budget.
Even with that supplemental support, many Kentucky hospitals are operating on perilously thin margins and, without it, they would lose money, Galvagni told the Lantern Tuesday. 
The hospital association commissioned a study that found Kentucky hospitals on average are operating on a 2% margin that would drop into negative numbers —  negative 7.4% — if what’s proposed in the Senate is approved, she said.
Researchers at the University of North Carolina recently analyzed hospitals’ operating margins and their dependence on Medicaid payments and identified 338 hospitals that would be most at risk of shutting down as a result of the Medicaid cuts Congress is considering.
Thirty-five of the hospitals identified as most at risk of closing are in Kentucky — more than any other state.
The House plan protects the status quo in Kentucky by freezing state provider taxes at current levels and grandfathering in existing plans for supplementing Medicaid reimbursements through state directed payments. Kentucky has three state directed payments plans — one for the state’s two teaching hospitals at the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville, one for all the other hospitals and a small plan for ambulance services.
The Kentucky plans, approved by the first Trump administration in 2020, tie supplemental funding for hospitals to quality measures  intended to improve care. Galvagni said the financial incentives are driving improvements including reductions in infection rates, readmissions and opioid prescribing.
Gaming the system?
But the current Trump administration accuses its predecessors in the Biden administration of allowing states and health care providers to “game the system” via provider taxes to tap additional federal funds to boost Medicaid payments.
Medicaid covers people who have low incomes or disabilities including working people who can’t afford or don’t have access to employer-provided health insurance. It is funded jointly by states and the federal government with most of the money coming from Washington. 
Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump’s Medicare and Medicaid administrator, described provider taxes and state directed payments as “legalized money laundering” in a recent Capitol briefing, reports The Hill. 
A June 6 White House memorandum says: “These State Directed Payments have rapidly accelerated, quadrupling in magnitude over the last 4 years and reaching $110 billion in 2024 alone,” threatening “the Federal Treasury and Medicaid’s long-term stability.”
The memo orders Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid, including by ensuring Medicaid payments rates are not higher than Medicare, to the extent permitted by applicable law.” 
The Senate proposal would reduce Medicaid’s state directed payments to hospitals by 10% each year until they reach the allowable Medicare-related payment limit.
Both Medicaid and Medicare rates are low in Kentucky
Galvagni said pegging the Medicaid supplement to Medicare rates would be “extremely damaging to Kentucky” and put many Kentucky hospitals into an even more unsustainable financial position because Medicare rates in Kentucky are almost as low as Medicaid rates. “You can’t pay the hospitals less than what it costs to deliver services,” Galvagni said, and not expect some to close and others to reduce services.
Medicare is a federally funded program that mainly covers people age 65 and over.
Galvagni also disputed suggestions that Kentucky is abusing the provider tax. All hospitals pay the same rate, she said, and the amount of tax they pay is not related to the amount of money they receive from Medicaid.
In the Senate, Republicans Jim Justice of West Virginia and Josh Hawley of Missouri have publicly voiced surprise and alarm at the cuts to provider taxes and Medicaid payments proposed by the Finance Committee.
Provisions in the House bill would cause an estimated 277,000 Kentuckians to lose their Medicaid coverage, according to KFF, which says that number could go as high as 346,000. 
Republicans in Congress also are expected to let tax credits expire that help Americans afford health insurance in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Without the tax credits the number of uninsured Kentuckians is projected to rise by 21%, according to The Urban Institute.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Attorney General Marty Jackley announced a flurry of criminal charges Tuesday in a series of incidents that have played out since February on the grounds of the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
Two people stand accused of providing the drugs that killed two of the four inmates who’ve overdosed this year in South Dakota prisons.
The charges in the overdose deaths of 20-year-old Anthony Richards and 39-year-old Jason Garreau were unsealed Tuesday. 
Legislative group studies SD’s high incarceration rate, overrepresentation of Indigenous prisoners

An inmate allegedly supplied the synthetic marijuana that killed Richards in February at the penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. The methamphetamine and cocaine that killed Garreau in the penitentiary in May was allegedly delivered hand-to-hand by an on-site visitor who lives in Sioux Falls.
There are two other suspected prison overdose deaths under investigation, Attorney General Marty Jackley said Tuesday at the Law Enforcement Center in Sioux Falls. 
Charges may come soon in those cases, which involved the May 18 death of 24-year-old Joshua Arrow and the June 10 death of 42-year-old Nicholas Skorka.
Jackley said the state’s still awaiting toxicology results in those cases. 
Fighting: Nine gangs involved 
Also unsealed Tuesday were felony assault and rioting indictments for 24 inmates reportedly involved in a 40-man gang skirmish at the Jameson Annex on May 27 that injured 14 and sent four to the hospital. 
There were nine gangs involved in that fight, Jackley said. The violence was “coordinated” by the gangs, he said, but he declined to say if any of the eight inmate victims who are named in the indictments were targeted specifically.
Two of the people whose names are listed as assault victims were themselves charged for felony rioting, defined under South Dakota law as an incident in which three or more people break things or hurt others on purpose. 
“I’m going to suggest to you that of the 24 indicted, they might all be taking the position that they’re victims,” Jackley said, noting that the Division of Criminal Investigation concluded that only eight of those involved could legally be classified as such.
The number of gangs involved – nine – is “probably more than I’m normally involved with in a particular investigation,” Jackley said. But he also said he recognizes that “there is gang prevalence at the penitentiary.”
Fallout: visits suspended, investigations ongoing 
The charges relate to some, but not all, of the recent high-profile prison grounds incidents. 
An inmate broke the nose of a female correctional officer in late March at the penitentiary.
Another, unrelated bout of violence at the Jameson Annex between inmates came hours later. On May 7, a male correctional officer was injured by an inmate at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield. 
None of those incidents has drawn charges. 
Fight breaks out at penitentiary one month after similar violence that injured officer

Several investigations have commenced this year into situations like those, Jackley said, as well as into a prison drug ring the Department of Corrections announced it had broken up.
A late May press release on that investigation said criminal charges would follow “if warranted.”
The attorney general declined to say Tuesday if more charges were imminent in any of those situations.
“Like all investigations, you may reach a point where you’re prepared because there’s probable cause and a reasonable likelihood that a jury would convict, where you move forward, but those investigations are not at that charging decision stage,” Jackley said.
He did suggest that autopsy results in the overdose deaths of Arrow and Skorka would be necessary to make the call in those specific cases. After Tuesday’s press conference, Jackley spokesman Tony Mangan told South Dakota Searchlight that the state is waiting for final reports in the officer assault cases. 
The Department of Corrections, meanwhile, suspended in-person visits in Sioux Falls in response to the drug ring investigation.
That decision has led to some consternation among inmate families, some of whom planned to hold the latest in a series of protests against the DOC Tuesday evening.
The charges and investigations this year have taken place as state officials consider sites for a new men’s prison to replace the oldest parts of the penitentiary. 
The first meeting of the Project Prison Reset task force came days after the late March assaults. Penitentiary and Jameson Annex inmates were on a security lockdown when the task force members toured the grounds for that April 2 meeting.
The officer in Durfee was attacked a week and a day after the group met in Springfield.
The next task force meeting is scheduled for July 8 in Sioux Falls.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a 16-state coalition filing an amicus brief Tuesday supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to cut some funding for Harvard University over reported claims of antisemitism on campus.
Bird, alongside 15 other attorneys general, filed the brief Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by Harvard University challenging the move to strip billions in federal funding from the institution. In April, President Donald Trump’s administration paused $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $50 million in multi-year contracts for Harvard.
While the funding cut follows reports of instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, the decision came after the administration demanded Harvard end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, cooperate with immigration authorities and adopt merit-based admission standards or risk losing $9 billion in research funding — demands rejected by the university.
The federal lawsuit claims the federal government’s decision to slash funding for the university is being used as “leverage to gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard,” and argues the research funding being impacted by the cuts is unrelated to concerns about antisemitism. Attorneys for the university have also stated the funding cut is a violation of the First Amendment, as the government’s demands include potential restrictions on material that can be taught by Harvard faculty.
But in the amicus brief filed Tuesday, Bird and the other attorneys general said the claim that the Trump administration is violating the First Amendment is invalid. The filing points to a previous federal decision to strip tax-exempt status from Bob Jones University, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983, because the institution was in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws by excluding Black applicants as students unless they were married.
The brief cites the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israel Bias report filed in April by Harvard University as evidence that there were repeated instances of antisemitism and an “alienating and hostile atmosphere” experienced by Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas against Israel.
“Harvard has failed to protect Jewish and Israeli students on its campus since at least October 7, 2023,” the brief states. “… Harvard invokes the First Amendment to distract from its failure to protect Jewish students in violation of Title IV, which the federal government cited as its reason for freezing funding. But the bottom line is that the First Amendment does not allow institutions to violate Title VI. Universities that accept federal funding must live up to their obligations to protect Jewish students, just like they protect students of other nationalities, ethnicities, and religions.”
Bird was joined in the brief by the attorneys general for Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas.
In a news release, Bird said she and the other state officials “stand firmly with the Trump Administration and against antisemitism,” adding, “but Harvard does not.”
“When President Trump acted to fix the rampant antisemitism on Harvard’s campus by restricting federal funding, Harvard sued,” Bird said in a statement. “Harvard itself admits that antisemitism both exists and is a problem on its campus but is unwilling to address the issue. Jewish students deserve equal protection and access to education which is why I led a 16-state coalition to support President Trump’s actions.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/birdnewsconf5.31-scaled-e1717192095129-1024x729.jpg,,,2025-06-24 19:07:33.878042

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After serving just two years as the state’s top economic developer, K.C. Belitz is exiting as director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.
Gov. Jim Pillen announced the resignation late Tuesday, without detailing why. Belitz did not return a reporter’s phone call. His final day with the state is July 18.
Belitz has overseen the review and award of hundreds of millions of dollars in grants through state and local programs aimed at revitalizing key areas of Nebraska, including the often tumultuous North and South Omaha recovery grant program, as well as for smaller rural communities.
Formerly a longtime head of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce, Belitz, 56, has often said his focus was on how to attract people as much as businesses to his home state that struggled to fill open jobs.
“K.C. is a committed public servant, whose entire career has been about growing local communities and growing Nebraska,” said Pillen, whose hometown also is Columbus. “Over the past two years, he has been a positive champion for bringing new business to the state and fostering relationships that will allow Nebraska to continue attracting companies involved in the bioeconomy, manufacturing, technology and other industries. I appreciate all that K.C. has done as director of DED and wish him the very best in all future endeavors.”
Belitz, in a statement, said it was a pleasure to serve Pillen and Nebraskans as DED director. He replaced Tony Goins, who resigned from his $215,000-a-year-job amid questions about potential conflicts of interest.
Of his DED post, Belitz described it as “immensely satisfying.”
“It has afforded me the chance to meet stakeholders across Nebraska who care deeply about their communities, making investments and creating opportunities so that families can raise their kids, have great careers, and thrive in their home state,” he said. 
The Pillen statement said an announcement on an interim DED leader is to be made later.

The governor of Rhode Island, a handful of state scientists, and a flock of reporters walked into an unfinished building in Providence Tuesday.
Donning hard hats, fluorescent vests, and safety glasses, and corralled by construction workers, the group congregated in the 90-degrees heat to tour Rhode Island’s new public health laboratory — an approximately $98 million project three years in the making, and one that state officials say is finally nearing completion.
Gov. Dan McKee invited the press to see the somewhat furnished, but not finished, space that will be home to the Rhode Island State Health Laboratories, which is part of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH). 
It’s likely the 80,000-square foot lab space will be finished before the end of summer. About 100 people are expected to use the lab space to monitor a range of nearly invisible threats, from infectious germs to milkborne pathogens to seawater pollutants. 
Currently, the health lab is housed in a nondescript administrative building on Orms Street, near the State House. Dr. Louis Marchetti, who leads the state’s Center for Clinical Toxicology and Laboratory Support, joked with reporters that the current facility is “one microwave away from a blackout.”
Still, Marchetti said: “People are really unaware of the technologies that exist within the state lab. While our current building might be old, our instrumentation is not.”
The new health lab is about 20% to 30% bigger than the current space and will have areas for the public to drop off samples for testing, and improved access controls for staff as well as law enforcement who come in to work on forensic samples. 
An organic chemistry lab will provide space to analyze PFAS, or the plastics known as forever chemicals. Microbiology space will give insight into the safety of beach water or the health of shellfish beds. Rabies, mosquitoes and meningitis are all within the laboratories’ purview. 
The building will also be home to Rhode Island’s only Biosafety Level 3 lab — the highest level of containment afforded only the most dangerous pathogens — although officials stressed that the state will only test local samples, and won’t import hazardous materials. The labs, Marchetti stressed, are not so much about research as they are public health. 
State surveillance of infectious diseases has pushed itself to the front of officials’ minds in the post-COVID-19 era. Dr. Glen Gallagher, the director of the State Health Laboratories and the tour’s leader, said the pandemic taught state health officials the importance of being able to pivot. That’s why the new facility includes a flex lab that can accommodate surge testing.

There’s also space for wastewater surveillance, another trend in epidemiology that became something of a household term during the COVID era. Currently, wastewater testing is “squished” alongside other lab activities, said Dr. Richard Huard, who leads RIDOH’s Center for Biological Science Laboratories.
“Everybody goes to the bathroom and takes a shower,” Huard said. “Think of everything that goes into wastewater, from your laundry machine, your shower, your sinks.”
Yet the state’s wastewater-testing tech is so sensitive, Huard said, that it can detect “a little bit of a viral DNA” even in massive volumes of wastewater. This sewer runoff helps state scientists track outbreaks of pathogens like COVID-19 and flu. It also lets the health department warn local hospitals that a new wave or this or that virus may be emerging in the state. 
But Huard noted that one category dominates the lab’s day-to-day operations: sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A recent state report found that STIs seem to have returned from their period of hibernation during the pandemic — a time when people were having less sex, and with fewer people, according to public health researchers.
Huard said part of the state’s goal is to return testing results quickly enough to interrupt the spread of these infections, namely chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis, which are the tests most commonly processed by the state laboratories.
“They’re important tests, because once a patient gets a diagnosis and is put on treatment, that’s how you break the chain of transmission,” Huard said.
Prominently planted at the edge of the Jewelry District, a few minutes’ walk from many of the city’s nightclubs and theaters, the building itself is jewellike, encased in terracotta cladding and adorned with slender windows with “playful spacing,” in the words of one design planning document. 
Behind the facade, the interior looks modern and airy, with the sterile white of lab spaces emphasized by the light coming in from the elongated windows — something Gallagher appreciated, along with the accompanying city views.
“You can see the space is really open. There’s a lot of windows. So this is really a real improvement,” Gallagher said in the area that will eventually become the STI testing room. 
The project was primarily funded by a grant worth $82 million from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Asked by reporters if Gallagher thought the construction funding was endangered under President Donald Trump’s administration, Gallagher said the grant money was secure and has largely been spent.
And it was likely money well spent, as suggested by Gallagher’s answer when asked why Rhode Islanders should care about the building.
“The work that happens here really touches every component of their lives, whether they know it or not,” he told reporters.

“It is very unclear what the world after federal funding looks like for public media,” Vermont Public CEO Vijay Singh said this week.

Vermont’s joint NPR and PBS station, Vermont Public, stands to lose about 10% of its annual funding if Congress signs off on President Donald Trump’s request to claw back funding the federal government provides for public media stations across the country. The measure passed the House earlier this month, and is now being considered in the Senate, where a hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Wednesday morning. 
For Vermont Public, the potential funding cut — which would set the station back about $2 million a year — is unlikely to pose an existential threat, according to CEO Vijay Singh. The station relies less heavily on federal funding, he said, than many others around the country do. He added that Vermont Public’s leadership has done some initial “contingency planning,” though declined to specify, noting much was still up in the air.
Congress has until July 18 to make a decision on the president’s request.
Trump and his Republican allies in Congress backing the funding cut have framed it as an effort to divorce taxpayer money from news outlets they claim are biased. That criticism has led Singh and other public media leaders to make urgent appeals about the nature of their work in recent months — and landed the news stations in their own headlines. 
Meanwhile, Singh said the proposed cuts have created significant uncertainty over whether public media in the U.S., which today operates as a closely-linked network of local stations sharing content and broadcast infrastructure, can continue in that form. 
“It is very unclear what the world, after federal funding, looks like for public media,” he said in an interview Monday afternoon at Vermont Public’s studios in Colchester. 
Like other public media stations, Vermont Public funds its programming in part with money appropriated by Congress to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit run independently from the federal government, which then distributes the money to individual outlets — as well as to NPR and PBS at the national level.

At the beginning of June, Trump asked lawmakers to claw back about $1 billion in funding they have already appropriated to support public media stations across the country over the next two years. Through that process, formally known as a “recission” request, the White House also asked lawmakers to pull back more than $8 billion for foreign aid programs that address global public health and hunger relief.
Conservative activists have been pushing to eliminate federal funding for public media stations for decades. Previous Republican presidents, including Trump, during his first term, have tried to do so, though so far, none have convinced Congress to go along.
This year’s measure passed narrowly through the House, largely along party lines, with most — though not all — Republicans in support. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement earlier this year that NPR and PBS have “consistently and knowingly betrayed the public trust” and “routinely ignore facts to advance a far left agenda.” 
Singh acknowledged “a lot of people have that preconceived notion” that public media, especially at the national level, has a liberal bias. Vermont Public airs many nationally-syndicated NPR and PBS programs, though it also produces its own programs that focus on news and culture in Vermont and neighboring regions.
He said that notion largely stems from the stations’ charge to represent viewpoints that do not always make it into traditional, commercial media stories — meaning the stations’ content will, by design, avoid promoting any one set of views.
“We are not here to reinforce worldviews, and realistically, that’s how a lot of commercial media operates,” Singh said. Public media, he contended, is “going to challenge your worldview. And that is, I think, sometimes where the feedback that we get comes from.”
Vermont Public leans less on federal funding than many other public media stations around the country, particularly among rural states, Singh said. According to data from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, almost half of all rural stations rely on the feds for at least 25% of their revenue, while about 35 stations — many of them on Native American reservations — rely on the government for at least half of their revenue. 
Just shy of 60% of Vermont Public’s revenue comes from individual donations and business sponsorships, according to the station’s latest annual report. In addition to that revenue and federal support, the report states, the station funds about 25% of its yearly operational costs with income from a substantial investment fund. 
Much of that fund comes from the 2017 sale of a Vermont PBS broadcast license to the federal government, which totaled about $55 million. The public television station merged with Vermont Public Radio in 2021 under the combined name Vermont Public. 
According to Singh, the investment fund provides a “cushion” that keeps Vermont Public from operating at a deficit, so the station’s leaders would be hesitant to dip into the fund further to support its operations in the event the station loses its federal funding. 
Rather than turn to its investments, he said the station would likely launch a public fundraising campaign to make up the $2 million gap, if needed. 
Singh said Vermont Public has been in regular contact with the state’s congressional delegation about the impacts of a potential funding cut. One of Vermont’s U.S. senators, Democrat Peter Welch, spoke against the rescission proposal on the Senate floor earlier this month, pointing to how, among other roles, public radio stations can be the only source of information available during a natural disaster.
Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, also a Democrat, has signed onto a memo filed in support of two federal lawsuits challenging the proposed public media cuts. The amicus brief argues funding losses could curtail the spread of emergency information across the country, among other points. The suits were brought by NPR and PBS, as well as local stations in Colorado and Minnesota. 
Public media stations provide “a source of local news at a time when we have news deserts all around the country, and the pressure on our local newspapers, on our local broadcasters, on our local radio stations is enormous,” Welch said on the Senate floor. “We need public broadcasting.”

A bill that would require tech companies to compensate Oregon newsrooms like these failed to pass the Oregon Senate on Tuesday. (Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A novel proposal that would mandate tech companies to pay local journalism outlets for using their news content failed to gain steam in its first floor vote in the Oregon Senate on Tuesday, effectively killing its chance to pass this year.
Lawmakers on Tuesday voted 15-14 against Senate Bill 686, introduced in January, which aims to regulate tech companies and social media platforms like Google and Meta that aggregate, publish and use news content for their feeds or algorithms to provide information to users. Four Democrats were in opposition.
“Does anybody honestly believe these companies are going to just write the check and keep doing business as usual here?” Sen. Mark Meek, D-Gladstone, asked his colleagues Tuesday before voting against the legislation. “No, they will stop sharing news content in Oregon all together, just like they did in Canada.”
The effort at enacting the nation’s most stringent rules regulating journalism content and reproduction has also met a mounting resistance from tech companies. Meta, for instance, has threatened to remove Oregon news from their platforms altogether if the bill passes, echoing its position in Canada where a similar law was passed in 2023.
The vote against the bill was followed by a motion by Sen. Kayse Jama, D-Portland, to send the bill back to the Senate Committee on Rules, where it was previously amended on June 11 in the face of legal concerns over regulation of private markets and the First Amendment.
But it’s unlikely that the bill will be revived, amended and passed out of committee and both chambers by Sunday, when Oregon’s legislative session ends. And the bill’s author, Sen. Khanh Phạm, D-Portland, told the Capital Chronicle that she will be reintroducing the bill next session.
The original version of the legislation had three avenues for platforms to satisfy the legislation’s regulations: pay each accessed provider an unspecified amount, enter into an arbitration process, or donate to a university-backed public media board. The new bill preserves those pathways but heightens the protections news outlets have if their content is used without an agreement with an online platform.
Under the legislation, companies like Apple, Google and Meta could pay tens of millions of dollars into a state fund that would support news outlets throughout the state, based on their size and the number of journalists they employ. Firms like Google, Instagram and Facebook could pay into a central fund that is doled out to different newsrooms based on size, paying $104 million annually if they have six billion or more monthly active users worldwide, or $18 million annually if they have fewer than six billion worldwide users.
One-tenth of that money would go to the Oregon Civic Information Consortium, a proposed board under the purview of the University of Oregon that would help train future journalists, offer grants to newsrooms and ensure funding for news deserts such as rural communities. The rest of the funding would go to newsrooms based on the number of employees and journalists they have; 70% of the funds must be spent on journalists and support staff by providers.
“We trust the people who work in this industry and whose vocation depends on freedom of the press to guide us on what they need,” Phạm said on the Senate floor, referencing the more than 50 Oregon newsrooms that have voiced support for the bill.  “Now they need a fighting chance in an unfair market.”
The bill was amended in a June committee hearing, however, to address legal concerns about violating the First Amendment and regulating the free market, though lawmakers anticipate the untested measure would face a legal challenge anyway. The new version shifted the focus away from cracking down on social media and tech platforms, aiming instead to empower news outlets to create agreements with platforms for payment or face legal consequences.
Sen. Daniel Bonham, R-The Dalles, warned his colleagues that the bill could unintentionally incentivize platforms to establish agreements with politically-biased media. He was also unsure if the bill would survive under legal scrutiny.
Under the new version of the legislation, online platforms could face lawsuits for damages from newsrooms if the companies accessed their content without a written agreement. The proposal would establish an arbitration process to decide what proportion of ad revenue a platform should dole out to newsrooms. The reworked bill also classifies the access and use of such content through aggregation, publishing and distribution without a formal agreement with an outlet as an unfair trade practice.
Sen. Jeff Golden, D-Ashland, told his colleagues there was no avoiding the uncertainty the bill would pose in the courts. But, he asked, “Can you think of a significant law in the past that tries to solve a significant problem that hasn’t been litigated?”
Aside from Meek, the three other Democrats who voted in opposition to the bill were Sens. Kayse Jama, D-Portland, Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene and Janeen Sollman, D-Hillsboro.  Jama reversed his position in order to be part of the prevailing majority against the bill, allowing him to call for the bill to be reconsidered and sent to committee. The one Republican who had expressed support for the legislation, Sen. Dick Anderson, R-Lincoln City, also voted against the bill.

,California,2025-06-24 22:21:06+00:00,CalMatters,Trump cancelled millions in California research grants. Judges want to restore them,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/06/health-research-california/,"The science grants are a core aspect of university operations and science development in the U.S. At the University of California alone, National Institutes of Health funding brought in $2.6 billion last year.","In summary
The science grants are a core aspect of university operations and science development in the U.S. At the University of California alone, National Institutes of Health funding brought in $2.6 billion last year. 


Federal judges handed California researchers temporary victories in their quest to retrieve what’s likely tens of millions of dollars in federal grants the Trump administration cancelled this year.
The judges issued the rulings in three cases Monday. In one case, more than 800 science research grants, including about 430 in California, need to be restored after a federal Massachusetts judge ruled the Trump administration’s cancellation of the grants was “illegal” as well as “arbitrary and capricious.” The list could grow as the trial advances. The judge said last week that he had “never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable” in his 40 years on the bench. A similar case filed by a national coalition of health researchers and graduate students affects a few dozen California research grants and hundreds of others across the country. Both cases were heard by William Young, a President Ronald Reagan appointee, and largely concern the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research.
In his statement last week, Young was referring to the legion of cancelled grants that investigated racial health disparities and funded health research into women and the LGBTQ+ community. The cancelled grants have also included research into dementia, aging, vaccines and a wide constellation of health science discovery. Congress had already allocated the funds to the National Institutes of Health and these grants were approved by committees of scientists in a highly competitive process.
The agency began cancelling the grants after President Donald Trump issued several executive orders seeking to cut federal support for programs that relate to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. A key focus for the health science agency was expanding the pool of diverse scholars and research concerning women and minorities. Those priorities were established by Congress.
The cancelled grants affect not just established research scientists. The cuts include programs for graduate students whose income and education are dependent on research grants to support their work and for promising undergraduate students who receive financial stipends to work in labs and hone their research skills to eventually apply for doctoral programs. The science grants are a core aspect of university operations and science development in the U.S. At the University of California, National Institutes of Health funding brought in $2.6 billion last year. Cancelled grants also ended training programs for students at California State University.Several cancelled grants have already been restored since states sued the federal government, including a large study at UC Davis investigating the causes of dementia.
When money will be returned is unknown
“It is our expectation and we believe the court’s expectation that funding will be restored,” said Joanne Adams, a spokesperson for California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who was among 16 state attorneys general to sue the Trump administration over the terminated grants.
Within hours of the ruling, lawyers for the Trump administration requested that the judge put a pause on his order for 14 days. They also filed an appeal with the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. Young rejected the pause request this morning.This is a case “concerning health research already bought and paid for by the Congress of the United States through funds appropriated for expenditure and properly allocated during this fiscal year,” Young wrote in his rejection of the pause. “Even a day’s delay further destroys the unmistakable legislative purpose from its accomplishment.”“We appreciate the court’s ruling,” said Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the University of California. “The longstanding partnership between the NIH and the University of California has allowed UC to develop breakthroughs that get us closer to curing cancer, and new technologies that can detect and combat life-threatening illnesses like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s faster than ever before.“When researchers will receive their funding again is unclear. “My best guess is it will be after all stays and appeals are resolved,” said Shalini Goel Agarwal, according to Axios. He’s special counsel at Protect Democracy and an attorney for the researchers and groups who sued the federal government.Extended funding delays may damage some research projects, professors wrote to the court. “Once cancelled, most research projects cannot immediately resume. Many of these projects entail longitudinal studies,” wrote a senior research official at UC San Francisco, Harold R. Collard. “When scientific studies stop in full swing, their partial results often lose validity.”
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for Health and Human Services, the department that includes the National Institutes of Health, said the department “stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,” according to Axios.
UC researchers may get science, environmental grants back
And in a third case, a federal district court judge in California ordered the federal government to “reinstate” numerous University of California grants that were cancelled by three agencies: The National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Endowment for the Humanities.Six UC scholars filed the suit this month after their respective grants were “terminated without explanation,” as the judge on the case, Rita F. Lin, put it.One of the plaintiffs, Dr. Neeta Thakur, “studies how genes in different racial and ethnic groups affect lung disease” and was awarded a federal grant to study the health risks caused by wildfire smoke “in communities of color and low income communities,” the judge said.In a preliminary injunction, Lin ordered that the grants from those three agencies be restored if they were cancelled with a termination form that used vague or generic language about the project not meeting agency priorities or for running afoul of Trump’s bans on DEI funding.Trump administration officials “have admitted that grants were flagged for termination for researching blacklisted topics, based on keyword searches or titles,” Lin wrote.Lin scheduled a meeting July 2 so that Trump administration lawyers can tell her what they have done to comply with the court order. Trump administration lawyers could seek an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to try to halt Lin’s preliminary injunction.The cases in Massachusetts and California are “nicely complementary, and we have decisions in plaintiffs’ favor in both cases at just about the same time,” said Claudia Polsky, a lawyer for the six UC scholars. She’s also a law professor at UC Berkeley, but isn’t representing the university in this case.Polsky said that cancelled grants from other agencies could also be reinstated as the trial progresses. She’s unsure how many grants would ultimately be restored by Lin’s order Monday, but it likely affects millions of dollars in research.And in another development, California and 21 other states led by Democrats filed a lawsuit today targeting a main tool that the Trump administration has used to terminate about $10 billion in grants across federal agencies. Federal regulations say an agency can cancel an award if it “no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities” — the language the Trump administration is using in its grant termination letters. 
But today’s suit argues that the federal agency behind those regulations wrote in 2020 that federal agencies “are not able to terminate grants arbitrarily.” Lawyers for the states want the judge to halt the Trump administration’s use of that regulatory clause in terminating grants.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM_47.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-24 19:07:33.878042

Compassion Center, withdrew earlier in the year. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The state’s Cannabis Control Commission is looking to license a new compassion center in northern Rhode Island after plans for one in Woonsocket were scrapped.
The three-member commission have reopened applications for candidates who qualified to open the medical marijuana dispensaries in the original 2021 license application process, with submissions due Sept. 18. The license is reserved for a business that opens in Zone 1, which includes Burrillville, Cumberland, Glocester, North Smithfield and Woonsocket. Smithfield is excluded, as voters in 2022 narrowly rejected allowing retail cannabis shops in town.
R.M.I. Compassion Center Inc. won the Zone 1 license in the fall 2021 lottery, with plans to open at Walnut Hill Plaza in Woonsocket by last summer, according to its website. R.M.I quickly faced pushback from local zoning officials, resulting in a court battle that R.M.I ultimately won.
But the center never opened and R.M.I. withdrew its application in January after failing to meet the state’s licensing requirements in September 2024, according to a consent order from the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation.
Paul Isikwe, who is listed on state documents as the president of the business, did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Four other applicants qualified for the 2021 lottery: Livity Compassion Center, Medici Compassionate Care Center Inc., New Leaf Compassion Center Inc., and Pinnacle Compassion Center Inc. To receive the license now, they must meet new regulatory requirements, including proof of zoning approval, operational readiness, and adherence to safety standards.
None of the four had reapplied as of Tuesday, Charon Rose, a commission spokesperson said in an email, and a Medici director told Rhode Island Current it would not try again. 
“It takes a lot of work — we’d have to get property again and redo everything,” said Christopher Roy. “And the other problem is the fees — it just makes it impossible to do business.” 
“The office is actively conducting outreach and establishing communication with previously qualified applicants to support their understanding of the process and timeline,” Rose said. “We remain available to answer any questions and are committed to ensuring a smooth and transparent process as we move forward.”
Prospective dispensary owners must pay a $10,000 application fee, but Rose said previously qualified applicants would not have to pay again. Once approved, compassion centers must pay an annual licensing fee of $500,000. If an applicant wants to sell recreational cannabis under a hybrid license, allowed as of 2022, that requires an additional $30,000.
A Zone 1 compassion center would bring the state’s total to eight. The first quarter of 2025 saw nearly $2.9 million in revenue go into the state’s coffers.
Regulators are still working on opening applications for the 24 new retail licenses allowed under the 2022 law that legalized recreational sales.

Ben & Jerry’s leadership wanted to put out a social media post last week in support of migrant community members detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Vermont, but London-based parent company Unilever denied them, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
“The recent detention and deportation of migrant farmworkers in our home state isn’t just a threat to individuals – it’s a threat to the fabric of our communities and our human rights,” the post, crafted by the ice cream making behemoth’s independent board, read. 
The post, which VTDigger viewed, named two individuals recently detained by ICE, Jose Ignacio “Nacho” De La Cruz, 29, and his stepdaughter, Heidi Perez, 18, a recent high school graduate.

Both are prominent leaders with Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based migrant advocacy organization. De La Cruz, a former dairy worker turned construction worker, helped launch the group’s Milk With Dignity campaign, which seeks to provide worker rights and a better life on dairy farms. Ben & Jerry’s was the first major company to join the campaign and agree to purchase milk only from farms that meet the standards of the program. The participating farms the company sources from represent about a fifth of Vermont’s dairy industry. 
“We stand with Migrant Justice and call for transparency, accountability, and the protection of constitutional rights for all,” the proposed post read. “Join us and urge the release of Nacho and Heidi so they can return to their families and community in Vermont.”
The post then linked to a Migrant Justice web page that included an Action Network petition demanding the release of De La Cruz and Perez. VTDigger is not naming the sources who shared the post due to their concerns about retaliation. 
De La Cruz and Perez were driving home to Chittenden County from delivering food to migrant farmworkers in Franklin County when they were pulled over by U.S. Customs and Border Protection due to “suspicious border activity,” according to a CBP spokesperson. De La Cruz’s window was smashed and they were detained.

De La Cruz is currently held in the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Swanton and Perez is being held at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, according to the state prisoner locator. They are both citizens of Mexico without legal immigration status in the U.S.
Unilever did not respond to multiple requests for comment by the time of publication on Tuesday. 
The Vermont-based ice cream maker has long aligned with progressive causes, including the Black Lives Matter movement and Palestinian rights campaigns in recent years. The company does so under an independent board that was established when Ben & Jerry’s was acquired by Unilever in 2000 to maintain the brand’s social mission.
But disputes between the brand and Unilever have ramped up since the election of President Donald Trump last year. 
In November, Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in U.S. District Court in New York, claiming the parent company shut down statements to support Palestinian rights. In January, they alleged Unilever barred them from criticizing President Trump in a social media post on the day of his inauguration. 
In March, after Unilever fired CEO David Stever, Ben & Jerry’s again sued Unilever, alleging Stever was fired for his commitment to the social mission and without properly consulting the brand’s independent board, according to court filings. 
Stever had been with the company since 1987 and moved into the role of CEO in 2023. The complaint stated that the motive for removing Stever was “his commitment to Ben & Jerry’s Social Mission and Essential Brand Integrity … rather than any genuine concerns regarding his performance history.”
The dispute comes as the arrests of Vermont’s migrant residents have ramped up under the second Trump administration, including detainment of nine farm workers in April and the deportation of four. In May, four landscape workers and ten construction workers were also detained by Border Patrol agents in northern Vermont.

The lawsuit, first reported Tuesday by the Washington Post, targets the leadership of the Virginia Military Institute, the University of Virginia and George Mason University. It asks the court to bar the contested board members from continuing to serve and declare that any board member who permits them to remain is violating their legal duties.
The dispute stems from a June 9 vote by the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, which rejected eight of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments — including former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick.
At the center of the clash is a standoff between Attorney General Jason Miyares and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who issued duelling letters to university rectors interpreting the fallout.
Miyares argued the appointees may continue to serve until the General Assembly reconvenes in January. Surovell, however, maintains that their terms ended immediately with the Senate’s vote.
The legal challenge underscores a broader power struggle between the Republican governor and the Democratic-controlled Senate over influence on public university boards. Democrats say Youngkin is stacking boards with ideologues to reshape policy.
Miyares said Tuesday evening that the board members in question had been lawfully appointed. 
“I think it is very unfortunate to see certain individuals in the state Senate that want to try to politicize the governance of these boards and just somehow remove these people. I think they’re wrong in the law,” he said.
Youngkin said that his administration has been working to combat illegal discrimination at Virginia’s universities and schools. He called the lawsuit an example of Democrats promoting the latter.
“The fact that they are challenging my appointees is not only meritless, but it’s a waste of time,” Youngkin said. “It’s a waste of money and it’s a waste of people’s efforts. The commonwealth is doing incredibly well, and I would just encourage my Democrat friends to work productively on real things versus wasting everybody’s time on this meritless effort when, in fact, we’re going to all be together in making sure there’s no discrimination on our university campuses.”
However, Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, pushed back against Youngkin’s assertion. 
“We will not tolerate Governor Youngkin violating our constitution to keep extremists on university boards. The Senate has acted and our decision is final,” Lucas posted on X, formerly Twitter.
Surovell added that he was “proud” to stand with Lucas in defending the rule of law of Virginia.
“If Donald Trump and his allies want to burn it down at the federal level, we’ll make sure it still stands strong here in the commonwealth,” Surovell posted on X.
Following the June 9 meeting, Surovell reminded the heads of Virginia’s public universities in a letter that same day that state code requires all governing board members to be confirmed by the General Assembly. He wrote that lawmakers “will not confirm individuals who do not possess the judgment, character, or willingness to follow the principles” outlined in the letter.
Those principles include an understanding of fiduciary duties, a commitment to independent institutional governance, and a pledge to avoid excessive partisan inclinations.
During the meeting, two Republican committee members defended the governor’s appointees, but it wasn’t enough to sway the Democratic-controlled panel, which voted to reject them. 
Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about why a joint subcommittee — composed of Senate and House Privileges and Elections committees members — had not met to review the appointees’ statements and economic interests, as required by state code. The committee’s attorney said he was not aware of whether the subcommittee was currently active. 
In a June 10 letter to Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Gee, who manages gubernatorial appointments, Senate Clerk Susan Clarke Schaar confirmed that the committee’s action is “effective immediately.”
Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who does not serve on the committee, predicted Tuesday that the lawsuit would be dismissed because, in his view, the General Assembly had not formally rejected the appointments. 
“The lawsuit filed by Senate Dems is a pure political stunt,” Obenshain wrote. “Despite an earlier letter she sent ‘at the direction’ of Senate Dems, the Senate Clerk agrees: the General Assembly has not refused to confirm the Governor’s appointments. It’s an easy call — dismissed with prejudice.”
Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, voiced support for the lawsuit, saying it was necessary to uphold the state constitution and prevent overreach by the executive branch. 
“This lawsuit is an essential and necessary defense of our constitution, our legislative authority, and the institutional checks and balances that protect Virginia’s democracy,” Hashmi said in a statement. “The governor and attorney general’s actions not only flout the clear mandates of the Virginia Constitution, but they also disregard the will of the Senate and undermine the General Assembly’s critical role in overseeing appointments to our public university boards.”
Last Friday, the governor announced a slate of new appointments to governing boards at several Virginia colleges and universities. None of the previously rejected nominees were included.
The Senate committee responsible for reviewing appointments has not yet scheduled its next meeting.

Enderlin native Sadie Rudolph posted on social media Monday calling on drone operators to help search for items taken away by the series of storms that rolled across North Dakota on Friday. In less than 24 hours, the post was shared more than 180 times with many people reaching out to add lost items to the list and to see how they could help.
“We’ve got a lot of people looking for things that have been scattered for miles,” said Rudolph, who now lives in West Fargo. 


How to help
The North Dakota Community Foundation has set up a storm relief fund. Financial donations will be provided to impacted communities and homeowners to assist with disaster recovery and unmet needs.


Rudolph said someone reached out to her on social media to report that a letter with an Enderlin address was found more than 90 miles away in Ulen, Minnesota.
“The sheer craziness of how far the storm took this stuff, it’s just mind-boggling,” she said. 
The Northern Plains UAS Test Site based in Grand Forks responded to the call for help. Three drones and pilots were searching for property in the Enderlin and Sheldon areas on Tuesday, said Victor Meza, marketing manager. 
A severe storm that produced multiple tornadoes, hail and high winds hit North Dakota over the weekend, claiming three lives in Enderlin. 
Residents asked drone pilots for help locating missing saddles, generators, tools, utility vehicles, a horse trailer and a pickup truck, among other items, that vanished during the storms.
“It’s not just clothes or things like that, but mainly trying to find bigger items that are still missing,” Meza said.

This is the first time drones from the Northern Plains UAS Test Site are being used to search for items after a tornado, Meza said. The Grand Forks test site is one of seven approved by the Federal Aviation Administration to research how to safely integrate unmanned aerial systems into the national airspace.
The organization previously helped Grand Forks with aerial flooding observations. Drones also were used by energy companies after the 2024 Christmas ice storm to locate downed power lines faster than personnel on foot, he said.
“Manpower can be expensive and it can be exhausting,” Meza said. Swamps and bogs can be difficult to search on the ground, but drones provide a much easier way to search those areas completely, he said. Meza added it also allows search personnel to be diverted to other areas with higher needs.
“If we can save five to 10 people from going in one direction … it expands the search even more,” Meza said.

Drone teams can deploy within about 10 minutes of arriving at a scene, he said. After searching on Tuesday morning, Meza said they had not found many of the larger items, but they are finding a lot of large pieces of debris and metal poles in the fields that will need to be moved before fields can be harvested.
The drones being flown in Enderlin are using Vantis, North Dakota’s statewide uncrewed aircraft system that allows drones to be flown beyond the visual line of sight. The network, which has received state funding, allows the drones to monitor air traffic in the area and extends their range.
“This is more than technology; it’s neighbors helping neighbors, and we’re honored to be part of that,” said Erin Roesler, deputy executive director for Northern Plains UAS Test Site.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The overrepresentation of Native Americans in state prisons, a lack of rehabilitation programming, and a need for more intervention to keep people out of prison are the biggest issues flagged by members of South Dakota’s legislative recidivism and rehabilitation committee.
The group held its first meeting Monday at the University of South Dakota’s Sioux Falls campus. The committee is tasked with analyzing the makeup of the prison population, comparing incarceration rates and sentencing laws in similar states, and identifying barriers to inmates’ reintegration into society. 
South Dakota has the nation’s 15th-highest incarceration rate, according to The Sentencing Project. Forty-three percent of adult offenders in South Dakota return to prison within three years of release, according to 2023 statistics from the state Department of Corrections.
Some lawmakers who voted in February against funding to build an $825 million men’s prison said the state should be investing more into rehabilitation programs to reduce its prison population.
Lawmakers on the recidivism and rehabilitation committee may propose bills and funding recommendations during the next legislative session. Some members of the committee also sit on the governor’s Project Prison Reset committee, which is searching for a location to build a new prison at a cost up to $600 million.
Mitchell Republican Rep. Jeff Bathke is the former director of substance abuse programs for the state Department of Corrections and a member of the recidivism and rehabilitation committee. He hopes the group will dig further into rehabilitation and behavioral health programming to understand existing programs and their efficacy.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)
“Right now, we’re just a warehouse. We warehouse people,” Bathke told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting. “Then they come back because we did nothing as a community to help them.”
The first meeting supported his belief that the state should hire a consultant to better evaluate the prison system and make recommendations to policy and programming. The state has hired a consultant to study prison construction needs, and that consultant said strict sentencing laws are among the factors driving prison population growth.
“This is a severely damaged system,” Bathke said. “But it can be great. It can be the best program in the nation, with some changes.”
Indigenous overrepresentation
Native Americans account for nearly 40% of the state’s prison inmates. They account for about 9% of the state’s overall population, according to a presentation from the Legislative Research Council.
That statistic is “alarming,” said Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, during the meeting. Sioux Falls Republican Rep. Greg Jamison, who co-chairs the committee, told lawmakers he believes the overrepresentation is one of the “biggest issues” facing the committee.

The disparity of Native Americans in the prison system has persisted for decades. Bathke added that offenders sentenced in federal court after crimes on tribal land aren’t accounted for in the state data.
“It is way worse than what these numbers actually show,” Bathke said.

South Dakota’s disparity is higher than similar states analyzed by the committee: Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. Legislative staff compared the states’ prison populations because they share economic and demographic similarities.
Jamison said he hopes to connect with tribal leaders this summer to hear their suggestions for addressing the problem. 
South Dakota also has the third highest female incarceration rate in the nation, according to The Sentencing Project. Nearly two-thirds of incarcerated women in the state are Native American, and about half of their worst offenses are drug-related.
North Dakota has the lowest prison population in the four-state comparison presented to the committee, at under 2,000 inmates, along with the lowest incarceration rate and lowest female incarceration rate.
“We’re going to have to dig into North Dakota a bit,” Jamison said.
‘Rehabilitation is important, and we are failing’
Several lawmakers and members of the public raised concerns about rehabilitation programming — both the quality of programs and the number of programs available to inmates. A Department of Corrections employee was not on hand to answer lawmaker questions.
Leaders of a company that trained and employed maximum security inmates at the state penitentiary for two decades said they were pushed out of the prison system by administrators last year, although administrators said the company left voluntarily to avoid adhering to newer, stricter security protocols. Gov. Larry Rhoden announced this week his administration will use economic development dollars from the state’s Future Fund to start a diesel mechanic training program in the metal shop’s former space.

Linsey Sapp, whose husband is incarcerated, told lawmakers during public comment that the lack of classes and programming is a serious concern, especially if inmates are spending “23 hours a day” in their cells. 
“Rehabilitation is important, and we are failing,” she said.
Tracii Barse, a Native American business owner who introduced himself as a seven-time felon to lawmakers, said mentorship during and after a prison sentence is necessary to successfully reintegrate inmates into society.
He suggested policy changes to allow ex-inmates to come into the prison to teach classes or mentor current inmates. While there are several volunteers who mentor, former prisoners better understand inmates’ history and challenges, he said.
Barse finds it ironic that he’s allowed to enter a school to mentor children, despite his background, but he can’t use that same experience and connection to help inmates.
Intervention and understanding reoffending
Sen. Tamara Grove, R-Lower Brule, encouraged lawmakers on the committee to explore the path that leads a person to prison and reasons why people reoffend. In better understanding those areas, the state can intervene, deter and help people while they’re in their home, she added.

Doing so would be cheaper, healthier, and keep a community intact — especially given the number of Native Americans removed from their communities due to incarceration, Grove said.
Grove, along with Sen. Kevin Jensen, R-Canton, discussed the possibility of removing a person’s felony conviction from their record for certain crimes after an amount of time or after rehabilitation, to help with reintegration and recidivism. Felons are not allowed to live in certain neighborhoods, can’t have some jobs and can’t own a gun.
“I think, at some point, it has to be where the person has paid for their crime and they move back to wholeness in whatever way that looks,” Grove said. “I think that’s a really big part of re-entry.”
The committee’s next meeting will be held in July in the Rapid City area.

The Republican-led state Senate passed both measures earlier this year. Senate Bill 227 targets K-12 education, while Senate Bill 558 focuses on public colleges and universities. The bills would prohibit what sponsors describe as “divisive concepts” from being taught in the classroom.
During a debate in the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday morning, where the bills were first heard before moving to the Rules Committee, Republicans argued the legislation prevents teaching that one race is superior to another. Opponents, however, contend the bills will chill academic freedom and honest discussions about historical oppression.
Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said Senate Bill 227 “sends a painful message that valuing diversity, equity and inclusion is somehow wrong, that standing up for every child and teaching every student that they matter is wrong.”
The ACLU of North Carolina warned the bills raise constitutional concerns and could lead to self-censorship among educators.
“These bills will censor curricula on race, gender and the lived experiences of marginalized groups in the classroom,” said Reighlah Collins, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina, during a public comment portion of the committee hearing.
Part of a broader anti-DEI campaign
The push against DEI in schools is part of a broader attack on the concepts by Republican lawmakers in the state and across the country. Another bill, House Bill 171 (“Equality in State Agencies/Prohibition on DEI”) would ban state agencies from promoting, supporting, funding, implementing or maintaining workplace DEI, including in hirings, dedicated staff positions and offering or requiring DEI training. 
The bill passed the House along party lines in April, and the Senate currently considering a newer version of the bill.
Both Senate Bill 227 and 558 now move to the House floor for a vote.
To overcome a potential veto from Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, House Republicans would need at least one Democrat to vote with them.

Ned Lamont has turned to repairing relationships frayed by his vetoes of priorities of Democrats and party legislative leaders.,"Gov. Ned Lamont has turned to repairing relationships frayed by his vetoes of an omnibus housing bill and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, both priorities of various elements of the Democratic coalition and its party’s legislative leaders.
Lamont’s veto of the housing bill came without a courtesy call to House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, one of the bill’s key sponsors and a man with whom the governor’s administration now must negotiate to save portions of the most significant housing bill to reach the governor’s desk.
A call to Rojas was one of the first Lamont made after the veto Monday. Another went to Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, the labor federation that worked successfully with the Democratic governor on a significant list of first-term labor victories.
The challenge now facing Lamont became clear in two very different conversations: one with a legislative leader who sees and is ready to grasp the building blocks of a housing deal; the other with a union man who sees Lamont unfeeling about workers and immovable on an issue that has come to the fore for labor.
“I was very frank with him,” Hawthorne said in an interview Tuesday. “The state elected Democrats, and Democrats put two bills on his desk that would have made a difference to working people. And he sided with Republicans.”
Lamont cast himself as a labor ally, a Democrat horrified at the Trump administration’s efforts to cripple the influence of public sector unions in the federal workforce and its removal of labor-friendly members of the National Labor Relations Board.
“I think about labor rights, and I think about what the Trump administration is doing to the NLRB and the rights of our workers to organize, rights of our workers to stand up to themselves. We’re trying to do everything we can,” Lamont said Tuesday at a public event at the state Capitol.
In his veto message the previous day about Senate Bill 8, which would have provided jobless benefits to strikers in Connecticut, the governor enumerated the first-term victories he helped deliver for the labor movement.
They included a higher minimum wage, a nearly universal mandate for paid sick time, paid family and medical leave coverage, expanded collective bargaining rights for public employees, and protections for workers who leave captive audience meetings. 
“Connecticut workers are the backbone of our economy,” Lamont wrote in his message. “I strongly support their right to organize, advocate for better conditions, and be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace.”
Hawthorne acknowledged the governor did those things, but he noted that federal labor law largely preempts states from enhancing the standing of unions to organize workers or negotiate contracts. One notable exception, Hawthorne said, is a state’s ability to remove the prohibition on striking workers collecting unemployment.
“When we asked him to sit down to talk about the [strikers’] bill, the response was, ‘Think of something else,’” Hawthorne said. “But everything else was preempted by federal law.”
The governor, who was elected in 2018, reelected in 2022 and is considering running again in 2026, also has a what-have-you-done-lately problem with labor.
“There’s first-term Ned Lamont and second-term Ned Lamont,” Hawthorne said. “He mentions the minimum wage — first term; paid family leave — first term; expanded collective bargaining — first term.”
The list goes on.
“We can’t live off the past when the president and Congress want to destroy every gain we’ve made in the last 15 years,” Hawthorne said. “We need a fighter, like first term Ned.”
Only New York and New Jersey provide jobless benefits for strikers. Oregon just passed legislation that would do so. Lamont has supporters strikers in Connecticut, sometimes visiting picket lines.
“But I think paying striking workers is a bridge too far and doesn’t help our cause. I think that some people say … ‘you’re too pro-labor’ or ‘you’re too pro-business,’ ” Lamont said. “I think I’m pro-jobs, and I want to watch out for any bill which I think discourages jobs in this state.”
Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, a retired UAW executive, said there is little room for compromise on the strikers’ bill, which would have provided jobless benefits after two weeks out of work. Passage eventually will come, but probably not while Lamont is governor, she said.
“I do like the governor. He is right on so many issues, but he is so wrong on this,” said Kushner, who called Lamont “stubborn.”

Gary Winfield, left, and Rep. Jason Rojas. Rojas is now negotiating with Lamont over a new housing bill. Credit: MARK PAZNIOKAS / CTMIRROR.ORG
On housing, there is room to negotiate.
Rojas ignored the slight of a veto that came without a heads-up and focused on the possibility to salvage the essence of House Bill 5002. 
Among other things, it would have required municipalities to set “fair share” goals for affordable housing, prioritize state aid to communities that build housing, and streamline approval for so-called “middle housing,” defined as a building with two to nine units.
Rojas said he was encouraged at the governor’s seeming support for establishing the conversion of commercial lots as something developers can do “as of right” for middle housing. But he was concerned that Lamont, in his view, seemed overly deferential to municipal officials.
The governor expects local officials will come to the table and negotiate a new version of 5002 over the next 90 days.
“I’m skeptical,” Rojas said. “In 45 days, most will be thinking about being up for election.”
The Connecticut Mirror reached Rojas by telephone after he finished a panel discussion at Princeton University on fair housing. The event was tied to the 50th anniversary of New Jersey adopting a fair-share requirement for municipalities to assess affordable housing needs.
In 1975, the New Jersey Supreme Court established the “Mount Laurel Doctrine,” requiring all communities to take responsibility for a share of a region’s affordable housing needs. The decision came in a challenge to restrictive zoning, and it kicked off further litigation and decades of legislation.
Rojas said participants were consoling and encouraging, reminding him that passing significant housing bills is a marathon, as they learned after Mount Laurel. Rojas, whose daughter is a runner, is hoping for a shorter race.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7912-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state’s correctional officers can sue the Department of Corrections as a class in an effort to get compensation for the time it takes the officers to be screened by security when coming to and leaving from work. 
In 2020, an officer filed a class action lawsuit against DOC arguing that the pre and post shift activities should be compensated. A Milwaukee County judge divided the case into two parts, separating the certification of correctional officers as a class from the evaluation of their argument on the merits. 
The circuit court judge granted the motion for class certification but that decision was reversed by the court of appeals, which ruled that the officers couldn’t be certified as a class because their argument was unlikely to be successful. 
In a majority opinion written by Justice Janet Protasiewicz, the Court reversed the appeals court’s decision, stating that to certify a class action lawsuit a judge must determine if the group at issue has a common question without evaluating the answer to that question.
DOC-ClassAction
“There is a difference between identifying whether a common question exists and deciding its answer,” Protasiewicz wrote. “A court ‘must walk a balance between evaluating evidence to determine whether a common question exists and predominates, without weighing that evidence to determine whether the plaintiff class will ultimately prevail on the merits.’”
Protasiewicz’s opinion was joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Rebecca Dallet, Brian Hagedorn and Jill Karofsky. Chief Justice Annette Ziegler wrote a partial concurrence, which was joined by Justice Rebecca Bradley. 
The attorney for the DOC officers who brought the case said in a statement that his clients appreciate the Court’s decision.
“Our clients appreciate the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s well-reasoned decision reversing the Court of Appeals and reinstating the Circuit Court’s decision to certify a class of Wisconsin corrections officers,” the attorney, Michael Flannery, said in the statement. “Corrections officers are the largest officer force in the State of Wisconsin, and do a vital and incredibly difficult job. It is simply unfair that, for years, Wisconsin has forced them to do unpaid work before and after their shifts. We look forward to litigating this case through trial and getting some of Wisconsin’s hardest workers the economic justice they so deserve.”

Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday the state is filing three lawsuits against CVS and its affiliates alleging they engaged in “unfair, deceptive, and unlawful” trade practices. (Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday the state is filing three lawsuits against CVS and its affiliates alleging they engaged in “unfair, deceptive, and unlawful” trade practices. 
Joined by dozens of independent pharmacists at the state Capitol, Landry and Murrill condemned the company for using customer information to launch a political text message campaign earlier this month. The messages called on recipients, including state employees, to oppose a bill in the Louisiana Legislature that would have prohibited pharmacies from also owning pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which operate as “middlemen” that oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers. The bill failed to pass both chambers before the session ended. 
Caremark, a CVS subsidiary, holds the PBM contract with the state Office of Group Benefits, which provides prescription coverage for most state employees and public school teachers.     
Critics of PBMs argue they are responsible for high medication prices, and independent pharmacists allege they unfairly favor large corporate pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens. Some of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, including CVS, also operate a PBM. 
In the final days of the legislative session, which ended earlier this month, CVS sent texts to customers saying the legislation would cause them to close all of their pharmacy locations in Louisiana. First Lady Sharon Landry was among the recipients, the governor shared Tuesday, as was Murrill. 
The governor directed Murrill to investigate the text messages, which led to the lawsuits, she said. All three were filed in St. Landry Parish.

“They used our information to lobby for their own corporate interests and to scare people into lobbying on their behalf,” Murrill said. “At least one or two of those text messages that I saw … threatened seniors, veterans and people with serious healthcare conditions, and said that you might not be able to get your medication, or if you do, you may have to pay more.” 
“All of those things are deceptive, in my opinion, and certainly misleading,” Murrill added. 
In an emailed statement, CVS spokeswoman Amy Thibault said the text messages were legal. The company denies using information obtained from state employees from the Office of Group Benefits. 
The first of Murrill’s lawsuits directly addresses the text messages, which she alleges was an improper use of customer data as well as a violation of “established standards of decency.” 
The second lawsuit targets the CVS “vertical integration” model, in which one company controls multiple stages of the supply chain. 
“Just like Congress prohibited all companies from owning the gas pump, we should ban PBMs from monopolizing so that they own the drug counter,” Landry said. “When you let middlemen control everything, it’s not a free market. It’s a rigged market.” 
“By combining health care delivery, pharmacy, health care benefits, and pharmacy benefit management, we make it easier for people to have what they want the most: a connected care experience,” Thibault said in the CVS statement. 
The third lawsuit alleges CVS’s business practices violate Louisiana’s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, harming the state’s independent pharmacies. 
In a news release, Murrill alleged CVS uses its industry influence to impose “unethical and exceedingly high fees” on independent pharmacies under threat of being expelled from the CVS network. 
“CVS is abusing its enormous market power to engage in covert spread pricing to further enrich itself at the expense of the independent pharmacies in its network,” Murrill wrote in her news release.
Critics have accused PBMs of spread pricing, when health plan providers or large employers are charged higher prices for prescription drugs than what the PBMs pay the pharmacy that fills the order. PBMs then keep the “spread” as profit.
PBMs insist spread pricing places the risk on their business when pharmacies raise their prices to fill prescriptions, forcing the PMBs to eat any costs. When there is a spread, PBMs say it goes toward their administrative expenses. The goal is to encourage consistent pricing for coverage plans and customers, according to PMBs.   
While Landry previously promised to call the legislature back to Baton Rouge for a special session to address PBMs, he said Tuesday he will first explore the possibility of taking unilateral executive branch action. 
Landry says he is convening a working group, that will include Murrill, to explore what options are available to him.

While legislation to prohibit pharmacies from owning PBMs failed, legislators did pass House Bill 264 by Rep. Mike Echols, R-Monroe, which requires PBMs to be more transparent with their practices with state regulators and pass on more savings to customers. Landry announced his intention to sign the legislation.

According to May data released Tuesday, the preliminary state unemployment rate ticked up from the revised 2.7% rate for May 2024.
Prior to the pandemic, Nebraska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was consistently around 3% then shot up above 8% during the pandemic before dropping to around 2% and then rising to the 3% mark in February.

According to other newly released labor data, Nebraska ranks No. 6 among states with the lowest seasonally adjusted unemployment rates. The national rate for May 2025 is 4.2%, unchanged from the previous month and up from the 4.0% reported for May 2024.
Nebraska labor officials have said the higher unemployment rate of late appears to be driven by an increase in the state labor force. They said when a person begins searching for work, he or she is classified as unemployed until finding a job.
The Nebraska Department of Labor reports that the total number of filled nonfarm jobs reached a historic high in May, with 1,073,696 jobs. 
“This surpasses the prior high in October of 2024 by over 5,000 filled jobs,” Nebraska Labor Commissioner Katie Thurber said in a Tuesday news release.
Private Nebraska industries with the most growth compared to the same month a year ago were private education and health services (up 6,599 jobs) and leisure and hospitality (up 4,217 jobs).
Numbers of employed and unemployed people in the labor force are based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey that asks a person’s employment status. 
The labor force includes both employed workers and those actively looking for work. Those not working or seeking a job are not considered part of the labor force and are held out of the unemployment rate calculation.

Mike Braun answers reporter questions about execution drugs on Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in Indianapolis. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun confirmed Tuesday that Indiana spent more than $1 million in taxpayer funds to purchase four doses of execution drugs — some which were used, and several others that expired.
He also clarified that the drugs were purchased in two transactions — one under former Gov. Eric Holcomb and one by him.
In total, $1.175 million was spent, Braun said. But two of those — worth $600,000 — expired with no use because “they had been on the shelf too long.”
Braun emphasized Tuesday, however, that neither of the doses used by the Indiana Department of Correction in December and May were expired when administered to inmates.
Reporting by the Indiana Capitol Chronicle previously revealed that at least $900,000 was spent by Holcomb’s administration to purchase pentobarbital. The execution drug was used in December to carry out the death penalty for convicted killer Joseph Corcoran, and again in May for the execution of Benjamin Ritchie.
Braun says Indiana is out of execution drugs, signals willingness to debate capital punishment

“It was tricky, because if you acquired it, and there was some type of glitch, then you go into the same thing that happened with the Holcomb administration, which bought three (doses) — anticipating more (executions). But in course, two expired, so we were careful to make sure it looked like all the administrative parts (of the judicial process) were done,” Braun said, adding that his administration waited until “right before” Ritchie’s execution before buying any new doses of the drug.
“We knew that was going to be a fait accompli,” he continued. “I was careful, so that it looked like (the execution) was going to take place, and not have something occur. And that was a little tricky. But at that point, the Indiana Supreme Court and the parole board would have been all that was left to get through. Administratively, that looked like it had a pretty defined time frame. … It was a question of when you were going to actually get it and not be stranded with it.”
Braun denied Ritchie clemency less than a week before the execution.
Braun’s office confirmed Tuesday that his predecessor paid $900,000 for three doses of the drug. Only one of those doses was used, however; the other two doses expired. Braun said earlier this month that the drug has a 90-shelf life.
After taking office, Braun authorized an additional purchase of the drug earlier this year for $275,000. That covered one dose of pentobarbital, used for Ritchie’s May 20 execution.
It’s not clear when exactly the state acquired the doses or where they were purchased from. State law protects the identity of the seller from public scrutiny. State officials had previously declined to provide details about how much pentobarbital was purchased, and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
“You’re dealing with a source of (the execution drugs) that’s very hard to pin down,” Braun said. “If it’s going to be available, it’s not like you can get it from several places.”
The governor additionally reiterated his desire for state lawmakers to weigh in.
“I’m going to encourage the state legislature to look at it — in terms of, is that what we’re going to use, and then on the issue itself,” he said, referring to capital punishment and lethal injections. “I’m very agnostic on that. I want them to weigh in.”

The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.

Today, I’m suing the Trump Administration alongside 19 other states and Washington DC to stop them from arbitrarily canceling funding owed to Pennsylvania.

But Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert—for the first time— that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.

In Rhode Island, cuts have affected a pair of University of Rhode Island research  grants funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and National Science Foundation, along with modernization of the state unemployment insurance system via U.S. Department of Labor funding.
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) Years of drought conditions on Iowa’s western edge have lowered water levels at Blue Lake and impacted recreation at the lake. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is hosting a public meeting Thursday in Onawa to discuss the low water levels and the department’s ongoing studies and lake restoration projects at Blue Lake. 
200 years ago, when the Lewis and Clark expedition came through the region, the oxbow lake was an active channel of the Missouri River, but now it is fed by a small watershed off of the Missouri River, and is located in Lewis and Clark State Park just west of Onawa. 
According to DNR’s annual lake restoration report, Blue Lake has a number of “aesthetically objectionable conditions” like algal blooms, and low water clarity that contributed to decreased recreational use. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
 Since the early 2000s DNR has been working to restore the lake via chemical restoration, removal of “rough” fish and selective dredging. 
Water levels in the Missouri River have been “especially low” over the past five winters, which led to low groundwater levels in the region and impacted not only Blue Lake levels, but water in communities throughout western Iowa.
The lake is currently about five feet below its crest elevation, or the fullest pool of the lake. Ben Wallace, a fisheries biologist who has worked on Blue Lake’s restoration projects said drop means the lake has about one third of its full-pool volume. 
Wallace said the informational meeting Thursday will help address concerns within the community about the low lake levels and to explain DNR’s work at Blue Lake. 
“When we enter into these drought cycles, access gets tougher at these lakes, because the water starts to recede from the shoreline,” Wallace said. “And yeah, some lakes get hit harder than others with the drought.” 
According to the DNR report, the Lake Restoration Program spent about $10,000 on a dredging and fish barrier project at Blue Lake in the 2023-2024 fiscal year and allocated $265,000 in fiscal year 2025 for well and pump assessment, fish renovation and containment site improvements at the lake. 
Wallace said some folks in the community have questioned if the DNR’s dredging work contributed to the lake’s low levels, but he said lake restoration work is done very “systematically” with the “entire picture” in mind. 
Iowans across the state asked to conserve water due to dry wells, high nitrate levels

“We just don’t go into things blind,” Wallace said. “We get a pretty good understanding of things before we execute large scale construction projects like this.” 
Plus, Wallace said this isn’t the first time Blue Lake has had levels this low. He said historic maps of the region show levels just as low, if not lower in the 1930s. 
“All of these lakes that I’ve had throughout my district have gone through drought cycles about once every 10 to 12 years, and sometimes those droughts are more severe and they’re a little bit longer than other but in my experience, they all bounce back,” Wallace said. 
He said water levels in the lake are about on par with groundwater levels in the region. That type of drought takes more than just a good rain to replenish.
“Each year a successive drought just takes that much more to recharge the groundwater level,” Wallace said. “It’s going to have to be a return to average or above average precipitation levels for some time, because we’re not just talking about bringing up the lake — we’re talking about bringing up the water in the ground.”
Restoration work at the lake has also addressed turbidity, or water clarity, by eliminating and blocking common carp from the lake. 
Wallace said these bottom-feeding fish continually stir up the sediment on the bottom of the lake which causes cloudy water, poor conditions for other fish and makes it easier for algae to bloom on the surface. 
Wallace said common carp are a problem at a lot of lakes in Iowa, but high densities in Blue Lake have impacted the water quality. DNR’s lake restoration efforts included the installation of fish barriers and aggressive carp angling in the lake to help reduce the common carp populations. 
In addition to the work to restore the lake, Lewis and Clark State Park Manager Nathan Fylstra said his team has been working hard to improve the state park with updates to the visitor’s center, improved drainage systems and a general clean up of ditches and fences. 
“We’ve been changing a lot of stuff, revamping a lot of stuff,” Fylstra said. “It should look a lot better.” 
The park is adjacent to the 250-acre Blue Lake, which typically hosts summer swimmers, boaters and anglers. 
Wallace encouraged anyone with an interest in Blue Lake to attend the informational meeting Thursday at the Onawa Community Center, 320 10th Street, at 5:30 p.m. 
“Show up and ask questions,” Wallace said. “I am looking forward to the opportunity to demonstrate the lengths that we went to in studying this lake and this lake system.”

(Screenshot of livestreamed meeting)COLUMBIA — Columbia no longer bans so-called conversion therapy for minors following City Council’s second 4-3 vote Tuesday to repeal the 4-year-old rule.
The repeated split vote — exactly one week after the first one — came without debate, despite residents’ pleas over roughly an hour to “fight back” against Republicans seeking the Governor’s Mansion. It was the final vote needed to undo the ordinance threatening a $500 fine for licensed therapists who attempt to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of an LGBTQ+ minor.
No one has been fined under the rule since its inception, according to the mayor’s office.
Mayor Daniel Rickenmann, among the four who voted “yes” to repeal, has said the ordinance lacks teeth to actually do anything, noting every case reported as a potential violation involved a religious group not covered by the ban.
But advocates of LGBTQ residents called it an important symbol of support and acceptance, as well as a stand against what they said should be called conversion trauma.
The vote ensures Columbia won’t miss out on its $3.7 million share of aid for local governments in the state budget that takes effect July 1. A clause inserted in the budget during the Senate debate threatened to yank the state aid of any city with such a ban, and Columbia is the only city that has one.
Council members twice delayed voting on the repeal as they waited to see whether the clause would survive budget negotiations and become law, which it did.
Additionally, Attorney General Alan Wilson threatened in April to sue over the local rule he contends violates both state law and constitutional free speech rights.
The meeting came a day after both Wilson and the author of the clause, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, announced their bids for governor. Advocates for the rule who spoke out Tuesday told council members they shouldn’t be helping the Republicans’ campaigns and letting them boss the city around.
“For y’all to give in and capitulate without a battle of any kind is strange to me. Where is the outrage?” asked Dr. Isabelle Mandell, a city resident. “You haven’t tried. You haven’t fought it.”
Attorney Nekki Shutt offered to represent the city for free to defend the rule and challenge the budget clause she called an unconstitutional violation of home rule.
“The city of Columbia is a refuge city in South Carolina for LGBTQ people. It’s where we can feel safe,” she said, adding she never expected to become a South Carolinian. “I laid down roots because I feel safe here.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/columbia-City-council-vote-1024x510.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

Federal lawmakers are scrambling to approve the massive bill, which is replete with major tax cuts and public program reductions, before the Fourth of July. Since the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act was first proposed, Medicaid has been slated for billions in cuts, which has caused advocates and health providers to warn communities and elected officials of dire consequences.
Across the country, rural hospitals will face $70 billion in cuts over the next decade under the current version of the bill.
A report from the National Rural Health Association and Manatt Health, released Tuesday, found that rural hospitals will lose 21 cents out of every dollar they receive for funding Medicaid, the joint state and federal public health insurance program that serves more than 360,000 Kansans.
Kansas is now set to lose more than $4 billion in Medicaid funding if the bill passes in its current form, according to updated estimates from the Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. The total losses increased by nearly $280 million after changes to the bill in the U.S. Senate.
Cuts to Medicaid are “best done with a scalpel and not with a machete,” Anderson said during a Tuesday press briefing hosted by the rural health association.
Anderson said he is interested in stewardship of federal funds, but cuts to Medicaid aren’t the right way to do it. Those cuts don’t just threaten the accessibility of the health care system for those on Medicaid but for the entire system, he said.
“Cutting Medicaid actually doesn’t save money because it sends people into the emergency department, where they get the most expensive and inefficient and inappropriate care for their ailment,” he said.
Difficulty accessing quality care, inadequate insurance and existing financial distress are already playing out in the Hutchinson Regional Health Care System, Anderson said. The hospital in Hutchinson, which serves around 100,000 people in central Kansas, must prepare for federal cuts while cutting its own budget by $7.5 million, along with shouldering costs for people without insurance.
“The story of Hutchinson, Kansas, is the story of middle America,” Anderson said.
More than half of rural hospitals in Kansas are at risk of closing, and the report found that Kansas would experience a 15% reduction in total rural Medicaid hospital reimbursement under the proposed bill. Plus, 5,000 Kansans enrolled in Medicaid are expected to lose coverage, according to the report.
The proposed bill passed the U.S. House by a one-vote margin May 22. The U.S. Senate is expected to conduct negotiations this week.
Cindy Mann with Manatt Health, an arm of a national law and consulting firm, said during the press briefing that the cuts to public programs, including Medicaid, within the proposal are designed to reduce spending to partially offset the costs of lost revenue from tax cuts.
“In some states, the cuts are really big, and in other states, they’re bigger,” she said.
Half of all children and one in five adults in rural communities across America rely on Medicaid. Half of all births in rural communities are paid for by Medicaid, according to the report.
All the while, rural health providers are struggling to keep their doors open, Mann said.
The Kansas Republican Congressional delegation has been publicly supportive of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act. Other Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, have said they won’t vote for a bill that cuts Medicaid benefits and targets rural hospitals, according to reporting from Stateline. The U.S. Senate could create a rural hospital stabilization fund to mitigate Medicaid cuts, but specifics on negotiations have yet to be released.
 
In the red
One of Craig Thompson’s greatest fears is what federal cuts might do to maternity care access. Mothers on Medicaid are nearly three times more likely to experience a bad health outcome than a mother on commercial insurance, said Thompson, CEO of Golden Valley Memorial Healthcare in Clinton, Missouri.
Twelve rural hospitals have already closed in Missouri in recent years.
“But that doesn’t really tell the full story,” he said.
At existing care facilities in the state, shifts in the type of care offered have created a lack of health services in rural communities, especially when it comes to maternity care. A similar story has played out in Kansas, where maternity care deserts are commonplace in rural areas.
As CEO of the HCC Network, a collection of six community health centers serving rural areas in Missouri, Toniann Richard often uses the term “whack-a-mole” to describe the necessary approach to the everyday challenges of being a health care leader.
She also used the term to characterize the feeling patients experience when they lose their coverage, which is expected to become more common under the federal proposal. They don’t know what to do, Richard said.
Based on Richard’s unit cost of health care analysis, the fewer people who are insured, the higher the cost of health care will be.
Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, said the federal proposal threatens the viability of rural facilities by eliminating Medicaid coverage and reducing access to care for rural patients.
“It’s very clear that Medicaid cuts will result in rural hospital closures, resulting in loss of access to care for those living in rural America,” he said in a press release.
An updated analysis commissioned by the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and REACH Healthcare Foundation and conducted by Manatt Health predicts Kansas will lose a combined $826 million in federal and state Medicaid funds in the first year of cuts and $4.05 billion over 10 years. Of that total, Kansas  hospitals are expected to lose $664 million in state and federal Medicaid funding in the first year and $2.8 billion over 10 years. 
Based on updated modeling, about 13,000 fewer Kansans would be able to enroll in Medicaid, which could lead to increased uninsured rates, according to the analysis.
David Jordan, president and CEO of the health fund, encouraged lawmakers to strengthen rural health systems instead of weakening them through the proposal.
“Our hope was for the Senate to protect rural hospitals and minimize coverage loss,” he said in a news release. “However, the plan the Senate is rushing through the process will cut $4 billion from our Medicaid program and make it harder to sustain health care in rural Kansas communities.”
Brenda Sharpe, president and CEO at REACH Healthcare Foundation, said rural hospitals will be uniquely challenged if Medicaid cuts pass. They are often sole sources of preventative care, prenatal visits and mental health support. The cuts put entire communities at risk, she said.
Sixty-three rural hospitals in Kansas are facing closure, and 87% of hospitals in Kansas are operating in the red, according to the fund. Twenty-six are at immediate risk of closure.
“Without them,” Sharpe said, “families may be forced to go without care altogether.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2170045-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSeveral organizations dedicated to preserving free speech and protecting members of the press are calling for the release of a prominent immigration reporter who was detained while covering a protest in Atlanta earlier this month and is now on track to be deported.
Mario Guevara, an Emmy-award winning Spanish language reporter based in metro Atlanta, was initially charged with improperly entering a roadway, obstruction of law enforcement officers and unlawful assembly, all of which were misdemeanors. An immigrant from El Salvador, Guevara had been a legal resident of the U.S. for more than 20 years. However, the misdemeanor charges after his arrest allowed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to place a detainer on him, paving the way for a potential deportation.
He was later transferred into ICE custody and charged with three additional misdemeanors from the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office for distracted driving, failure to obey a traffic control device, and reckless driving, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Body camera footage obtained by the AJC showed Guevara wearing both a helmet and vest marking him as a member of the press as he was arrested, alarming free press advocates. He had been covering a protest against the Trump administration’s immigration policies.
“At the time of his arrest, Guevara was wearing a press vest and clearly identified himself to law enforcement,” Katherine Jacobsen of the nonprofit organization Committee to Protect Journalists wrote in a letter to DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Lorraine Cochran-Johnson. “Video footage indicates that Guevara was in no way obstructing police activity but rather documenting the protest, a matter of public interest.”
In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the Committee to Protect Journalists and other free press advocates including the Atlanta Press Club, the Georgia First Amendment Foundation and the Georgia chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists urged her to facilitate Guevara’s release.
“We request that he be released on bond and that removal proceedings against him, which were triggered by three misdemeanor charges that seem to conflict with his First Amendment rights as a journalist, be dropped unequivocally and immediately,” the letter states. “If Guevara’s case proceeds, it would represent a grim erosion of both freedom of the press and the rule of law. Journalists who are not U.S. citizens could be at risk of deportation solely because local law enforcement filed misdemeanor charges against them in retaliation for reporting without those charges ever being tried in court.”
Department of Homeland Security’s official account disputed media coverage of the arrest in a post on the social media site X, and confirmed that Guevara “was turned over to ICE custody and has been placed in removal proceedings.”
Guevara is currently being held at the Folkston ICE Processing Center in South Georgia, which is set to become the largest immigrant detention facility in the United States. His legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Titus and Horsford photos by Jeniffer Solis, Lee photo by Michael Lyle)The Democrats within Nevada’s congressional delegation are divided in their reactions to the U.S. bombing of Iran, with more progressive members condemning President Donald Trump’s unilateral actions and moderates signaling some level of support.
U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat and the longest-serving member of the delegation, on Tuesday voted to advance articles of impeachment against Trump introduced by U.S. Rep. Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, for abuses of power.
The Trump administration carried out the bombings of three nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend without providing notice and justification to Congressional leaders, a departure from standard protocol but an increasingly popular shortcut for recent presidents.
Green’s efforts were not expected to get far given Republican control of the House. Titus acknowledged as much in a televised interview Sunday, when she was asked by ABC News about U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s separate public call for impeachment. The “votes aren’t there” to impeach Trump, Titus said.
Titus criticized Trump for launching a war “that Congress has not authorized, Nevadans don’t support, and Trump himself said he would never pursue.”
The House vote Tuesday to table Green’s resolution was 344-79, with all Republicans and 128 Democrats voting to stop the effort. Titus was the only Nevada representative to vote to keep the resolution alive.
Titus told ABC News she signed onto a War Powers Resolution “to prevent further U.S. involvement without Congressional approval.” That bipartisan resolution is sponsored by U.S. Reps. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California.
Like Titus, U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat, issued a statement condemning Trump. He released the statement Monday after Iran retaliated against the U.S. with attacks of its own.
“Right now, air sirens are blaring at U.S. bases across the Middle East because President Trump ignored the dangers that his impulsive air strikes posed for our military personnel,” he said.
Those attacks, on a U.S. military base in Qatar, resulted in no U.S. casualties, national media would later report.
Horsford emphasized that the president “has no authority to entangle the United States in a new war” and that “Congress has not authorized the use of military force.”
He continued, “Trump’s unilateral use of force threatens our troops, undermines our leadership on the world stage, and flies in the face of our Constitution. This Administration must be held accountable, and Congress must assert itself to ensure the American people have a voice in decisions of war and peace.”
While Titus and Horsford outright condemned Trump’s actions, the remaining three members of Nevada’s Democratic delegation in Washington D.C. issued statements suggesting they may find the actions justified.
U.S. Rep. Susie Lee posted on social media that she was awaiting a briefing on “the intelligence that led to the strike and on the status of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.”
She added, “I remain firm in my commitment that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. It cannot be forgotten that the Iranian regime is responsible for funding global terrorism and killing Americans. The regime’s goal is to access nuclear weapons to use against America, Israel, and our other allies.”
U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen similarly did not condemn the actions. In a statement, she thanked the military service members “for carrying out this limited, targeted, and hopefully decisive action.”
She continued, “The Iranian Regime has made it clear that they will do everything in their power to destroy the United States and Israel, and their nuclear program has been a means to that end.”
Rosen did, however, say in her statement that the president “must involve Congress before taking any further military action against Iran and must respect Congress’s sole constitutional role in the authorization of the use of force.”
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in her statement said the Trump administration “must come before Congress with a detailed plan for how to protect our service members and bases overseas, prevent Iran from restarting their nuclear program, and get Iran back to the negotiating table diplomatically.”
She continued, “I stand ready to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure we continue to support Israel and keep Americans and our allies safe. But this administration must not push the U.S. into a war with Iran.”
As of Tuesday afternoon, Israel and Iran appeared to be honoring a ceasefire announced by Trump the day prior. However, that shaky status came after a night of bombings from both sides, which drew the ire of Trump.

Patrick Morrisey’s vaccination exemption mandate previously co-sponsored a religious freedom bill that’s being used as the governor’s justification for the order.
On Tuesday, Morrisey held a press conference in Beckley, West Virginia, to announce that a mother had filed a lawsuit against the Raleigh County Board of Education after the state school board recently announced it wouldn’t recognize the governor’s executive order allowing religious exemptions to school immunizations.
The Republican governor says his vaccine executive order is legally permissible under a 2023 bill known as the “Equal Protection for Religion Act” after House of Delegates members lawmakers killed a bill that would have put religious exemptions for childhood vaccinations in state law. 
The lawsuit was assigned to Raleigh County Circuit Court Judge Todd Kirby, who, while serving as a Republican in the House of Delegates, vehemently advocated for the religious freedom bill. 
Kirby joined 10 other Republicans to sponsor the broad bill that says no state action may substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion unless it’s essential to a compelling government interest.
While speaking on the House floor, Kirby said that — in his view — the government had infringed on residents’ religious rights, including what was being taught in classrooms. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, he also cited vaccine requirements as an example.
“For people that are very well-educated on the effects of vaccines, both the side effects and benefits, we told them you don’t have a choice; you have to get vaccinated even if it violates your most fervently held religious beliefs,” Kirby said during bill debate. 
Kirby, who has served as judge since 2024, did not respond to an email for this story with questions about whether he should recuse himself from the case. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, who was in the House in 2023, raised concerns during bill debate that it would be used to weaken West Virginia’s strict childhood immunization laws. The state has been one of only a handful that hasn’t permitted religious exemptions to school vaccination requirements.
“I have a lot of respect for Judge Kirby, and I expect that he’s going to recuse himself. It’s less of an ask, I expect he’s going to do that because that’s the only thing you can do in this type of situation where he’s voted and advocated for the underlying bill just a couple years ago,” Garcia said on Tuesday.
Garcia said there is precedent that other judges, who served as lawmakers in the House and Senate, recused themselves when case analysis involved legislation they’d voted on.
While a lawmaker, Kirby also co-sponsored a 2024 bill that would have eliminated childhood immunization requirements for private and parochial schools. The bill passed the House and Senate, but former Gov. Jim Justice vetoed the legislation, citing childhood health concerns. 
The West Virginia Democratic Party has also called on Kirby to recuse himself from the case.
“Judge Todd Kirby should recuse himself from hearing this case. As a former member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, he cast a vote and spoke in favor of the so-called ‘Religious Freedom Restoration Act’ — legislation that is central to the legal arguments now before him. That alone should raise serious concerns under the West Virginia Code of Judicial Ethics,” Mike Pushkin, state Democratic Party chair, said in a statement. 
“West Virginians have a right to expect an impartial hearing when it comes to matters affecting the health and safety of their children. Judge Kirby’s continued involvement in this case would violate that principle,” he continued. 
Garcia said he voted against the 2023 religious freedom bill because, “I thought that there was the potential that someone would try to use the law as a weapon to take down the other laws that we’ve had for public safety.”
“I think that Gov. Morrisey has been so aggressive in trying to make a change to the law that he’s really just picking fights wherever he can, and unfortunately for him, he’s losing those fights, and I think he’s going to lose,” he said.
The lawsuit was filed in Raleigh County Circuit Court on behalf of Miranda Guzman, whose child, A.G., was issued an exemption to the school vaccine mandates by the state Department of Health based on religious beliefs. 
More than 100 families have requested to use religious exemption to circumvent vaccine requirements the upcoming school year, according to the state health department. 
Morrisey says the religious freedom bill will supersede the current compulsory school vaccination requirements. 
“In my view, and I think the view of many, many people, this applies to the topic of religious exemptions for vaccines,” he said. “And that 2023 law was passed over any of the conflicting laws.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice have filed a writ of mandamus in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised students. That lawsuit seeks to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order. 
Kirby, an attorney, served in the House of Delegates beginning in 2022. He resigned from his seat in 2024 after Former Gov. Jim Justice appointed Kirby to serve in the 10th Judicial Circuit. Kirby won his judicial election and will serve an eight-year term that began Jan. 1.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Five words.
That’s the basis on which 20 Democratic attorneys general, including New Jersey’s Matt Platkin, and one state governor, are contesting sweeping cuts to federal grants and aid in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration.
The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal.
But Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid.
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert—for the first time— that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.
“The Trump Administration and DOGE have mounted an unprecedented campaign to terminate billions of dollars of federal funding to states that supports critical programs for our residents. That reckless slash-and-burn campaign has rested on the flimsiest of legal justifications. And it has continued unabated for months — which is why we’re taking the fight to the Trump Administration to stop these reckless and illegal cuts from continuing,” Platkin said in a statement.
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada.
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.

Tate Reeves to halt the execution of Mississippi's oldest and longest-serving death row inmate.,"A prison reform advocate on Tuesday publicly implored Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to halt the impending execution of Richard Jordan, Mississippi’s oldest and longest-serving death row inmate.
“I’m here today to ask our Christian governor to do the Christian thing and show mercy – mercy on a man that has spent 49 years in prison and has done everything he could do to atone for his crime,” Mitzi Magleby said outside the Mississippi Supreme Court.
Jordan, 79, is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection Wednesday evening at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman for the 1976 kidnapping and killing of a woman in coastal Harrison County.

Reeves declined to block the only two executions Mississippi has carried out since he became governor – one in 2021 and one in 2022. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to an email from Mississippi Today on Tuesday seeking comment on Jordan’s case.
Jordan was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter in Harrison County, and it took four trials until a death sentence stuck in 1998. 
One of Marter’s sons said Jordan should have been executed long ago.
“I don’t want him to get what he wants,” Eric Marter, who is 59 and lives in Lafayette, Louisiana, told Mississippi Today. “If you want to spend the rest of your life in jail, then I would rather you not get that, and if that means you get executed, you get executed.”

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday denied Jordan’s request for a stay of execution. Jordan had a separate request for a stay awaiting consideration at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The appeals court wrote that Jordan has received repeated review of his claims in state and federal courts for nearly 50 years.
At this point, “finality acquires an added moral dimension,” the appeals court wrote. “Only with an assurance of real finality can the State execute its moral judgment in a case. Only with real finality can the victims of crime move forward knowing the moral judgment will be carried out.”
Magleby, who has met Jordan, said he has been a model prisoner and is extremely remorseful. She said she believes life without parole would be a sufficient and humane punishment. 
“I believe that it is more of a penalty to do life without parole,” she said. “The death penalty gives you an out-date. Life without parole does not.”
She also delivered a petition asking Reeves to prevent Jordan’s execution. That petition had more than 3,000 signatures.

The news conference was put on by Magleby and Death Penalty Action, who are supporters of Jordan’s cause.
If Jordan’s execution goes forward as scheduled, supporters plan to hold protest vigils Wednesday outside Parchman and the Governor’s Mansion and online.
Human rights group Amnesty International released a statement Tuesday opposing the execution.
 “Governor Tate Reeves is the only person with the power to spare Jordan’s life,” the group said. “He must use this power to halt this execution, commute Richard Jordan’s sentence and work towards ending the death penalty in Mississippi more broadly.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24114435/Execution-Protest1.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

Kevin Kiley, chair of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, said at the panel’s hearing.“At the same time, child care can be exceedingly expensive — the cost is only climbing,” said the California Republican, whose panel is part of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.Kiley said the Child Care and Development Block Grant “exists to help working families access affordable child care, giving them the freedom to remain in the workforce and increase their economic opportunity, one solution to the problem of child care affordability and access.”The grant, funded at roughly $8.75 billion in fiscal 2024, goes to states, tribes and territories to help low-income working families access child care.Kiley noted that “choice” is a program pillar, “giving parents the freedom to make both lifestyle and economic decisions that best meet their individual family’s needs.”Caitlin Codella Low, managing director of human capital at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank, noted that annually, “the average cost of child care exceeds $10,000 per child, and it’s more than public college tuition in most states, more than the cost of rent in all 50.”“Employers are paying the price — child care challenges lead to higher absenteeism, lower retention and difficulty recruiting talent,” she added.Local programsTodd Barton, the mayor of Crawfordsville, Indiana, highlighted his community’s efforts in addressing a shortage of affordable, high-quality child care.Barton said that shortage has “deeply affected” the community’s workforce and economic potential.Some of those efforts include the formation of a child care task force that evolved into an early childhood coalition, a full-day summer program for school-aged children and an early learning center that Barton said has already increased the community’s child care capacity by more than 30%.Barton said that “to sustain this scale of work, we need strong federal support,” noting that “programs like the Child Care (and) Development Block Grant and Employer-Provided Child Care Credit are essential tools that we need at our disposal.”Dems blast cutsRep. Suzanne Bonamici, ranking member of the subcommittee, said that “without bold and sustained federal investment, child care costs will continue to rise and the workforce that provides the care will continue to struggle.”The Oregon Democrat blasted the proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as part of congressional Republicans’ reconciliation package.Bonamici described Medicaid and SNAP as “programs that support children, families, child care centers and the child care workforce.”She also highlighted the Child Care for Working Families Act, which Virginia’s Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the full committee, and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, reintroduced in their respective chambers during the previous session of Congress.Bonamici said the bill “would cap the cost of child care at 7% of income, making it affordable for all parents and also provide historic investments in the child care workforce, including higher pay, better benefits and improved training opportunities.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made sweeping cuts within the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families.The administration reportedly closed down at least five Office of Head Start regional offices earlier this year.Ruth Friedman, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, said “we are already seeing very bad impacts from those closings.”She added that “local programs are not getting the support and the answers they need, grants are coming slowly to them, which is very, very problematic in Head Start, because they really work month-to-month with their budget and lost an enormous amount of expertise on the local needs those programs serve.”Rep. Summer Lee also called for more federal investment in child care, saying “existing programs are, quite frankly, not cutting it.”“We know that for every dollar we invest in early childhood education, we save substantially more on services that children won’t need as they grow up,” the Pennsylvania Democrat said.She called for passage of the Scott-Murray bill, as well as a measure that would guarantee universal child care access.“This is why we need to pass the Democrats’ legislation like the Child Care for Every Community Act and Child Care for Working Families Act, which I’m looking forward to introducing with Ranking Member Scott in the near future.”",,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

That’s the basis on which 20 Democratic attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, and one state governor, are contesting sweeping cuts to federal grants and aid in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration. The 80-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Tuesday centers on how the Trump administration has interpreted a five-word section of federal regulations to rationalize a “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign,” abruptly terminating billions in already awarded funding to state and local governments, research institutions, universities and more.
The full, 2020 rule promoted by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget states that federal agencies can cut off grants “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” OMB made clear that federal agencies can only terminate grants when there is evidence that the money is not achieving its intended goals or that there is cause to “significantly question” feasibility of achieving the goal. 
But Trump’s administration in a Feb. 26 executive order selectively picked five words from the regulation “no longer effectuates…agency priorities” — to justify abrupt cuts to federal aid. 
“In effectuating this directive, Agency Defendants now assert—for the first time— that the Clause means something completely new: That the Clause permits agencies to terminate grant awards when the agency simply changes its mind,” the lawsuit states.
Since the initial order authorizing the Department of Government Efficiency to get involved in federal agency grant distributions, the same phrase has featured prominently in subsequent orders, agency memos and explanations for slashing billions of dollars in aid to a wide host of recipients across the country.

“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.’ Here, we are proactively asking the Courts to put a stop to the nonsense. The President cannot withhold Congressionally-allocated federal funds from the states, and this clause is no loophole.”
The complaint, which names a dozen federal agency heads as defendants, offers a litany of examples of the consequences of abrupt cuts to already awarded federal grants and aid: losing habitat restoration in Maine, ending efforts to combat hate crimes in New Jersey, ceasing shelter programs for migrants in Illinois released from overcrowded federal detention centers and cutting off research of air quality risks from wildfire smoke in rural Nevada. 
“With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived States of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more,” the lawsuit states.
In Rhode Island, cuts have affected a pair of University of Rhode Island research  grants funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and National Science Foundation, along with modernization of the state unemployment insurance system via U.S. Department of Labor funding.
Even federal aid still flowing remains at risk, compromising safety and support to people who qualify for food assistance programs and those who live in flood zones, farmers, minority students, scientists, and more, the lawsuit states.
Arguing that the federal administration’s actions violate the Administrative Procuredures Act, the AGs have asked a federal judge to permanently clarify that federal regulations do not grant federal agencies “unfettered power” to terminate funding already awarded. Or, as an alternative, they have asked a judge to toss the Trump administration’s interpretation of the clause in question. The request, if granted, would apply to all existing and future federal grants.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice, which is representing the federal agencies, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an email Tuesday.
In addition to Neronha, the other AGs who filed the complaint represent Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)Utah’s measles case count is now up to three, after state health officials on Tuesday reported two more Utahns have been diagnosed with the highly contagious virus. 
Like the state’s first case reported last week, the two additional people who have been infected are adults and unvaccinated, according to a news release issued by the Utah Department of Health and Human services. 
The two additional adults are not linked to each other or the first person who was diagnosed with measles on Friday. They are from different parts of the state, health officials said. One is a Utah County resident, while the other is from the state’s southwest health district. 
“Public health investigations are ongoing to identify any locations where possible exposures may have occurred,” state health officials said. 
First measles case confirmed in Utah amid national outbreaks 

Utahns can monitor the state’s measles case count and find more information about Utah’s response to outbreaks on the state’s website, epi.utah.gov/measles-response/.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the state listed only two potential “exposure locations” and times related to the state’s first confirmed case: Parkway Health Center in Orem, 154 W. 1300 South, from June 13 at 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m., and Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room in Orem, 750 W. 800 North, from June 14 at 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
State officials are encouraging any unvaccinated people who were at these sites during those time frames to monitor themselves for symptoms, stay away from others and call their health care providers. 
“Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure,” state officials said. 
Measles symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure, according to the state health department. Early symptoms include a high fever (higher than 102.2 degrees fahrenheit or 39 degrees celsius), a cough, runny nose or red eyes. A rash typically appears after four days of fever. 
The vast majority of Utahns, more than 90%, have been vaccinated against measles and are “highly protected against infection,” state officials said. However, infants younger than the age of 1 are generally not eligible for the vaccine. 
“These infants are at higher risk of severe disease. If you have an infant younger than age 1 you can talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns and next steps,” state health officials said. “Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women, and people who have weakened immune systems.”
While most Utahns are vaccinated, the state — along with other states in the West — have seen a downward trend in vaccination rates among Utah children in the last five years, Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, told reporters last week. 
Measles outbreak hasn’t hit Utah yet, but health officials are bracing for when it does

“The numbers are still not super low, but they’re low enough to cause us to be concerned that there could be kids who are vulnerable to this, and certainly there are parts of our state or schools that have higher numbers of kids that are not vaccinated,” Nolen said. “So we are concerned that little kids are susceptible to this. There could be an outbreak in a school. So we really would like to encourage people to get them and their children vaccinated.”
Health experts say the most effective protection against measles is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is 97% effective against measles when a person gets two doses. 
Public health officials want to “reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation,” Tuesday’s news release said.

Oklahoma City Police estimated that nearly 500,000 people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder along the nearly two-mile parade route that stretched through downtown to commemorate the Thunder’s first NBA championship since coming to the city in 2008.
They cheered en masse as Thunder players popped champagne and waved at fans.
Maverick Stephenson, of Norman, sat toward the back of the crowd, waiting for the parade to begin. Stephenson, who was covered from the waist up in the Thunder’s trademark blue and orange body paint, said he’s been a longtime Thunder fan.
“I’m really happy,” Stephenson said. “I’ve been a fan for a long time. I was a fan when we were losing a bunch of games, and it feels really good to see your team win.”

He held a handmade poster that read “SGA + DORT Chug A Beer (It’s Canadian),” a reference to Thunder players Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luguentz Dort, who are both from Canada. He said he hoped one of the players would accept the Canadian beer he was holding as they passed by. 
Other fans said they were proud to celebrate their team after finally winning a championship. Some said they had supported the team since they were formerly known as the Seattle SuperSonics and played in Seattle. 
“They overcame a lot of hate and stuck together,” said Makayla Basco, of Mustang. 
She said the team, which is the youngest in nearly 50 years to win an NBA championship, faced a lot of doubt because of their ages and because more people seemed to be rooting for their opponents, the Indiana Pacers. The Thunder beat the Pacers in seven games.
“I was here when Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook almost did it,” Basco said. “Seeing a team that’s just as young as they were to finish it is pretty cool.”
The last time Oklahoma City played in the NBA Finals was in 2012 against the Miami Heat, but they lost that series in five games.















































































































































































Megan Robinson, of Yukon, wore an embroidered Thunder hat and gold lightning earrings to the parade. Robinson said her husband is a diehard Thunder fan. The two have been cheering on the team since the beginning.
“The camaraderie between them is amazing,” she said of the team. “Their teamwork throughout the whole series was amazing.”

Shawn Clay, of Oklahoma City, who was standing with his wife and daughter, attended the parade in a Hawaiian-themed Thunder shirt. His wife and daughter wore Thunder gear and hats.
He said this marked the first time an Oklahoma team has won a major championship, outside of college football, and he wanted to celebrate that accomplishment.
“The team reflects the city, and the city reflects the team we most support,” Clay said.
Adryan Adams, of Oklahoma City, said he’s been a Thunder fan since 2009. He said when he went to college in Texas he often heard people criticize the Thunder.
Now the Thunder has proven that it’s “the best team in the world.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 21:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawsuit challenges billions of dollars in Trump administration funding cuts,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/trump-funding-cuts-lawsuit/,AGs from more than 20 states are seeking to limit Trump administration from relying on an obscure clause to cut grants that don't align with its priorities.,"BOSTON (AP) — Attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C. filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging billions of dollars in funding cuts made by the Trump administration that would fund everything from crime prevention to food security to scientific research.
The lawsuit filed in Boston is asking a judge to limit the Trump administration from relying on an obscure clause in the federal regulation to cut grants that don’t align with its priorities. Since January, the lawsuit argues that the administration has used that clause to cancel entire programs and thousands of grants that had been previously awarded to states and grantees.
“Defendants’ decision to invoke the Clause to terminate grants based on changed agency priorities is unlawful several times over,” the plaintiffs argued. “The rulemaking history of the Clause makes plain that the (Office of Management and Budget) intended for the Clause to permit terminations in only limited circumstances and provides no support for a broad power to terminate grants on a whim based on newly identified agency priorities.”
The lawsuit argues the Trump administration has used the clause for the basis of a “slash-and-burn campaign” to cut federal grants.
“Defendants have terminated thousands of grant awards made to Plaintiffs, pulling the rug out from under the States, and taking away critical federal funding on which States and their residents rely for essential programs,” the lawsuit added.
Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha said this lawsuit was just one of several the coalition of mostly Democratic states have filed over funding cuts. For the most part, they have largely succeeded in a string of legal victories to temporarily halt cuts.
This one, though, may be the broadest challenge to those funding cuts.
“It’s no secret that this President has gone to great lengths to intercept federal funding to the states, but what may be lesser known is how the Trump Administration is attempting to justify their unlawful actions,” Neronha said in a statement. “Nearly every lawsuit this coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed against the Administration is related to its unlawful and flagrant attempts to rob Americans of basic programs and services upon which they rely. Most often, this comes in the form of illegal federal funding cuts, which the Administration attempts to justify via a so-called ‘agency priorities clause.”
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said the lawsuit aimed to stop funding cuts he described as indiscriminate and illegal.
“There is no ‘because I don’t like you’ or ‘because I don’t feel like it anymore’ defunding clause in federal law that allows the President to bypass Congress on a whim,” Tong said in a statement. “Since his first minutes in office, Trump has unilaterally defunded our police, our schools, our healthcare, and more. He can’t do that, and that’s why over and over again we have blocked him in court and won back our funding.”
The lawsuit argues that the OMB promulgated the use of the clause in question to justify the cuts. The clause in question, according to the lawsuit, refers to five words that say federal agents can terminate grants if the award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”
“The Trump Administration has claimed that five words in this Clause—’no longer effectuates . . . agency priorities’—provide federal agencies with virtually unfettered authority to withhold federal funding any time they no longer wish to support the programs for which Congress has appropriated funding,” the lawsuit said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25161592778125-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 18:08:16.356259

As the state’s $3.5 billion road bonding plan runs dry, lawmakers are searching for a new solution to fix the state’s crumbling roads, with Michigan House Republicans advancing a $3.1 billion road funding plan in March with support from several Democrats.
Testifying before the committee on Tuesday, representatives from both the libertarian Reason Foundation and the Michigan County Road Association emphasized that the House’s more than $3 billion plan is a short to medium term solution. 
While Michigan roads are mainly funded through state and federal fuel tax revenue and vehicle registration fees, policymakers have long acknowledged that Michigan is in need of new funding.
The proposal at hand? Mileage-based fees for drivers. 
Both the Reason Foundation and the County Road Association warned that gas tax revenue is on the decline due to electric and hybrid vehicles and the increased efficiency of vehicles powered by gasoline. 
“I like to say the fuel tax is like a rock star on his farewell tour. You know, we keep saying, ‘Well, this is going to be it. We’re going to find a solution. We’re going to find a solution. We’re going to find a solution.’ And we’re to the point now where the rock star has done three or four farewell tours, and we actually need to come up with something,” said Baruch Feigenbaum,  the Reason Foundation’s senior managing director of transportation policy.

The gas tax has lost about 50% of its spending power over the last 30 years due to inflation and a lack of indexing on the tax, Feigenbaum said. 
In its place, Feigenbaum and the other individuals testifying called for a pilot program to examine what it would look like to implement a mileage-based charge on vehicle owners to cover the cost of road repairs in Michigan 
While the state has previously conducted a study looking at road tolls as a potential solution, Feigenbaum argued more will be needed to fix the state’s road funding issues. 
“Tolling by itself is not going to work, because local streets can’t be tolled. [On] roads with traffic signals, tolling is a challenge, and so we need something that can work on all streets in all places,” he said. 
Under this proposal, the Reason Foundation recommends these fees be applied to all vehicles, not just electric or hybrid vehicles. Rates can be flexible and are generally two to three cents per mile depending on the gas tax rate. Additionally, heavy duty vehicles would pay a higher rate as their higher weight means more wear on Michigan’s highways. 
The fees could also be applied in a number of different ways, Feigenbaum said, noting that residents often raise concerns about the government tracking them.

“There is a high-tech option where the device plugs into the vehicle’s OBD2 port and collects the when and the where of highway use. … There’s also a medium option, where you have a device, but it’s only collecting the miles, it’s not looking at the location or the time,” Feigenbaum said. “And then a low-tech option, such as an odometer reading, which can be done with a photo, other types of verification at a mechanic through various inspections that requires very little in the way of new technology and little in the way of new costs.” 
There are also other new options in the works including using a vehicle’s telematics to track location, allowing drivers to pre-pay on mileage, or by using a phone app, Feigenbaum said. 
While some rural residents have raised concerns that this system would cost them more because they have to drive more than residents in urban areas, Feigenbaum noted that drivers in rural areas tend to drive less fuel efficient vehicles, meaning those drivers are paying more in fuel taxes and could benefit from shifting to a mileage-based fee system. 
While Feigenbaum emphasized the mileage based fee should be used as a replacement for the state’s fuel tax rather than a supplement, Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) asked how the collection costs compared to the 2-3% cost of collecting the fuel tax. In states that had looked into this type of program the cost had been 5-10% of their revenue, Feigenbaum said.
Hosting a pilot program would allow Michigan to examine how this kind of system would work in the state, examining questions like the impact of out-of-state vehicles, options for privacy, and how to best address drivers traveling across multiple states. 
It also allows the state to look into whether they should charge drivers once at the end of the year, or throughout the year, he said.

Ankur Agarwal, the CEO of electronic tolling and road usage charge company GeoToll, offered assurances on the privacy concerns these programs carry, noting that one of the methods using systems integrated with certain newer vehicles only shares data with the consumer’s consent. Even using a GPS method, GeoToll has been able to completely maintain a user’s privacy, he said. 
“So privacy issues were there in the earlier times, but with the recent technology that has been rolled out, the privacy concerns have been completely addressed and they have been eliminated from this road usage charge perspective,” Agarwal said. 
However, Agarwal advised against a GPS plug-in approach, noting that while it is user friendly, it carries a high cost between the device’s hardware, the cost of sending data to a server and maintaining hardware over time.
While Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy) asked whether these fees would apply to other vehicles traveling on roads like off-road vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and tractors, the stakeholders emphasized that is the Legislature’s decision to make, should they adopt a mileage-based fee system. 
Should the state pursue a pilot program, Denise Donohue, CEO of the County Road Association, emphasized that the state will first need to educate residents about the impact of these programs, alongside hosting focus groups to gather perspective from residents across the state’s various regions, as they have very different thoughts on these kinds of efforts.

Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday announced his support of a lawsuit against state school officials over their defiance of his executive order requiring religious exemptions to the state’s school-mandated vaccines.
“These are nine-year terms,” Morrisey said of the school board. ‘That’s a really long time with no political accountability. I would argue that has to change… I am not going to let an unelected body of bureaucrats stop and strip religious liberty protections that are afforded to them under West Virginia law. Period.”
The lawsuit was filed in Raleigh County Circuit Court on behalf of Miranda Guzman, whose child, A.G., was issued an exemption to the school vaccine mandates by the state Department of Health based on religious beliefs. 
Earlier this month, the Board of Education voted unanimously that Superintendent Michele Blatt should issue guidance to the county boards of education that they do not allow religious exemptions for the state’s vaccine laws despite Morrisey’s executive order.
The lawsuit names as defendants members of the state board of education, Blatt and members of the Raleigh County Board of Education. 
Guzman’s lawsuit has been assigned to Raleigh Circuit Judge Todd Kirby. In 2023, Kirby was a member of the state House of Delegates and a co-sponsor of the religious freedom bill that is the basis of Morrisey’s executive order. Kirby was appointed judge by former Gov. Jim Justice in July 2024.
During a news conference in Beckley, West Virginia, Morrisey again argued that the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act should be interpreted as allowing religious exemptions for the state’s school-mandated vaccines. 
“In my view, and I think the view of many, many people, this applies to the topic of religious exemptions for vaccines,” Morrisey said. “And that 2023 law was passed over any of the conflicting laws. We know that there were laws passed on compulsory vaccines many, many years ago. 
“All we did at the beginning of the year, and all we’re doing now as the executive as per his prerogative and discretion, we’re actually stepping up, and we’re interpreting both laws together,” Morrisey said. 
The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the school board so that the student will be able to attend school. It’s at least the second lawsuit to be filed concerning the executive order. The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice has also filed a writ of mandamus in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised students. That lawsuit seeks to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order. 
Speaking about the new lawsuit Tuesday, Morrisey said filing the complaint was a “very noble thing” for Guzman to do. 
“As a Christian, Miranda is raising a number of objections to state-mandated vaccines that run counter to her deeply held religious beliefs, including the use of fetal cells in some of the immunizations and preemptively altering her daughter’s natural immune system,” he said. “As governor, I fully support Miranda’s ability to seek a religious exemption, and I support her lawsuit against school board bureaucrats.”
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, while some vaccines involve growing viruses in human cell cultures originally developed from two aborted fetuses in the 1960s, vaccines themselves do not contain fetal cells. 
Every state requires children attending school to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases. West Virginia has been one of only five states that allows only medical exemptions for the vaccine requirements.
Morrisey issued his executive order in January. According to the state Department of Health, as of last week, the department had processed 321 religious exemptions for the 2024-2025 school year and 140 religious exemption requests have been processed for the 2025-2026 school year
During the regular session earlier this year, the Legislature rejected Senate Bill 460, which would have put the religious exemptions into state law. The measure passed in the Senate but was voted down in the House of Delegates.
In an email Tuesday, a spokesperson for the state Board of Education reissued a prior statement it previously issued after the board decision not to comply with the governor’s order. 
The board’s direction “is in line with the actions of the West Virginia Legislature during the 2025 regular session which did not vote in favor of religious exemptions for vaccines,” the statement said. “The intent of the state board is to do what is best for the 241,000 children, 23,000 educators and 15,000 service personnel in our 629 public schools. This includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws. This board is constitutionally bound to provide a thorough and efficient system of free schools, and our members remain committed to this charge.”

Steven Jackson sponsored a new law that requires the Louisiana Board of Ethics to broadcast its public meetings. (Allison Allsop)The Louisiana Board of Ethics will be required to broadcast its monthly public meetings starting in January under a new state law. 
The law, sponsored by Rep. Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport, will require the meetings to be available live through internet streaming or television. Recordings of the meetings will be stored for at least two years in an online archive reached through the ethics board’s website. 
The state ethics board oversees the enforcement of political campaign finance laws and the state ethics code for public employees, elected officials and lobbyists for local and state government. Anyone from a public school teacher to the governor can be subject to the board’s investigations. 

The board’s public proceedings mostly deal with fines for not filing political campaign paperwork properly, requests for advisory opinions on ethics laws and charges brought for breaking ethics laws. 

A large portion of the board’s work takes place in private, however, and still won’t be broadcast. 

Who the board votes to investigate for potential ethics violations, for example, is confidential and not released publicly unless the board files charges against someone. Details of allegations against officials over misconduct are also kept secret unless the board brings charges over those accusations. 

Legislators have been frustrated with the ethics board’s decisions over the past year, and part of the motivation for broadcasting its meetings is to allow more scrutiny over its deliberations. 

Jackson, the Shreveport lawmaker who authored the law, has had several disputes with the ethics board after racking up over $10,000 in fines for improperly submitting state ethics paperwork.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Over the past decade, Jackson has accused the board of unfairly targeting him. His accusations were in emails the Illuminator acquired through a public records request last year. 
“You all are nothing more than a debt collection agency that harasses and bullies elected officials who don’t have the means to defend themselves,” Jackson wrote to the board staff in 2022, when he was a Caddo Parish commissioner and before he joined the legislature. 

The broadcast law builds on two other new ethics board statutes Jackson passed last year as a freshman lawmaker. 
One reduced how often elected officials have to file their personal financial disclosure forms with the board. Another dramatically cut the fines lobbyists pay if they submit paperwork late. 
In addition to the broadcast requirement, legislators passed two other bills this year that will make it much harder for the ethics board to charge public servants with misconduct. 

The first bill, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, has already been signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry. It raises the threshold for the board to charge a person with ethical wrongdoing and provides more avenues to the accused for blocking those charges. 
The second, sponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, R-Covington, is on the governor’s desk awaiting his signature. It increases the threshold for charging a person with political campaign finance violations and provides more mechanisms to the accused for pushing back against those charges.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LaIllum-01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 20:48:13+00:00,CT Mirror,Himes introduces resolution despite murky situation in Middle East,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/us-israel-iran-jim-himes-war-powers-resolution/,"Amid a shaky ceasefire in the Middle East and the delay of intel briefings, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes is moving ahead with a war powers resolution.","Amid a tenuous ceasefire in the Middle East and the postponement of classified briefings on Tuesday for federal lawmakers, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, is moving ahead with his war powers resolution in an attempt to rein in President Donald J. Trump on military action in Iran.
Himes’ push on war powers is part of a larger effort among Democrats to reassert their congressional authority on military action as the Trump administration defends the the president’s ability to launch strikes.
The southwestern Connecticut congressman is part of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of Senate and House leaders plus relevant committee heads in both parties who get briefed on intelligence matters by the administration. But Himes didn’t receive advance notice of the U.S. strike on three Iranian nuclear sites and learned of it through social media. He has since seen some reporting but said he couldn’t discuss it because of its classified nature.
“As the battle damage assessment comes in, based on what I’m seeing out there, I suspect that some of the high-fiving and celebrations are probably going to be revisited in terms of what was actually accomplished,” Himes told the Connecticut Mirror on Tuesday. “I am not confident that this is in fact the end of kinetic activity either by Israel or the United States, so we’re going to continue to go forward” on the resolution.
But he also acknowledged the tough reality of getting enough Republicans to support such a resolution while serving in the minority party. Some Democrats have also been supportive of the strikes, but the vast majority of the party has largely questioned the constitutionality of Trump’s move without input from Congress.
“We’re hoping against hope that maybe there are a handful of Republicans who will remember that their duty is to the Constitution to which they raised their right hand and took an oath, as opposed to the man that occupies the Oval Office,” Himes told NPR on Tuesday.
“That wouldn’t be a terribly good bet, if you are a betting person, but we are going to try to make that case, because again it’s always worth standing up for the prerogatives of the Congress and frankly for the Constitution and the law,” he added.
Himes’ resolution — introduced alongside other national security leaders U.S. Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Adam Smith, D-Wash. — is similar to other war powers resolutions already introduced, but it has a key distinction: It directs Trump to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran “other than those elements of the Armed Forces that may be necessary to defend the United States or an ally or partner of the United States from imminent attack provided.”
That is on top of a war powers resolution introduced by a bipartisan pair of lawmakers, though one of the sponsors, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., indicated he might withdraw it if the ceasefire holds up. And the Senate has its own version that U.S. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said could come up for a vote later this week.
Once the Himes resolution is formally introduced, a floor vote in the House is required within 15 days. But under House rules, that doesn’t count pro forma session days that happen during a recess, and Congress will be off for a week for the July 4 holiday. That would push the 15-day window farther into July. It is a concurrent resolution, which doesn’t require the signature of a president and is not usually considered binding.
Himes said it was designed as a privileged resolution so that could come up for a vote. 
But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been critical of war powers resolutions, saying that it “is not a time for politics.” 
The Constitution grants the legislative branch the ability to “declare war.” The War Powers Act of 1973 requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action if there is no declaration of war. Johnson took aim at that law on Tuesday.
“Many respected constitutional experts argue that the War Powers Act is itself unconstitutional,” Johnson told reporters. “I’m persuaded by that argument. They think it’s a violation of the Article II powers of the commander in chief. I think that’s right.”
Himes and Connecticut’s congressional delegation were hoping to get more answers about the recent strikes on Tuesday during briefings led by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But they were postponed. The Senate briefing was rescheduled for Thursday, and the House one was moved to Friday.
Himes said he didn’t know the reason for the cancellations but cast doubt on Trump’s characterization that Iran’s nuclear facilities were “completely and totally obliterated” based on what the congressman has learned so far.
“Based on what I’ve seen out there in public, not on classified channels, I think the persistent use of the word ‘obliterated’ is probably way misplaced,” Himes said Tuesday.
“It’s very disappointing,” he said about the postponed briefings. “The administration has not only not warned us in advance of this attack but now has cancelled this briefing so they’re being about as untransparent as possible.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said Monday he wanted to get more insight into the damage assessment and what officials are doing in terms of “risk mitigation” for U.S. forces in the region. On Monday, Iran launched a retaliatory strike on a U.S. Air Force base in Qatar — which was intercepted by Qatari air defenses.
Since then, Iran and Israel have entered a ceasefire announced by Trump on Monday. But the situation seemed precarious earlier Tuesday. Trump warned both countries against violating the pact and said he was “not happy” with Israel for bombing Iran. 
The president also appeared to walk back his sentiment from a day earlier when he indicated the possibility of backing regime change in Iran.
“I’d like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible,” Trump told reporters Tuesday on Air Force One. “Regime change takes chaos and ideally we don’t want to see so much chaos.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-5.44.33 PM-1024x567.png,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788

Leslie Rutledge preside over a joint session of the Arkansas House and Senate on Jan. 14, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ political leaders have described feelings of concern and a heightened attention to safety following the murder of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband earlier this month. 
Former Minnesota House Speaker Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed in what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said appeared to be “a politically motivated assassination.” Law enforcement officers arrested Vance Boelter on June 15. He faces charges for their murders and for shooting Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife who are expected to recover, according to the Minnesota Reformer.
Arkansas House Speaker Rep. Brian Evans, R-Cabot, said he knew Hortman and attended a number of events with her last year.
“It was just a very surreal moment … Just knowing that one of my colleagues, how quickly life could change for one of us,” he said. 
The Advocate spoke to elected officials of both parties, and most said they weren’t afraid for their safety. However, Evans said the act of violence would not and could not be ignored.
“In today’s climate, ensuring safety is not just a precaution, it’s a responsibility,” he said. 
Since the shooting, the addresses for many Arkansas legislators have been removed from the general assembly’s website, as first reported by the Arkansas Times. 
Efforts have been made in recent years to improve security at the Arkansas State Capitol by increasing Capitol Police presence around the grounds and within the complex’s buildings, he said.
Little Rock Republican Sen. Mark Johnson said state lawmakers have security at the Capitol, but once they walk outside, they’re exposed.
“Crazies know no boundaries,” Johnson said. “I have never had any fear for my own safety or that of my family because I’m in the Legislature, but it’s a wake up call that maybe I should just be a little more careful.”
Benton Republican Sen. Kim Hammer said he and other lawmakers have felt safer since the Legislature decided during last year’s fiscal session to have Capitol Police handle security at the Multi-Agency Complex building, Big MAC for short, instead of paid contractors.
Hammer said everyone should condone violent acts, and that he wouldn’t live in fear of potential threats.
“It’s not the first time in history that elected officials have been targeted,” he said. “You go back to when they [Republican Congressmen] were playing ball on a ballfield. They were targeted. You go back to the head of the Democratic Party here in Arkansas. He was murdered.”
A gunman opened fire on Congressional Republicans practicing for a charity baseball game in Virginia in 2017. Democratic Party of Arkansas Chair Bill Gwatney was murdered by a gunman at the state party’s headquarters in 2008.


Let us know what you think...


 

Everyone the Advocate spoke with condemned the shootings, including Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. When contacted for comment, her office pointed to a social media post where Sanders said she was “heartbroken” to hear of what happened. 
“Violence has no place in our democracy,” she wrote. “Bryan and I are praying for the victims and their families.”
Secretary of State Cole Jester’s spokesperson Samantha Boyd said in an email that security was a top priority, and that events such as what happened in Minnesota “certainly intensify concerns and our push for urgency.” At the same time, Boyd said law enforcement was striking a balance between security and public access.
Meanwhile, Jester himself condemned the shootings while touting security funding approved by legislators during the session.
“​​Since the first day I took office, we have been taking action to harden the physical infrastructure of the State Capitol against the kind of despicable actions we saw in Minnesota,” Jester wrote in an emailed statement. “We are thankful to the legislature for giving us funding to do so this spring. Further, we have expanded the State Capitol Police and strengthened their training regimen. Evil is real, and we stand ready to fight back.”
Even with increasing polarization nationally, Evans and other Arkansas legislators highlighted the cordial relationships between lawmakers, regardless of their party affiliation. Those relationships and the example it sets are part of the reason why political polarization has not taken greater root within the state’s legislative body the way it had in other states, they said.
“I do think that more people buy into the lack of civility; they believe that’s just how it is,” Evans said. “You see it a lot with freshman members when they come in now. They’re used to seeing what’s happening on the national news and the national scene, and they think everything’s about a soundbite or whatever.”
A week after political assassination, democracy group tries to chart a way forward

Evans said that most legislators, however, quickly adapt to the body’s dynamics by the end of their first session.
House Minority Leader Rep. Andrew Collins of Little Rock and Senate Minority Leader Sen. Greg Leding of Fayetteville agreed that Arkansas’ Legislature was less polarized than in other states. But the Democrats also expressed greater concern about threats of physical violence against elected officials.
Leding said charged rhetoric from legislators when pushing their bills — especially those framed as “protecting vulnerable kids” — contributes to the problem.
“It could easily plant the idea in someone’s head that there are left-leaning people out there who are targeting children,” he said.
When people interact online, Collins said it seems more extreme than if that same interaction happened in-person. He and other lawmakers from both parties agreed that the conversations surrounding politics were more heated now than before.
“You never know what sends someone into that mindset or into that form of rage that triggers them to take this type of action, as has happened in Minnesota,” Evans said.
Immediately following the assassination, Evans said the House’s security director began a risk assessment. Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said on Friday that those conversations had not yet happened for the Senate. 
Hester said that “crazy people are going to do crazy things” and that once people set their mind to committing violence and are willing to give up their lives to do so, there wasn’t much that could be done.
Leding took issue with this characterization. 
When lawmakers repeatedly demonize vague enemies like “the radical left,” Leding said, it emboldens people to take actions that would otherwise be unthinkable.
“It is deeply irresponsible to just blanket all violence or lay all violence at the feet of people suffering with mental health issues. That is just shrugging off the responsibility of the language we use,” Leding said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer).Kentucky’s utility regulator is inviting Kentuckians to weigh in on the possibilities of developing nuclear power plants in the state.
The Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) in an order earlier this month opened a case to discuss “issues involving the construction, operation, and funding of potential nuclear electric generating facilities.” A PSC press release says the effort is part of complying with a directive from the  Kentucky legislature to make preparations for constructing nuclear power plants.
PSC Chair Angie Hatton in a statement earlier this month said nuclear energy is “increasingly seen as a reliable, dispatchable, clean energy source” as the country faces rising electricity demand. 
“Recent technological advances have made nuclear energy potentially more affordable and attainable,” Hatton said. “However, the technology is still very expensive and we want to make sure we examine all angles of this potential power source, including its impact on ratepayers, electric grid reliability, our environment, economic development and our workforce in Kentucky as we explore our options.” 
In addition to upcoming conferences with utilities in Frankfort, the PSC plans to hold public hearings around the state to hear from Kentuckians given that the “potential impact of nuclear generation and storage on any given community could be significant.” 
Kentucky does not have any nuclear power plants, though Kentucky lawmakers have taken steps to look into the potential for one. Those steps include funding a new research authority at the University of Kentucky. The director of the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research, where the new authority is housed, told lawmakers last year it’s not likely a new nuclear power plant will be built in Kentucky over the next 10 years.
The Public Service Commission regulates the rates and services of over 1,100 utilities that include large, investor-owned electricity providers such as Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, along with small water districts that provide drinking water to rural communities. The regulator also hears requests from utilities to retire or build new power generation and fields complaints from Kentuckians about service and rates.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0218-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X video)Florida’s bid to be on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation plans has taken a swampy turn.
The state, with approval from the Department of Homeland Security, started this week to build a temporary detention center in the Florida Everglades for undocumented immigrants arrested by state police and federal immigration authorities.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post Monday that the federal government is “working at turbo speed” and the facility will be funded in large part by the FEMA Shelter and Services Program.
Gov. Ron DeSantis is using emergency powers to take control of the facility after his administration offered to buy the land from the county. According to the governor’s office, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava offered what DeSantis’ office called an “unreasonable” price tag for the state to buy the county land, $190 million. 
“Time is of the essence. We must act swiftly to ensure readiness and continuity in our statewide operations to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement,” the Division of Emergency Management wrote in a letter informing the county of the emergency takeover. 
  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier via Department of Legal Affairs
Florida’s top Democrats blasted the idea initially proposed by Attorney General James Uthmeier, with Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried saying the state is “hijacking” county-owned land.
“This proposed detention center isn’t just cruel, it’s environmentally catastrophic. This facility would desecrate ecologically critical wetlands, trample on Tribal sovereignty, and transform one of the world’s most cherished ecosystems into a prison camp for political gain,” Fried said Tuesday, adding that Uthmeier, a former chief of staff for DeSantis and architect of the Martha’s Vineyard immigrant operation, “is again using human lives as props.”
She wasn’t alone in her criticism, with Democrats in the state House and U.S. House criticizing the move.

— Attorney General James Uthmeier (@AGJamesUthmeier) June 19, 2025

In the video, Uthmeier says DeSantis has tasked state leaders with finding new locations for detention centers and that Miami Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport is the ideal location.
“Because you don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there’s not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons. Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide,” Uthmeier said. He also said the National Guard will be on site. 
The facility occupies 39 square miles and is in the middle of the Florida Everglades. Uthmeier said in his post that as many as 1,000 beds could be brought online in the next 30 to 60 days. 
The Training and Transition Airport initially was constructed in the 1970s as a replacement runway for Miami International Airport but environmental concerns brought continued development to a halt. According to the airport’s website, roughly 900 acres of the 24,960-acre property has been developed. The Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission manages the remainder.
Supporters of mass deportations
Uthmeier and his former boss, DeSantis, have been vocal supporters for the Trump administration’s promise of mass deportations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials and state police raided an apartment complex building site near the Florida State University last month. 
Shortly after Trump’s election, the Florida Legislature met in special session to pass a law that, among other things, makes it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
DeSantis signed SB 4C on Feb. 13, but U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams blocked its enforcement temporarily after the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state.
Williams on June 17 found Uthmeier in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the law as illegitimate and unlawful.
Criticisms
FDP Chair Fried wasn’t alone in her criticism of the plan.
  Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
“Donald Trump, his Administration, and his enablers have made one thing brutally clear: they intend to use the power of government to kidnap, brutalize, starve, and harm every single immigrant they can — because they have a deep disdain for immigrants and are using them to scapegoat the serious issues facing working people,” U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost said. 
“They don’t care if people live or die; they only care about cruelty and spectacle,” Frost added. “Anyone who supports this is a disgusting excuse for a human being, let alone a public servant.”
“Florida is too expensive for Floridians, but instead of doing something about it, Attorney General Uthmeier is spending his time on the right-wing podcast circuit trying to go viral — he’s all in,” state Rep. Dan Daley said. 
“Enough with camera-chasing appointees. Florida doesn’t need another politician trying to go viral. We need an Attorney General who will actually do the job,” Daley said. “If Uthmeier can’t, we should find someone who will.”
According to the governor’s office, state use of the facility will be “completely self-contained” and will not involve removing vegetation or permanent construction.

Nation's soaring oil and natural gas production may buffer energy prices if Israel-Iran conflict disrupts global supplies, some industry officials predict.
The post Wyoming oil positioned to weather Middle East conflict, analysts say appeared first on WyoFile .","The global oil market’s reaction to rising conflict in the Middle East has been subdued, so far, as supplies remain flush and shipping routes mostly uninterrupted. That could change, however, if Iran makes good on a threat to shut off the Strait of Hormuz, according to energy analysts.
The key petrol shipping route connects 25% of the world’s oil and about 20% of the world’s liquified natural gas from the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and on to, mostly, Asian consumers like China. Though speculation abounds about whether Tehran might try and succeed at closing the vital shipping pinchpoint, such an action would most likely send oil prices soaring with implications for Wyoming’s energy-dependent economy.
Yet even if that were to happen, according to market watchers who spoke to WyoFile, the U.S. is far less prone to global supply and price disruptions than in decades past. That’s because the U.S. reversed a 30-year decline in oil and natural gas production to reach record highs, becoming a net exporter of petroleum products in 2020 and surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the top oil producer in the world today.
“We’re way less vulnerable than we’ve been in years past,” Washington D.C.-based Bracewell partner and energy policy analyst Frank Maisano told WyoFile. “We’ve just seen much more minimal impacts [from world oil markets] because we’re inoculated against it — because of all the production we have going in the U.S.”
This map depicts liquefied natural gas terminals in relation to the Strait of Hormuz. (U.S. Energy Information Administration)
The U.S. accounts for about 22% of world oil production, surpassing the second-largest producer Saudi Arabia, which accounts for about 11%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. is also the top natural gas producer, as well as the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.
Following decades of decline beginning in the 1970s, the U.S. regained its foothold in oil and natural gas production, thanks to advances in hydraulic fracturing and onshore directional drilling in the mid-2000s, particularly in shale formations in places like the Permian Basin underlying New Mexico and West Texas.
Though oil prices shot to more than $100 per barrel following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the industry was still on its heels, trying to backfill operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, Maisano noted. Suppliers have regained footing since, and so far world oil prices have oscillated only slightly since the U.S. bombing in Iran. The Brent crude spot price — the benchmark for two-thirds of the global market — slipped by about $5 per barrel to settle around $71 on Monday, according to Reuters. The price remains within the past year’s average.
U.S. oil benchmarks have mostly tracked, with the West Texas Intermediate price briefly up then settling to about $65 per barrel, about $3 less than before the U.S. bombing over the weekend, according to market reports. Though the world market absolutely still influences the U.S. market, Maisano said, it is far less prone than it was 15 years ago.

“There’s always some potential impacts when you talk about conflicts, especially in the Middle East,” Maisano said. “But global markets today are just more resilient compared to where we used to be. It’s because we’ve transformed ourselves into a global energy superpower.”
The situation in the Middle East remains volatile, however, stoking fears of retaliatory efforts by Iran or rogue actors who might want to interrupt shipping routes and tankers.
For now, Wyoming can take solace in robust regional oil and natural gas production, as well as refining capacity, which makes the broader region even more resilient than other parts of the U.S., according to Maisano and others.
Wyoming oil
Pump prices in Wyoming in recent days have tracked slightly lower than the national average of about $3.22 per gallon, according to GasBuddy. And that’s during the onset of the summer travel season.
That’s owed, in part, to regional production and refining capacity.

Wyoming is the eighth-largest oil producer in the nation and ranks ninth in natural gas, according to federal data. 
Though its refining capacity of about 126,000 barrels per day is a fraction of the industry’s heyday in the 1970s, the combined production and refining infrastructure in the broader Rockies region supports a relatively stable market, said Grier Bailey, executive director of the Colorado Wyoming Petroleum Marketers Association.
“I think gasoline and fuel supply for Colorado and Wyoming will be okay even if there is a slight increase in the price based on the global commodity exchanges,” Bailey told WyoFile via email. “The U.S., led by states in our [region], have the supply to handle our needs.”
Maisano credits the region’s long history in oil and gas, as well as state leaders throughout the Rockies who are supportive of the industry. 
“You have both Democratic and Republican state leaders who have not been shy about putting domestic production and in-state production as a priority,” he said.
Whatever happens to oil prices related to rising tensions in the Middle East, many producers here still bemoan what they see as Wyoming’s disadvantage — more federal mineral ownership and regulatory hurdles — to be responsive. Producers in New Mexico, West Texas and Pennsylvania can be far more responsive than Wyoming to meet an unexpected spike in demand, said Steve Degenfelder, land manager for Wyoming-based Kirkwood Oil and Gas.
“If you do have a price spike that people want to take advantage of, chances are they’re probably not going to be able to take advantage of it in Wyoming,” Degenfelder told WyoFile.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Some state budget provisions are beginning to come into relief days ahead of a deadline to pass a spending bill before the new fiscal year begins on July 1.
Top-ranking legislators in the Senate introduced tax proposals pitched as part of Murphy’s budget plan that would raise levies on cigarettes and the fluid used in vaping devices.
“Hopefully, some of this revenue will be applied to smoking cessation programs,” Sen. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex), the chamber’s health chairman and a sponsor of one of the bills, told the New Jersey Monitor.
A bill sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the chamber’s budget chair, would nudge New Jersey’s cigarette per-pack tax up from $2.70 to $3, while Vitale’s bill would triple tax rates on electronic cigarette fluid sales at both wholesale and retail levels.
Gov. Phil Murphy pitched both proposals in the budget plan he unveiled in February. They were among a raft of proposed tax increases meant to generate $1.2 billion in additional revenue as New Jersey faces tightening fiscal conditions, a deficit, and uncertainty over the future of its federal funding.
Vitale said a third proposal, which has not been reviewed by the New Jersey Monitor, would apply a 30-cent tax to tobacco-less nicotine pouches, like those sold by Zyn. It was not immediately clear whether the tax would be levied on each pouch or tin. Currently, those products are taxed at 30% of their wholesale price.
The three bills will be combined and advance as one, Vitale said.
“They’re merging everything. All these issues — cigarettes, e-liquid, nicotine pouches — will be merged into one piece of legislation,” he said.
In February budget documents, administration officials urged lawmakers to boost cigarette tax revenue as smoking wanes and is supplanted by newer nicotine delivery mechanisms.
Absent the increase, the tax on cigarettes was expected to generate $365.3 million in the coming fiscal year, down from an estimated $374 million in the current one. With the higher rate, that tax would generate $406.3 million, according to treasury documents.
The increase would allow some money from New Jersey’s cigarette tax, about $10.7 million, to flow into the state’s general fund.
The first $391.5 million in cigarette tax revenue is dedicated to an off-budget fund that pays for smoking cessation and other health care programs, and some additional funds must be used to pay down bonds issued against cigarette tax revenue.
Opponents warned raising the tax would harm convenience stores, gas stations, and other retailers that carry tobacco products.
The changes would push smokers to cross state lines to purchase cigarettes in Pennsylvania, which charges a $2.60-per-pack cigarette tax, said Eric Blomgren, executive director of the New Jersey Gasoline, C-Store, and Automotive Association.
“For each individual that does so, there are two losses. One is to the retailer who not only lost that sale, but also the cup of coffee, snack, or other purchase that customer would have also bought,” he said. “The other is to the state, which in an effort to squeeze $3.00 from a pack instead loses the $2.70 it was already getting, plus another roughly 77 cents in lost sales tax.”
Excise taxes like those that New Jersey levies on nicotine products have dual roles. In addition to the revenue they generate, they are meant to deter taxpayers from certain activities, like smoking and drinking.

Vitale, a longtime supporter of higher excise taxes on nicotine products, cautioned New Jersey might see limited success on that second prong.
“I think that the revenue’s required, and it serves, at some level, as a disincentive to smoke, but the actual data doesn’t support it as much as I thought it did,” Vitale said. “The people who have an addiction have an addiction. Whether it’s $2.70 a pack or $3 a pack, they’re going to continue to smoke unless there’s an alternative for them.” 
The nicotine taxes are among a range of revenue raisers Murphy has proposed for the next fiscal year. Legislators, including Sarlo, have stated opposition to some others, including a proposal to subject recreational activities like laser tag to the state’s sales tax.
Under Vitale’s proposal, the state’s tax on e-cigarette cartridges would rise from 10 cents to 30 cents per milliliter. That increase would add about 56 cents to a four-pack of Juul cartridges and roughly $1.44 to a four-pack of Vuse Alto cartridges.
New Jersey’s tax on e-cigarette cartridges can be applied to wholesalers or retailers, depending on the flow of goods.
The bill would separately raise the tax rate on bottled vaping fluid to 30% of retail price, from 10%.
It would also require distributors and retailers to take inventory of their stock of vaping fluid, report it to the state, and pay the additional tax within a month of the bill becoming law.
Blomgren argued the state should enforce its existing ban on flavored vaping products before seeking to boost revenue by raising tax rates.
Last year, Attorney General Matt Platkin fined 19 stores for selling illegal flavored vapes. In January, he sent warnings to nearly 11,000 businesses warning of a ban that had by then been on the books for five years.
“It is doubtful that many of the people selling an illegal product are paying the state the proper tax on vape products. In fact, one of our members recently purchased an illegal flavored product from a competitor, and found they did not even charge them sales tax,” Blomgren said.
Murphy and lawmakers must pass and sign an annual spending bill before July 1 to avert a government shutdown.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom) A group of educators and health advocates urged Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) to take a stand against the Republican-led budget reconciliation package, warning of dire consequences for rural North Carolinians.
The press conference, organized by progressive group Down Home North Carolina, featured speakers who shared their experiences with rural education and health care and said the cuts prescribed by President Donald Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful bill” would cause significant harm to both.
The House version of the bill, passed in May, would cut Medicaid funding by nearly $900 billion and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $295 billion over the next decade, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Cuts to Medicaid at the federal level could also end North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion, which automatically reverts if federal matching funds fall below a certain threshold.
“We should not argue about whether children eat lunch or not,” said Kim Morrison, the former superintendent of Mount Airy City Schools. “We are a wealthy community as America, and we can take care of those that are less fortunate than us by giving free meals to them and free support for their health.”
Morrison said the federal funding cuts jeopardize not only the wellbeing of those who utilize the programs, but also the financial solvency of rural schools, hospitals, and grocery stores that depend on those dollars. She added that school programs that can easily be taken for granted — like Mount Airy’s student-operated Blue Bear Cafe and summer educational Blue Bear Bus — are made possible in part by federal funding, as are many beloved community programs.
“I think it’s really important for us to educate our community to say rural North Carolina is who’s really going to be hit the hardest,” she added. “They’re going to take the brunt of these cuts.”
Shanna Peele, a Buncombe County special education teacher, said many of her students on individual education plans are able to only because Medicaid covers their expenses. “That means a first grader who can’t hold a pencil gets occupational therapy,” she said. “It means a child learning to walk again can get physical therapy right in their school building. These are not extras. These are necessities.”
Franky Echols, an organizer with Public Schools Strong in Johnston County, noted that the school system is the largest employer in the county, and that many of those jobs will likely lose funding if the “big beautiful bill” passes.

Speakers said they tried to contact Tillis, who is set to seek reelection in 2026, but have been left with murky answers from aides and did not get to hear from the senator directly. Rachel Phipps, a substitute teacher who has two chronic illnesses, lupus and multiple sclerosis, said Tillis’s office did not address her concerns that she could lose access to the care she depends on to continue teaching.
“All the emails I have received that they actually answered, their answer to every question that I asked was they were trying to weed out waste, fraud, and abuse,” Phipps said. “There’s no clear answer. We are not getting direct answers at all.”
In a June 11 commentary for The Hill, Tillis touted the reconciliation package as “the most ambitious welfare reform in a generation” and praised it for “finally enacting work requirements for able-bodied adults.”
“Trump was right to push to protect Medicaid beneficiaries while calling for a crackdown on waste, fraud and abuse,” Tillis wrote. “How dare we expect an able-bodied adult capable of holding a job actively seek employment, volunteer in their community, or pursue education in exchange for taxpayer-funded benefits?”
Todd Warren, a former public school Spanish teacher who is now Down Home NC’s statewide education strategist, said Tillis is “missing” as his constituents seek answers on the bill, adding that concerns about waste, fraud, and abuse are an attempt to deflect the fears of those who will lose coverage under the changes.
“There’s just literally no way to make that level of cuts and people not lose health care and access to food resources,” Warren said. “If there is any waste, fraud, and abuse, it’s on the part of the insurance companies, and that should be returned to the people of North Carolina.”
The Senate is expected to vote on the budget mega-bill on Friday or Saturday, after which it would proceed to the House for a final vote before heading to Trump’s desk if both votes are successful.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmiranda_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788
,California,2025-06-24 20:22:51+00:00,CalMatters,Sacramento police release search warrant in California senator’s DUI investigation,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/sabrina-cervantes-dui-warrant/,CalMatters obtained the search warrant from Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ DUI investigation. Here’s what it says.,"In summary
CalMatters obtained the search warrant from Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ DUI investigation. Here’s what it says. 


A California state senator had thick slurred speech, appeared drowsy and was unsteady on her feet when officers interacted with her at a Sacramento hospital following a car crash last month, according to a search warrant a judge signed authorizing police to perform a DUI blood test.
Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ blood would later show no evidence of intoxicating substances, and Sacramento County prosecutors declined to file charges. 
Now, Cervantes is threatening to sue the Sacramento Police Department, alleging officers targeted the Democrat representing Riverside because of her race and sexual orientation. 
Her attorney, James Quadra, said the search warrant CalMatters obtained late Monday from Sacramento police through a California Public Records Act request only helps their case. 
“There’s going to be lots of witnesses that are going to contradict everything that this officer put in there under oath,” Quadra said today.
But on May 19, the day of the crash, Officer Kevin Lucas was able to persuade a deputy district attorney and a Sacramento Superior Court judge that officers had probable cause to believe Cervantes, 37, was impaired by a central nervous system depressant, according to the search warrant. 
Cervantes was cited under a California statute that prohibits driving under the influence of “any drug.” That includes prescription or even over-the-counter medications.
The document, which includes Lucas’ sworn affidavit, is the first police record released in the case. The police department has so far declined to provide CalMatters with body camera footage or other reports. Officers cited the other driver for running a stop sign and prosecutors cleared Cervantes. Police have said the crash remains under investigation.
Lucas wrote in his affidavit that officers met Cervantes at a Sacramento hospital emergency room following the early afternoon crash a few blocks from the Capitol. 
Last month, police said the state fleet vehicle manager called to report the collision and that Cervantes’ chief of staff drove her to the hospital. 
Warrant alleges Cervantes appeared intoxicated
When officers arrived, they met with Cervantes in the emergency room waiting area. Lucas wrote that Cervantes was seated and wearing a black face mask and sunglasses.Lucas wrote that Cervantes “appeared to have difficulty getting into a standing position,” and she had an “unsteady gait” as she walked the 75 feet to a private security room.
“When she removed her face mask and sunglasses she appeared to be drowsy while speaking,” Lucas wrote. Cervantes had “thick slurred speech and at times she stumbled over the pronunciation of words during her statement.”
She denied drinking anything, but when officers asked to perform field sobriety tests, she declined and said “she would need to speak with senate legal counsel first,” Lucas wrote. 
Officers suspected this was a “stalling tactic attempting to delay the investigation of DUI,” Lucas wrote. Cervantes told officers she wouldn’t provide a blood sample unless police obtained a search warrant, Lucas said. 
A deputy district attorney reviewed the documents before Judge Carlton Davis signed it at 5:41 p.m., more than four hours after the crash. 
Police would later tell reporters that Cervantes eventually consented to the blood test before the warrant was authorized, but they decided to wait until they had the judge’s clearance before taking a blood sample. 
Cervantes’ attorney claims officers lied
“The officers remained professional throughout, taking time to explain the process and answer all of the senator’s questions,” police said in a statement last month.
Quadra, Cervantes’ attorney, said it was no wonder that his client was unsteady on her feet. She had just been in a wreck that totaled her car. She also had spoken to a legislative law enforcement officer who advised her to go to the hospital to get checked out, he said. 
Once she got there, police started treating her “as if she did something wrong when she’s a victim,” Quadra said. He added that given their suspicion, it was little wonder she exercised her right to seek legal advice. Quadra said no one else Cervantes spoke to that day noted she had slurred speech.
“I don’t fault the judge for issuing a warrant when a police officer lies,” Quadra said. “And that (search warrant is) full of lies.”
Sacramento police spokesperson Sgt. Dan Wiseman declined to comment.  
Ed Obayashi, a law enforcement officer, lawyer and consultant who gives state-certified training courses to police, including on how to prepare search warrants, reviewed Lucas’ affidavit at CalMatters’ request. 
He said it wasn’t the strongest affidavit he’s seen, but it meets the “minimum threshold” of probable cause. Obayashi noted that both a prosecutor and a judge felt the same. 
He said he could see no evidence in the document that police officers were biased against Cervantes. They may have noted her Hispanic ethnicity in the report, as is standard police practice, but officers would have had no idea she was a member of LGBTQ community, Obayashi said. 
“I mean, does she have a sign around her neck saying that?” he said. “How would they know?”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/042423-Assembly-Floor-0424-MG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-24 17:09:30.780788

(Screenshot from the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma Supreme Court justices on Tuesday questioned the timing of the state Republican Party’s challenge of a proposed ballot measure that could open primary elections.
The state’s highest court heard about an hour and a half of oral arguments from both supporters and opponents regarding State Question 836, which proposes overhauling the state’s primary election system. Justices did not immediately issue a ruling. 
Vice Chief Justice Dana Kuehn said the Oklahoma Constitution places all political power with the people of the state and that the court has affirmed that it will not violate this provision by dictating what the people get to put on the ballot except in rare occasions. 
“There’s no tension until it’s a law or a constitutional change that then someone challenges and brings to us, and then we decide,” she said. “We don’t even know if they’re going to get enough signatures. We don’t know if the gist is okay. We don’t know any of those things. And I just want to understand why you think we should be here right now.”
  Benjamin Sisney argued against a ballot measure to open primary elections in Oklahoma in front of the state Supreme Court on Tuesday. (Screenshot from the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network)
But Benjamin Sisney, an attorney representing the Oklahoma Republican Party and Ronda Vuillemont-Smith, a former Tulsa GOP chair, who are challenging the measure, argued that the challenge is not premature. He said if the question is allowed to proceed, it would make “radical” changes to state elections. Sisney also questioned the constitutionality of opening the state’s closed primary system to any registered voter.
“It creates the false appearance that candidates are endorsed by or affiliated with the party, co-opting or appropriating the party’s name and platform,” Sisney said. “This is what clearly, manifestly violates the Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has consistently protected the associational rights of political parties.”
The proposed state question, which needs nearly 173,000 signatures to make it onto a future ballot, seeks to open primary elections to all voters. Voters would choose one candidate for each office and the top two voter-getters advance to the general election regardless of political party. Presidential primary elections would be unaffected. 
While Oklahoma primaries are currently closed, parties can choose to open them to 466,000 registered independent voters. Only Democrats currently do. 
Supporters argue that opening the primaries will allow more people to participate in elections, which are often decided in a primary or primary runoffs.
They argued Tuesday that the state question doesn’t affect the First Amendment rights of political parties at all.
  Robert McCampbell argued on behalf of proponents of the ballot measure on Tuesday. (Screenshot from the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network)
Open primaries would not change the way political campaigns are run or how political parties can support candidates, said Robert McCampbell, counsel for the state question proponents. 
“They can run their process however they want, and they can run their process with whatever rules they want,” he said. “They keep all of their First Amendment rights. Mr. Sisney says, ‘Well, what about a Trojan horse candidate?’ Somebody files to be a candidate for a party, but they’re not a true believer for that party? Well, that can happen under our current system.”
Voters would not be selecting nominees for a political party under open primaries, McCampbell said, but for candidates to advance to a general election. 
Tony Stobbe, a proponent for the ballot measure and respondent in the lawsuit, said in a statement following Tuesday’s arguments that this is not a partisan issue. 
“Let the people vote,” he said. “That’s all we’re asking. The only reason party insiders are trying to block SQ 836 in court is because they know it has real momentum. Oklahomans are ready for a system where every voter gets to vote in every election — and the political elites are clearly scared of that.”
A spokesperson for the plaintiffs’ counsel declined to comment further on the case. 
Justice Travis Jett recused himself from this case. He was sworn in Monday after being appointed in April. 
Judge Robert Bell from the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals was appointed as a special justice for this case.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Three years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal right to an abortion, health care organizations in Maine are sounding the alarm about dire federal funding cuts impacting family planning providers, and the need for the state to step in.
Maine’s reproductive health providers, Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, have already been cut off from funding through Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services, without explanation, they said. 
If the budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in the U.S. Senate is to pass, patients on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, would no longer be covered for health care provided by organizations that receive more than $1 million in federal reimbursements and also provide abortions.
“Every single day we are having to navigate a new policy or push from the federal government, something that’s being taken away, all in an attempt to put us out of business, to stop us from providing abortion,” Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said at a press conference on Tuesday.
During the virtual event, patients also highlighted the importance of reproductive freedom. 
Years ago, Portland resident Aleisha Reynolds was 20-years-old, in an abusive relationship, and in want of an abortion. She said she worked several jobs to scrape together the funds and ultimately said it changed her life for the better. Reynolds eventually began advocating for abortion rights, which she believes are fundamental. 
“I can’t imagine where I would be if I had been denied an abortion,” Reynolds said. 
“I’m horrified to think of all the people who have been denied that decision, both before and after the Dobbs ruling,” she added, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision in 2022 that struck down the federal right to abortion granted by Roe v. Wade.  
Clegg and others stressed that, since the organizations are committed to serving patients regardless of their ability to pay, these pending cuts would ultimately mean their clinics may need to further reduce hours or staff, unless that funding can be found elsewhere.
“We need Maine legislators to step up and fill the void,” said Maine Family Planning President and CEO George Hill.
The budget addition signed by Gov. Janet Mills on Monday includes $3 million for family planning services, such as routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. This amount is half of what providers requested in a bill this year, which is currently vying for remaining funds in the budget committee. 
Hill emphasized that the rest of the money needs to be allocated to cover services that both providers are committed to providing. 
Already, some Maine Family Planning locations in rural areas including Rumford, Damariscotta and Dexter can only stay open once or twice a week because of the persistent deficits these centers have been facing. The targeted exclusion from Medicaid funding, which 47% of all Maine Family Planning patients used last year, further jeopardizes the services they can provide, according to Olivia Pennington, director of advocacy and community engagement for the organization.
Medicaid funding already can’t be used for abortion, but Clegg said the budget reconciliation bill was “a backdoor abortion ban.” 
“In Maine, we are fortunate that our state laws protect the right to abortion, but these rights mean nothing without access to care,” she said. “And right now we are facing, at state and federal levels, insufficient funding, withheld funding, and an otherwise all out assault on reproductive health care by anti-abortion politicians.”

Buck Newton --seen here in a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting last week -- has reworked a House Bill intended to protect people from sexual exploitation to one that targets transgender surgery and access to public school library books. (Photo: NCGA video stream) The North Carolina Senate voted Tuesday to approve a controversial bill that defines biological sex and recognizes only male and female genders, mirroring one of President Donald Trump’s earliest executive orders.
“We cannot ignore the biological realities,” Sen. Buck Newton told the Senate chamber in Tuesday’s floor debate.
House Bill 805 started as a noncontroversial measure to prevent the sexual exploitation of both adults and minors. It passed the House in May 113-0. In recent weeks, however, Senate Republicans transformed it into a catchall for a collection of conservative social agenda priorities, including provisions that target transgender individuals and provide parents with expanded rights to challenge school library books.
The vote on the bill, which was 27-4, precipitated a lengthy and intense debate about Senate rules and an additional series of procedural votes. Most Democratic senators said that they chose to vote “present” on the matter because of their objection to the way a consensus bill was amended with items they argue were not germane to the original subject and therefore in violation of Senate rules.
As the Senate voting machines do not include an option for members to vote “present” like many other legislative bodies, however, Senate Republicans responded by moving to treat the “present” voters as if they were excused from voting — a status they argued would bar those members from taking any further votes on the bill if it were to come again before the Senate.
At one point, citing an 18th Century law that purported to impose a fine of $10 on lawmakers who fail to carry out their duties, Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch of Wake County offered to make a payment of cash for each of her members who voted “present.”
In the end, Senate Rules Chair Bill Rabon (R-Brunswick, Columbus and New Hanover) used a procedural move to advance the bill to its third reading where it was approved on a voice vote — thus diffusing the controversy.
During the debate on the original vote, Senator Batch said the bill that was written to protect children was “hijacked, gutted” and loaded up with culture war amendments.
Newton responded by offering yet another amendment that would prohibit public school students from sharing sleeping quarters with a member of the other biological sex during field trips or school sponsored events. The amendment was approved on a partisan vote.
Democratic amendments that would have raised the age to marry to 18, appropriated more funds for the state victims’ compensation fund, and required the surrender of a firearm upon the issuance of a domestic violence protective order were rejected by the Republican majority. Republicans also defeated a motion by Sen. Kandie Smith (D-Edgecombe, Pitt) that would have divided the bill into two different sections so that she and her colleagues would have been enabled to vote in favor of the bill’s noncontroversial provisions.
The Senate’s version of HB 805 would ban the use of state funds for transgender surgeries for any prisoner incarcerated in the state correction system.
The statute of limitations on medical malpractice lawsuits brought by people who have undergone a gender transition procedure would be extended from three years to ten. The legislation would also require that the original birth certificate be preserved at the state and county whenever a transgender person seeks to have their gender changed on that legal document.
The original portion of the bill, which won unanimous support in the House, enacts guardrails for online pornography. It creates age verification and consent requirements for individuals appearing in pornographic images, provides for the removal of those images, and create enforcement mechanisms. The Attorney General would be empowered to impose a fine of up to $10,000 a day for each day a pornographic image remains online when non-consensual content is not removed after 72-hours of being notified.
HB 805 was further amended last week to excuse students from specific classroom discussions, activities or assigned readings that the student, parent, or guardian believes would impose a substantial burden on the student’s religious beliefs. Parents would also have access to a searchable list of school library books, with the power to mandate which library books may not be borrowed by the student.
The North Carolina Values Coalition said the bill attempts to solve “the obscenity problem in our schools” related to curriculum and library books. The ACLU of North Carolina said the legislation amounts to harmful attacks on transgender people, and a desire to push them out of public life.

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)Three years after federal regulators warned medical providers to avoid using certain products from a mail-order pharmaceutical company, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy is taking action against the company.
The board has charged the Iowa-licensed compounding pharmacy FarmaKeio, located in Richardson, Texas, with violating provisions of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The board has not disclosed the specific nature of the violations or stated when they occurred.
However, in April 2022, the Food and Drug Administration publicly warned patients and medical providers to refrain from using any FarmaKeio products that were intended to be sterile.
The warning followed an FDA inspection of FarmaKeio facilities in which regulators claimed to have “observed conditions that could cause the drugs produced by the company to become contaminated or otherwise pose risks to patients.” The FDA recommended the company voluntarily recall certain products.
The FDA also advised health care professionals to check their medical supplies, quarantine any FarmaKeio drugs that were intended to be sterile, and not administer them to patients.
A hearing on the Iowa Board of Pharmacy charge is scheduled for July 18, 2025.
In a separate matter, FarmaKeio currently facing charges from the California Board of Pharmacy. The board’s executive director alleges FarmaKeio provided false information to board investigators in an effort to subvert a board investigation; committed unprofessional conduct by shipping 92 prescriptions for compounded hormonal pellets to California that were obtained from a facility not licensed in California; furnished patients with compounded drug preparations that were adulterated; and provided compounded drugs in violation of FDA restrictions.
In that case, the California board’s executive director is seeking to revoke FarmaKeio’s nonresident compounding pharmacy license and to bar the company’s chief executive officer, Daniel Deneui, from serving as a manager, administrator, officer or partner for five years if the company’s license is placed on probation.

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)The U.S. Senate parliamentarian ruled late Monday that a provision by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to mandate the sale of more than 2 million acres of federal public land cannot be part of the Big Beautiful Bill.
Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough — the official nonpartisan advisor to the Senate who interprets the body’s rules — ruled that several provisions in the major spending bill violate the Byrd Rule, which constrains what measures can be part of reconciliation bills and pass with a simple majority. Typically, votes in the U.S. Senate must overcome the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster. According to the Economic Policy Innovation Center, the Byrd Rule requires reconciliation bills to be focused on fiscal issues.
A press release by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resource Committee, said that the ruling indicated seven provisions that are subject to the Byrd Rule, including requiring the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to sell off swath of public land in 11 state. Montana is exempt from the provision.
The other provisions ruled against by MacDonough include sections about energy leasing, fees, royalties and exports, as well as one that would nullify environmental reviews for offshore oil and gas projects.
On social media, Lee, who chairs the Natural Resource Committee, indicated he would continue to push for selling some public land to help address housing issues in the country. He did announce his intention to make some changes to his provision including removing all Forest Service land from consideration and reducing eligible BLM land to only land within five miles of a population center.
Montana’s federal delegation has come out strongly against the sale of any public lands, and Montana is the only Western state that was exempt from Lee’s proposal.
Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke was successful in removing a public lands sale provision from the spending bill before it passed the House, and subsequently founded a Public Lands Caucus, which Montana Rep. Troy Downing joined.
Sen. Steve Daines also issued a strong rebuke against selling federal land, with a spokesperson telling the Daily Montanan that Daines “always has and always will be against the sale of public lands.”

BURLINGTON — A defense attorney for a person linked to the fatal shooting of a U.S. border patrol agent in Vermont earlier this year anticipates his client will soon face charges that carry the death penalty.
That comment from federal public defender Steven Barth, who represents 21-year-old Teresa Youngblut, was made Tuesday afternoon during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Burlington.
Barth said he expected federal death penalty eligible charges would be brought against Youngblut in “short order.” He did not elaborate on the charges during the hearing and declined to speak to reporters following the proceeding.

“You all have a good day,” he said to reporters as he walked away. 
Acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont Michael Drescher, the top federal prosecutor in the state, declined comment following the hearing Tuesday afternoon. 
Youngblut and Felix Bauckholt were stopped in January by federal agents on Interstate 91 in Coventry, which led to a shootout that left Bauckholt, a German national, and Border Patrol agent David “Chris” Maland dead.
Youngblut has since been charged with two federal offenses. One charge alleged that Youngblut “used a firearm while knowingly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating, and interfering with a U.S. Border Patrol Agent while he was engaged in official duties.” 
The second charge stated that Youngblut “knowingly carried, brandished and discharged a firearm” during a violent crime. Youngblut pleaded not guilty to the charges in February and has been held without bail. 
Youngblut has not been directly charged with firing the fatal shot that killed Maland. 
In a document released in May titled, “Summary of Incident: Border Patrol Agent and subject killed during vehicle stop in Vermont,” the U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that Youngblut fired a shot during the incident and struck a Border Patrol agent. However, the report does not explicitly state who fired the shot that killed Maland.
Youngblut and Bauckholt allegedly had ties to a loosely connected group of people known as the “Zizians,” an offshoot of the Rationalist movement that has been tied to several other homicides, including in California and Pennsylvania.
Another person linked to that group, Maximilian Snyder, was arrested in the Jan. 17 homicide of a Vallejo, California, landlord. Snyder and Youngblut had previously applied for a marriage certificate in Washington, where they both resided in the past.
VTDigger is using Youngblut, Bauckholt and Snyder’s names as they appear in court documents. While all three people have appeared to use other names in some instances, VTDigger has not been able to confirm which each person uses in their day-to-day lives.
This story will be updated.

The change at the top of Keolis Commuter Services comes as the contract, held by the company since July 2014, is set to expire June 2027.
The post MBTA commuter rail operator’s CEO heads back to France  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ABDELLAH CHAJAI, the CEO and general manager of the MBTA’s contracted commuter rail operator Keolis Commuter Services, is leaving his position this summer and returning to France. In September, he will start a new job as executive director of marketing and innovation for the Keolis Group, a Paris-based conglomerate focused on public transportation. 
The change at the top of Keolis Commuter Services comes as the contract, held by the company since July 2014, is set to expire June 2027. MBTA officials are readying to have a new contract in place, whether it’s with Keolis or another operator, by the time the current contract expires. 
A search for Chajai’s successor is underway, according to the company. An interim CEO, not yet announced, will helm the organization until the new CEO is hired, with input from MBTA officials. 
Chajai, a native of France, first took the CEO job in 2022. He relocated from London, where he worked for a joint venture involving Keolis and fellow operating company Amey, an engineering and operations firm. 
“I am tremendously proud of what the Keolis team has accomplished during my time in Boston, and in my new role I will continue to be a champion for the important work happening here,” he said in a statement. “In partnership with the MBTA, we have helped usher in a new era of Commuter Rail operations and service, driving the strongest ridership return nationally post-Covid.” 
Brad Thomas, the president and CEO of Keolis North America, the subsidiary of Keolis Group that owns Keolis Commuter Service, thanked Chajai for his work in Boston. “Keolis is committed to continuing this momentum and to bringing a new CEO to lead Keolis Commuter Services into the future,” he added. 
Keolis Commuter Services, one of the largest private employers in the area, has 2,500 people on the payroll, with 85 percent of the workforce represented by 14 unions. As part of its contract with the MBTA, the company received $421 million in 2023 for train operations, as well as $83 million for additional work and $19 million in revenue-sharing and parking. 
The commuter rail system has just over 140 stations and an on-time performance rate of 92 percent, according to the MBTA. The system, which runs out to Worcester, as well as New Bedford and Fall River, sees more than 550,000 weekly passengers. 
The Fall River/New Bedford Line, also known as South Coast Rail, a long-awaited project that cost $1.1 billion, started service on March 24. 
But the service saw a rocky start, with canceled trains and customers shifted onto buses. Keolis blamed cancellations on needing more trained employees, and Chajai appeared before the MBTA’s oversight board in April to apologize to passengers for the disruptions. 
In a May 2 letter to state senators last May, after they inquired about the late trains, MBTA general manager Phil Eng wrote that, while the majority of South Coast rail trips were on time, the shuttle service was “entirely unacceptable.”  
“Keolis provided assurances to the MBTA prior to the start of service that a sufficient number of trained operators would be available, and that Keolis would provide the level of service our riders deserve,” he added. “Keolis has fallen short on that promise, and the MBTA intends to hold Keolis accountable.” 
That aside, the head of the MBTA’s watchdog agency praised Chajai’s three years as CEO. Brian Kane, the executive director of the watchdog MBTA Advisory Board, credited him with increasing revenue collection with the installation of fare gates at North Station. The fare gates are soon coming to South Station, too. 
“I think he had a successful tenure,” Kane said.

You can read more about the section here.

Mississippi’s public school teachers and students keep racking up wins for our state.
A few months ago, we received terrific news regarding the latest national test scores. Our fourth-graders earned a ninth-in-the-nation overall ranking in reading and 16th place in math. Mississippi students did similarly well on state tests, achieving the highest proficiency rates ever logged on those assessments.
The recently released Annie E. Casey Foundation’s KIDS COUNT 2025 Data Book now ranks Mississippi 16th in the nation for education — an incredible leap from 30th in 2024 and 32nd in 2023.
National media outlets have proclaimed our students’ remarkable rise in academic proficiency to be the “Mississippi Miracle,” inspiring other states’ education leaders to ask how they can be more like us.
Without a doubt, the progress made in Mississippi’s public schools is a direct result of the tireless efforts of our public school teachers and students. Their impressive work has been bolstered by tens of thousands of parents and community leaders who have been standing in the gap for decades, fighting for better school resources and, importantly, against the billionaire-backed campaign to undermine public education through private school voucher programs.
Other states have fallen victim to the voucher lobby, swayed by the millions of dollars spent pressuring them to adopt so-called “school choice” policies. Mississippi’s legislators, however, have resisted school choice, standing with their constituents and refusing to gamble with our children’s futures, thereby avoiding the financial and academic pitfalls suffered in states that embraced voucher schemes.

But a piece of legislation moving through Congress poses a significant threat to our state’s education progress. 
The sweeping federal budget bill, HR 1 (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act), includes a dangerous provision that would impose a nationwide tax-credit voucher program, overriding the will of states like Mississippi and threatening our historic progress. 
These few paragraphs tucked into a massive federal budget bill would jeopardize the gains our students have worked so hard to achieve while adding $5 billion a year to the federal deficit.
Mississippi isn’t alone in opposing school choice schemes. Voters across the country have rejected voucher proposals every single time they’ve appeared on statewide ballots. Unfortunately, some state legislatures have ignored their constituents in favor of voucher lobbyists and donors, legislating voucher programs with devastating consequences: severe state budget shortfalls and flagging student achievement. In fact, every state named by EdChoice as a “Top 10 School Choice State” has seen academic performance decline precipitously while Mississippi’s results keep rising.
If HR 1 were to become law with the voucher provision intact, it would set Mississippi back decades and establish a dangerous precedent: allowing private interests to decide which of the country’s children will be educated with federal dollars.
The bill already has passed the House and now awaits action in the Senate where Mississippi’s own senators —  Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith — could play a critical role in removing the tax-credit voucher language from the legislation. Both senators enjoy significant influence in the U.S. Senate, influence that is heightened in this case by what is expected to be a very close vote. 
We urge them to consider these key points:

Mississippians have rejected vouchers time and again and do not want them forced on us by the federal government.
The tax-credit voucher plan in HR 1 would reverse years of progress in our public schools.
The proposed tax-credit voucher program would add $5 billion to the federal deficit annually — for a program Mississippians don’t want.

Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, and Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, spoke about their bills in front of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government Tuesday morning. Elkins’ proposal would allow cremation or burials of unclaimed dead bodies, but it died in the House earlier this year. Roarx’s bill would allow local code enforcement and zoning inspection employees in Louisville to be eligible for hazardous duty retirement. It did not get a committee hearing this year, but was backed by a few Democratic representatives and Republican House Whip Jason Nemes, of Louisville. 
  Greg Elkins, R-Winchester. (Kentucky Senate Majority Caucus)
Elkins said his bill is a “local control bill” that gives local governments in the state the option of cremating or burying dead bodies in cases where a family member cannot be found. The decision to cremate or bury would be made by the local coroner, fiscal court, consolidated local government or urban-county government that would be responsible for the expense. 
One amendment to the bill this year was to direct coroners to search for next of kin for at least six months, but some coroners in rural areas had argued that was too long and storage costs could incur to local governments, Elkins said. Next year’s bill will likely make  the time frame 30 days. 
Another amendment addressed avoiding cremation if the person was Jewish to align with common practices in the religion. Elkins said that Rabbi Shlomo Litvin of Chabad of the Bluegrass offered to cover costs of the burial for persons of Jewish descent who might be affected by the local government decision. 
Elkins said the 2026 session would mark the third time he’s filed the legislation. 
“Each time it has made it further and further, so I’m hoping this year it gets all the way across the line,” the senator said. 
Roarx presented her bill to the committee with Brandon Lincoln, the chair of governmental affairs for the Kentucky State Fraternal Order of Police. She said the bill would make Louisville Metro code enforcement officers eligible for hazardous duty retirement benefits. Those employees are often involved in situations that include investigations, inspections, issuing citations and more that have “a high degree of peril and danger as well as physical conditioning.” Clerical and administrative positions are not included in the bill.
  Rachel Roarx (LRC Public Information)
Lincoln told lawmakers that code enforcement officers, particularly in Louisville, are “frequently (the) first point of contact in the efforts to resolve serious issues with property owners and or tenants.” Some properties also have hazardous environments, such as unsafe living conditions or unreported occupants. 
Roarx said that about 60 Louisville Metro employees would be eligible for benefits under her bill and that the additional expense would be under $500,000 annually. 
“It’s a pretty reasonable financial investment that only the City of Louisville would have the option to take on if they so choose in the next budget sessions that they encounter,” Roarx said.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/Source New Mexico)The U.S. Forest Service will seek to repeal a rule that has effectively blocked the logging of almost a third of America’s national forests, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told a meeting of Western governors on Monday in New Mexico.
The “Roadless Rule” has blocked the construction of new roads in wild areas of most states’ national forests since 2001, when it was imposed in the closing days of President Bill Clinton’s presidency.
“In this administration, we are taking a look under the hood of each and every regulation that affects the everyday lives of the American people, and this rule certainly affects the everyday lives of every single American living in the American West,” Rollins told officials assembled at the Western Governors Association meeting.
“That’s why I’m excited to announce today here with you, for the first time, our intent to repeal the disastrous Roadless Rule. The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests under the leadership of President Trump,” she said.
Lifting the rule would allow the construction of roads, a needed prerequisite for development and logging, in significant parts of the Tongass National Forest, the largest remaining temperate rainforest on Earth. Ninety-two percent of the Tongass is considered a roadless area.
“There’s no doubt about it, we are continuing to be aggressive in our efforts to increase American timber production in line with President Trump’s agenda,” Rollins said.
Rollins’ announcement was criticized by environmental groups, who vowed to oppose it.
“Secretary Rollins is taking a blowtorch to a landmark rule that shields almost 60 million acres of national forests from the serious impacts roads can have, not only on wildlife and their habitats but also on the nation’s drinking water sources,” said Vera Smith, director of national forests and lands for Defenders of Wildlife, a national group.
“America’s roadless forests are crucial strongholds for wildlife including at-risk species that are battling extinction. Sec. Rollins’ boon to industry is yet another punishing blow to the American people and the wildlife and wild places we all hold dear,” Smith said in a written statement.
The Roadless Rule has been the subject of lawsuits for decades, particularly in Alaska, where most of the California-sized Tongass is covered by the rule.
Republican presidents have sought to reduce or eliminate the rule and have been opposed in court by environmental groups. Democratic presidents have sought to keep the rule and have been opposed by logging and development trade groups.
If the Roadless Rule were a box, almost all of the action since 2001 has taken place within that box, as groups attempt to exempt certain states or parts of states.
The new rulemaking process announced by Rollins would throw out the box altogether.
“What Secretary Rollins pledged today was to rescind the whole Roadless Rule, the whole enchilada,” said Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans at the law firm Earthjustice.
More than 96% of roadless areas are located in 12 Western states, and Alaska alone has almost 15 million acres of roadless area, mostly in Southeast Alaska, but also in the Chugach National Forest near Anchorage.
Idaho, which has the second-largest amount of roadless Forest Service land, is already exempted from the Roadless Rule, as is Colorado. Idaho and Colorado have state-specific rules that supersede the federal rule.
Montana, the No. 3 roadless state, has more than 6 million acres of roadless forest.
“They are the wildest lands on the National Forest System, de facto wilderness. And the only reason to rescind the Roadless Rule is if you want to undermine the wild character of these lands by invading the wilderness,” Caputo said.
Rollins, speaking in New Mexico, said she believes that rescinding the rule would allow the Forest Service and other organizations to more efficiently fight fires in national forests and allow timber cutting that could reduce fire danger.
“That’s great news,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, in response to Rollins’ announcement.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it, and if we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve (timber) production,” Cox said.
In Southeast Alaska, the Tongass National Forest is a rainforest and isn’t subject to significant wildfire danger. Rescinding the Roadless Rule there would directly allow new mines and logging.
The proposal drew immediate pushback from regional conservationists.
“The Tongass National Forest is our home — it sustains our communities, supports our fisheries, our recreation and tourism economy, provides critical climate change mitigation, and nourishes the deer and salmon we rely on for sustenance,” said Maggie Rabb, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, in a written statement. “Opening up more of the Tongass to large-scale, clearcut logging is an existential threat to the authentic values of the forest and our Southeast Alaska ways of life.”
SEACC and a collection of environmental, tourism and tribal groups are currently fighting a lawsuit that seeks to reverse the Roadless Rule in the Tongass.
The lead plaintiff in that suit is the Alaska Forest Association, a logging trade group whose leadership praised the new plan.
“The Alaska Forest Association applauds the Secretary’s decision to repeal the Roadless Rule,” said Tessa Axelson, the association’s director.
“The Rule has contributed to the decline of the timber industry in Southeast Alaska for over twenty years, and more importantly, limited critical access for project development and mining that can and should support rural community needs, decrease energy costs, and power the economy of AK, and the United States,” Axelson said in an email provided by the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the Forest Association in its lawsuit.
“By rescinding the rule, the Secretary is taking a step in the right direction to restore Congress’s intent that our natural resources should be put to productive use and our forests should be actively managed,” she said.
Back in New Mexico, Rollins insinuated that the Roadless Rule repeal is only one of several policy proposals that the Trump administration is planning.
“We are not even six months into what promises to be arguably one of the most transformative administrations of our lifetime,” she said.

People interested in attending the event can register online through the America250 website. The U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, also known as America250, is the initiative organizing events with Trump and others leading up to the 250th anniversary of the United States’ founding in 2026. In a news release, the organization said the Iowa event will be the starting point for a nationwide tour celebrating the U.S. “where America250 will unite our nation through events in every state and territory, culminating in the most monumental celebration our Country has ever known.”
America250 was also involved in the military parade taking place on Trump’s birthday earlier in June that drew some criticism over high costs.
Attendees at the Iowa kickoff will “get an exciting preview of these impactful initiatives” planned for the upcoming year. The event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines July 3 has pre-programming beginning at 5 p.m., with Trump scheduled to speak at 7:30 p.m.
Monica Crowley, a spokesperson for America250, said in a statement the organization is ready to launch the year of celebrations in Iowa.
“America250 is proud to host this historic kick-off event in Iowa, in keeping with President Trump’s commitment to provide a grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of America’s 250th birthday,” Crowley said. “This special event serves as the magnificent start of a dynamic, year-long commemoration across our beautiful country, unveiling a vision for a renewed commitment to America’s future.”
Trump had spoken in 2023 about his plans for a yearlong celebration for America’s 250th birthday, proposing the Iowa State Fair as a starting place for what he called the “Great American State Fair.”
“My hope is that the amazing people of Iowa will work with my administration to open up the legendary Iowa State Fairgrounds to host the great American state fair and welcome millions and millions of visitors from around the world to the heartland of America for this special one-time festival,” Trump said in a May 2023 video. “Together we will build it and they will come.”
Though the event is at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines, the Iowa State Fair itself is not until August — taking place this year from Aug. 7 through 17. Trump attended the state fair in 2023 and 2015 during his campaigns for the presidency. He also has held several other events at the state fairgrounds, including rallies in 2015 and 2021.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/trumpcoralville1-scaled-e1702521234339-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-06-24 16:14:18.432251

Mike Lee said changes are coming to his proposed public land sale, which is currently facing a roadblock after the Senate Parliamentarian rejected it Monday evening. 
For weeks, controversy has simmered over Lee’s attempt to include mandatory public land sales in Congress’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill.” Lee’s proposal would require the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service to each dispose of 0.5% to 0.75% of their land across 11 Western states — that’s roughly between 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. 
Lee said the land sale is designed to help Western communities manage growth, and the parcels should be used for housing. But critics from all political backgrounds have come out in staunch opposition, noting that there’s no mandate requiring the land be used for housing. Plus, according to the bill text, more than 258 million acres would be eligible for sale, including 18.7 million acres in Utah. 
Changes to Senate Republicans’ budget proposal means even more Utah public land could be sold

But in a social media post Monday night, Lee said he now wants to eliminate forest service land from the proposal, writing, “We are NOT selling off our forests.” He also said he would “significantly reduce” the amount of Bureau of Land Management land for sale by including a provision that requires eligible parcels to be within five miles of a “population center.” 
Lee also said he would include “freedom zones” to ensure the land benefits American families, and that the bill would “protect our farmers, ranchers and recreational users. They come first.” Lee did not elaborate in his social media post. 
Lee has been hinting at a change for several days, acknowledging the flurry of criticism. Hundreds of conservation, environmental, hunter and angler groups have come out against his proposal — Lee has even suggested there’s a well-funded opposition campaign targeting his bill, writing on X, “How much money do you think has been spent on this campaign against my lands bill?” 
The proposed change comes as Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough rejected a number of items proposed by Senate Republicans. The parliamentarian is a nonpartisan, unelected adviser to the Senate who ensures the body doesn’t stray from their rules during budget reconciliation — that includes enforcing the Byrd Rule, which requires that reconciliation bills stay focused on fiscal issues. 
Anything considered nonbudgetary could be subjected to a point-of-order, which is what happened to Lee’s public land sale proposal on Monday evening. 
Per Senate rules, Lee’s provision would require a minimum of 60 votes — rather than a simple majority — otherwise it would be subjected to a point-of-order objection. 
Lee’s public land sale is one of seven proposals from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources that the parliamentarian says goes against the Byrd Rule.

A number of public land advocacy groups expressed cautious optimism on Tuesday in response to MacDonough’s announcement. 
“This is a significant win for public lands. Thankfully, the Senate Parliamentarian has seen Senator Lee’s ridiculous attempt to sell off millions of acres of public lands for what it is — an ideological crusade against public lands, not a serious proposal to raise revenue for the federal government,” said Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance highlighted the “nationwide backlash” sparked by Lee’s proposal. 
“While we’re glad to see the sell-off plan removed from the Budget Bill, we know Lee’s underlying goal remains the same: to sell off America’s public lands using any excuse or legislative opportunity he can find,” said Scott Braden, the group’s executive director. 
And the Center for Biological Diversity said that while Lee’s proposal may be caught up in Senate rules, they expect similar attempts from the senior Utah Republican. 
“His legislation was always about destroying public lands anywhere and everywhere, privatizing cherished recreation destinations and locking away these beautiful places for the ultra-rich. No one should believe his lies now, and any backroom deals to rewrite his legislation will still be a disaster for public lands,” said Laiken Jordahl with the center. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Tuesday, the group Vet Voice Foundation, a military veteran advocacy group, hosted a virtual town hall where veterans and policy experts spoke against Lee’s proposal. Lee was invited to join the discussion but did not attend, and the group displayed a symbolic empty chair in his place. 
Among the speakers was New Mexico Democrat Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who helped form the Public Lands Caucus with Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke. 
The caucus’ first order of business was to sink a proposal from Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy, a Republican, who identified roughly 11,500 acres of federal land in southwestern Utah to sell to St. George, Washington and Beaver Counties, and the Washington County Water Conservancy District. 
“We were able to successfully kill that provision in the House only to see it come back from the dead in true zombie fashion, more powerful and uglier, in this proposal from Sen. Lee,” said Vasquez. “I’ve worked on a lot of conservation campaigns. I have not seen conservationists from every stripe come together more — Republicans and Democrats, anglers and birders, RVers and mountain bikers — to protect this special resource.” 
Vasquez warned Lee, and any other politician eying a public land sale, that the newly-formed caucus will be a roadblock. 
“Folks should know whenever they bring these proposals forward, especially in the House, that they’re going to have to go up against the caucus,” he said.

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
 

The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests.
 

The announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
 

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the WGA conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The vigil included prayer for incarcerated people in solitary confinement and for the families of Shawnee Reed and Brittany Doescher, who died at Taycheedah Correctional Institution. 
“We’re all human,” JOSHUA Coordinator Caitlin Haynes said. “So whether you committed a crime or not, you deserve humane treatment. So we’re here for that, and to bring light to the situation that they deserve better.”
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections reports on how long prisoners spend in disciplinary separation, where a prisoner might be sent after committing a violation. GBCI has the longest average length of stay in disciplinary separation of any of the adult facilities listed, at 48.6 days, as of the most recent data.
JOSHUA, a local affiliate of the advocacy organization WISDOM, holds monthly vigils at Green Bay Correctional. 
Leslie Hill, who attended the event, said her son died by suicide after leaving prison. 
“I spoke to him daily whenever he wasn’t in solitary, and he had many traumatic experiences,” Hill said. “He had no support. And he was facing one more charge, he was on bond. I had bonded him out to have some mental health treatment…and I think [a] contributing factor to his death was [the prospect of going back].”

In a post before the event, WISDOM said advocates were gathering with four other groups “to call on Gov. Evers to veto any budget that continues to invest in punishment over people.” At a rally at the Capitol in late May, advocates called on the governor to veto the budget if it lacked certain items. 
“We’re urging [Evers] to veto any budget that does not include adequate investments in health care, child care and public education,” said Mark Rice, Wisconsin Transformational Justice Campaign Coordinator at WISDOM. “Also, we want him to ensure that no new prisons are included in the budget… Also wanting to adequately fund measures in the budget that would reduce the prison population.” 
GBCI’s future to be determined 
In February, Gov. Tony Evers laid out a plan that included closing GBCI in 2029 and updating Waupun Correctional Institution (WCI).
Last week, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee approved a level of corrections spending that was significantly lower than Evers’ proposal.
Co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said GBCI wouldn’t be discussed until later in the week, when the committee would take up the capital budget. That meeting was canceled. 
According to the Evers administration, the governor’s plan opted to close GBCI instead of Waupun because of local support for closing GBCI and the lower cost of updating the Waupun facility, the Examiner reported in February.
Long stays in restricted housing
According to the most recent data, 138 incarcerated people were in disciplinary separation at GBCI, and 71 incarcerated people had been in restrictive housing for over 30 days. This was the highest of any facility listed and nearly triple the number at the second highest facility. 
Over the years, the average length of stay in disciplinary separation has declined across facilities, from 39.7 days in 2019 to 27.8 days in May 2025. 
The Wisconsin Department of Corrections has entered a contract with a third-party management and consulting firm, Falcon Correctional and Community Services, Inc. The partnership includes studying restrictive housing practices at adult prisons. 
An aging facility 
GBCI was built starting in 1898. As of June 20, it housed 381 more incarcerated people than its design capacity of 749. 
Overcrowding puts additional burdens on staff to maintain a facility’s safety and security, a 2020 draft report on the Wisconsin Department of Corrections website stated. Overcrowding also “stresses inmate programs and support functions.” 
The report found that GBCI and Waupun Correctional Institution, the oldest facilities in the system, were both “at or nearing the end of their useful lives.”
Without extensive demolition and reconstruction of housing, program and support services buildings, the report stated, “they will not begin to achieve the safety, security, efficiency and flexibility found in modern correctional institution design.”
Maximum security housing at the prisons opened with 50 square foot cells designed for single occupancy, according to the report. Most of those cells were being used to house two people, presented operational issues and did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or meet American Correctional Association standards. 
The report said new maximum security housing was needed in the long term. In the short term, “consideration should be given to reducing populations at GBCI and WCI if possible to allow for more single occupancy cells.” 
The 2020 report also said a number of facilities have ADA-accessible housing accommodations, but “there exists a particular lack of accessibility at the GBCI and WCI maximum security institutions.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-24 19:07:03+00:00,CT Mirror,Family of man with ALS who died within 24 hours of incarceration sues DOC,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/24/d-death-als-lawsuit/,Disability Rights CT investigated Robert Bracey's death and alleged in a report in April that DOC staff ignored his ALS-driven dietary needs.,"Family members of a man who died within 24 hours of being admitted to Bridgeport Correctional Center are suing the state Department of Correction for allegedly failing to provide the medical care he needed and falsifying records after his death. 
Robert Bracey, who died in June 2022 at age 56, was the subject of a report published in April by the advocacy group Disability Rights Connecticut. The organization’s investigation alleged the nurses and correction officers who responded to Bracey’s death ignored his ALS-driven dietary needs. It also asserted the staff did not actively monitor Bracey’s ongoing opiate withdrawal and delayed trying to revive him for nearly 20 minutes after finding him unresponsive.
The report did not identify the man who died, but family members said the report refers to Bracey. 
The lawsuit comes after the Bracey family held a press conference at the Capitol in Hartford, where they called on state officials to hold the department responsible for the medical care of all incarcerated people.
Robyn Bracey, the daughter of Robert Bracey and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, told those gathered at the press conference, “ I just want y’all to know that he was more than a dad. He was a hero. He was a best friend.” She said she did not find out about her father’s death until three days after it occurred. 
“ [The Department of Correction] needs to be accountable and held accountable for the things they did. They took someone very dear and special to us. My life will never be the same,” Robyn Bracey said. 
DOC Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius declined to comment Tuesday on the pending lawsuit.
The Bracey family’s complaint echoed many of the claims found in the Disability Rights CT report, alleging that correction staff gave Robert Bracey a meal without the thickening agent necessary for him to be able to swallow it. 
The complaint also noted that the nurse who conducted Bracey’s initial assessment noted that he was “extremely frail,” in heroin withdrawal, vomiting and having trouble speaking. The nurse sent him to the infirmary ward of the facility.
According to the lawsuit, Bracey had been at Stamford Hospital 24 hours before entering the Correctional Center. Robyn Bracey told the Connecticut Mirror that he had been rushed to the hospital from his arraignment hearing because of ALS and withdrawal symptoms.  
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive neurological disorder that slowly takes away a person’s ability to control their own muscles. The disease is fatal and affects a person’s ability to move, speak, eat and perform other voluntary functions.
Both the report and the lawsuit alleged that a correction staff member falsely recorded “safety checks” that had never been performed. Under department policy, correction officers were supposed to check on Bracey every 15 minutes because of his medical condition. 
Medical staff also allegedly failed to perform an assessment on Bracey for opioid withdrawal. Instead, according to the report and the lawsuit, two nurses entered two different screening scores into Bracey’s medical records after his death. Finally, the lawsuit claims that corrections staff waited 12 minutes before starting to perform CPR on Bracey. 
According to the Disability Rights CT report, two of the nurses involved in the case are being investigated by the state Department of Public Health. Two lieutenants received suspensions that were later reduced, and one correction officer was dismissed but later had that dismissal reversed and was able to receive back pay. It took over two years for DOC to discipline those involved. 
At the time of the report’s release, department spokesperson Ashley McCarthy said that the department “takes the health and well-being of all those under its supervision very seriously and continuously strives to ensure that the incarcerated population receives the best level of care possible.” 
After the press conference last week, Robyn Bracey described her father as an “all-around good guy.” She told CT Mirror that he wrote poetry and worked as a carpenter before being diagnosed in 2015 with ALS. “[His] first time ever meeting you, he would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it,” she said. 
Bracey was previously arrested at the age of 48 and spent three years in prison, after which he was released to a halfway house, according to a blurb in the 2017 annual report of Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery. He began volunteering, including acting as a peer group facilitator, in January 2017. Robyn Bracey said that her father got his OSHA license and started a course of studies at Housatonic Community College. In 2018, he won a personal achievement award from the Bridgeport Re-entry Collaborative. 
But Bracey began to struggle again after his long-time partner died from Covid in April of 2020, according to Robyn Bracey, who said she found out a year later that he had gone back to using drugs. His ALS was also worsening, and in early 2021, he had to stop working because the muscles in his neck and hands were deteriorating. He was arrested in June 2022 on charges of sale and possession of narcotics and possession with intent to sell. 
“ He meant the world to me and my family. Despite his circumstances, he took care of his family and friends. He had a heart of gold,” his daughter said. 
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled Bracey’s death the result of  “complications of acute and chronic opioid use.” His final diagnoses included “acute intoxication” from fentanyl, fluid accumulation in his lungs, and a type of pneumonia that causes inflammation in the lungs.

They join a growing list of schools in the district that are embracing renewable energy.
L.W. Beecher Museum Magnet School of Arts and Sciences and Hill Central School will be the first in New Haven to have solar panel parking canopies.
More than 950 solar panels will be installed. Mayor Justin Elicker said his city will continue to transition away from fossil fuels despite the federal government’s backtracking.
“There are a lot of benefits that people know about solar,” Elicker said. “And in the work that we are doing to help support our climate and address climate change. When the federal government has really been backtracking, New Haven continues to take the lead.”
The new panels are expected to save the schools more than a million dollars in operating costs over the next 20 years.
Around 35% of their energy is expected to come from the solar panels once they’re installed.
State Rep. Steve Winter (D-New Haven), who is also the city’s Director of Climate and Sustainability, said the panels will save $27,000 in energy costs in the first year. That number is expected to continue to go up.
“We’re all often looking at things that we can do to keep money here in the community, and by utilizing federal tax credits the state’s non renewable energy solutions program and power purchase agreement, we can do that,” Winter said.
The panels are expected to be installed this summer.

June 24, 2025 | Photo By Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was in the hot seat on Tuesday as Republicans on the House Oversight Committee grilled her over upcoming fixes to the state’s new online campaign finance reporting system.
Benson and her team at the Michigan Department of State have been talking about problems with the new system since it was launched earlier this year – issues that have made it difficult for lawmakers, candidates and lobbyists to file finance disclosures and even more difficult for average citizens to track them for transparency’s sake.
Republicans took back control of the House of Representatives at the beginning of the year, and the House Oversight Committee has spent considerable time parsing the issue. That led Benson to finally appear before the committee on Tuesday to talk about what’s being done to fix the bugs.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The secretary of state told reporters in a virtual press call held Friday that a corrective action plan, a new “go live” approval process and additional project management support were among steps her department was taking to fix issues with the new system.
Before taking questions from lawmakers on Tuesday, Benson presented updates to the system and the timeline for key fixes – much of which was already presented to the committee in May and again for reporters on Friday.
What was new in that information was that the vendor, Tyler Technologies, would be offering the state a $166,000 refund on downtime the state has experienced as fixes commence. It was previously reported that refunds would be issued, but at what amount was unknown until Tuesday’s hearing. Benson said that figure was based on the number of hours in which the system was not functioning properly or if the public search function was down.
Much of the back and forth between lawmakers on the GOP-led panel focused on whether Benson knew Tyler Technologies had acquired the company that owned the previous campaign finance system prior to entering a contract with the state to build a new one. Tyler Technologies also became one of the only bidders on the project. 
Another firm bid on the proposal to build the system but was deemed unqualified, leaving only Tyler Technologies.
That was a point of contention when Benson’s chief of staff, Christina Anderson, testified before the committee in May.
There was also significant fire from Republicans on the panel, including its chair, state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), toward Benson, on why the new system was launched before it was ready for prime time, and whether the department was willing to walk away from Tyler Technologies and find a new firm if they couldn’t get the job done.
As to whether or not she knew about Tyler Technologies’ connection with the old campaign finance system before becoming the state’s vendor for the new system, Benson said much of the early work on the project was delegated to her team within the department.
Hall calls for Oversight Committee investigation into Michigan’s new campaign finance portal

“That wouldn’t be something that would typically be brought to the granular level of my decision making,” Benson said.
DeBoyer countered by noting that the committee was talking about nearly $10 million of the state’s money, and that Benson should have been in the loop, let alone making the decisions on whether to move forward in contract with Tyler Technologies.
When pressed further, Anderson and Benson did note that Tyler Technologies disclosed its connection to the old system.
In defense of the decision to use Tyler Technologies, Anderson said that its contract was a flat fee structure for the product the company promised to deliver. 
In the context of the issues that are currently plaguing the system, Anderson said if it gets to the point where they have paid Tyler Technologies in full and still haven’t received a fully-functioning campaign finance reporting system as promised, the company would still be on the hook to deliver without additional payments.
Tyler Technologies has also ramped up resources to the project without the state incurring any additional expense.
DeBoyer asked why Tyler Technologies couldn’t have just put the old system back into operation while it worked out the kinks in the new system. A representative from the company said that, from a technical perspective, it could have.
But Benson, Anderson and Tyler Technologies all insisted that the new system did work despite flaws and bugs that needed to be addressed. Benson said her team, with assistance from Tyler Technologies and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, were proactively testing out bugs in the system.
When Anderson noted that some of the same data lag and site issues that affected the old system were in part some of the same bugs they were seeing in the new system, DeBoyer scoffed and said it appeared the state got the same product it was trying to do away with.
Benson again said her department believes in continuous improvement, and that’s why it was so important to update the campaign finance reporting system with more robust and modern technology.
State Rep. Jaime Greene (R-Richmond) thanked Benson for getting the state and its lawmakers off a system that initially ran off a floppy desk using the antiquated MS-DOS operating system, but asked the secretary of state who was to blame for the recent failures.
Instead of passing the buck, Benson said it was on her and she continued to praise her team for their efforts.
The committee fielded only a few questions from Democratic members, a point that was raised by state Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) and state Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing), both of whom said they were frustrated that DeBoyer chose mostly members of his caucus to question Benson.
DeBoyer, Benson spar over gubernatorial campaign finance violation
As an aside, DeBoyer also grilled Benson over Attorney General Dana Nessel’s determination that the secretary of state committed a campaign finance law violation by holding her 2026 gubernatorial campaign announcement in the lobby of the building that houses her department.
Nessel’s office noted, however, that it did not have the authority to impose any civil penalties against Benson, nor any criminal penalties outlined in the law. 
DeBoyer on Tuesday specifically questioned Benson on that point, and asked if she intended to turn the matter back over to the attorney general’s office to issue sanctions against her, or handle it internally and sanction herself.
Benson in response said she was “very flattered” that DeBoyer appeared to be hanging on her every word regarding the violation, but added that her department did not reach out to the attorney general’s office because the opinion clearly resolved the issue, meaning there were no sanctions or other penalties left to consider.
That said, Benson was adamant that even the secretary of state be treated like every other candidate in Michigan, and acknowledged that a violation had occurred.
Benson later approached the dais after the meeting to talk with DeBoyer, which appeared cordial but tense from afar.
Michigan Advance asked about the interaction following the meeting. 
Benson said DeBoyer did continue to share his opinions about the campaign finance violation, but that she also used the opportunity to share with DeBoyer that she appreciated the work he was doing on the House Oversight Committee.
“What I was trying to communicate to him was that I want to work with him more. I want us to work together to make sure he feels he’s able to get information from our office in a regular manner, and that we have a collaborative working relationship,” Benson said. “So, that was my purpose in reaching out to him. And I hope he can see that we actually are more aligned and alike than he may realize.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250624_094648-1024x730.jpeg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

Healey's $7.5 billion proposal would continue to fund state government for about another month if the next spending cycle begins without a final budget in place.
The post Healey buys lawmakers time with $7.5B interim budget filing appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","LAWMAKERS WORKING on a compromise state budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 could get four more weeks of runway under an interim spending bill Gov. Maura Healey filed Monday.
Healey submitted a nearly $7.5 billion proposal (HD 4844) that would continue to fund state government for about another month if the next spending cycle begins without a final budget in place.
The governor wrote in a letter alongside the bill that the funding would “maintain necessary services through July 31, 2025, pending the passage of the General Appropriations Act.”
Interim budgets — sometimes referred to as one-twelfth budgets because they usually cover about a month — have become a common occurrence on Beacon Hill each summer as House and Senate Democrats stretch their private budget talks into the next fiscal year.
Massachusetts regularly produces some of the latest state budgets in the nation, and it has not had a final spending plan signed into law on time since fiscal year 2011.
House Speaker Ron Mariano said Monday he’s optimistic about the chances of agreeing on the budget by the end of the month, and Senate President Karen Spilka added that negotiators are “very close.”
The House and Senate are each holding a formal session Thursday, and the branches could use those sessions to send the interim budget back for the governor to sign into law.
The governor gets 10 days to review any legislation, so even if the Legislature strikes a deal before July 1, having an interim budget in place would allow Healey to use all of the time constitutionally allotted to her without impacting state spending.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A Utah college student arrested by federal immigration agents in Mesa County earlier this month was released Friday after what she called the “nightmare” of a 15-day stay in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora.
Caroline Dias Goncalves was detained by ICE in Grand Junction on June 5, shortly after being pulled over by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy in a separate traffic stop, from which she was let go with a warning. The deputy has been placed on leave amid an internal investigation into whether a Signal message leading to Dias Goncalves’ arrest violated Colorado laws prohibiting cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE.
The University of Utah nursing student was then held at the ICE facility in Aurora, operated by private prison firm GEO Group, before being released on bond Friday evening, she said in a statement released through immigration advocates on Monday.
“The past 15 days have been the hardest of my life,” Dias Goncalves said. “I was scared and felt alone. I was placed in a system that treated me like I didn’t matter.”



A daily average of more than 1,100 people are held in the Aurora ICE detention center, the only such facility in Colorado. Dias Goncalves, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. as a 7-year-old, described having to eat soggy food — “even the bread would come wet,” she said — and other dehumanizing treatment towards detainees in the facility.
“The moment they realized I spoke English, I saw a change. Suddenly, I was treated better than others who didn’t speak English,” her statement added. “That broke my heart. Because no one deserves to be treated like that. Not in a country that I’ve called home since I was 7 years old and is all I’ve ever known.”
ICE has not replied to questions from Newsline and other media outlets about Dias Goncalves’ arrest, which has sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“We are hurting our nation — and our very soul — when we target immigrant youth this way,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a statement on Dias Goncalves’ release. “One traffic stop. One unlawful arrest. And a lifetime of trauma. Enough is enough.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has directed ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. That has included an order to the agency to meet an arrest quota of at least 3,000 people per day.
Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people taken into ICE custody despite having no criminal record — Dias Goncalves among them — has risen sharply since January.
Representatives for Dias Goncalves said she and her family were requesting privacy following her release. In her statement, she said she would try to “move forward” and focus on work and school, and directly addressed the ICE agent who detained her.
“He kept apologizing and told me he wanted to let me go, but his ‘hands were tied.’ There was nothing he could do, even though he knew it wasn’t right,” Dias Goncalves wrote. “I want you to know — I forgive you. Because I believe that people can make better choices when they’re allowed to.”

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A taxpayer-funded attorney will defend suspended Rep. RJ May against charges of distributing child sexual abuse material, a federal judge decided Tuesday.
May, a founding member of the uber-conservative House Freedom Caucus, pleaded not guilty to the charges June 12. He was arrested the day before at his West Columbia home.
But the 38-year-old married father of two doesn’t own the home, he told federal Magistrate Shiva Hodges on Tuesday. His wife’s name is the only one on the title, according to Lexington County property records. May claimed to own no assets but his pickup truck, Hodges told the court.
May paid property taxes on a 2019 Ram 1500 and a 2017 Chevy Suburban last year, according to public tax records.
SC representative charged with distributing child sexual abuse material

May’s financial status warranted a public defender, assigned to people who can’t otherwise afford an attorney, Hodges decided. She assigned Jenny Smith, an assistant federal defender based in Columbia.
Smith will defend May against the 10 counts of distributing child sexual abuse material. His previous attorney suggested May was set up by unnamed “political enemies.”
The charges stem from April 2024, when social messaging app Kik notified the nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of videos involving child sexual abuse sent from an account called “joebidennnn69.” Investigators found at least 220 different videos and images depicting sexual abuse of young children, including toddlers and infants, saved to the account, a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security testified in court earlier this month.
Law enforcement tracked the account to May’s home and cellphone, which matched the network addresses used, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
May had previously hired Columbia defense attorney Dayne Phillips to represent him after federal investigators seized electronics from his home last August. Because of that, Phillips represented May during his first appearance in court June 12, during which he argued someone may have taken control of May’s phone or home internet. Prosecutors noted that access to May’s home WiFi and phone both required passwords.
May declined to hire Phillips as his attorney moving forward, Phillips notified the court Friday.
The determination to assign a public defender is made based on a number of factors, including a person’s income, debt, monthly expenses, savings and assets. The form defendants fill out is not available to the public, so May’s exact financial status is unclear.
May, who first won office himself in 2020, owns Ivory Tusk Consulting and ran campaigns for GOP candidates who aligned with his hardline brand of conservatism.
The consulting business received payments from clients, including current representatives, as recently as February. In 2024, his consulting firm received $309,000 from South Carolina candidates who paid him for consulting services as well as for mailers, signs and door hangers, according to public campaign disclosures.
SC representative arrested, booked in Lexington County jail

For 2024, May also received $34,795 for his job as a legislator. That included his salary, a per diem that’s meant to cover food and lodging while legislators are in session, a $1,000-a-month stipend for “in-district” expenses, mileage reimbursements, and postage, according to his latest public economic statement.
For more than two years, he helped lead the faction of Republicans in the South Carolina House that’s been warring with the majority caucus in the supermajority GOP chamber.
While under federal investigation, May continued showing up to session every day this year, but he stayed quiet instead of participating in debates. He voted alongside the Freedom Caucus, though he hasn’t been a member since last August, when news broke that federal authorities seized his computers.
Following his arrest, May was suspended from the state House without pay pending the case’s outcome, the House Speaker’s Office said in a letter after the charges became public. State law requires suspension for officeholders indicted on felonies.
House Majority Leader Davey Hiott filed a complaint with the House Ethics Commission to investigate May, a first step toward expelling him from the House.
“The conduct these charges allege are reprehensible, vile, and have no place in our society, let alone in the House of Representatives,” the Pickens Republican said in a statement earlier this month.
Other representatives, including the Freedom Caucus that May helped start, have called for May to resign his seat.
May is being held in the Edgefield County Detention Center while awaiting trial. He appeared in court Tuesday wearing a striped orange and white jumpsuit, with “ECDC” printed across the back.
If convicted, May faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte will request a special session of the Legislature this week to prepare for the possibility that the House and Senate fail to pass a budget Thursday and allow for a continuing resolution, her office said Tuesday. 
In an announcement Tuesday morning, the governor’s office said Ayotte will present the proposal to the Executive Council Wednesday requesting the session for Friday, June 27.
The proposal will request that lawmakers pass a continuing resolution that would last 90 days, requiring the Legislature and the governor to work to craft and pass a compromise budget by Sept. 25. 
The move comes as Republican lawmakers and the governor are at odds over the state’s two-year budget, and as Ayotte has vowed to veto the final package if it is not changed. 
The full House and Senate are slated to meet Thursday to take up a vote on the two budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2. Last week, a panel of House and Senate leaders negotiated and agreed to final versions of those bills, which now need the approval of the full Legislature.
But Ayotte has raised concerns with the final compromise budget. On June 19, she criticized it for including a less-than-generous funding fix for a specific set of Group II retirees, who include police officers, firefighters, and corrections officers. She also spoke against a sweeping $51 million cut to the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as a change in the school funding formula that would see Manchester schools receive $10 million less than expected.
Ayotte said she would veto the budget if it weren’t changed. But the budget bills cannot be changed on Thursday; lawmakers may only vote to approve or kill them. 
Under Part 1, Article 50 of the New Hampshire Constitution, a governor can call the Legislature back into session, but the proposal must be approved by the Executive Council and the session must be limited to the governor’s stated purpose. 
The council meets Wednesday at 10 a.m. for its regularly scheduled meeting. In her official request, which she will present at the meeting, Ayotte mentioned her three budget priorities as the reason for a continuing resolution. The request does not mention Ayotte’s pledged veto. 
“We must continue to do the people’s work and deliver on our promises to all of New Hampshire,” Ayotte wrote. “That means keeping the state open, especially during our summer months, to serve the people of our great state. Doing the people’s work means putting together a responsible, balanced budget that keeps our promises to protect services for our most vulnerable citizens, ensure our children receive a best-in-class education, and take care of the men and women who have made our state the safest in the nation.”
Special sessions are relatively rare. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu called one in summer 2018 in an unsuccessful attempt to pass a bill protecting New Hampshire from out-of-state sales taxes in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair. A special session was also called in 2019 to allow the Legislature to pass a compromise budget after Sununu vetoed the Democratic-passed budget over a desire for continued tax reductions.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaid2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday afternoon that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
US Interior Secretary Burgum hypes innovation at WGA, steers clear of public lands controversy

The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.
“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
The “Roadless Rule” repeal would mean more than 58 million acres of land in 38 states would lose their protections. In New Mexico, according to Forest Service data, about 1.6 million acres, or roughly 2,500 square miles, of land in all the state’s national forests have some level of protections. A 2003 Forest Service map suggests most of the areas losing protections are in the Santa Fe and Gila national forests.
Public lands protesters picket Western governors’ conference

The announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
Governors’ report outlines how western states, territories could build more affordable housing

Rollins made the announcement during one of several keynote addresses by President Donald Trump’s cabinet members during the WGA conference. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke earlier Monday, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke afterward.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Fifteen thousand nurses at 13 hospitals in the Twin Cities and Duluth could strike if they can’t reach a deal with their employers.
Nurses unionized with the Minnesota Nurses Association voted Monday to authorize a strike, though the union’s negotiations teams will determine if and when to call the strike.
Nurses authorized a strike at hospitals operated by Allina Health, Aspirus St. Luke’s, Children’s Minnesota, Essentia Health, M Health Fairview and North Memorial Health. The strikes, if called, could also impact dozens of Essentia Health clinics in northern Minnesota and some Allina Health infusion centers in the Twin Cities.
The nurses say their employers are violating the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to negotiate in good faith. Because the authorized strike is an “unfair labor practices strike” — based on allegations that employers are breaking the law — the nurses would have greater protections than they would if the strike was for better wages or hours.
A top priority for nurses is more staffing. Health care workers are five times more likely to be seriously injured from an assault at work than the U.S. workforce as a whole, and nurses say increased staffing can reduce the risk of violence while improving patient care.
But the union’s safe staffing proposals are a nonstarter for hospital management. 
“Nurses have brought forward serious proposals about affordable, accessible health care plans, safe staffing and protections against unsafe scheduling, the rising violence we face at work, and respect for professional sacrifices we make every day. Leadership has refused to meaningfully engage in these issues,” said Sydney Pederson, a nurse at M Health Fairview – Riverside.
Nurses said at a press conference Tuesday that hospitals have reneged on staffing agreements made in the last round of contract negotiations, in 2022, forcing nurses into a protracted grievance process that has yet to be resolved. 
A spokesperson for Allina Health said in a statement, “We are disappointed the union is once again choosing to focus its efforts on organizing its members to walk away from their jobs.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_7005-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

“Following the President’s decision to strike Iran, we immediately convened our team here in Pennsylvania: State Police, National Guard, Homeland Security, all of the folks that assess risk, PEMA, here in this commonwealth, to make sure that if there were any threats to our homeland of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we could prepare our citizens,” Gov.

While the state isn’t facing any specific threat, the governor said his administration will continue work with federal agencies in monitoring the situation.
“My primary focus is on the safety and well-being of the people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — A candidate for governor of South Dakota endured two hours of questioning on a witness stand Monday about his efforts to restrict citizen-initiated ballot measures.
The candidate is Jon Hansen, who serves as speaker of the state House of Representatives and is running for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in next June’s primary election. He convinced his fellow legislators to pass a bill during the winter that makes the window for gathering ballot-question petition signatures three months shorter, by moving the election-year deadline for submitting signed petitions from May to February. 
Petitioners need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to place a proposed law on the ballot, or to refer a bill passed by legislators to the ballot as a question. The number of signatures required to petition a state constitutional amendment onto the ballot is 35,017.
Ballot group sues state over shorter petition circulation window

Dakotans for Health is a ballot question committee that has sponsored multiple petition drives. It’s suing South Dakota’s top elections official — the secretary of state — and asking a judge to stop enforcement of the new law. Monday’s proceeding at the federal courthouse in Rapid City was the first part of a hearing that will continue in early August. Meanwhile, the law is scheduled to take effect next Tuesday.
The lawsuit is the latest development in a longstanding struggle between ballot petitioners and Republican legislators over citizen lawmaking. Jim Leach, the lawyer representing Dakotans for Health, said in his opening statement that the earlier petition deadline is an unlawful attack on a form of free speech.
“Three months of core political speech are eliminated, out the window, cannot happen,” Leach said.
The secretary of state’s lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Grant Flynn, said in his opening statement that Hansen proposed the new law to allow adequate time for resolving disputes about the validity of petition signatures.
“What he has attempted to do is place proper guardrails so this process can be used effectively,” Flynn said.
Several times during witness testimony, Leach pointed to bills Hansen has sponsored during his legislative career to restrict citizen lawmaking. 
During this year’s legislative session, for example, Hansen prime-sponsored the bill to shorten the signature-gathering period and also prime-sponsored a bill adding justifications for the secretary of state to reject petition signatures, both of which passed. He co-sponsored a bill vetoed by the governor that would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in each of the 35 state Senate districts. Existing law allows signatures to come from registered voters anywhere in the state.
The state’s lawyer, in response, asked Hansen if he’s opposed to the initiative process or wants to repeal it. Hansen answered no to both questions.
Monday wasn’t the first time that Hansen — who has his own private law practice — has tussled with Leach and Dakotans for Health in court. Last year, Hansen helped lead a lawsuit attempting to disqualify Dakotans for Health’s abortion-rights ballot question. The lawsuit claimed numerous petition signatures should have been invalidated because of alleged legal infractions by petition circulators, including failing to show signers the attorney general’s explanation of the measure and leaving petitions unattended, among other accusations.

Hansen alleged Monday on the stand, under questioning from the state’s lawyer, that one of the reasons the earlier lawsuit didn’t make it to trial before last fall’s election was because Leach deliberately stalled the proceedings. That was among the reasons Hansen wanted to shorten the window for signature collecting, he said — to allow more time for litigation to play out and avoid the possibility of a “completely unlawful” measure being placed on the ballot.
Hansen’s group, the Life Defense Fund, ultimately dropped the earlier lawsuit after voters rejected the abortion-rights ballot measure in November.
Leach, during his questioning of Hansen, methodically attacked the stalling allegation. Relying on records from the earlier lawsuit, Leach showed, for example, that he sometimes took less time to file his motions and responses than Hansen’s side did — forcing Hansen to admit that those examples reflected Leach’s promptness. Leach also showed that Hansen’s lead co-counsel in the earlier case, Sara Frankenstein, told the judge at one point that she had no availability during a three-week period, forcing Hansen to answer “yes” when Leach asked if that slowed down the case.
Frankenstein was unavailable to participate in Monday’s hearing. The judge granted the state’s request to continue the hearing and set a date of Aug. 8 so Frankenstein can testify.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/591A0101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

Ron DeSantis signed a bill Tuesday that repeals a 2018 law that opponents argued limited public beach access in Walton County in northwest Florida.
Appearing in Santa Rosa Beach with emerald gulf waters behind him, the governor said SB 1622 returns to local governments decision-making about recreational access to the dry sand areas of Florida beaches.
“This bill is about restoring local control, cutting legal red tape, and putting our residents first,” DeSantis said.
Filed by Panama City Republican state Sen. Jay Trumbull, SB 1622 repeals the earlier law that established a judicial review process that governmental entities had to go through before passing any regulations regarding the customary use of any private beach property.

Sponsored by Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, the 2018 law was lauded at the time by beachfront property owners, including U.S. Ambassador to Israel and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.
Signed into law by former Gov. Rick Scot,t the law applied retroactively and blunted a 2016 Walton County ordinance that allowed for customary use of the beaches.
Counties throughout the state have long abided by the concept of “customary use” of beachfront, meaning people have been using the beaches for decades and should continue that public use, also meaning private property owner can’t restrict the public from enjoying those spaces.
“This bill is much more than policy. It’s about families, it’s about tradition, and it’s about restoring something that never should have been taken away in the first place,” said Trumbull, who joined DeSantis at the press conference.
The bill passed the House 108-8 and the Senate 35-2  with the two dissenting votes cast by Passidomo and Sen. Don Gaetz, who owns a home in Seaside, a master planned community in Walton County across the street from the beach.
Gaetz predicted the bill won’t solve disputes in Walton County and, during debate on the bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee, predicted just the opposite and warned it would result in litigation.
“My fear is, in fact, my hard prediction is, that whatever you do with this bill is not going to solve the problems in Walton County of people who think they own property near the beach or on the beach because they bought it from being very upset when somebody else tries to use that property,” Gaetz said. “The issues won’t go away.”
SB 1622 also makes it easier to restore eroded beaches in certain Gulf Coast counties with smaller populations. To promote that provision of the law, DeSantis was joined by Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Alexis Lambert, who noted, “Of Walton County’s 26 miles of beach, nearly 19 miles are now considered critically eroded and in need of nourishment.” 
“The bill clarifies how local governments can set beach use rules without unnecessary red tape. It also simplifies how we can set erosion control lines, allowing vital beach nourishment projects to move forward more efficiently. This means stronger, healthier beaches, clearer access, and a balance between public enjoyment and private property rights,” Lambert said.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Speaking at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in Santa Fe on Monday, United States Education Secretary Linda McMahon defended her agency’s return to collecting student loan payments from millions of borrowers, calling the pandemic-era pause “confusing” for students and their parents.
On May 5, the Education Department announced it would resume federal student loan collections after President Joe Biden’s administration paused them in March 2020. In a news release, McMahon said the resumption of collections meant that, “American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies.”
As feds resume student loan collections, states try to catch borrowers before they sink

During her keynote address, McMahon said the Education Department had already received about $200 million in payments. The payments represent the first collection in more than five years and come after the Supreme Court stymied Biden’s efforts to forgive billions in student loan debt during his presidency.
McMahon said times have changed since March 2020, and resumption of collections, among other benefits, eliminates confusion borrowers face about whether and when to repay their loans with potential loan forgiveness hanging over their heads. 
“One father told me: He said, ‘You know, my kids were covered under an educational trust fund that I set up for them, but I wasn’t sure that I wanted to pay out that money, because if it was going to be forgiven, was that short changing them in the long run?’” she said. 
More than 10% of New Mexicans have student loan debt, according to EducationData.org, which says that 226,000 New Mexicans in 2024 had an average debt of $34,071. 
A spokesperson for the New Mexico Higher Education Department did not respond to a request for comment from Source New Mexico about McMahon’s comments. 
In addition to her comments on student loans, McMahon defended President Donald Trump’s efforts to pare back the Education Department, saying she does not see what he’s doing as a “cut to education” but, rather, a means of reducing bureaucracy and empowering states to take the lead in their students’ education. 
During her speech, protesters outside the Eldorado Hotel could be heard shouting “Not for sale! Not for sale!” More than 1,000 people protested the budget reconciliation bill making its way through the United States Senate that would mandate the sale of up to 3 million acres of federal public lands. 
The chants echoing through the meeting hall prompted New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to explain the reasoning behind the protests and offer an apology “for the noise, [but] don’t apologize for community engagement.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9945-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112
,DC,2025-06-24 18:01:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/utahs-mike-lee-make-new-attempt-sell-public-lands-us-senate-mega-bill,,"U.S. Sen. Mike Lee says he will revamp his controversial proposal to require the sales of vast acres of federal lands in the West so it can be included in Senate Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cut package.Lee will be seeking approval for his revised plan from the Senate parliamentarian, who will decide if the provision complies with the chamber’s strict rules for the fast-track procedure Republicans are using to pass their bill. An earlier version of Lee’s plan was dropped from the measure.Lee, a Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, wrote on X on Monday night that he would alter the proposal to include only Bureau of Land Management land within 5 miles of a population center and exempt U.S. Forest Service lands altogether.The amended version would also create “freedom zones” and protect “our farmers, ranchers, and recreational users,” Lee said.It was not immediately clear what either point would mean and legislative text of the proposal was not publicly available Tuesday. A spokesperson for the committee Lee leads did not return a message seeking comment Tuesday morning.The original version of the proposal would have mandated the sale of at least 2 million acres of BLM and Forest Service land in 11 Western states. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that language did not comply with the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, according to Senate Budget Committee ranking Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon.Budget reconciliation is the procedure Republicans are using to pass the package that contains most of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities, including extension of the 2017 tax cuts.The process allows passage with only a simple majority in the Senate instead of the usual 60 votes but comes with strict rules that every provision has a substantial impact on the federal deficit and relates to spending and taxes.Polarizing provisionLee’s social media post emphasized his goal was to expand housing supply by making public lands available for new construction.“Housing prices are crushing families and keeping young Americans from living where they grew up,” Lee wrote. “We need to change that.”Democrats and some Republicans from the affected states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — strongly opposed the measure, seeing it as a one-time sell-off of public lands used by hunters, hikers, ranchers and other users of public lands.The provision “would have gutted America’s public lands and auctioned them off to the highest bidder, in yet another bid to benefit the wealthy,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday.“Republicans tried to rip away hundreds of millions of acres of public land—not to help families, not to solve real problems—but to hand yet another gift to the wealthy and well-connected,” he added. “It was outrageous, it was shameless, and it would have forever changed the character of the country. Senate Democrats fought tooth and nail to keep public lands in public hands because these lands belong to everyone—not just the privileged few.”A similar provision was removed from the House’s version of the reconciliation bill in the face of heated opposition from Western Republicans led by Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke.The former Interior secretary said last week he remained firmly opposed to the Senate version of the bill that included Lee’s proposal.“I have said from day one I would not support a bill that sells public lands,” he wrote on X. “I am still a no on the senate reconciliation bill that sells public lands. We did our job in the House. Let’s get it finished.”Other energy provisions strippedMerkley reported the Senate parliamentarian also ruled several other provisions of the Energy Committee’s section of the package to be out of compliance with the “Byrd Rule,” which governs what can be included in a reconciliation bill.Among the provisions the parliamentarian removed were items that would have waived environmental review requirements for offshore oil and gas development, mandated approval of a controversial mining road in Alaska, required annual lease sales for geothermal energy lease sales while changing how geothermal royalties are calculated and allowed natural gas exporters to pay a fee to have projects exempted from environmental requirements.Other provisions in the committee’s reconciliation instructions were still under review Tuesday, Merkley said.In a statement, Merkley said he would continue to lead Democrats’ campaign to strip provisions from the GOP bill.“Democrats will not stand idly by while Republicans attempt to circumvent the rules of reconciliation in order to sell off public lands to fund tax breaks for billionaires,” he said. “We will make sure the Byrd Rule is followed and review any changes Republicans attempt to make to the bill.”",,,,2025-06-24 15:14:15.581112

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality is now accepting applications for its Waste Tire Pilot Program. It offers up to $20,000 per recipient in funding for tire-related cleanup, enforcement and prevention initiatives to address what LDEQ says is a widespread problem across the state. 
Examples include:

Equipment purchases to support cleanup or prevention of illegal dumping;
Overtime or labor costs for parish or municipal staff handling collection or enforcement;
Site-specific cleanup of newly discovered illegal tire dump locations; and
Installation of barriers, signage or fencing to prevent future dumping.

LDEQ developed the program following a series of regional town halls the agency hosted last year to gain insights from local officials and residents across the state on how to address illegal tire dumping.
“This program reflects our commitment to practical, collaborative solutions for Louisiana’s environmental challenges,” LDEQ Secretary Courtney Burdette said in a news release. “We are proud to provide our local partners with tools that will help clean up communities, protect our environment and enhance public health in a meaningful way.”
Funding for the initiative comes from fees the state collects from companies that dispose and recycle waste tires.
To be considered for the Waste Tire Pilot Program, municipalities and parishes must submit a proposal by July 18 outlining how the funds would be used to address unauthorized waste tire disposal in their jurisdiction. Proposals can be emailed to Lewis.Donlon@la.gov or mailed to:
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Environmental Services, P.O. Box 4313, Baton Rouge, LA 70821-4313. Attn: Dutch Donlon

(Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
South Dakota Legislature removes lawmaker addresses from website after Minnesota shootings 

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.










People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated. It's an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.


– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.

“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline) North Carolina fishermen abandoned their boats on Tuesday to walk the halls of the General Assembly and voice strong opposition to legislation that would ban inland shrimp trawling. House Bill 442, passed by the Senate last week, would prohibit trawlers from using their nets for shrimping in all inshore waters and within a half mile of the coast.
The original bill passed by the House in May dealt with strengthening the state’s flounder and red snapper stocks by regulating the harvest season and the number of fish that could be taken. The measure, however, was rewritten to address the shrimp trawling issue and quickly approved by the Senate last week.
Proponents of the revised bill, including the North Carolina Wildlife Federation, argue that large-scale shrimping nets kill hundreds of millions of juvenile fish and destroy vital seafloor habitats.
The Wildlife Federation has sent an email to over 1.5 million North Carolina license holders urging anglers to support the legislation.
Capt. John Mallette, co-owner of Southern Breeze Seafood Co. in Jacksonville, said those pushing the bill have offered no context or explained how it will damage the industry.

“The amendment for the shrimp trawl ban is baseless and full of lies,” Mallette told reporters at a Tuesday press conference.
Mallette said trawling has been going on for more than a century and fishing in the region remains sustainable.
“There’s still plenty of fish around. The shrimping is getting even better, even though the amount of shrimp has gone down.”
The Pamlico Sound accounts for 75% of the state’s shrimp landings. Closing that area to trawling would cripple the entire industry, according to Mallette.
The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission notes that North Carolina is the only state on the Atlantic or Gulf coast that continues to allow widescale trawling in inshore waters.
“There is no magic bullet that will restore depleted fisheries overnight, but reducing the impacts shrimp trawling has on the habitats that juvenile fish depend upon and limiting by-catch of those fish will make a difference,” explained the federation in an online message to its members.
Rep. Phil Shepard (R-Onslow) said the legislation was not just bad for commercial fishermen, but consumers who prize fresh seafood.
“I was born Down East, and I know the difference in a local shrimp and one that comes from Thailand or China.”
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) — one of the legislature’s leading voices for environmental protection — also joined the chorus of voices opposing the trawling ban.
Senator Bobby Hanig, who represents ten coastal counties, has been fighting the ban in the upper chamber. Hanig called the Senate maneuver to pass the revised version of HB 442 “sleazy politics at its worst.”
  Rep. Keith Kidwell (Photo: NCGA)
Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Craven) said the bill would “flip the switch” on the economy in eastern North Carolina, harming not just the commercial fishermen, but all the supporting businesses.
“Are we going to shut down the people who live every day making an honest living because some branch of the government finally decides some slimy backroom deals that they don’t want to do this anymore?”
Kidwell said the bill would not advance in the state House on his watch.
“We’re going to spike this bill. And we’re going to drive a stake through its heart so it’s dead — because as you’ve noticed many times in this building, bills are like Freddy Krueger. Once you think they’re dead, they come back to life. This one’s going to die. It will be a swift, painful death.”
Kidwell also predicted House Bill 441 that would offer temporary “transition payments” to commercial fishermen impacted by the proposed trawling ban, would also fail as primary sponsors of the original bill have asked that their names be removed from the legislation.
“I’m going to beg everybody in this General Assembly. All my friends in the House and my enemies — Don’t sponsor a bill that’s going to kill an industry that supports the east coast of North Carolina. I’m not going to let it happen.”
The debate has grown increasingly bitter in recent days with authorities arresting a Brunswick County man for threatening to kill state lawmakers who would support the trawling ban.
The commercial shrimping industry in North Carolina is valued at more than $14 million per year.

But Democrats and some Republicans from the affected states strongly opposed it.Lee said on social media Monday evening that he was working to rewrite the proposal to comply with reconciliation rules. A spokesperson for his office did not return a message seeking comment Tuesday morning.SNAP cost-sharing with states back in billIn another turn of events, Senate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., announced the panel successfully reworked a provision that would transfer some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to state governments. The parliamentarian ruled over the weekend an earlier proposal wasn’t compliant with the rules.“Our commonsense approach encourages states to adopt better practices, reduce error rates, be better stewards of taxpayer dollars, and prioritize the resources for those who truly need it,” Boozman wrote in a statement.The new language will give states the option of selecting fiscal year 2025 or 2026 as the year that the federal government uses to determine its payment error rate for SNAP, which will then impact how much of the cost the state has to cover starting in fiscal year 2028. Afterward, a state's payment error rate will be calculated using the last three fiscal years.Any state with an error rate higher than 6% will have to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the nutrition program for lower income households. Rushing toward deadlineThe internal debates among lawmakers about how to rewrite major pieces of the tax and spending cuts package have led to a rushed feeling among Republican leaders, who have repeatedly promised to approve the final bill before the Fourth of July — an exceedingly tight timeline.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a press conference shortly after a closed-door House GOP conference meeting Tuesday that he’s hopeful the final bill that comes out of the Senate won’t make too many changes to what the House approved earlier this year.“I remain very optimistic that there's not going to be a wide chasm between the two products — what the Senate produces and what we produce,” Johnson said. “We all know what the touchpoints are and the areas of greatest concern.”

Republicans, he said, know they need to focus on preserving a fragile compromise on the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, that helps offset the cost of living in some higher-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York.A deal Johnson brokered with GOP lawmakers in the SALT Caucus has been significantly rewritten in the Senate, but is expected to move back toward the House version, though not entirely.Johnson also mentioned GOP efforts to roll back certain clean-energy provisions that Democrats approved and President Joe Biden signed into law in their signature climate change, health care and tax package, called the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in 2022.“We’ve got to get the SALT negotiation number right. We’ve got to make sure the IRA subsidies are handled in an appropriate manner,” Johnson said. “Look, you’ve got a number of provisions.”Johnson said he expects the Senate to vote on its final bill by Friday or Saturday and that he’s told House lawmakers to “keep your schedules flexible” on being in Washington, D.C., for a final House vote. Trump goads RepublicansPresident Donald Trump sought to spur quick approval of a final bill, posting on social media that GOP lawmakers should get the package to him as soon as possible.“To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don’t go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK. Work with the House so they can pick it up, and pass it, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Tuesday. “NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT’S DONE. Everyone, most importantly the American People, will be much better off thanks to our work together. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said there are concerns among his fellow Republicans about all of the provisions that must be removed or significantly reworked to meet the complex rules for moving a reconciliation bill through that chamber. For example, while it is being redone in hopes of adding it back in, language was removed that would have transferred some of the cost of running the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to state governments, potentially leaving states on the hook for billions in added spending on the food aid program for lower-income people.

“Every time something comes out that we're using as a pay for, it takes the deficit reduction down. And they've taken out nearly $300 billion so far. We've got to make that up,” Mullin said after leaving the closed-door House GOP meeting. “The Senate can't come in below the House version as far as deficit reduction. So that makes it difficult.”Mullin, who has been acting as his chamber's top negotiator with SALT Republicans in the House, told reporters he expects the deduction for state and local taxes to remain at the $40,000 level negotiated in the House. But said the Senate will likely rewrite the $500,000 income ceiling to qualify for the tax deduction.“I think 40 is a number we're going to land on,” Mullin said. “It's the income threshold that's in negotiations.”The ‘red line’ in the HouseNew York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler told reporters following the closed-door meeting that Senate leaders shouldn’t assume whatever they pass will be accepted by the House.“I've been very clear about where my red line is. So, you know, we'll let this process play out,” Lawler said. “I think the Senate should recognize the only number that matters is 218, and 50 plus 1. That's it. And how do you get there?”Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, so leadership cannot lose more than four votes and still approve the package, given that Democrats are universally opposed.

In the House, GOP leaders have 220 seats and need nearly every one of their members to support whatever the Senate sends back across the Capitol for it to make it to the president’s desk before their self-imposed deadline.In addition to the SALT tax compromise, Lawler said he has concerns about how the Senate has changed other provisions, including those addressing Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people.“Yeah, there are a number of concerns about decisions that they're making,” Lawler said. “And obviously, the bill on their side is not final, so we’ll see where it goes.”Missouri Republican Rep.

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capitol Dispatch)Several dozen people gathered last Saturday in Monticello for a citizen workshop the Grassroots Iowa Network organized to get more everyday Iowans engaged in the political process.
They spent the day listening to speakers* and exchanging ideas and observations, without fear or reprisal. They lunched and learned.
Former officeholders and current office-seekers were there, too. So were people who have spent countless hours working on issues or on behalf of candidates.
Although there were no knee britches or tri-corner hats in sight, our nation’s Founders were there in spirit. The Founders would take comfort knowing those Iowans were exercising liberties so important that they stitched them into our Constitution in the First Amendment — the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the right to assemble peaceably, and the right to petition our government for a redress of grievances.
Throughout our nation’s history, people have exercised those rights with passion and vigor. We saw that a week ago when hundreds of people gathered on the grounds of the Iowa Capitol. We saw that in recent weeks when people gathered outside courthouses, federal buildings and in other public spaces from Alaska to Florida and from Maine to Hawaii.
Their cause is unimportant to the broader point, because increasingly when people exercise their First Amendment freedoms, others quickly label them in negative ways because they disagree with the viewpoints being expressed.
Even so, those neighbors who march peaceably do not hate the United States. They are not leftist Commies or right-wing nut jobs. They are not hell-bent on destroying our nation.
Just like the colonialists of 250 years ago, the people marching through the streets of America these days do so to express their dissatisfaction with the course the nation is taking. These people are willing to express their disappointment when government ignores, harasses or arrests people for what they think, how they look or what they say.
For me, it is a time we again should celebrate those who march in America, or meet in Monticello, as the patriots they are. They deserve our respect, just as we revere the women and men in our military who defend our nation, all it stands for, and its core ideals that they fight to protect, including the right to think and speak in support of a cause, or the right to voice their dissent.
History supports this.
For most of our nation’s life, being a patriot did not mean you came only from one side. There were Revolutionaries, Continentals, Populists, Whigs, Agrarians and even contrarians, and each group walked the patriot walk and talked the patriot talk in their own way.
So, let’s encourage more citizen roundtables and community marches, because they provide one measure of hope that our nation still stands solid and that better days will come.
Let’s hope Iowans who are Republicans, Democrats, independents, political agnostics, and maybe even a Whig or two, can gather and talk about facts and ideas, policies and problems, solutions and challenges — all without resorting to the name-calling that spews from some politicians.
Let’s make it so words like morons, lunatics, scum, losers, traitors, crooks get left on the elementary school playground. Our country does not benefit from such name-calling.
But Iowa can benefit from a renewed energy of engagement. We need people’s ideas. We need people who will step out of their comfort zone and respectfully disagree with the direction of our state and our nation. We need people who will stand up and demand answers from political candidates and especially from those already in office.
It does not matter who started this war of words. We must return to the civility that used to be a hallmark of our political discourse, when political leaders traded ideas, not insults. Nowadays, politicians scramble like Caitlin Clark with the basketball, except these leaders fall all over themselves to avoid answering questions.
Bipartisan carpool
A shining example illustrating the change in civility and our political dialogue occurred 53 years ago in a car traveling from Washington, D.C., to Iowa.
  Neal Smith and John Kyl, two Iowa Nice rivals. (Official U.S. House portraits)
It was in the summer of 1972. Congressional redistricting after the census had thrown two incumbent members of the U.S. House into the same newly drawn congressional district. One was Democrat Neal Smith of Altoona, and the other was Republican John Kyl of Bloomfield.
These two Washington veterans were campaigning against each other. One would win, and the other would be out of a job. That summer, their wives wanted to escape the summer heat in Washington and get home to Iowa.
The way they did that is memorable — and a lesson for all of us. Their example of civility gets at the heart of Iowa values and respect for those with whom we may disagree on politics, but with whom we probably agree on many other matters.
Think about this: Bea Smith and Arlene Kyl traversed half a continent by carpooling with each other.
I am not suggesting we must suppress our differences of opinions. Far from that. But it costs us nothing to treat those with whom we disagree as decent human beings, as neighbors and as potential friends.
We all need to do our part to restore civility to our political discourse. That applies to us as voters. It most assuredly applies to those we elect to lead us.
And, most of all, we need it to remain patriots ourselves.

(Photo by Oregon Department of Agriculture)Farmworkers in Maine may have gained the right to state minimum wage this legislative session, but they still won’t be protected from retaliation for talking about work conditions.
Late last week, Gov. Janet Mills vetoed LD 588, which would have offered agricultural workers in the state that right. In her veto letter, Mills noted that the bill is similar to a measure she rejected last year and her thinking has not changed on the issue. 
“Because the bill is unchanged, so too is my veto letter,” she said. 
Her letter goes on to say that the legislation would create a complicated legal framework that would add to the burden farmers are already facing with increased severe weather, toxic chemical contamination on their lands, price pressures and more. 
The Maine Legislature will have the opportunity to overturn Mills’ veto; however, it will require support from at least two-thirds of lawmakers. The House of Representatives initially rejected the bill, but narrowly decided to change course and join the upper chamber in passing the measure.
Given those existing challenges, Mills said she could not “subject our farmers to a complicated new set of labor laws that will require a lawyer just to understand.” She also added that Maine’s agricultural sector is largely made up of small farms that treat workers well in order to retain them.
Proponents of the bill, including the left-leaning Maine Center for Economic Policy, saw LD 588 as a chance to right a historic wrong. Though most other workers are protected from retaliation when speaking about working conditions, farmworkers have long been excluded because those roles were historically filled by Black workers, wrote Arthur Phillips, an economic policy analyst, in a blog post after the veto.
“While we celebrate the farmworker minimum wage and lament the governor’s veto of the concerted activity bill, we also recognize these are pieces of a long, ongoing fight for economic and racial justice in Maine,” Phillips added.

The appellate judges said Monday a jury ought to determine whether excessive force was applied in the death of Cedric Lofton, 17, in 2021. (Greenleaf123/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A panel of U.S. Court of Appeals judges agreed with a lower court that Sedgwick County juvenile detention personnel couldn’t sidestep an excessive-force lawsuit filed against them after a teenager in mental distress was held in a face-down restraint until he suffered cardiac arrest and later died.
In September 2021, Cedric Lofton, 17, became unresponsive while restrained by five officers at the Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center. He had been placed in a prone position, which means face down, on a holding cell floor for nearly 40 minutes with officers’ weight applied to his back. Lofton was resuscitated after an officer noticed he wasn’t breathing. He never regained consciousness and died two days later at a hospital, the court record says.
Court of Appeals Judges Richard Federico, Carolyn McHugh and Allison Eid of the 10th Circuit affirmed the district court ruling declaring the corrections officers weren’t entitled to qualified immunity or summary judgment in the suit filed by Lofton’s estate.
“A reasonable officer would have been on notice that continued application of pressure after Mr. Lofton was subdued created a serious risk of asphyxiation and death, even if he was still verbalizing threats,” the three-judge panel said in a decision released Monday. “Under those circumstances, it is clearly established that a continued prone restraint is unconstitutional.”
Before the involvement of Wichita law enforcement officers, the court record says, Lofton was taken by a foster parent to a clinic for a mental health evaluation. Lofton ran away from the facility but later returned home. On advice of the Kansas Department for Children and Families, the court record says, foster parent Tanea Randolph called Wichita police.
Wichita police officers said Lofton was hallucinating, and the decision was made to transport him to St. Joseph’s Hospital for involuntary hospitalization. A struggle ensued outside the foster home, and Lofton was arrested for battery of an officer.
Lofton was taken to the Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center, where he engaged in physical altercations with corrections officers. In view of surveillance cameras, five Sedgwick County juvenile officers held the 135-pound Lofton in a prone position for nearly 40 minutes until he suffered a heart attack. He was revived by officers before being transported to Wesley Medical Center, where he subsequently died.
An autopsy indicated the death — ruled a homicide — was associated with complications of cardiopulmonary arrest amid a physical struggle and while held in a prone position, court documents said.
Lofton’s brother, Marquan Teetz, filed a federal lawsuit in 2022 alleging personnel at the juvenile facility engaged in excessive force. Attorneys for the officers sought dismissal of their clients from the case based on the premise the officers were shielded from liability for constitutional acts.
Eric Melgren, chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Kansas and an appointee of President George W. Bush, denied the motion and concluded surveillance footage could support Teetz’ claim that excessive force was sustained after Lofton stopped resisting. The judge said a jury ought to decide whether officers conducted themselves within constitutional boundaries or relied on unconstitutional force.
On appeal, lawyers for the officers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals to reverse the district court judge. Defense counsel Jeffrey Kuhlman argued Lofton wouldn’t have died if he hadn’t resisted commands of officers in a manner that resulted in exposure to “an air deficit.”
Inside the juvenile facility, Lofton allegedly punched a corrections officer in the face and held another in a chokehold before being restrained by defendants Jason Stepien, Brenton Newby, Karen Conklin, William Buckner and Benito Mendoza. Conklin performed CPR on Lofton before his transfer to a hospital.
The three-judge panel said it was reasonable to conclude there were circumstances in which application of pressure to a subdued person’s back while in a prone position on a solid surface was excessive.
“This may include situations where the suspect continues to resist to some degree, physically or verbally, but no longer poses a risk of serious harm or injury due to the restraints,” the panel said.
McHugh, an appointee of President Barack Obama, wrote in the opinion that the district court calculated Lofton was not “meaningfully resisting” correction officers for at least 12 minutes while held in the prone restraint.
“Defendants had sufficient control over him,” she wrote. “At that point, a reasonable officer would have perceived the threat had passed and that the use of deadly force was no longer reasonable. Instead, five officers continued to subject Mr. Lofton to a prone restraint while his legs were restrained and he appeared not to move for prolonged periods.”
McHugh added: “We therefore conclude defendants violated Mr. Lofton’s Fourth Amendment rights not just by using excessive force, but by using deadly force well past the point a reasonable officer would have perceived any serious threat to his physical safety had passed.”
During the episode at the juvenile detention facility in Wichita, Lofton was in temporary custody of the facility. The Wichita Police Department retained legal custody of the teenager. Lofton apparently went into cardiac arrest while juvenile officers were attempting to contact Wichita police to request they retrieve him.
In addition to the five corrections officers, defendants in the lawsuit include the Sedgwick County Commission and the city of Wichita.
In 2022, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett declined to file criminal charges in the Lofton case. He said corrections officers acted in self defense and that “these folks are protected by Kansas law.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-24 13:25:32.597533

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Library records in New Hampshire are currently confidential under state law, but a bill being considered by the state Legislature could carve out an exception for parents.
House Bill 273, if passed, would mandate public libraries make kids’ borrowing histories available to their parents upon request. That bill, which went through the committee of conference process last week, is scheduled for a vote of the full House and Senate Thursday. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Mike Drago, a Raymond Republican. If both chambers approve it Thursday, the bill will head to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, where she will have the option to sign it into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature.
Drago, introducing the bill in April, said the “elephant in the room” is “the inappropriate material that makes its way into our libraries these days.”
“That debate isn’t going to be solved today or tomorrow on what’s appropriate for who,” he continued. “But I think it’s more important than ever to at least have parents have access to their child’s library records, so they can help decide what’s appropriate and what’s not.”
The bill has already been approved by both the House and Senate, though each chamber voted for a different effective date. Last week, negotiators in a committee of conference hashed out their differences and decided the bill would be effective Jan. 1. They’ll now take the newly amended bill to the full chamber.
The bill comes amid a number of so-called parental rights bills in the Legislature this year that seek to give parents even more access to information about their children. Earlier this month, Ayotte signed House Bill 10 into law. That bill guarantees New Hampshire parents the right to ask school personnel for any information about what their child is doing at school and get complete disclosure. This was criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates worried that it would force teachers to out young gay or trans kids. The bill also enshrines into state law parents’ right to opt their child out of sex ed, exempt their child from vaccine requirements with a doctor’s note or because of religious belief, and home school their child, among other things. Many of these actions were already allowed, but the new law reaffirms them. It also creates new requirements of school boards to create policies promoting parental involvement in a child’s education.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/libaryprivacy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-24 13:25:32.597533
